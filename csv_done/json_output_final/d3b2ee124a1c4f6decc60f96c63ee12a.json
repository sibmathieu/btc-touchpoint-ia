I was uh justturning 15 and I went and worked for myfather for four years in a CD DVD storemy family had a chain of record storescool uh I remember a custom oh it washeaps of fun I absolutely loved it andit wasn't really the type of Industrywhere you had rapport with customers itwas you know walk in I want a JohnnyCash album sell them Johnny Cash albumand they leave again and especially thedemographic that our store that I wasworking in was located there was a lotof pensionersum you know a lot of just older people ahigh level of I guess well welfarepeople with um disabilities all thesesorts of things that was just the suburbwe were in and I built up an amazingrapport with at an absolute slew ofcustomers to the point that I'd havesome customers come in and just go youknow what album am I am I getting thisweek and I said oh look I think you'dreally like this one 30 bucks 30 bucksfor a CD you know uh 16 17 years ago andthey just buy it and that wasn't reallynormal and I guess that's where my mypassion for sales and customer servicereally really started developing Iremember I had one a couple that used tocome in and they see my father they wereuhKatrina and Jacko were their namesand they wanted real obscure things andI think early on I mishandled atransaction and overcharged them orforgot to put something in the bag orwhatever it was and they they used tocome in and and just wait for Dad theydidn't want to be served by anyone elsethey just wait for my father and thenone day Dad couldn't find something hewas serving them and we're alwaysimporting obscure heavy metal things andEuropean films for them and while Dadwas searching for them you know I waslike teenager starting to get a bit morefamiliar on the internet than him and Iwas over on another website and he saidno I can't find it anyway and I said Ithink I've got it and I showed him thescream and we got it in for them andthen the next time they came in a fewdays later and this couple was spendingthree four hundred dollars a week withus so they were easily our biggestSpenders in a little record store thenext week they came in they stood thereand Dad saw them so he's come over toserve them and I'm standing on anothercomputer with another customer and theylooked at dad and I remember it sovividly dad goes radio you know how yougoing today how can help and they justshook their head and real curtly sort ofjab their finger over to me we want tosee him and I became their guy and wegot along so well and when we closed thestore because I remember LimeWire comingout and I downloaded a new ArcticMonkeys album in like 30 seconds flatand I'm saying that our business istoast there's no way the album wasn'teven released yet the album was set forrelease in three weeks or something youknow that was the writing on the walland we worked out our lease and closedthe store down and said bye to all ofour great customers but that was just inthe trenches Retail 101 seven days aweek we're doing 89 hours a week I didopens I did closes I did the banking andthis is all as a teenager so I had anabsolute blast there and then my parentsand Ipurchased a local bicycle store that wasfor sale because it wasn't doing verywelland we've had that store for over adecade now we ended up buying a block ofland and developing it putting a biggerbuilding on it so our bicycle storesabout 1200 meters uh Squarespace floorspace so I don't know how that umtranslates into feet but it's not asmall store we've got a cafe inside ofthe bike shop that runs seven days aweek and then a few years ago I took aninterest in farming so I've now starteduh direct to Market farming so we'reraising beef pork chicken lamb eggs gota few ancillary Enterprises like honeyand a fruit all sorts of strangedifferent things I had to buy my ownButchery because there was an instantbottleneck in production and no onelocally could sort of satisfy my needsall my wants in terms of how my animalswere being cut upso you know that's another whole beastand along the way I've done some strangethings I used to import guitars andflick them on eBay I used to buyhandmade tobacco pipes off uh producersall around the world and sell them on alittle website I had called pipes downunder these artists and I've got some onthe Shelf over here but you know some ofthese pipes holes selling were four orfive thousand dollars a piece beautifullittle one of a kind tobacco pipes likewhat like what your grandpa might havesmoked but uh reallyartistic and people would try to putcollection collections together fromcertain Styles certain periods certainproducers certain countries and I gotdeep in that world for a few years and Iended up getting out of that because Iwanted to focus on the bike shop for thefamilyyeah always got little side hustles Ibreed dogs as wellum holy man I like being busyit's funny you bring up the the pipething because my my price my most prizedpossession is basicallyum my grandfather smoked a pipe when hewas in the Navy and his pipe was like Idon't know if it was Navy issue but ithad Navy like uh symbols and stuff on itanyways when he died you know five tenyears ago and everyone was just kind offiguring out his estate and hisbelongings and stuff like that this cameup and they asked anyone if they wantedit and you know everyone said no becauseit's got a little chip on the mouthpieceand it's just kind of an old pipe but Itook it because you know one I I had atremendous relationship with him admirethe hell out of him for many differentreasons and there was so likeyou know a pipe is a very intimate thingright not not only because you know youhave it in your mouth all the time butyou're you know it's always in your handand you can see the the places on thepipe where the hand has kind of rubbedthe color away a little bit you can seethe bite marks in the thing and I justthought it was the coolest thing ever soI took it and you know again like I saidto this day uh it's one of my favoritethings that I had that I ownwell if he was the sort of gentlemanthat uh had it with him frequently itbecomes an extension of him yeah exactlyisn't it like it's so I remember sellingpeople pipes and and they're trying tobuy them online right and that somethingthat would come up was does it suit mebecause Aesthetics has a lot to do withit people wanted a pipe that would sitin there and it'd suit them and it'ssort of like a pair of sunglasses or ahat like quite often they don't suit youthe first time you put it on but onceyou've lived in it for a couple weeks itbecomes part of you like go and buy themost outrageous pair of sunnies you canafter a while the sunnies are you eventhough they're you know you got astar-shaped red frame sunnies and theylook ridiculous but after a while youknow your Bootsy Collins they're yoursunnies yeah well you could eat likeit's almost like it conforms to you abit and you conform to it and you knowit becomes part of your identity or orbirths another aspect of your identitythat previously wasn't given expressionor given you know given air or somethinglike that I totally agreeum all right so you you go through thatEnterprise you go back to uh thebicyclesand there's like we're talking like roadbikes and mountain bikes and that kindof stuff like a boutique sort of bikeshopso we really tried to angle to Mara andParr uh you know in just like a lot ofbusinesses I guess the lower end of themarket the cheaper bicycles have abigger margin percentage and uh thestock doesn't age as well the skill setfor staff needed to to sell it to workon it easier and I just saw that my oneof my big things in business is the pathof least resistance and that doesn'tmean uh be a wimp that doesn't meansteel like it doesn't mean any of thosethings it just means you know where isyour time best served meeting the marketwhere are you going to get the bestreturn for your effort which by proxymeans you're giving the best service sowe really focused on that Mum and Dadmarket and mountain biking sort ofnaturally grew alongside that that'sjust what our region wanted in toothwe've purchased the store in 2011 and in2013 I hosted an electric bike Expo sopeople could come and test drivedemonstrated models of electric bicyclesand there was only three suppliers inAustralia at the time who had electricbikes two were real cheap uh you knowjust slapped together quite like veryheavy I think one still had lead acidbatteries at that stage and then thethird one was gazelle like a beautifulhandmade Dutch bicycle and the wholeindustry laughed at me because I don'thave a cycling background you've got toimagine everyone in the cycling worldwho works in short stores and ownsstores all the Reps all the owners ofthe Distributors they're allprofessional cyclists the whole industryis so entrenched like it's this it's afull cottage industry and I don't have acycling background we just entered asMerchants a family of merchants and thewhole industry laughed at me for havinge-bikes and I persevered and I like tothink I sort of put a bit of a notch onthe on the belt with that one becausenow uh end of last year end of 22 theindustry did some surveying and electricbicycles contributing on average 40Revenue per storewow so I you know I I it's really easyto sort of get stuck in your ownPrejudice like if you're if you're aprofessional triathlete who's purchaseda bike shop by proxy you're going to beselling triathlete bicycles Triathlongear when the Market's telling you itwants ebike but you think e-bikes suckor they're a hack or they're cheatingand you don't care you're not thinkingabout the fact that your customers lovethem and they want them so we we'veactually one of the rules of my familyhas always been to buy businesses thatwe're not interested in so interestinglymy dad hates music he'd rather silenceor AM radio TalkBack radio but he boughta record store for the same reason so ifyou're into heavy metal you fill theShelf up with heavy metal records eventhough your local demographic wantscountry now you can cut through thosethings on like if you've got a.com forinstance it might make a lot more senseto Niche uh but if you're opening bricksand mortar retail like what we've alwaysdone we've always just tried to peel theblinkers off and service the market butthat's a complete contradiction to mycurrent mission on the farm which I'mvery passionate about well tell me howyou got into that so how do you go fromfrom bikes selling bikes to selling meatand operating a regenerative Farmsure well I'm married by uh wife in 142014 and then we we moved we actually uhpurchased the house together and wemoved in together the day after we gotmarried so both come from Christianfamilies quite traditionalum conservative background so we dideverything the right way and we moved inthe day after and we you know it was alittle while and I started you know yougot to home all of a sudden before thenI've been living out of my van I youknow I got my license I didn't want tomove out of house because I didn't wantto spend the money on a on a rental so Ijust drift around hanging out withfriends sleeping in the back of my vanwherever I was and then we moved in wehad a garden to tend to so I thought I'dput some veggies in and I'm a rabbitholder you know you get into interestinterested in something and I buy thebooks I get on YouTube I listen to thepodcast I get quite obsessive my wife'salways laughing you know what's the nextObsession going to be and I got rightinto organic gardening looking upno-till gardening all these differentways of maximizing your yield in termsof you know gross quality and uhquantity out of your small Urbanbackyard and I was justgoing down the rabbit hole on YouTubeand I came across a video by this famousAmerican Farmer called Joel saliton andthe thumbnail was clickbait was on theside of the you know suggested videosand it said this farmer buys land at 15an acre and I knew it was click bait butI clicked on it anyway and the the theID there was with 15 per acre worth ofinfrastructure Joel Sullivan claims thathe doubles his productivity thereforeit's the same as buying more lead and Ijust thought that was really interestingbecause my dad had 100 acres out of townand 100 acres in our area is a hobbyFarm like it's a place to put a coupleponies out the back and run some housechickens and no one's taking youseriously as a farmer and I I I becamereallyum snatched up by the Romanticism andtheumthe earnest sort of nature of the wayJoel saliton described farming like itreally appealed to me and I was on ahealth Journey at the same time lots ofallergy issues skin issues nasal issuesI've sort of been I wouldn't say a frailchild but just like constantly burdenedby little things niggling away at me andI was on a bit of a health Journey atthe same time so I said to Dad can Ilease the farm off you when I want tostart moving cows around and I want toget some chickens and if I can getenough chickens maybe I'll get an egglicense and I'll wholesale the eggs backto our Cafe in townand that just became that became it nowso now I leased 300 acres and I'mcurrently discussing to at least another200 more I don't own any Farmland uh andlike I said we've got you know I'veprobably got 100 cattle at the momentabout 70 years sheep thousand egg-layingchickens we're doing a few hundred meatbirds every month uh pigs we've gotrolling batches of Pigs we're sendingoff about a dozen Peaks to slaughterevery Fortnight and I've got a I've gota Butchery with two full-time butchersand we're selling all that everything iscuts of meat to the end consumer and ourFarmsit's it's sort of nothing like what ourcurrent mindset might be of atraditional Farm but if we go back intime and think about what a traditionalFarm might have been 200 years ago it'sprobably a lot more similar to thathaving all these different animals onthe one property and then everything'salways rotating so we're always tryingto observe natural systems uh cattlebeing migratory flocks of birds chasingmigratory uh ruminant herds all thesesorts of things we're trying to wrap allthese uhthings that we learn off nature togetherand and execute them on our farm thebest we can to step away from constantuses of pharmaceutical input sincesynthetic fertilizers which we've usednothing of since I started in 2019 we'venever drenched an animal like we'venever wormed an animal we don't useantibiotics we don't we sort ofcircumnavigate all these inputsuh a budgets relying on goodold-fashioned management with technologythings like electric fence and runningwater are important to usman I got so many questions but off thetop so you're in Australia you'reallowed to do all that not do the theantibiotics and not you know like youcan just run a farm how you like andsell what youwhat you produceit really depends on the the shortanswers uh yes I think I'm involved inso many different things like keeping upto date on on uh the legalist agendaskind of a but for example raw milk'sillegal in Canada right can you sell itoh that's that's good that's completelyContraband here but the differencebetween that and the other example yougave me is uh raw milk is an output andthe use of antibiotics as an input soI'd imagine that if you had a if you hada feedlot or a factory farm it might notbe a legal requirement to useantibiotics but you would have a duty ofcare in terms of code of conduct andAnimal Welfare uh to sort of to sort ofmaintain Health to a standard and it'llbe impossible in those environments todo that without these uh pharmaceuticalinputs so I've you know on our farm wehave really good outcomes so there'sthere's no pressure to rely on theseinputs right so so you said you leasing300 acres is 100 still from your familyand then 200 Acresadjacent from someone else or are theyin different areas so they're all indifferent areas at least two properties100 acres each of my parents and they'reabout an hour apart so uh during covertmy family bought a sort of like aholiday house weekend or about an hourout of town and that had 100 acres on itso I farmed cattle and pigs on thatproperty and then I've picked up another100 acres five minutes around the cornerfor me from a from a bitcoiner that Imeant to bed at a farm tour which waspretty cool and I'm talking to anotherproperty owner about an hour north sothe the distance that we're spreadingthe business apart is a challenge and itmakes management uh difficult and youknow a lot of complexity to manage butthe reality is that we can't findadjacent properties you know they don'texist because most of our neighbors havehorses and plenty of money and wouldrather you're not on their property atall you know it it doesn't sort ofthere's no benefit to them in thatequation because in my area your annualcost of leasing is about one percent ofthe value of the farmso land here is selling for aboutanywhere from ten to thirteen thousanddollars an acre and your annual cost ofleasing is around 120 to 150 dollars soyou know like on one hand why would youbuy but on the other hand this there isactually a fair bit of demand for thatlease Market as well because the valueis so good so we are spreading out we wedo intend on buying our own lands uhbecause we we need to have some morefixed infrastructure things like our ownabattoir I think it's only a matter oftime till we get pushed out of the localprocessing uh market for for a multitudeof reasons and you know just their ownefficiency and you know being one ofthem they're just not going to want todeal with small producers like meanymore and you know my wife and I wouldlove to live on some land we're livingin Suburbia here farming 300 acres I'vegot a I drive 10 minutes out to the farmevery morning I've got I'm looking outthe window here I've got six neighborstouching my house I want to get out ofhere right yeah I can relate to that sowhat was it like at the beginningbecause I mean I I take the point thatas Farms go this is perhaps still on apretty small scale but I mean forsomeone just effectively new to this andcoming in and uh being sold on theregenerative ranching or agricultureethos or philosophy uh and being and asyou say like it's you kind ofromanticize about it because everyone ornot everyone but a lot of peopleespecially bitcoiners imagine beingSovereign in that way right having landworking land having that connectionbeing able to uh support yourself withsustenance from it and doing it theright way et cetera et cetera so whatwas it like like at the beginning youknow how what was this the gap betweenhow you romanticized about it and thereality of being knee-deep andbasically uh and you know give me somethoughts and and what would theexperience was like in the early daysyeah sure look in the beginning I wasdoing uh all the chores by myself and itwasn't a full-time job because you knowright at the start uh maybe I had a fewhundred chickens and 20 cows and fourpigs and that was sort of the startingcrop and I was still working full-timein the bike shop so I'd I'd race out ofthe morning let the chickens out oftheir pan make sure they had foodrace into the block shot head outafterwards move the cows you know justchaos just um uh pandemonium and mystaff eventually in the bike shop uheventually approached me and said ohwe're going to take you off the rosterwhich when they first told me that I wasa little bit uh put off I was a littlebit offended because I thought well thisis my shop and and you're oversteppingit and those are things all sinking inmy head and you're making me feelinadequate like I'm not pulling myweight and and you know you'd be betteroff without me but then as theconversation went they said Jake youknow we've watched youum slave your guts out for the lastseven years you've got a son you've gota wife and you're really passionateabout this farming stuff like we justwant to free you up that you can chasethe things that you're involved in and Ithought you know what a beautiful thingand and the shops never run better sinceI got kicked out of the place so I wasrunning back and forward a lot and Itell you what you know theinfrastructure on the farm wasnon-existent and what I mean by that waswe just had the normal fences that Ibuilt when he bought the farm you knowin the early 2000s or whatever it wasand there was no irrigation so Icouldn't pump water to animals I had tocart water the number one rule everyonelistening who goes and buys a farm don'tcut water put your infrastructure infirst cutting water is a mugs game whatI mean by that is filling up buckets orbarrels and driving it to the animalslike it's an absolute nightmare it's thebiggest time pit you'll have and I wasdoing all these things that I taughtpeople not to do now but I wasabsolutely loving it because it wasfarming and that was what I wanted to doand I was really excited to be with mychickens and be with my cows and andwatch them and learn from them and andbe productive with them and so over itvery quickly I put labor on so now theFarm's got two full-time Farm hands andI've got two full-time butchers and I'mbasically off the chores on the farmunfortunately I'd like to be on thechores more than I am but the the levelwhere the farm business is at like Isort of float around my stores and feelpressure points and the current pressurepoint is uh inventory control and Orderpacking and sending the Australia issuch a big place and it's so difficultto do refrigerated Frozen Freight aroundthe country and we're not shippingenough produce yet to justify payingsomeone to do it so that's the pressurepoint that I'm investing in my time toscale at the moment but you know as Igot help on the farm I employed thisfarmer uh Michael he's still with methree years later we we gauge how tallthe trees are but he planted a fewthousand trees on the farm for us andevery now and then I want to know howold they are so I think about how oldhis first order is because he plantedthem just after she was born and it'sjust this really cool you know he'sbecome part of the farm uh it's so nicehaving a trusted hand like that aroundthe place but as help turned up and thenwe rolled out some really basicinfrastructure which took me months towrap my head around because I'm not ahandy guy I'm not a Mr Fixer-Upper uh Iremember employing a Sparky one day tocome and replace the extraction fan inour shower because I couldn't do it andI watched him do it and I was soembarrassed he just climbed up a steplater we've stood it out of the ceilingunplugged it out of the socket pluggedthe new one in from the hardware storeand clicked it in and I thought I didn'teven I didn't even attempt because I'mso not handy well I forced myself tobecome handy now through multipledemasculating emasculating events likethat but once we've got thisinfrastructure in I guess the point wasis that I'm trying to make is theinfrastructure took me months to wrap myhead around how to roll it out how toget a solar pump to suck out of a dam uhand Prime two kilometers of pipe underthe ground all these sorts of things andnow when we're leasing a block like thislast hundred acres that I leased fromthe on the Bitcoin around the corner werolled out infrastructure in two daysbecause we had a look at the farm wedownloaded a Google map got the pen andpaper out ordered the materials got itto live in just rolled it out and it waseasy peasy and you know I sort of feellike we've gone through those first fewyears of earning our stripes and andmuddling through being absolutelyclueless and now for like for mepersonally in our operation I watchother regenerative farmers in Australiaand around the worldget online every now and they don't havea whinge about how hard it is becausethe pigs keep getting out or how hard itis because foxes keep eating theirchickens and these aren't thingsthankfully that we seem to deal withvery often because I guess the thementality of our operation is if it ifsomething like that goes wrong that'sour fault and the systems aren't goodenough you just need to improve yoursystems and your infrastructure and Idon't want to be wasting my time chasingpigs off the highway and sitting out atnight time shooting foxes there thereare systems out there to manage thesethings there's infrastructure andmanagement and we're just aggressivelyproactive about those things because thethe ROI for putting pigs back into apaddock is horrendous as soon as a pigis out of its Paddock it's an absoluteliability it goes on the road it's likeit's like hitting a cow you know youjust can't have it and and I watchFarmers all over the place have theirpigs all over the countryside so youjust need to have that uh abundancemindset and not that poverty mindsetthat everything's too hard and just dothe workamenum so was it kind of what you wereexpecting you know just the last pointon on the the beginning of all this wasas you were doing all that initial workand making those mistakes and figuringout how to get your way throughwere youwere you happy about it was were youlike yes this is this was the rightdecision you know and it was satisfyingyou in the way that you thought it wouldyeah I'm I'm enjoying the farmingbusiness more probably than I thought Iwould I don't really uh look ahead toofar I'm not a massiveplanner I've never had two-yearFive-Year Plan so when I started doingthe farming on the property initially itwas just to feed my family and then Ithought well I'm producing an all rightamount here maybe I can wholesale to myCafe so I startedwholesaling everything at arm's lengthinto the Family Cafe which now almostexclusively uses our produce oreverything that we produce isum all those skus that exclusively saucefrom us like we don't grow rice so weimport ricebut I never had this big objective Iguess but the the further we go and themore it scales the more my my wife and Iare like this is us this is what we'redoing in the future you know instead ofthe family that was always lookingonline at the next business opportunityum to invest in a new business and turnit around uh we're pretty set now thatfarming's our thingyou know we were talking earlier aboutthe impact of putting glasses on and youknow they look weird at first but thenthey look normal because you adjust abit and it becomes normalizedhow has this new Ventress last lifestylechange you if at all you know you gofrom as you just said on the hunt for agood business operators of small retailbusinesses or small to medium-sizedretail businesses to now kind ofstepping into a farmer regenerativeRancher sort of identity how has thatchanged your personality how you seeyourself I mean obviously it's changedhow you see your future but I'm justcurious if it'sif if you identifying that way haschanged anything about how you think oract or anything like that100 it has you know when I was younger Iwould uh if if somebody made a commentabout uh veganism or or not eating meatI was the sort of teenager that would uhyou know someone knows at them and goI'm going to eat two pieces of bacon nowbecause because you're not going to haveany it's just that realum I guess arrogant borderlinedisrespect for animals and just beforewe started farming of watching a heap ofEX Avatar exposes and all this sort ofstuff and I've always loved animals eventhough it didn't manifest in my speechat that time but in high school Ithought if I was going to study foranything I wanted to be a vet but my dadsaid to me why do you want to be a vet Isaid I love animals he said oh so youwant to hang out with sick animals alldayand so that turned me off straight awayI thought that was quite a pragmaticconversation and the careers teacher wasvery upset that my dad had pulled meaway from uh the aspiration of highereducation it's so interesting to mebecause my careers teacher knew that Iwas thinking about being a vet in the umexercise of the class it wasn't anactual thing I was wanting to pursue butin the exercise if you had to what wouldyou when I say this because I loveanimals no one suggested be a farmerlike I think I think the stigma is maybe changing a little bit but it's it'snot this uh it's not thisvocation that people turn up to thesoccer match you know my son's going tobe a dentist oh my son's going to be apsychiatrist all my son's going to be afarmer like it just doesn't sort of holdthe same people that own land want theirchildren to get off the land to go getgood paying jobs in the city because thedrought's too hard right but it's it'sreally changed my attitude around foodand animals I'm on a massive welfareJourney I've always been a proponent ofwelfare and everything we do as a higherwelfare but my my thinking on whatwelfare actually is is evolving rapidlywell well welfare is is generallydiscussed in the tone ofkindness and outcomesso uh somebody would say oh you know uhmy dog has such a good life because I'vehad it all the time and bite chew toysyou know that would be an extension ofwelfare at homeuh whenuh the true toys that you can buy intown here are almost likeum there's these blueberry toothbrushesthat look like they're made out ofsynthetic plastic they're not they'rethey're edible materials but the fact isis that dogs are almost carnivores likethey're omnivores but the percentage ofmeat they're eating their diet is isextremely high most of the green matterthey would consume would be out ofum prey intestinal tracts and I look atthat now and I go well yeah your dog'shappy and it gets pets and you bitethese true toys but those two toysaren't really the right thing for thatdog that dog needs a bone and I know I'msort of uh splitting hairs here but anextension of that would be pigs don'tdeserve to be in sheds because they needwallows and dirt and and so I guess I'mI'm welfare for me is is getting awayfrom the outcomes because cage ofenvironments factory farms can sometimeshave really good outcomes because of howmedicated and controlled theenvironments are and it's also and thenit's trying to shift the Paradigm andlook at the animal in the context of itsexpression so like how does this animalexpress its nature in Wild it's a birdthat perches so why would we keep it ina cage without perches in it you knowit's a bird that's outside so I'mI'm going down a little bit of and tothe point that when I first startedfarming chickens I was against usinglights now a lot of farms use lightsthat come on a bit before the sunrise tostimulate the bird to get more eggs outof it and the farmers like me that areregenerative and we're holier than theyare and we do everything perfect on ourmicro little scale we're all telling allthe big boys how to suck eggs becausethe lights was unkind to the birdsbecause it was tricking them into moreeggs but the further you go down therabbit hole you realize that thegenetics of the chickens that we use onour Farms now are derived fromIndonesian jungle fowl birds that livedand evolved close to the equator thatare used to consistently long daylighthours and then we're putting them inplaces like South Australia orum you know northern Europe where thedaylight hours in Winter are a lotshorter and so my thing my Journey'sgone from stop modifying these birdsenvironments to trick them to now goingwell maybe we should be modifying theirenvironment a little bit to pay homageto their genetic base because that's thenatural expression of that bird in itsReal Environment does that make sensetotallyyeah so it's just it's just a journey soI guess my but then by by correlation tothat my attitudes around food and whatfood can do for your health human inputshumans natural environments the naturalExpressions you know we can observe whatwe've done for hundreds and thousands ofyears and derive that some of the thingsthat we're doing now uh might not be thebest for our health outcomesso that's been a massive you don't set ahole for us yeahand then the third thing probably askingabout what's changing my own Outlookwould be our environment my family'snever been greeny-based we've neverreally we've always thought uh peoplespoke too much and and you know becausewe you see Leonardo DiCaprio tellingeveryone to be green and then flyingaround into private jets and your pointof the hypocrisy and you go haha and formost for a lot of people out therethat's enough to sort of bow out of theconversation and go this is a waste oftimeum on a on a macro scale I'm notinterested in becoming aenvironments running around beating mydrums but just by farming on our smallacreage it's it's the feedback loop isso uh quickly provable about how you caneither degrade or improve a life a pieceof the environment in real time by yourmanagement practices your use of animalsso you know when people want to demonizecows saying they're bad for theenvironments well firstly like cows arethe environment so you're gonna you knowI think that's a really strange sort ofpremise that by proxy of like just beinga cow they're bad for the environmentbut there's no doubt that poormanagement of our places like feedlotsand factory farms are going to have anegative outcome on the environmentespecially the local environment you'regoing to have import feed export manureair quality all the soil and all theground is going to become Barren in thefeedlot but those animals can actuallyrestore it just as quick as they candegrade it if you manage them properlyand so I've become a real environmentalAdvocate because watch in my farm areflourish and how productive it's becomeand how efficient it's become because ofthat is motivating on on so many levelsan environmental level a balance sheetlevel uh work satisfaction in yourenvironment level it's uh it's it'smotivatingyeah I can only imagine I mean that'sthat's one of the things that's souh frustrating about the so-called greenor environmental movement I mean it'salways just the world is going to endgive the government more of your moneyand that that just seems to be theapproach rather than taking it on alocal level I mean I remember when I wasexcuse me like I don't know 20 years oldand I'd be hanging around with somefriends that you knowum feigned environmental Consciousnessor you know all else being equal theywould prefer towell you know they didn't they didn'twant to the the environment to bedestroyed and let's say they you knowthey believed in some of thecatastrophizing that's gone on and youknow fair enough nobody really knowsprecisely you know where we are andwhat's what the trajectory of things isbut it always was just deferring to thegovernment to put a tax on that and youknow make make this group of people dosomething or make that group of peoplenot do something or prohibit them fromdoing something rather than being likeno you you are an ecosystem and you arean impact on the ecosystem so step oneis to manage that right to manage howyou the degree to which you impactnegatively or destroy or pollute yourown environment and and your own bodybecause obviously they're intimatelyconnected so if you can start there thenBranch out from there and I you knowpeople like yourself I would say that'swhat you're doing you're you're carvingout a little space where you're going tosay I'm not going to try to fix theworld right off the batI'm going to take 100 acres 200 Acres300 acres and I'm going to see if I canmanage this properly such that I'm ableto get what I want out of it without ithaving a deleterious effect on theenvironment and actuallyopposite to that to actually regeneratewhat has been a somewhat depleted ordegraded environment and if everyone hadthat kind of mentality I feel like we'dresolve a lot of the issues and theanswer wouldn't have to be morecommunismyeah 100 this is like classic JordanPeterson clean your room sort of stuffright yeah you know like instead oftelling the government to uhum shut down all the coal power plantsand so Australia just exports its coalover to China instead of using it herelocally uh how about you go out educateyourself and buy your grass-fed andfinished beef direct from a farmerinstead of consuming feedlot beefbecause all of a sudden you've gone frompersonally contributing to the problemto contributing to this solution so Ilike to tell when I do my farm tours Ido free farm tours every month I like totell people that we buy our future likea lot of people say Jake why don't morefarmers do it like you I'm like wellit's expensive the way we do it in termsof management labor we actually havelower input costs and our leverage ofland capital is a lot better but ourLabor's right up there and laborrequires constant cash flow so it's abit more expensive to farm this way whydon't other farmers do it this waybecause they've got nowhere to selltheir produce and get a better return onit it all just gets sold into commoditymarkets but if more and more peoplestarted going we want to buy direct orFarmers that farm with integrity andtransparencyuh more farmers will be able to step upand meet the demands of the market soinstead of advocating for more Taxationand more governance people just need tovote with their dollar and buy theirfuturesyeah I totally agree with thatum and you know to the additional ironyorin absurdity of the situation isoftentimes the people that espouse thatview are the ones you know and I'm beingvery stereotypical here but in Starbuckson their iPhone you know being one ofthose white collar workers so detachedfrom the the very thing that they'reclaiming to be a representative of oradvocating for you know and this speaksto your point earlier where and I I grewup the same way you know like when Igrew up uh all of the things that youmight aspire to were for you knowbroadly speaking White Collar be anentrepreneur be a you know uh be apsychiatrist as you said a doctor alawyer you know accountant something inan office basically and something boringyeah exactly something boring in anoffice where you know you just want tokill yourself most of the time uh andfarming was was seen to be beneath youlike it's just why why would you ever dothat that's that's olden times that'speople that have no other options that'speople that are stupid you know and it'sand I think it's turning around fairlydramatically right now there's probablya number of reasons for that I mean oneis more and more people are appreciatingthe idea of sovereignty and they'resaying well if I want true sovereigntynot just like a limited sovereignty wellland and and being able to uh sustainyourself on the land is certainly a hugecomponent of that so I think it'sattractive for that reason but I alsothinkthe kind of the conceit or deceit of themodern Progressive vision and I you knowa lot of these words are highlypoliticized so I I'm sure many peopleare kind of interpreting themdifferently but I just mean like thatprogress is those white-collar jobs thatthat we were just alluding to I thinkpeople are starting to have a differentperspective on that be like you knowprogress can just as easily beuh you know going back to the land as itwere but doing things a little bit moredifferently leveraging modern technologyso you can build better infrastructureso that you can interface with thatecosystem and manage it better and getmore get more from it and have it uhenrich itself over time or you know bebecome more enriched over time and Ithink that idea is just becoming youknow more and more attractive to moreand more people especially bitcoinersum and before we move on to some ofthose uh other issues because of courseI got to ask you what your when Bitcoincame on the scene buthow hasI guess interfacing with nature to sucha intimate degreehow has that influenced well I mean Ithink you you said that you grew up in aa family of faith and faith is somethingyou know very important to you has thathad any influence they just seeing thosepatterns that you referenced before youknow seeing howhow uh how one little change can affectanother change in the ecosystem and howthe different feedback loops work andand how you can either do you knowdegrade and destruct or you can beconstructive with your managementpractices how has interfacing sointimately with you know nature broadlyuh impacted your philosophy your faithyour way of seeing the world if at allI guess it's given a lot moreperspective and Clarity around the factof the weight that our decisions carryand that's not just as a farmer butthat's a consumer alsoyou know Landscapes can so like I saidearlier can so quickly uh degraderimprove based on the management and theinputs of themthat you know the way we interact withit as a consumer has tangibleoutcomes now like I remember before Iwas interested in this space at all youexist in natureas though it's it's umdetachedfrom your own experience so like inNature's almost a space like you'rewalking around in it and it's it's anarea for you to exist in but you don'tthink about well I never certainlythought about how intertwined ourexistences were because just like cowsare natureyou know we are nature too and andbeing able to be on the farm and makelittle just little changes like how longthe cows are in that Paddock how manytrees you plant uh what you build thebridge out of uh how often you drive onthe road you know your Chickenmanagement and seeingknock-on effects that last years onyears based on those little decisionsit's uhit adds it adds gravity I think to theway that you you become more purposefulwith your it's like I've I've nevercared too much and this is going to besacrilege but a few years ago I got afew letters in the warning for puttingthe wrong rubbish in the wrong binbecause I just never cared too much I'mlike yeah I'll put a I put a recyclingbottle in the trash bin like sue me I'vegot a few letters and I said do it againwe won't pick up your bins for twomonths uh but now uh even though I can'ttie that you know the the waist going tothe tip I can't tie that directly to afunctional experience on the farmI'm very conscientious of the way Ihandle those little externalized outputsin my life now because I know what sortof knock-on effect it can have out thereand all those little one percents add upover the life of you know 80 90 yearsand and if everyone did that there'd bea large accumulative massive outcomewouldn't they yeah totally it must alsojust expand your world in a sensebecause again the stereotypical likeCity dweller so-called modern person youknow you have the cityscape and you havetransportation and you have online andmedia but being you mentioned earlierlike the the feedback loop or cycle isso so quick right you're constantlygetting feedback and you're constantlyable to see what happens when you changea certain input and it must be just sofascinating it's like just again mindexpansion is the word that comes to mindbecause you're you're witnessing andobserving and increasingly understandingkind of a whole new world right you'rejust you're seeing all the differentways that these animals and systems andplants work together how much they'rereliant on you know Cosmic forces ofweather and stuff like that and just howit it all gets shaped and then how youcan be you know a middleman or anintermediary somewhere there and justnudging things in this direction nudgingthings in that direction and seeing howthings rebalance and whether or notthat's what you're looking for andwhether or not that's what the land ornature is is willing to give up let'ssay it must be fascinatingit's really fascinating and watchingspecies of uh plants and animals comeback to the farm that we had never seenin the first sort of 15 years of usliving there just all these littlethings you know blow your mind and Iguess a good analogy would in terms ofthe relationship with the environmentand the ecosystem it'd be like goingfrom the passenger of a car to thedriver of a carlike you know you as as a consumer oryou know a civilian in the city you seethe birds there uh in around town andthe birds that are there are just thebirds that are there and you take it forgranted but if you become a driver andyou start putting a bit of feed out inyour backyard and you you modify theenvironment and you can attract morespecies of birds and all of a sudden yourealize like where we're not passengerswe're participating you know we are theenvironment and and that's it it'shumbling and it's motivating becauseit's sort of there's this motivationaspect of it that we've got all theopportunity to improve everything and wecare we've got the tools we know how todo it it's just a matter of factors ifwe want to do it but then on the otherhand parallel to that there's now thisduty of care like you can't unknow thisstuff so you have to go and live itmm-hmmis there a notion I mean I this isprobably kind of a silly question but isthere a notion of like Perfect Harmonybecause you know you're here you'reobserving things you notice when animalscome back you notice how things changehave you seen the documentaryum the biggest little farm I thinkthat's that's what it's called so youknow basically they started with Barrenland and you know they were gonna monocrop originally or I think you know theywanted to do something regen but thenthey they got advice from an old hand inin that world and ended up just you knowadding tons of different plants andfruit trees and animals of all differentkinds and when you know the uh animalInvaders or you know like came in andate half a crop or killed some of theiranimals they just they found a way toaccept a certain amount of you know thechaos of nature while also being able tobuild you know a thriving diverseecosystem and you know anytime you youhaveumyou have a system and you're noticingthat your inputs into it canharmonize it better can bring morebalance to it and can have it not onlybe more in Balance but even moreproductive with more balance does it notconjure up Notions of like well howharmonious could this system be likewhat is the the maximalmaximum harm like balance of Harmony andproduction that that is possible hereand you know there's broader ecosystemconstraints I suppose like you knowAustralia versus northern Europe versuswhatever but does it conjure up those isthat what you strive for when you'reattempting to continue to hone orperfect your craft herewell by proxy of just being involved inregenerative agriculture you know wedeliberately don't call ourselvessustainable agriculture because whywould you want to sustain the status quoquote like how mundane can you be it'sabout improving and regenerating andReviving restoring and you know what agreat film biggest little Farmers one ofthe yes we don't watch much TV there'smy TV behind me with a picture hungoverso the boys don't ask for it but wewatch it very sparingly that's one ofthe films that we like our children towatch because it's you know it'swholesome and it's um it's it's visuallyengaging and it's motivating and there'sfull of lessons uh you know they tookthem about seven years didn't it to sortof stop having plagueuh plagues on their farm that would justwipe out crops and and for everything toharmonize and balance outand you know it's definitely somethingthatwe haven't had plague events but I thinkbecause you know they got into umuh cropping like fruit production andstuff and vegetable and fruits harderthan animals let me tell you moving afew cows around the paddock is anabsolute piece of cake compared torunning a small Market Garden becausethese things they drink themselves theyeat themselves they've got their ownlegs to go where they need to go couldcompare the carrots and kale absolute uhbeautiful how elegant cattle farming isthe thing that I think about uh quite abit actually is that no one alive todayhasever met somebodywho's ever met somebody that's ever seena landscape in Full full bolt naturalstatus being highly productive and notdegraded by human intervention like youcan you can research um you go all theway back to the Romansand the Romans were cutting down uhabsolute masses of forestsall around their cities so that rivalarmies couldn't sneak up on them andthat ended up having ecosystem collapseand because all the forests were goneand then a few a few areas a few notableareas turned into lagoons because theecosystem would collapse and now they'dbasically formed into stagnant riparianareas which caused an explosion ofmosquito population which started wipingout all the cities with malariayou know that was thousands of years agolike we have you read you read about uhyou know the closest examples of ofpristine balanced ecosystems that we'dhave would be eitherum settled Australia or America you knowtwo and three hundred years agoyou read the books of the settlers whocame in these places you know they theytalk about the explorers that go throughthe Midwest of America and on Horsebackand the grass is so tall they can tieknots in the grass over the back of thehorse while they're sitting in thesaddle they can just grab the grass andlike to ex and they've got mobs ofmillions of Buffalo and wildebeestcoming through and these Landscapes areeasily supported and building fertilityI think the Midwest in America hadsomething like 30 foot deep in Topsoiland they're down to two foot now becauseit's all been mined out of the place sono one alive has ever met anyone who'smet someonethat understands what these ecosystemsare even meant to look like the bestClues we have are in old books and maybea few paintings like I love looking atold uh Explorer paintings of Australiabecause you can pick up there's a hillnear us called Big Ben and you can findwhen people were here a couple years agoand they painted Big Ben they didn'thave cameras and then you go and look atit today and you stand in front of itand they're not the same they're they'reso back when the indigenous peoples werelooking after it and we didn't have umfire trucks so if a fire started thatwas just a natural expression of thatlandscape and it wiped everything outyou'd have these big mountains with umtrees just spotted over at these big uhfully expressed three four hundred yeargum trees that just uh were like amosaic just scattered out over the hillnow because fire bad we put every fireout with a uh with a fire truck becausethey're a liability you can't see ablade of grass on these Hills they'recompletely choked out dense bush withyoung trees none of them look older than20 years old because they've allsuffocated each other and can't growlike I just don't think we can eventhat's sort of a bit of a tangent so Iknow it's not really what you ask but Idon't think we can even wrap our headaround what these Landscapes uhpotential expression is and you knowthat you could chalk that up to be somesort of sob story but I think it's it'sincredibly motivating because look athow productive I can be the last time Ispoke to my bank trying to get somemoney out of them they wanted myfinancials so I gave them the financialsout of the farm this was my 22figures 23 Financial year and there's noindustry to Benchmark me against becausethere's no industry that they have dataon that's mixed Enterprise stackedEnterprise like mine so the closestthing they benchmarked me on was beefproduction because all my neighbors arejust beef farmers and my biggest incomemyself is beef and out of my 100 Acrehobby Farm I was doing 26 times moredollars per meter squared than theindustry average around my areayou know and and to be that productivewhile using no synthetic inputs and nopoisons no fertilizer and having massesof grass compared to everyone around meit's so motivating already having thoseresults then thinking we haven't evenscratched the sidesof the potential production of ourLandscapes we don't even know how tophrase what that could potentially looklikeyeah well that's one of the things I wasgoing to ask you you know we talk abouttheseuh untouched Landscapes let's say like300 years ago midwest U.S or somethinglike thatand you know you as you say the topsoilhas come down a lot and the Bisonpopulation is has been decimated and allthat stuff but does it not I mean I gotto think that one of the exciting thingsnow is that you can takeyou know a large amount of knowledgeabout how to re rebalance orre-establish Harmony in these ecosystemssuch that over time they're buildingrather than degradingbut you can also you also have moderntechnology to assist you in that so youknow and I think to my mind the thingthat would be exciting about that is youmay be and we as a species or whateverlet's saymight be able to establish a type ofbetter is probably the wrong word butyou know like a better Harmony than hasever existed right because even in thatnow we're kind of comparing apples tooranges because in that untouched insome of those untouched Landscapesnobody was relying on them forsustenance you know and we have to be sowe have to impact our our ecosystems forthat reason but is it not exciting tothink like wow likewith all that we know and the technologywe have and we'll continue you know mostlikely to continue to have will we beable to do more with this land than hasever been done with it you know are wenot able toyou know like do something completelynovel with it you know for on the upsideon the good side and how exciting isthatabsolutely and that's why for me thefuture is not Bleak there's not thisdoomsday outcome the future is full ofuh possibilities you know if if a coweats the grass at the right time itimproves the landscape it sequesterscarbon it nutrient cycles that grass soit takes this grass that would normallystand there and oxidize turns it intomanure which gets eaten by the soil andand on your go when you've got these bigmigratory herds uh in the wild theseCycles might have been annual you knowthe animals might have come through andeaten that grass and done a lot of goodand then come back a year later whenthey're bouncing you know migrating backthe other direction they're what we knowabout the grasses in the landscapefunction now is in spring when thatgrass is growing really fast it's gotitself to a levelum it's it's repaired itself andrecovered and expressed itself to alevel where it might be ready forgrazing again in 10 or 15 days withoutnegatively uh impacting and on the flipside actually positive really impactingthe ecosystem but there's certain otherSeasons where it does need four or fivemonths in different Landscapes so wewe've got these tools now if you've gotan open mind and you do the research soI guess to your point we we can now withour management leverage systems thatwould take thousands of years Millenniato build that fertility and and we canmanipulate that and work those systemswithin the natural context andaccelerate it extremely aggressively soinstead of grazing that grass once ayear we can graze it eight times a yearand get eight times the amount of manureon the ground but if you've got to havethe right decision-making matrix it'simportant toyou know in in farming you don't want tostick to systems like you need systemsin in terms of uh what what time do youstart your shift when do you let thechickens out of the sheds in the morningthese sorts of things but if you saythings like uh we move our cattle to anew Paddockum every single day that's a rigidoperating system but the it's not movingthem to the new day that's actually thetrick it's how long you let that Paddockrecover before you come back and grazeit and that can't be systemized becausethe weather changes the amount ofanimals you're feeding changes the rainchanges all these all these your soilgets more fertile less fertile over timedepending on how you're managing it soit's aboutum it's really about forming thatrelationship with the environment you'reowning and having the decision-makingMatrix to be able to think about theseall these different moving parts and forus on our farm that's why it was soimportant to do a holistic managementcourse there's I don't know if you'veseen Alan Savory he did a very famousTed Talk a few years ago and talkedabout how he killed all the elephantsbecause he figured out elephants are badfor the environment and now it sees youknow greatest regret because you realizeit's not the cow it's the cow it wasn'tthe elephants degrading the environmentit was the fences trapping the elephantsmovements so he's written in a fantasticblueprint for decision makingcontext and actually you know looking atall the different moving parts and howto apply that onto your farm without itbeing a rigid system because the rigidsystems fail so the futures right therewe can absolutely leverage naturallandscape function to accelerate itsrepairing[Music]um going back to the bank meeting I'massuming with 26 times uh Revenue persquare meter is that what you saidat that stage it wasum probably be closer to 40 now so thebank gave you some money I'm guessingbased off those figuresyepum my question ispresumably that's a fairly what you'redoing and what others have doneought to be generating a fairly strongincentive or at least peaking theCuriosity of other Farmers because youknow and this will be different independing on where you are butpart of the reason we alluded to earlierwhyum farming was such a uninterestingcareer path when you and I were growingup and part of that although I'm morecognizant of it in later years soperhaps not too much a part of it but isthe the plight of farmers like uh youyou've heard many SOB stories or youknow you've heard how difficult it is tobe a farmer whether it's you know therising cost of inputs whether it befertilizer or you know energy inputs anduh you've heard about Shady practiceswith uh you know the monsantos of theworlduh you know you've the debt that farmershave to take on in order to keep thingsgoing and how inflation is is they'rehaving is making everything harder sopresumably people that are coming alongand doing what you're doing and sayingwell I figured out a way to be you knowway more profitable and good for theenvironment and you know less stressless inputs less subject to the themachinations of macroeconomics in termsof the cost of inputs so is that notgenerating you know a lot of interest inFarmers that previously were doing ityou know a different way mono crop bigfeed lot that kind of stuff and I I meanI think it has to be mentioned as wellwe'll break into this in a little bitbecause it's super interesting whatyou're doing but the Dynamics havechanged as well like 50 years ago youproduce something you sell to awholesaler and they or a distributor andthey they sell it right now with theinternet and with social media you cansell direct to Consumer and so you'reable to retain a lot of the profit thatotherwise or previously would have hadto have given up so all of these thingsare changing the dynamic uh or the theopportunities that are available toFarmers so are they not starting to lookover your fence and be like I want someof that I don't I don't want to besuffering it over in the way I've beendoing itit's really mixed you know I get a lotof young people that want to startfarming reaching out wanting informationhave a zoom call which I'm always happyto do uh a lot of the old-timersum although they're not wanting to rollit out because they've sort ofum you know they've done their farmingJourney but a lot of the older boys whomight be in their 70s and 80s that Imade at different events that I speak atand things are incredibly uhcomplementary and interested and saythings like I wish I thought of thissooner but the the my peers the farmerswho are out there inheriting broad AcreFarmsin their 30s and 40s and working wellnot even inheritance take that out of itbut are working and stewarding these bigfarms like America has guys around myage I generally get a bit more Flack offthem because to them it's allsensationalizedum it's all hobby it would never work atscale it's all a bit too romantic it'snot the real image of what farming is soit's a really uh mixed response and Ifind it really interesting that they'rereally young and the in the old peopleboth love it but it's it's that uh it'sthe workinggroup like the groups that's actually Iguess a little bit more in control ofwhat we're actually doing that most ofthem tend to see it as a little bit of ajoke I guess I I do think the way thatwe're doing thingsis is necessary and I think that there'sa lot more opportunity for young peopleto get into a stacked Enterprisedirect-to-consumer Farm compared totrying to get into a traditional farmingexperience but I wouldI would be remiss if I didn't sort ofput some sort of caveat on that and sayyou know no business is free and nobusiness is easy but people since I'vestarted only four years ago I've watcheda dozen local Farms trying to do what wedo young people on lease land or hobbyblocks start and finishstart online telling everyone howthey're going to fix the world sellingeggs selling pork whatever it might beand then within two or three years I'vealready given up because they didn'tmeet their expectation and it was uh toodifficult for them and I think one ofthe things where New farmers go wrongcoming into it is that they think theycan do it with no Capital behind themyou know whether you're whether you'rebuying or starting a bike shop a recordshop a restaurant an InvestmentPortfolioFarm businessyou know you you don't get value fornothing you know they're called Ponzischemes you've got to have somethingyou've got to buy your livestock you'vegot to Market you've got to haveinfrastructure to store your produce andto fence your animals in so you know Ithink I'm a little bit of an anomaly uhbased on on my tradection Traction inthe last four years with how quick we'vescaled from a you know kid who knewnothing about farming toum you know we'll easily crack a milliondollars Revenue uh this year but I'veinvested somewhere between four and fivehundred thousand dollars in the farmingbusinessas well to to purchase the the animalsand the infrastructure like I had to goand spend in you know over half of thatmoney that I just said I've invested isto purchase my Butchery and renovate itand stock it with equipment becausethere's no access to Market without itum so I thinkI wouldn't want to dissuade anyone fromdoing it but you've got to be realisticthat if you if you don't have the equityif you don't have the capital toSnowball the the farm as soon as you getinto it you've got to be willing totrade off that Equity with your laborwith your unpaid Sweat Equity and that'sgoing to make scaling longer isn't it itmight take you 10 years to get to wellwhat you could do in four years withhalf a million dollars might take you 10years if you've only got 100 Grand inthe bank to because you'll have tonaturally breed your animals up insteadof buying them in all these sorts ofthings and I think a lot of people seesmall scale stacked Enterprise low-costinfrastructure portable infrastructureall these things and they think they cando it on the smell of an oily rag uh butthen they never hit that scale they needto actually be able to afford to put afarm hand on so they're not working 80hours a week doing it all themselves andever seeing their familyI've never heard that expression beforesmell of an oily rag I like itum whatyeah I'm sure it is what would you saytobecause you know I suspect a lot ofpeople listening to thisyou know perhaps including myself atsome point but you know as we weresaying a lot a lot more people are beingum are finding thisway of life or at least this type ofEnterprise very compellingyou know what would you say to peoplethat are looking to start out obviouslyyou just said you know if you want toFast Track things you can if you haveCapital then you can deploy it and FastTrack things that way but for peoplethat maybe have less than Capital thanthat and can't get access to it or youknow want to hold on to their Bitcoinmore tightly or whatever the case may beif someone's just trying to getsomething started on a small scaleyou know is there anything that pops outthat you would um you know you wouldadvise them to make their 100 Journeyeasier and more successful and not beones like the the 10 you mentionedwell you've got to you've got toidentify what you actually want firstlike are you trying to start a viablefull-time business or are you justtrying to Homestead to build up somefood security for your family becausethey're they're different scenarios andthe way you're going to attack themdifferently but if you're just wantingto have enough of your family and maybesell some Surplus to community friendsand family you knowpeached canned peaches for SATs onTwitter every now and then or somethinglike that you need less land than youthink okay I laugh about my 100 acresbeing a hobby Farm but if you're afamily of four or five and you canscratch together two or three acres youcould absolutely it depends on climateyou know there's so many variables butI'm just going to go out there and saythat you could absolutely be uh themajority you you could be food securewith most of your foods like obviouslyif you're going to be wanting to eatmangoes and rice you're going to beimporting these Commodities fromappropriate climates go to the shoppingcenter to get them but on a few acresfor the average family you could raise abody of beef every year you could havehalf a dozen pigs you could have ahundred chickens like what if for meatand eggs and do all these things and Iwould just um encourage people that youcan't Google Experience like the famousJoel Salton says and just to get outthere in the trenches and do it now thisdoesn't mean being irresponsible andneglecting your animals there's there'sa there's a level of Duty of care andresponsibility that comes with acceptinglivestock onto your farm but I I knowand see so many people that have readall the books watched all the YouTubechannels gone to all the courses andthey're still planning three four yearslater they're still planning they've gotthe land they're on the land and they'rejust uh they've bound themselves upthey're their high level ofconscientiousness has just killed anypotential productivity that they mighthave been able to excrete so I wouldjust encourage people to actually getstarted you don't have to do it all atonce just get 20 chickens if you ifyou've got a Suburban I live on a 800meter block so it's like a two and ahalf thousand foot city block and I'veGot Friends in in town with the samesize blocks and they raise all theirmeat birds every year in their backyardstheir broilers doing daily moves onpasture you know like there's so muchpotential on smallum Landscapes so even if you're livingin a high-rise complex put some potsoutside and start growing some tomatoesand just start getting those Hands-Onexperiences uh as quick as possiblebecause they gain momentum and as youtalk to people about them it'll it'llbuild opportunities rightum you mentioned you had to purchase aButchery so there was an existingButcher and and you purchased it or youhad to start one up and and staff it orso when you when you want to sell directto Market in Australia you have to sendyour animals to a processing plant whichwe call an avatar that's where theanimal gets uh killed slaughtered andthen it gets delivered to a localbutcher so your local Mara and pad thatyou'll go to to buy your snags andScotch steak for dinner T-bone steak andthey'll cut it up for you put it in yourpackets and charge you a price for doingthat and I was using a great localbutcher who did a fantastic job for mebut his capacity was extremely small andso I started nosing around at multipledifferent butcherstrying to see if I could run you knowanimals through two or three differentlocal processes just became a nightmarebecause they're all busy running theirown shop they've all got differentequipment so all the meat would bepacked and labeled differently I'd haveno consistency in my product which wasimportant to me coming from a retailbackground on you everything needed tobe consistentuh timelines all over the place costingsare all over the place some of them area bit hot-headed and hard to deal withso I just thought my business is I wasso micro at that level and I was alreadyhitting these bottlenecks and I thoughtI just need to process myself so Ipurchased a freehold a building of aButchery business that had recently beenclosed that had been in town for over 70years and the the family that had at thePeter's family had sold the business theperson that bought the business wentbankrupt and so they liquidated all themachinery and then they sold theFreehold and I'm the one that bought theFreehold the timing worked really wellfor us and then we renovated it becausewe had to get it back up to code becauseit was a bit old and tired put all newequipment in it and started processingour own animals and in the beginning Ihad a butcher working two days a weekthis was only two years ago I had abutcher working two days a week in TheButchery and then two days a week in mybike shop building bikes and then a daya week on the farm driving the tractoraround slashing all the neighbors weedsand doing all sorts of different choresand he loved it he thought it was greatto have all these different thingsexperiences and now we've got twofull-time butchers and a part-timePacker doing our custom processing andwe also custom process for about 15other local farmers so other Farmersthat have also identified the challengein getting uh into the market with theirproduce can use us and because we don'trun a traditional front of house retailspace we're not getting distracted bythe phone ringing at the door buzzingwhich is out the back processing sowe're able to make sure thateverything's very consistent and timelyand packaged nice and neat so that'sbeen running for about two years nowthere's no way we could do our businesswithout it but the the next week link isthe abattoir because I've gone from fourlocal avatars servicing our needs to onein two yearsfor a range of for a range of reasonsit's not a they're not singling me outthey've stopped doing any custom Procustom slaughtering uh purely justbecause the economics of it are just apain in their backside dealing with allthese little micro producers that arealways late and send animals that aretoo big or too small they just don'twant to deal with it anymore so we needan abattoir in our supply chain uh thatwe can control just to have thatsovereignty over our own businessbecause of this sabatoire turns me offyou know we're standing in standingstill yeah but I guess I don't know didyou see what we've done with our retailspace onlineuh uh is I I saw your Tick Tock that hadyou know hundreds of thousands of viewsI want to hit on that in a second butbefore we doum have you you know gotten involved inin the butchering and that kind of stuffup to this point is that something thatyou if not you know will youno look I just I I bring in the laborfor that into my bike shop I can'trepair bikes in my Cafe I can't makecoffees I'm not I know a lot of businessowners like having their fingers on thepole to be able to do everything but tome that really slows progress and turnsyou into a micromanager and and it makesyou uh probably more open to hiringpeople that aren't as suitable for thejob because you can fill theirshortfalls you know one of my rules isto hire people better than me for thetask that they're being given why wouldI want to hire people worse than me Imight as well do it myself it just makesno sense so I deliberately shy away fromthose jobs and and it also makes youtreat your staff differently to a degreelike I've got great workplace cultureacross my businesses but if you knowthat you can't step in and do that man'sjob or that woman's job for them uhthere's there's a certain level ofmanagement that needs to come along withthat for the for the uh ying and theYang of the business to keep progressingso I'll go in there and I'll cry back anold label bags and all uh I'll slicesteaks in a pinch if I need to but interms of the proper technical butcheringI'm starting to figure out where certainthings come from a bit better I'm notinto these sorts of details on bigpicture you know a lot a lot of peoplejust obsess about all these littledetails and as long as the meat in thepacket is good quality I'm quite happyto just know as little as possible yeahso you might think this is a sillyquestionum and in a sense it you know it perhapsis but it's still something I thinkabout and uh you know for contact thequestion I'm going to ask you is youknow you said earlier you're an animallover and you used to be kind of uhdismissive of like you know the thestereotypical vegans refrain or concernor argument or whateverbut you know now part of your businessis yes absolutely raising animals in thebest possible environments and ensuringthat they have a good life and that kindof stuff then part of that is harvestingor killing animals and you know uh it'ssomething that I've had to think a lotabout as you know I eat a ton of meatbecause I think it's the best sustenancefor me and umyou know I won't go too deeply into youknow my own philosophy on it but it hasif nothing elseumand this again this may sound somewhatfunny but like if I'm going to uhsacrifice an animal's life for my ownsustenance it has impressed upon me acertain responsibility to make as bestuse of that sustenance that they'vegiven me as I possibly canyou know for lack of a better term bethe best that I can be or or lead a goodlife some you know something like thatmake it make that sacrifice asmeaningful as I possibly can and I'mjust wondering you know now that you'reup close and personal with thisuh these activities you're part of thisprocess uh how has that influenced if atall you'reyou know your mentality or yourperspective on that stuffyeah absolutely to to the same extent oftaking my own health more seriously wewe work extremely hard to use the wholeanimal nose to tail we want us we wantas smaller amount of the animal beingthrown out as possible which is alsobetter financially for us but not all ofit it's a great Roi struggling throughhow to figure out how to use these bitsbut we want to umpay respect to the you knowthe the yield that these animals havegiven us they've worked their wholelives and now we've taken their proteinthat we need for our own sustenance andit is about honoring that thatum sacrifice to use the word that youusedum I Ilike I can't eat factory farmed meat soif we go out to a restaurant and it'sit's caged pork and feedlot beef on themenu I'll eat I'll get the vegetarianoption and I'm basically Carnival like Idon't eat vegetables but I would rathereat vegetables than eat a pig that'sbeing confined into a concrete box itswhole life and and just being abused youknow part of the reason why I do what Ido is not only so my family can haveaccess to what we call Healing food butgreat quality food that makes us feelgreat but it's so that we can also eatit with a clean conscience knowing thatthat animal hasn't been violated like ithasn't been put in a jail cell its wholelife and I know that's hard for the thevegan population to wrap their headaround the reality is for me being onone end of the spectrum and most vegansbeing on the other end is if we actuallysat down and had a round tablediscussion I think that we would have 95of things in common uh we would we wouldagree that the the way we've raised alot of our animals stinks the way weprocess a lot of our animals thinks theenvironmental outcome of the way weraise our animals is no good like wewe'd agree on all these things I'm likewe're Partners in this but the one thingwe would disagree is um on the the finalPoint morality of being able to consumethese animals or not whether whetherit's somethingum appropriate or not but we actuallyand this is what you see acrossum society as a whole isn't it you seeyou see tribalism and sides pitchedagainst each other left versus right allthis sort of stuff when their reality isis that we all want the same things weall want to be healthy we all want to behappy we want our family protected wewant good quality food like very fewoutliers on these main things assist ourthinking process as to how we get therediffersyeah I totally agree with thatum last point on that but you know againas you said like the Vega the veganswould come back and say yeah it's greatthat you're giving them a better lifebut you're still taking the life at somepoint in the processum and you know I that's that point isprobably not reconcilable either youthink that you're uhyou know you have a kind of right orprivilege to do that or you don't doesdoes your faith impact your perspectiveon you know so-called dominion overanimals to do that or did you make upyour mind on on that absence you knowhaving to invokeuh maybe that's the wrong framing but Ithink you know what I'm getting at youknow you're yeah well you knowbeing raised in a Christian household webelieve that we will put here to Stewardthe Earth which isn't something thatwe've uh I I don't think it's somethingthat we can claim we're doingfantastically well at the animalum so you know trying our best toactually live that Joel saliton who Ikeep referencing he's he's the farm Gurufor me he wrote a book called TheMarvelous pigness of pigs and it'sbasically an open letter to the churchgoing all you guys think you'reChristians yet you sit by while we abusehis creation and Destroy his environmentin the process and you happily eat itbecause it's cheaper off the shelf youknow it's hypocrisyum so like my decision to Source uhbetter quality food wasn't a faith-baseddecision it was just a decision goinglook at that video of that Pig'sdisgusting environment of the way ofsuffering I don't want to be part of itit was you know it was it was a visualuh Game Changer but I Iyou know for me this this goes back tohuman welfare you know we're talkingabout animal welfare and you have toobserve the species in the context ofits natural environment well if we stepback over time and look at the speciesof humans in context to our naturalenvironment we ate meat almosteverywhere and in some places we onlyeat meat and of course there's someplaces on with very heavy vegetariandiets but it's just not the normexceptions you know you've got you'vegot ideals norms and exceptions and whywould we make our own personal decisionsbased onum exceptions that are there because ofsmall amounts of culture or smallergrants of geographical location you knowI think the norm is that we've eatenwe've eaten meat but the norm isprobably that we've eaten really goodhigh quality meat from Wild game andanimals that haven't had antibioticslike we've only had antibiotics inanimal agriculture since the 40s youknow so you know we're just uh I I alsothink there's a fantastic book calledDeep nutrition by Dr I think she'sAmerican and Dr Catherine Shanahan andit talks aboutepigenetics I don't know if you've comeacross epigenetics yeah and and for mewhen we againhow environment allows for theexpression of certain you know latentgenetic attributes basically yeah soyour environment and your in your dietwhich is a you know part of yourenvironment can turn basically turn offor turn on certain parts of your uhgenetic information but that's heritableso the the part where your health is atat the time of your breeding when youbreed with your partner is sort of thestarting block for your progeny so if ifyou want to be a if you want to masteryour personal health in the name ofanimalum care that's we could argue whetherthat's Noble in its own right but ifyou're doing that prior to breeding andyou're handing down that starting blockfor your future uh progeny I would saythat's really poor welfare on a holisticsense you know it's you're predisposingyour child to a range of enormouschallenges throughout its life and noneof this is Airy Fairy stuff you know youcould pick up a book and educateyourself so I thinklike I've I've got I've got familymembers that are vegans and they'reraising summer raising children infantchildren vegan and the other ones arenotyou know it's it's a real it's a realcognitive dissonance to sort of findyourself in as a as a principal veganand I don't want to become the veganBasher like I said I've got more incommon with them than I don't but it'sjust you know there's conversations tobe have around this and humans beingliving mammals in our environment sopart of the environment we have our ownwelfare and I don't believe that umyou know if if not for yourself whatabout for the kids you know like there'sthere might be just a better time andplace to be living theseum virtues yeah I agree with you and youknow sure we can skip on the the veganbashing but what we can probably do isis Bash on the standard Americanso-called diet you knowum and it's amazing that the the acronymis sad but you knownothing nothing is a better indictmentof howuh the sustenance so-called that thosepeople are consuming is being producedthen what its outcome is in in the theform and the health status of the peoplethat consume food produced in that wayand you know drawing broad brush Strokeshere again but I I think most peoplewouldn't find too much argument withthat doesn't result in what nearlyanybody would deem to be a healthystrong longevity oriented physique orhealth status when you eat food that'sbeen produced in that way so you I meanthat alone if we're just judging thelandscape and saying well what should weeat and how should the food that we eatbe producedyou look at someone who's eating youknow the mono crop the high fructosecorn syrup the you know the factoryfarmed all this kind of stuff and thenyou look at someone who's eating a dietyou know of the manner that the foodthat you produce and it's evident whichone is I mean it's extremely evidentwhich one isum most appropriate for for for athriving human being let's sayyeah absolutely and those thoseSupermarket diets where everything's youknow wheat and fructose corn syrup youknow not only does it have horribleeffects for human health on agenerational level but it's alsodisgusting for the environment if you ifyou look right exactly yeahum heavily medicated monocultureenvironments the interesting thing isand this is where I think it all startsto get into the weeds and this is wherelong-form discussion is really helpfularound these butcropping large-scale cropping and animalgrazing can both cause desertificationthey can both destroy landscapesbut in in with the current tools that wehave in front of us only one can rapidlyrestore the landscape and that's theruminant grazing if if managed properlyum so I don't know the the for thecropping areas around me when you drivethrough them yeah they look prettysometimes of the year because you've gotall these yellow flowers but you comeback a few months later after they'vejust finished burning it off to get ridof all the stubble and it sits in thepaddock and then they come through andthey poison it they put 14 tractorpasses over a crop nowby the time they prepare the ground seedit fertilize it come through and useherbicides and pesticides to clean upall the pressure on the crop to to sprayit to kill it at the end of the seasonso it all dies uniform and they don'tget late season bolting to actuallyHarvest it 14 times these tractors goover these films these fields you knowjust the um the input the input alone isincredibleit almost makes me think as you'resaying that thatum managing it with rumen and animalsproperly doing the regenerative approachis almost inevitable because the landwill give up the ghost you know in theway that it's currently being used andyou'll have to introduce the style offarming in order to rehabilitate it atsome pointum I know we're coming up on time so Ijust got two more things for you but uhone isI think you had you know two or threetwo or three hundred thousand views on atick tock slash Twitter video you putout recently and this was the retailexperience for the farming that you'vebeen doing and it was super coolbasically for anyone that hasn't seen ityou know you go you you you only havemembers and so each member gets a pincode to this retail location let's justsay it's on a normal like Retail Roadand uh you go in and there's all sortsof stuff you know Beef Pork eggstons of stuff it looks amazing and youjust fill up your cart and then you havean app on your phone Express checkout orsomething like that you scan the thebarcode on everything that you're takingthere's nobody in the store there's acouple cameras up in the ceilings youso you're you're relying on the membersto be honest in what they have in theircart they scan everything they pay thatway they walk out the door there's noPersonnel whatsoever and then at the endof the video you say thatyou've been doing this for two years Ithink you said and uh you've never hadum you know you've never had a lossbasically so nobody's ever screwed youwhich is amazingum but I thinkyou know and you you you vet as you saidyou vet the members they come and do afarm tour so there is a relationshipthere but I think the industry you're inand what I'm beginning to notice or havebeen noticing for a while in Bitcointhat I think our future and thevalue for value and what you're doing isobviously not the same and you knowthere's no additional marginal cost toDistributing information let's say butjust this notion of well people beingmore honorable people being more honestand being willing touh pay for for what they're receivingand not not needing to be policed youknow I think that's a an attribute ofthese these twouh Industries communities whatever youwant to call them that I suspect andhope we will see proliferate far more sothat there can be more of this style ofdoing business rather than you knowstarting from a a premise of extremedistrust and you know and and the kindof how that pollutes a relationshipbetween either individuals or you knowcustomer and andentrepreneur or orshop owner or whatever so yeah tell metell me if I missed anything and whatthat retail experience has been like andhow you came up with it and all thatstuffno that was a great recap look I Ididn't want to open a traditionalstorefront because you know one of thethings that lets us be so efficient anddisciplined out the back with ourprotein processing is that we don't havea door buzzer going off and we have toput tools down and go surf people andwith my with my production it there'sjust it makes no sense to throw anotherwage out the front to stand there andscan backs like I I'd have to be doing alot more than I am and it'd all have togo through there and it just wasn'twhere we were at so I initially decidedyou know we need to have a big meatvending machine and I couldn't findanything suitable and then I justsomehow came up with this I don't knowhow it popped into my head but basicallyit's like a 24-hour gym that you cansell service on using your phone as thehardware instead of having like a youknow if a fixed scanning device and thememberships aren't free like they theydon't cost anything but I do requestthat people come along to one of my farmtours which are free I do them monthlythey always book out you know within aday or two of Hosting them uh listingthem uh they don't cost anythingfinancially but I do request three tofour hours of your undivided attentionon a Sunday which is not easy to getfrom people you know it's a it's a it'sa long time to donate to walking arounda field and hearing about a guy rant andRave about each cows and obviously Iattract a certain clientele that areinterested in food Providence and animalwelfare and regenerative farming andcommunity building and all these thingsbut for me that's been a really greatfilter to onboard people who areactually serious about wanting to puttheir money where their mouth is and andbuying their future and then in turntrusting them within the facilitythere's a certain level of trust withthe facility but there's also a certainlevel of Big Brother you know uniquecode for Access high def camerasrecording Visual and audiofootage uh you know Rolling Stock takesjust to check things but like like Isaid earlier sure it's not a free thingno you know there's some disincentivesthere butyeah but but for the you know for themost part someone could just walk in andgrab a big box full and off they go butfor me it's always been you know worseeven if somebody breaks into the placewhich I've my other stores my bike shopmy Cafe they get broken into everycouple years and you sort of get alittle bit desensitized to it like it'sjust you don't take it personal after awhile it's just a cost of doing businessbut even if somebody walked in andloaded a couple boxes up with as muchmeat as they could possibly carry outlike what are we talking about 30 40kilos of meat maybe a thousand bucksworth of meat no it's just not the endof the world I saved that in a in fourdays worth of wages so the downside forme when I started was everyone was goingyou're going to get fleece you're goingto get fleece I'm like well maybe butI'll just cut my losses at a fewthousand dollars and I'll just reinventthe wheel and we'll have a go again butit's never it's never come to that pointyeah I saw it and what everyone thoughtit was pretty interesting I gatherbecause it kind of went viral as far asvideos go as far as uh yeahthe video I had about um the video hadabout a million views between Tick Tockand Twitter in the first week and uh mywebsite crashed it had over threemillion Landings in a week and uh youknow people click it around and Bug itup my website for a little bit there butwe're back on now did it translate muchinto boost in in salesnot not enormously because I don't priorto the video going viral I didn't have ashopping cart on my website becauseeverything I produce is selling outlocally so I haven't really been chasingyou know it's it's a it's a chicken andegg sort of thing because toonce I scale production on the farm I'vegot to go and find out a place to moveit because it's time sensitive materialI can't just you know sit it on theshelf for years it's got to get outthere and get into people's freezes buton on the other hand when demand doesBoost production takes time like uhhard to finish breeding a cow and havinga finished animal to sells three yearsyou know after to turn a pig off to geta pig weiner in and finish it off andsell it into the markets about fourmonths so there's certain I'm scalingmeat chickens broilers they're calledand uh pigs pretty quick at the momentand I've invested a lot into cattle andsheep but they're just a slower burn Ijust can't make the market as fast it'sjust the way it is yeahum all right last one for you uh theBitcoin element when did you you knowcatch the Bitcoin bug go down the rabbithole andwell I mean we could discuss a lot aboutany element there but perhaps most uhinterestingly oryou know one of the elements of thiswhich I've discussed with other peopleyou know doing the regenerative farmingthing before is is just howuh ironically perhaps or surprisinglyyou know this digital protocol thatlives on the internet that you know younever really see touch or smell oranything like thatis very much in line with you know theprinciples of farming and soil and youknow uh and work and storing you knowthe proof of your work storing valueum and of course a lot ofchange in perspective often comes withunderstanding Bitcoin and it seems likethat perspective is also very conduciveto seeing the value in something likeregenerative agriculture so justwondering what what your rabbit holestory was and and how if at all uhyou've integrated it into what you'redoing or it influences your perspectivein terms of what you're doing it changesyour idea about the future of whatyou're doing floor is yours just tellthem tell me yeahthe new Bitcoin stuffwell like I guess most civilians I'veheard about Bitcoin I knew that it was aonline digital currency but I I probablyyears ago Googled it and couldn't figureout how to buy it within two or threeminutes and just you know Chase the nextbouncing ball and got on with it thenJerry and covered a friend of mine goton an exchange and started basically daytrading coins so he said come dothis with me and I like when I tell thisstory I can just hear all the bitcoinersroll on the horizon the background butwe've all got it everybody did it maneverybody did it so for me it was a bitof fun because we had uh we hadlockdowns all over the place you knowAustralia being probably the most lockeddown place in the world and um maybemaybe bar China anda lot of pressure across my businesseswith onerous compliance and Regulationand Audits and things and so I justjumped on one of these exchanges with myfriend and we're just sending each otherscreenshots of the trades and the pumpsand dumps and for me I didn't look at itas an investment I was it was literallygambling for me I think I threw in athousand bucks uh made some money onsome Lots I ended up getting out abouteven but along that process trying toeducate myself I realized that not allcurrencies were equal in theseMarketplace there were some that werejust absolute Ponzi schemes and therewere others that did profess some sortof uh value and I sort of thought youknow which ones the which one's the realone which one's the most legitimate outof all of thembut I always ended up getting bored withthe day trading I sucked out all my cashand I walked away from it and then a fewmonths later I had somebody called myButchery and say I want to I want tobook in a body of beef for processingand you've been recommended to me to doit I've yeahsorry my stud here is uh just seeingsomebody out the window come here bigboy and uh I'll show youoh boy sorry sorry for the people justlistening but I've got my standardschnauzers overlapping he's got amassive head big news gorgeous man aneasy people outside anywayback in the dayI've got a mini here next to me as wellbut my sister breeds Minnie's a businessI set up with her and then I sold her myportion and I imported these standardsfrom Croatia and I I breed and sellstandards now nice anyway uh this guysaid I've got a blind Club in Melbournewe raise our own beef on adjustment outof town and we want to get a process tostart selling it to our friends and usin our community I said yeah great andthen he said if I send you a list ofeveryone's orders can you pack theorders for us and now this is theabsolute worst part of the job for usbecause it's so uh laborious and andFarmers always haveum things sold and split into packs thatare almost completely impossible becausethey're just clueless as to how manyT-Bones a cow gives you so I said yeahlook I can do it for you so he sent mehis spreadsheet with everyone's ordersand there was a column so it would sayyou know Mark is getting 20 kilo mix boxwe're delivering it to him at hisaddress or he's picking it up from thisaddress and then there was a column witha paymentand I'd never seen anything like it inin you know 15 years of business andbeing self-employed it was it was umFiat Fiat Fiat honey Bitcoin BitcoinBitcoin Fiat and when I called him Isaid your order's ready it's on thetruck coming down to Melbourne I saidare you selling some of this meat forBitcoin and it didn't click with me atthe time because I wouldn't havedescribed myself as a bitcoiner butum it was aproof of work beef was what he calledhimself uh which was really you know Isaid he's selling some of this forBitcoin and I thought what a strangename andhe said yeah I am you know if you wantme to pay you for the process againBitcoin too and I said oh look not thistime maybe we'll talk about that in thefuture but I've got bills and you knowstuff I want to get on and I didn't havea wallet didn't even know what a walletwas and that guy John has basicallybrought me into the Australian beefinitiative which we just had Texas slimat our farm giving a uh we had a big funweekend the the inaugural Australianbeef initiative Summit with 100 peoplethere that was great cool cool that wasmy first intro I guess into Bitcoin andthen um John actually came up to one ofmy farm tours and met me and physicallyuh showed me how to get a wallet on myphone with me and sent me some SATs anduh gave me as a gift a uh a uhhard wallet what what type was it I gota couple now but he gave me one andreally just sort of mentored me throughthat process and motivated me to keepsort of digging deeper and to look intoit and um I I you know I'm I love it nowit's a part of our business we've justwe're just about to roll outfunctionality so people at our bike shopin our Cafe can buy coffees mealsbicycles services with SATs through anapp called vaultpay which was developedby an Aussie guyuh so we got a big window stickergetting printed up we've got this frontfacing our stores on one of the mainstreets of town so we've got thesewindows at about three and a half by oneand a half meters and I've got this bigBitcoin accepted here posts are about toget put on one of the main streets ofAlbury the busiest intersection inAlbury uh we accept it for ButcheryGoods Farm Goods uh our website's gonnahave uh SATs integration within the nextweek or two hopefully so people that arebuying our meat boxes or honey or pettreats or hats or whatever there's youknow limited we don't sell our wholecatalog on our website but it'scurrently expanding events we've gotwe've got a lot of events coming up overthe next 12 months including a QuantumHealth Summit with all these uh doctorsthat want to talk about light and coldbaths and diet and epigenetics is goingto be super nutrient dense that's inNovember we want to accept stats for allthat sort of stuff because I'm the sortof I'm not an investor I'm a businessmanso I don't want to buy my Bitcoin I wantto earn it yeah I I don't like it likewhen investing is fine everybody shoulddo a little bit of it some peopleprofessional investors that's great butfor me investing is acknowledging thatsomebody else is better going to giveyou a better return than what you can dofor yourselfand so I'm a little bit arrogant in thesense that like obviously there's athere's a million different companies Icould invest in and I'd probably createa better Roi than what I could do butI'm also giving up flexibility because Iall my businessesnot only are they generating me incomebut they're also contributing to mylifestyle uh my my security my my accessto different markets different peopledifferent connections so I'm verybullish on investing in myself and myown ecosystem my own infrastructure andI bought myself my own portable TimberMill so I don't have to go to thehardware store anymore I can just go outinto the public and build my own Timberoff trees that are falling down on myfarm that's the sort of thing that Ilike air quote investing my money intobut with the SATs I'm very uh excitedand having a great time acquiring andstackingthrough sales and earning my turnyeah I couldn't agree more with thatum I imagine thatthe only people paying in sats are thebitcoiners well I guess now you'reshipping across the country perhaps withthe with the new website but prior tothatum or even still even still it's justyou know the bitcoiners wanting a whackof meat and they're you know willing topay in SATs there are are many peopleavailing of that to this pointso at our last event the beef initiativeevent a few people got signed up and nowthey're wanting to use their uh walletto you know do transactions with mewhich is you know they'll fee atcustomers before then so that's excitingbut it's thethe bit the Bitcoin I guess uh optionhasn't taken any fee at trading awayfrom my business it's only added Bitcointrading to my business because there'speople out there that want to spend itand as soon as someone realizes that youcan do it you posted in that many signalgroups and telegram groups and Twitterfeeds and then they all come out of thewoodwork so I'm shipping a lot of meatevery week I'm down to Melbourne up toSydney across Canberra from people thatare just wanting to buy my meat uhspecifically primarily because I'maccepting SATs but then they do theresearch and they realize that theproduce is what they want for theirfamily as wellman that is that is so cool I mean andthat's the way it's supposed to be andthat's the way it's happening in manymany areas now especially with the addedyou know gasoline of the the beach in itthe beef initiative you know bringingthese people together and and creatingthese relationships uh I love it is isthe guy what would you say the guy thatfirst hit you up proof of work beef wasthat his name well it's he it wasactually it was actually proof of workhoney was what he was trading underbecause he's um he had beehives and thiswas his first Venture into beef Ibelieve he set up proof of work beef isanother company now but his name's JohnTiernan he's one of the directors of theAustralian beef initiative he's anawesome guy and like we just had thisevent with a hundred people and he gavea presentation presentation on bitcoin101 sent everyone in the crowd sat it'sgot them all there to download wallet ofSatoshi sent them all set in lifetime toshow him how easy it was and then heasked me to email all hundred people ablanket email with his private mobilenumber and private email addressencouraging them to call him for any andall Bitcoin help they need movingforward but the guy is just a uhabsolute Powerhouse to the you know forthe message and I I love I love whathe's doing for me uh where I'm at in myBitcoin journey is I'm just reallytrying to encourage you know everyone'sgot their own Journey nothing I don'tthink there's any wrong all right butI'm really trying to encourage peopleespecially local people here to um notjust stack and hold but to earn andspend because you know that's thefunction because one of them isinvestment to me and obviously store ofvalue you know set yourself up all thatstuff's great but one's investment andand um one's currency you know like youknow I think if if everyone that'sreally serious about Bitcoin justaccumulates as much as they can and holdon it the the economy is going to takelonger to get going so you know andwhether that means instead of justspending me two hundred dollars for youthat could just mean buying theequivalent in sets and then flicking theSATs over but you know so you're notactually losing your stockpile if youwant if if you want to sit on that andstack it but I I just think thatwe we need to see more of the actualtrading for goods and services if that'swhat we're wanting it if we're wantingmore people to accept it for goods andservices yeah yeah I couldn't agree moreand look I know there's you know capitalgains considerations and accountingconsiderations but you know generallyI don't know why you wouldn't spend ifyou have the opportunity because notonly not only could you just replace itbut that 200 you're holding in Fiatuh and spending on the beef it couldhave easily just been held in in Bitcoinright it's 200 it still wasn't inBitcoin one way or the other again itdepends on you know what your toleranceis for the volatility and all that kindof stuff but uh I totally agree you knowand I think a lot more people arebeginning touhwell let's put it this waypeople have begun it seems to reorienttheir life and so they huddle as much asthey can but for the things that havelet's say uh ascended their valuehierarchy the things that they deem tobe the most important and food andsustenance healthy food and sustenancethat is you know aligned with theirphilosophies or their ethics around itsproductiondefinitely seems to be one of the thingsthat people deem worthy of spending SATson and what I hope to see is that it'snot just like a parallel economy that'sa copy paste of of the Fiat economy butjust transacting in Bitcoin It'sactually an entirely different economybecause what's going to happen and Ithink you know beef and is the firstum Exemplar of thisis only the things that can compel orextract the SATs away from you are goingto be the ones are is are going to bethe things that people spend SATs onright and so it has to be extremely highquality extremely important extremelymeaningful whatever it is so whetherit's high quality beef and sustenancewhether it's really awesome art whetherit's really great causes that you wantto support like it's going to have to bein that upper strata of really awesome to get people to relinquish theirstats but what we're finding I think isif it does fall into that you know areaor category or elevation people arewilling to do it and you know so that'sit's so encouraging because you you windthe clock forward and so at first it'sbeef and sustenance and then it becomesall these different things and all youknow over the course of time you have aparallel economy that is just filledwith the most awesome you know andtransacting in a frictionless mannerborderless manner everyone can beinvolved you know and of course you havethe savings element of of continuing tohuddle your your excess or what you'renot spending on on the things that aremost meaningful to you and you know whatwhat could be better I mean this is whatwe're all working towards is is thattype ofcircumstance and market so it's it'sreally awesome to see that um it'sstarting with a product like the onethat you're selling and people likeyourself that are aligned with these youknow certain values and principles andexpress them through everything thatthey're doing I mean again this isalways howthis is always how I wanted it to panout and seeing that it is panning out inthat way uh is extremely encouraginglast one for you man and then I'll letyou go but what do you see as you knowthe future of of your firm you know itit sounds like it's doing extremely wellif that continues it's probably going tobe a very lucrative you know so-calledbusiness opportunity but what what moredo you see from it when you look outfive 10 15 years in the futurecool so like I said to you earlier we'renot big planners we don't have we don'thave timelines but we are dreamers youknow and there are there are things thatmy wife and I would love for our familyand love for our community so where weyou know when we're sitting down andletting a table uh talking about wherewe're headed uh we want to move on landand owner own a piece of land we don'thave to own heaps of land to do what wedo we just want enough space that we caninvest in some permanent infrastructurebecause everything I've got at themoment is mobile but if you want to dolike a red meat abattoir a small redmeat Avatar a lot more sense to haveconcrete on the ground so we want enoughland that we can have a family home somepermanent infrastructure there I'mtalking to a few doctors in Australiabut we would really love to have a bigHub on our farm so we would love theAvatar The Butchery the Tannery formaking leather goods uh the restaurantall to be on site I spend my whole lifedriving between businesses I want to getout of the car and into the pastureright we would love to have staffquartersum we're homeschoolers so some somefacilities to serve as homeschooling forus in our community because we dohomeschoolers share a lot of classes soeven though we're all individuallyresponsible for maintaining our child'sprogression we do get together and dojoint activities all the time and welove our church I've got this littledream in the back of my head of the uhthe little church on the on the top ofthe hill doubling up as the classroomfor all the homeschool kids to come anddo their uh arithmetic once a week orwhatever it might be and then we'd alsolove to have eco-tourism on our propertyso if we all can pay and have a farmstay and we're talking to these doctorsabout having a decentralized uh HealthRetreat so you can actually come to thefarm like we want to get intopreventative health so we don't want tobe a triage-based system or a pilldispensary we want people who go youknow what like we're not we're not uhwe're not dying we're not in in Mortalpain but we know that life could bebetter if we were healthier and we'regoing to go to this place where we canstay for a weekdo a detox do a heap of Education withall these different doctors ACCESS foodto shore up our food lines movingforward and actually get into adecentralized health system where theycan be given information and andum you know helping care that theywouldn't normally be guessing in astatus quo Health industry uh and andthat sort of and then obviously all theEnterprises need to scale around that sowe're breeding I've got about 60 cowsthat I'm breeding at the moment and ourwhole herd including carbs and steers isaround 100 at the moment I'm pushing asfast as I can to get to 500 cows I thinkto sustain a little abattoir on our farmand all the other overheads that's sortof where we need to be um so I'm I'mbreeding this amazing species of cowcalled enguni they're a South Africangenetic uh just incredible animals smallframed highly fertile disease resistantuh very maternal our very and they'vegot 80 different colored pods so whenyou when you want to evaluate to youranimal to respect the whole animal andcreate leather goods you've got you'vegot a big catalog of skus there which isexciting to me so you know it so on topof all of those infrastructures andcomplementary Enterprises That We'reDreaming about the whole Farm has toscale to reach that so in regenerativeagriculture there's a there's a largeportion of the market that romanticizesstaying micro because it's moreCommunity Based it's uh just you andyour neighbor it's getting out of bigbusiness and monopolies and all thesethings at a um deemed to be evil that'sfine I think we need more Farmers moresmall farmers is great because it givesyou know resiliency to certaincommunities and production types butthere is people in Sydney and there'speople in large Metro areas that need toSource through you and there needs to beproducers to to give it to them and myprimary objectives is to get animals outof sheds restore Landscapes and feedpeople food that's going to make themhealthier so we're bullish about scalingour Enterprise we're romanticizinggrowing bigger not romanticizing stayingsmaller and uh we have absolutely havegrowthum you know as what we're sort ofworking towards because the market needsit you know people need access to thisstuff Landscapes need restoring and it'sall well and good to say all the smallfarmers are going to do it but where aretheyuh you know there's a lot of landscapewe've got millions and millions of Acresaround the world that's beenum you know managed to not to thepotential so we're going to do as muchas we can to do our partwell that sounds awesome man and that'sa amazing dream and it sounds like umyou're kind of putting together acitadel sort of vision there you knowall the all the essential bits andpieces with with like-minded people thatuh can contribute to it support it Availof it in in many different ways I'm sureso it sounds like a phenomenal dream tobe working towards and thank you guys ifI couldanother 20 seconds but I've actually gotthis dream in Australia you can leasereally marginal land very cheap likescrub land off in the bush yeah uh verycheap and the but it's not veryproductive obviously the cattle of thebreeder cattle that I'm uh breeding isthrives in those events they're made forreally low fertility events which is oneof the reasons I've sidestepped intothemumI've got this little niggling dream inthe back of my head there's only 250 ofthese animals in the country purebredbecause they're quite new in the in theso we're just building up numbers butI've got this dream in the back of myhead of leasing uh you know 50 000 Acresof this marginal country towards CentralAustralia and putting a thousand andgoonie on it uh with the the Bitcoinlogo branded on their rump and having abig Bitcoin hurt I thought how cool ifyou want to own 20 cows or 50 cows or 10cows do crowdfunder herd and have thisBitcoin heard of these apocalyptic cowsout in the Aussie Bush I just think thatthat would be so fun so maybe that'llhappen in the next few years too yeahwell that sounds pretty awesome and I'msure you get a lot of support from theBitcoin crowd for something like thatwhether it be SATs or Word of Mouth youknow spreading the word or anything likethat I'm sure they'd be super into itum well man thanks for uh getting upearly in the morning for thisconversation it's been uh reallyenjoyable and lightning and you know Ilove love what you're doing I love theattitude you bring to it and uh yeah Iwish you nothing but success in thefuture and hopefully we can have anotherchat sometime maybea year 18 months and see where thingsare at thenawesome yeah John thanks for having meI've had a lot of fun all right brothertake caresee ya see yalet's do it Jacob how are youI'm doing well good morninggood morning thank you for um getting upand getting sorted at this early hour tohave this discussion I appreciate itvery muchyeah absolute pleasure I'll tell youwhat I've been getting up early lately Iused to sleep in a lot as a young man inthe last few weeks I've had a little bitof a Paradigm Shift you know thosecommas in your life through your JournalI've had a bit of a paradigm shift andI've been watching the sunrise the lastfew weeksat the back of the house and normallyone of my sons comes and sits them likewhile we do it and I'm feeling a millionbucks I like getting up early yeah wellthat sounds like a pretty magical momentI mean I think for for anything in lifethat requires uhwell either a departure from routine ora certain amount of discipline you needsomething inspiring that pulls youtoward it right it can't just be allpushed right you need something to pullyou and it sounds like a majestic sunsetwith your son on your lap is a prettynice you know thing to get you up andout of bed in the morningyeah it's great but you know anotherthing that helps keep that momentumgoing is just results I met a doctorfriend of mine and he said just get upand go outside and watch the sunrise youknow no glasses on uh you know thiswhole red light blue light Jack Cruisesort of stuff and um after after doingit for four days I've been waking up 15minutes before Sunrise without an alarmjust effortlessly for weeks now andthat's not a thing that would be I'm nota I'm not a big sleeper enterer becauseI'm busy uh but I'm alwayspurely getting out of bed on Willpowerprobably because I stay up too latereading and fighting with people onTwitter or whatever it is but uh no Imean I'm enjoying it it's it's good yeahwell I'm in your boat I mean II I've always relied on the the alarmeven when I was getting up at like youknow or especially when I was getting upat 5 30 or whatever to go work out inthe mornings but I I think I that's mynext thing I need to um try to weanmyself off the alarm you know for onebecause I mean it's just a more pleasantway of waking up you know you have thatthing that just usually it's an awfulsound and it you know you snooze it acouple times and it just seems likethat's a horrible way to get the daystarted you know you know like justnaturally waking up at a reasonable timeand then going on and going on aboutyour day seems like the way to do it soI think that'll be a good project for meto uh to start withum but just you know for everyone who'slistening and doesn't yet you know maybeknow much about you can you give us thebrief introduction into you know who youare and what you do and and we can findour way from thereyeah sure I uh it's always strange forme tointroduce myself a little bit I guessbecause if depending on how far back wego but when I introduce myselfI listen to myself and I go geez thatguy's full of crap because I've had areally varied uh I guess life since I'vesince I've left school so just I'll runthrough it pretty quick but I leftschool end of year 10. I was uh justturning 15 and I went and worked for myfather for four years in a CD DVD storemy family had a chain of record storescool uh I remember a custom oh it washeaps of fun I absolutely loved it andit wasn't really the type of Industrywhere you had rapport with customers itwas you know walk in I want a JohnnyCash album sell them Johnny Cash albumand they leave again and especially thedemographic that our store that I wasworking in was located there was a lotof pensionersum you know a lot of just older people ahigh level of I guess well welfarepeople with um disabilities all thesesorts of things that was just the suburbwe were in and I built up an amazingrapport with at an absolute slew ofcustomers to the point that I'd havesome customers come in and just go youknow what album am I am I getting thisweek and I said oh look I think you'dreally like this one 30 bucks 30 bucksfor a CD you know uh 16 17 years ago andthey just buy it and that wasn't reallynormal and I guess that's where my mypassion for sales and customer servicereally really started developing Iremember I had one a couple that used tocome in and they see my father they wereuhKatrina and Jacko were their namesand they wanted real obscure things andI think early on I mishandled atransaction and overcharged them orforgot to put something in the bag orwhatever it was and they they used tocome in and and just wait for Dad theydidn't want to be served by anyone elsethey just wait for my father and thenone day Dad couldn't find something hewas serving them and we're alwaysimporting obscure heavy metal things andEuropean films for them and while Dadwas searching for them you know I waslike teenager starting to get a bit morefamiliar on the internet than him and Iwas over on another website and he saidno I can't find it anyway and I said Ithink I've got it and I showed him thescream and we got it in for them andthen the next time they came in a fewdays later and this couple was spendingthree four hundred dollars a week withus so they were easily our biggestSpenders in a little record store thenext week they came in they stood thereand Dad saw them so he's come over toserve them and I'm standing on anothercomputer with another customer and theylooked at dad and I remember it sovividly dad goes radio you know how yougoing today how can help and they justshook their head and real curtly sort ofjab their finger over to me we want tosee him and I became their guy and wegot along so well and when we closed thestore because I remember LimeWire comingout and I downloaded a new ArcticMonkeys album in like 30 seconds flatand I'm saying that our business istoast there's no way the album wasn'teven released yet the album was set forrelease in three weeks or something youknow that was the writing on the walland we worked out our lease and closedthe store down and said bye to all ofour great customers but that was just inthe trenches Retail 101 seven days aweek we're doing 89 hours a week I didopens I did closes I did the banking andthis is all as a teenager so I had anabsolute blast there and then my parentsand Ipurchased a local bicycle store that wasfor sale because it wasn't doing verywelland we've had that store for over adecade now we ended up buying a block ofland and developing it putting a biggerbuilding on it so our bicycle storesabout 1200 meters uh Squarespace floorspace so I don't know how that umtranslates into feet but it's not asmall store we've got a cafe inside ofthe bike shop that runs seven days aweek and then a few years ago I took aninterest in farming so I've now starteduh direct to Market farming so we'reraising beef pork chicken lamb eggs gota few ancillary Enterprises like honeyand a fruit all sorts of strangedifferent things I had to buy my ownButchery because there was an instantbottleneck in production and no onelocally could sort of satisfy my needsall my wants in terms of how my animalswere being cut upso you know that's another whole beastand along the way I've done some strangethings I used to import guitars andflick them on eBay I used to buyhandmade tobacco pipes off uh producersall around the world and sell them on alittle website I had called pipes downunder these artists and I've got some onthe Shelf over here but you know some ofthese pipes holes selling were four orfive thousand dollars a piece beautifullittle one of a kind tobacco pipes likewhat like what your grandpa might havesmoked but uh reallyartistic and people would try to putcollection collections together fromcertain Styles certain periods certainproducers certain countries and I gotdeep in that world for a few years and Iended up getting out of that because Iwanted to focus on the bike shop for thefamilyyeah always got little side hustles Ibreed dogs as wellum holy man I like being busyit's funny you bring up the the pipething because my my price my most prizedpossession is basicallyum my grandfather smoked a pipe when hewas in the Navy and his pipe was like Idon't know if it was Navy issue but ithad Navy like uh symbols and stuff on itanyways when he died you know five tenyears ago and everyone was just kind offiguring out his estate and hisbelongings and stuff like that this cameup and they asked anyone if they wantedit and you know everyone said no becauseit's got a little chip on the mouthpieceand it's just kind of an old pipe but Itook it because you know one I I had atremendous relationship with him admirethe hell out of him for many differentreasons and there was so likeyou know a pipe is a very intimate thingright not not only because you know youhave it in your mouth all the time butyou're you know it's always in your handand you can see the the places on thepipe where the hand has kind of rubbedthe color away a little bit you can seethe bite marks in the thing and I justthought it was the coolest thing ever soI took it and you know again like I saidto this day uh it's one of my favoritethings that I had that I ownwell if he was the sort of gentlemanthat uh had it with him frequently itbecomes an extension of him yeah exactlyisn't it like it's so I remember sellingpeople pipes and and they're trying tobuy them online right and that somethingthat would come up was does it suit mebecause Aesthetics has a lot to do withit people wanted a pipe that would sitin there and it'd suit them and it'ssort of like a pair of sunglasses or ahat like quite often they don't suit youthe first time you put it on but onceyou've lived in it for a couple weeks itbecomes part of you like go and buy themost outrageous pair of sunnies you canafter a while the sunnies are you eventhough they're you know you got astar-shaped red frame sunnies and theylook ridiculous but after a while youknow your Bootsy Collins they're yoursunnies yeah well you could eat likeit's almost like it conforms to you abit and you conform to it and you knowit becomes part of your identity or orbirths another aspect of your identitythat previously wasn't given expressionor given you know given air or somethinglike that I totally agreeum all right so you you go through thatEnterprise you go back to uh thebicyclesand there's like we're talking like roadbikes and mountain bikes and that kindof stuff like a boutique sort of bikeshopso we really tried to angle to Mara andParr uh you know in just like a lot ofbusinesses I guess the lower end of themarket the cheaper bicycles have abigger margin percentage and uh thestock doesn't age as well the skill setfor staff needed to to sell it to workon it easier and I just saw that my oneof my big things in business is the pathof least resistance and that doesn'tmean uh be a wimp that doesn't meansteel like it doesn't mean any of thosethings it just means you know where isyour time best served meeting the marketwhere are you going to get the bestreturn for your effort which by proxymeans you're giving the best service sowe really focused on that Mum and Dadmarket and mountain biking sort ofnaturally grew alongside that that'sjust what our region wanted in toothwe've purchased the store in 2011 and in2013 I hosted an electric bike Expo sopeople could come and test drivedemonstrated models of electric bicyclesand there was only three suppliers inAustralia at the time who had electricbikes two were real cheap uh you knowjust slapped together quite like veryheavy I think one still had lead acidbatteries at that stage and then thethird one was gazelle like a beautifulhandmade Dutch bicycle and the wholeindustry laughed at me because I don'thave a cycling background you've got toimagine everyone in the cycling worldwho works in short stores and ownsstores all the Reps all the owners ofthe Distributors they're allprofessional cyclists the whole industryis so entrenched like it's this it's afull cottage industry and I don't have acycling background we just entered asMerchants a family of merchants and thewhole industry laughed at me for havinge-bikes and I persevered and I like tothink I sort of put a bit of a notch onthe on the belt with that one becausenow uh end of last year end of 22 theindustry did some surveying and electricbicycles contributing on average 40Revenue per storewow so I you know I I it's really easyto sort of get stuck in your ownPrejudice like if you're if you're aprofessional triathlete who's purchaseda bike shop by proxy you're going to beselling triathlete bicycles Triathlongear when the Market's telling you itwants ebike but you think e-bikes suckor they're a hack or they're cheatingand you don't care you're not thinkingabout the fact that your customers lovethem and they want them so we we'veactually one of the rules of my familyhas always been to buy businesses thatwe're not interested in so interestinglymy dad hates music he'd rather silenceor AM radio TalkBack radio but he boughta record store for the same reason so ifyou're into heavy metal you fill theShelf up with heavy metal records eventhough your local demographic wantscountry now you can cut through thosethings on like if you've got a.com forinstance it might make a lot more senseto Niche uh but if you're opening bricksand mortar retail like what we've alwaysdone we've always just tried to peel theblinkers off and service the market butthat's a complete contradiction to mycurrent mission on the farm which I'mvery passionate about well tell me howyou got into that so how do you go fromfrom bikes selling bikes to selling meatand operating a regenerative Farmsure well I'm married by uh wife in 142014 and then we we moved we actually uhpurchased the house together and wemoved in together the day after we gotmarried so both come from Christianfamilies quite traditionalum conservative background so we dideverything the right way and we moved inthe day after and we you know it was alittle while and I started you know yougot to home all of a sudden before thenI've been living out of my van I youknow I got my license I didn't want tomove out of house because I didn't wantto spend the money on a on a rental so Ijust drift around hanging out withfriends sleeping in the back of my vanwherever I was and then we moved in wehad a garden to tend to so I thought I'dput some veggies in and I'm a rabbitholder you know you get into interestinterested in something and I buy thebooks I get on YouTube I listen to thepodcast I get quite obsessive my wife'salways laughing you know what's the nextObsession going to be and I got rightinto organic gardening looking upno-till gardening all these differentways of maximizing your yield in termsof you know gross quality and uhquantity out of your small Urbanbackyard and I was justgoing down the rabbit hole on YouTubeand I came across a video by this famousAmerican Farmer called Joel saliton andthe thumbnail was clickbait was on theside of the you know suggested videosand it said this farmer buys land at 15an acre and I knew it was click bait butI clicked on it anyway and the the theID there was with 15 per acre worth ofinfrastructure Joel Sullivan claims thathe doubles his productivity thereforeit's the same as buying more lead and Ijust thought that was really interestingbecause my dad had 100 acres out of townand 100 acres in our area is a hobbyFarm like it's a place to put a coupleponies out the back and run some housechickens and no one's taking youseriously as a farmer and I I I becamereallyum snatched up by the Romanticism andtheumthe earnest sort of nature of the wayJoel saliton described farming like itreally appealed to me and I was on ahealth Journey at the same time lots ofallergy issues skin issues nasal issuesI've sort of been I wouldn't say a frailchild but just like constantly burdenedby little things niggling away at me andI was on a bit of a health Journey atthe same time so I said to Dad can Ilease the farm off you when I want tostart moving cows around and I want toget some chickens and if I can getenough chickens maybe I'll get an egglicense and I'll wholesale the eggs backto our Cafe in townand that just became that became it nowso now I leased 300 acres and I'mcurrently discussing to at least another200 more I don't own any Farmland uh andlike I said we've got you know I'veprobably got 100 cattle at the momentabout 70 years sheep thousand egg-layingchickens we're doing a few hundred meatbirds every month uh pigs we've gotrolling batches of Pigs we're sendingoff about a dozen Peaks to slaughterevery Fortnight and I've got a I've gota Butchery with two full-time butchersand we're selling all that everything iscuts of meat to the end consumer and ourFarmsit's it's sort of nothing like what ourcurrent mindset might be of atraditional Farm but if we go back intime and think about what a traditionalFarm might have been 200 years ago it'sprobably a lot more similar to thathaving all these different animals onthe one property and then everything'salways rotating so we're always tryingto observe natural systems uh cattlebeing migratory flocks of birds chasingmigratory uh ruminant herds all thesesorts of things we're trying to wrap allthese uhthings that we learn off nature togetherand and execute them on our farm thebest we can to step away from constantuses of pharmaceutical input sincesynthetic fertilizers which we've usednothing of since I started in 2019 we'venever drenched an animal like we'venever wormed an animal we don't useantibiotics we don't we sort ofcircumnavigate all these inputsuh a budgets relying on goodold-fashioned management with technologythings like electric fence and runningwater are important to usman I got so many questions but off thetop so you're in Australia you'reallowed to do all that not do the theantibiotics and not you know like youcan just run a farm how you like andsell what youwhat you produceit really depends on the the shortanswers uh yes I think I'm involved inso many different things like keeping upto date on on uh the legalist agendaskind of a but for example raw milk'sillegal in Canada right can you sell itoh that's that's good that's completelyContraband here but the differencebetween that and the other example yougave me is uh raw milk is an output andthe use of antibiotics as an input soI'd imagine that if you had a if you hada feedlot or a factory farm it might notbe a legal requirement to useantibiotics but you would have a duty ofcare in terms of code of conduct andAnimal Welfare uh to sort of to sort ofmaintain Health to a standard and it'llbe impossible in those environments todo that without these uh pharmaceuticalinputs so I've you know on our farm wehave really good outcomes so there'sthere's no pressure to rely on theseinputs right so so you said you leasing300 acres is 100 still from your familyand then 200 Acresadjacent from someone else or are theyin different areas so they're all indifferent areas at least two properties100 acres each of my parents and they'reabout an hour apart so uh during covertmy family bought a sort of like aholiday house weekend or about an hourout of town and that had 100 acres on itso I farmed cattle and pigs on thatproperty and then I've picked up another100 acres five minutes around the cornerfor me from a from a bitcoiner that Imeant to bed at a farm tour which waspretty cool and I'm talking to anotherproperty owner about an hour north sothe the distance that we're spreadingthe business apart is a challenge and itmakes management uh difficult and youknow a lot of complexity to manage butthe reality is that we can't findadjacent properties you know they don'texist because most of our neighbors havehorses and plenty of money and wouldrather you're not on their property atall you know it it doesn't sort ofthere's no benefit to them in thatequation because in my area your annualcost of leasing is about one percent ofthe value of the farmso land here is selling for aboutanywhere from ten to thirteen thousanddollars an acre and your annual cost ofleasing is around 120 to 150 dollars soyou know like on one hand why would youbuy but on the other hand this there isactually a fair bit of demand for thatlease Market as well because the valueis so good so we are spreading out we wedo intend on buying our own lands uhbecause we we need to have some morefixed infrastructure things like our ownabattoir I think it's only a matter oftime till we get pushed out of the localprocessing uh market for for a multitudeof reasons and you know just their ownefficiency and you know being one ofthem they're just not going to want todeal with small producers like meanymore and you know my wife and I wouldlove to live on some land we're livingin Suburbia here farming 300 acres I'vegot a I drive 10 minutes out to the farmevery morning I've got I'm looking outthe window here I've got six neighborstouching my house I want to get out ofhere right yeah I can relate to that sowhat was it like at the beginningbecause I mean I I take the point thatas Farms go this is perhaps still on apretty small scale but I mean forsomeone just effectively new to this andcoming in and uh being sold on theregenerative ranching or agricultureethos or philosophy uh and being and asyou say like it's you kind ofromanticize about it because everyone ornot everyone but a lot of peopleespecially bitcoiners imagine beingSovereign in that way right having landworking land having that connectionbeing able to uh support yourself withsustenance from it and doing it theright way et cetera et cetera so whatwas it like like at the beginning youknow how what was this the gap betweenhow you romanticized about it and thereality of being knee-deep andbasically uh and you know give me somethoughts and and what would theexperience was like in the early daysyeah sure look in the beginning I wasdoing uh all the chores by myself and itwasn't a full-time job because you knowright at the start uh maybe I had a fewhundred chickens and 20 cows and fourpigs and that was sort of the startingcrop and I was still working full-timein the bike shop so I'd I'd race out ofthe morning let the chickens out oftheir pan make sure they had foodrace into the block shot head outafterwards move the cows you know justchaos just um uh pandemonium and mystaff eventually in the bike shop uheventually approached me and said ohwe're going to take you off the rosterwhich when they first told me that I wasa little bit uh put off I was a littlebit offended because I thought well thisis my shop and and you're oversteppingit and those are things all sinking inmy head and you're making me feelinadequate like I'm not pulling myweight and and you know you'd be betteroff without me but then as theconversation went they said Jake youknow we've watched youum slave your guts out for the lastseven years you've got a son you've gota wife and you're really passionateabout this farming stuff like we justwant to free you up that you can chasethe things that you're involved in and Ithought you know what a beautiful thingand and the shops never run better sinceI got kicked out of the place so I wasrunning back and forward a lot and Itell you what you know theinfrastructure on the farm wasnon-existent and what I mean by that waswe just had the normal fences that Ibuilt when he bought the farm you knowin the early 2000s or whatever it wasand there was no irrigation so Icouldn't pump water to animals I had tocart water the number one rule everyonelistening who goes and buys a farm don'tcut water put your infrastructure infirst cutting water is a mugs game whatI mean by that is filling up buckets orbarrels and driving it to the animalslike it's an absolute nightmare it's thebiggest time pit you'll have and I wasdoing all these things that I taughtpeople not to do now but I wasabsolutely loving it because it wasfarming and that was what I wanted to doand I was really excited to be with mychickens and be with my cows and andwatch them and learn from them and andbe productive with them and so over itvery quickly I put labor on so now theFarm's got two full-time Farm hands andI've got two full-time butchers and I'mbasically off the chores on the farmunfortunately I'd like to be on thechores more than I am but the the levelwhere the farm business is at like Isort of float around my stores and feelpressure points and the current pressurepoint is uh inventory control and Orderpacking and sending the Australia issuch a big place and it's so difficultto do refrigerated Frozen Freight aroundthe country and we're not shippingenough produce yet to justify payingsomeone to do it so that's the pressurepoint that I'm investing in my time toscale at the moment but you know as Igot help on the farm I employed thisfarmer uh Michael he's still with methree years later we we gauge how tallthe trees are but he planted a fewthousand trees on the farm for us andevery now and then I want to know howold they are so I think about how oldhis first order is because he plantedthem just after she was born and it'sjust this really cool you know he'sbecome part of the farm uh it's so nicehaving a trusted hand like that aroundthe place but as help turned up and thenwe rolled out some really basicinfrastructure which took me months towrap my head around because I'm not ahandy guy I'm not a Mr Fixer-Upper uh Iremember employing a Sparky one day tocome and replace the extraction fan inour shower because I couldn't do it andI watched him do it and I was soembarrassed he just climbed up a steplater we've stood it out of the ceilingunplugged it out of the socket pluggedthe new one in from the hardware storeand clicked it in and I thought I didn'teven I didn't even attempt because I'mso not handy well I forced myself tobecome handy now through multipledemasculating emasculating events likethat but once we've got thisinfrastructure in I guess the point wasis that I'm trying to make is theinfrastructure took me months to wrap myhead around how to roll it out how toget a solar pump to suck out of a dam uhand Prime two kilometers of pipe underthe ground all these sorts of things andnow when we're leasing a block like thislast hundred acres that I leased fromthe on the Bitcoin around the corner werolled out infrastructure in two daysbecause we had a look at the farm wedownloaded a Google map got the pen andpaper out ordered the materials got itto live in just rolled it out and it waseasy peasy and you know I sort of feellike we've gone through those first fewyears of earning our stripes and andmuddling through being absolutelyclueless and now for like for mepersonally in our operation I watchother regenerative farmers in Australiaand around the worldget online every now and they don't havea whinge about how hard it is becausethe pigs keep getting out or how hard itis because foxes keep eating theirchickens and these aren't thingsthankfully that we seem to deal withvery often because I guess the thementality of our operation is if it ifsomething like that goes wrong that'sour fault and the systems aren't goodenough you just need to improve yoursystems and your infrastructure and Idon't want to be wasting my time chasingpigs off the highway and sitting out atnight time shooting foxes there thereare systems out there to manage thesethings there's infrastructure andmanagement and we're just aggressivelyproactive about those things because thethe ROI for putting pigs back into apaddock is horrendous as soon as a pigis out of its Paddock it's an absoluteliability it goes on the road it's likeit's like hitting a cow you know youjust can't have it and and I watchFarmers all over the place have theirpigs all over the countryside so youjust need to have that uh abundancemindset and not that poverty mindsetthat everything's too hard and just dothe workamenum so was it kind of what you wereexpecting you know just the last pointon on the the beginning of all this wasas you were doing all that initial workand making those mistakes and figuringout how to get your way throughwere youwere you happy about it was were youlike yes this is this was the rightdecision you know and it was satisfyingyou in the way that you thought it wouldyeah I'm I'm enjoying the farmingbusiness more probably than I thought Iwould I don't really uh look ahead toofar I'm not a massiveplanner I've never had two-yearFive-Year Plan so when I started doingthe farming on the property initially itwas just to feed my family and then Ithought well I'm producing an all rightamount here maybe I can wholesale to myCafe so I startedwholesaling everything at arm's lengthinto the Family Cafe which now almostexclusively uses our produce oreverything that we produce isum all those skus that exclusively saucefrom us like we don't grow rice so weimport ricebut I never had this big objective Iguess but the the further we go and themore it scales the more my my wife and Iare like this is us this is what we'redoing in the future you know instead ofthe family that was always lookingonline at the next business opportunityum to invest in a new business and turnit around uh we're pretty set now thatfarming's our thingyou know we were talking earlier aboutthe impact of putting glasses on and youknow they look weird at first but thenthey look normal because you adjust abit and it becomes normalizedhow has this new Ventress last lifestylechange you if at all you know you gofrom as you just said on the hunt for agood business operators of small retailbusinesses or small to medium-sizedretail businesses to now kind ofstepping into a farmer regenerativeRancher sort of identity how has thatchanged your personality how you seeyourself I mean obviously it's changedhow you see your future but I'm justcurious if it'sif if you identifying that way haschanged anything about how you think oract or anything like that100 it has you know when I was younger Iwould uh if if somebody made a commentabout uh veganism or or not eating meatI was the sort of teenager that would uhyou know someone knows at them and goI'm going to eat two pieces of bacon nowbecause because you're not going to haveany it's just that realum I guess arrogant borderlinedisrespect for animals and just beforewe started farming of watching a heap ofEX Avatar exposes and all this sort ofstuff and I've always loved animals eventhough it didn't manifest in my speechat that time but in high school Ithought if I was going to study foranything I wanted to be a vet but my dadsaid to me why do you want to be a vet Isaid I love animals he said oh so youwant to hang out with sick animals alldayand so that turned me off straight awayI thought that was quite a pragmaticconversation and the careers teacher wasvery upset that my dad had pulled meaway from uh the aspiration of highereducation it's so interesting to mebecause my careers teacher knew that Iwas thinking about being a vet in the umexercise of the class it wasn't anactual thing I was wanting to pursue butin the exercise if you had to what wouldyou when I say this because I loveanimals no one suggested be a farmerlike I think I think the stigma is maybe changing a little bit but it's it'snot this uh it's not thisvocation that people turn up to thesoccer match you know my son's going tobe a dentist oh my son's going to be apsychiatrist all my son's going to be afarmer like it just doesn't sort of holdthe same people that own land want theirchildren to get off the land to go getgood paying jobs in the city because thedrought's too hard right but it's it'sreally changed my attitude around foodand animals I'm on a massive welfareJourney I've always been a proponent ofwelfare and everything we do as a higherwelfare but my my thinking on whatwelfare actually is is evolving rapidlywell well welfare is is generallydiscussed in the tone ofkindness and outcomesso uh somebody would say oh you know uhmy dog has such a good life because I'vehad it all the time and bite chew toysyou know that would be an extension ofwelfare at homeuh whenuh the true toys that you can buy intown here are almost likeum there's these blueberry toothbrushesthat look like they're made out ofsynthetic plastic they're not they'rethey're edible materials but the fact isis that dogs are almost carnivores likethey're omnivores but the percentage ofmeat they're eating their diet is isextremely high most of the green matterthey would consume would be out ofum prey intestinal tracts and I look atthat now and I go well yeah your dog'shappy and it gets pets and you bitethese true toys but those two toysaren't really the right thing for thatdog that dog needs a bone and I know I'msort of uh splitting hairs here but anextension of that would be pigs don'tdeserve to be in sheds because they needwallows and dirt and and so I guess I'mI'm welfare for me is is getting awayfrom the outcomes because cage ofenvironments factory farms can sometimeshave really good outcomes because of howmedicated and controlled theenvironments are and it's also and thenit's trying to shift the Paradigm andlook at the animal in the context of itsexpression so like how does this animalexpress its nature in Wild it's a birdthat perches so why would we keep it ina cage without perches in it you knowit's a bird that's outside so I'mI'm going down a little bit of and tothe point that when I first startedfarming chickens I was against usinglights now a lot of farms use lightsthat come on a bit before the sunrise tostimulate the bird to get more eggs outof it and the farmers like me that areregenerative and we're holier than theyare and we do everything perfect on ourmicro little scale we're all telling allthe big boys how to suck eggs becausethe lights was unkind to the birdsbecause it was tricking them into moreeggs but the further you go down therabbit hole you realize that thegenetics of the chickens that we use onour Farms now are derived fromIndonesian jungle fowl birds that livedand evolved close to the equator thatare used to consistently long daylighthours and then we're putting them inplaces like South Australia orum you know northern Europe where thedaylight hours in Winter are a lotshorter and so my thing my Journey'sgone from stop modifying these birdsenvironments to trick them to now goingwell maybe we should be modifying theirenvironment a little bit to pay homageto their genetic base because that's thenatural expression of that bird in itsReal Environment does that make sensetotallyyeah so it's just it's just a journey soI guess my but then by by correlation tothat my attitudes around food and whatfood can do for your health human inputshumans natural environments the naturalExpressions you know we can observe whatwe've done for hundreds and thousands ofyears and derive that some of the thingsthat we're doing now uh might not be thebest for our health outcomesso that's been a massive you don't set ahole for us yeahand then the third thing probably askingabout what's changing my own Outlookwould be our environment my family'snever been greeny-based we've neverreally we've always thought uh peoplespoke too much and and you know becausewe you see Leonardo DiCaprio tellingeveryone to be green and then flyingaround into private jets and your pointof the hypocrisy and you go haha and formost for a lot of people out therethat's enough to sort of bow out of theconversation and go this is a waste oftimeum on a on a macro scale I'm notinterested in becoming aenvironments running around beating mydrums but just by farming on our smallacreage it's it's the feedback loop isso uh quickly provable about how you caneither degrade or improve a life a pieceof the environment in real time by yourmanagement practices your use of animalsso you know when people want to demonizecows saying they're bad for theenvironments well firstly like cows arethe environment so you're gonna you knowI think that's a really strange sort ofpremise that by proxy of like just beinga cow they're bad for the environmentbut there's no doubt that poormanagement of our places like feedlotsand factory farms are going to have anegative outcome on the environmentespecially the local environment you'regoing to have import feed export manureair quality all the soil and all theground is going to become Barren in thefeedlot but those animals can actuallyrestore it just as quick as they candegrade it if you manage them properlyand so I've become a real environmentalAdvocate because watch in my farm areflourish and how productive it's becomeand how efficient it's become because ofthat is motivating on on so many levelsan environmental level a balance sheetlevel uh work satisfaction in yourenvironment level it's uh it's it'smotivatingyeah I can only imagine I mean that'sthat's one of the things that's souh frustrating about the so-called greenor environmental movement I mean it'salways just the world is going to endgive the government more of your moneyand that that just seems to be theapproach rather than taking it on alocal level I mean I remember when I wasexcuse me like I don't know 20 years oldand I'd be hanging around with somefriends that you knowum feigned environmental Consciousnessor you know all else being equal theywould prefer towell you know they didn't they didn'twant to the the environment to bedestroyed and let's say they you knowthey believed in some of thecatastrophizing that's gone on and youknow fair enough nobody really knowsprecisely you know where we are andwhat's what the trajectory of things isbut it always was just deferring to thegovernment to put a tax on that and youknow make make this group of people dosomething or make that group of peoplenot do something or prohibit them fromdoing something rather than being likeno you you are an ecosystem and you arean impact on the ecosystem so step oneis to manage that right to manage howyou the degree to which you impactnegatively or destroy or pollute yourown environment and and your own bodybecause obviously they're intimatelyconnected so if you can start there thenBranch out from there and I you knowpeople like yourself I would say that'swhat you're doing you're you're carvingout a little space where you're going tosay I'm not going to try to fix theworld right off the batI'm going to take 100 acres 200 Acres300 acres and I'm going to see if I canmanage this properly such that I'm ableto get what I want out of it without ithaving a deleterious effect on theenvironment and actuallyopposite to that to actually regeneratewhat has been a somewhat depleted ordegraded environment and if everyone hadthat kind of mentality I feel like we'dresolve a lot of the issues and theanswer wouldn't have to be morecommunismyeah 100 this is like classic JordanPeterson clean your room sort of stuffright yeah you know like instead oftelling the government to uhum shut down all the coal power plantsand so Australia just exports its coalover to China instead of using it herelocally uh how about you go out educateyourself and buy your grass-fed andfinished beef direct from a farmerinstead of consuming feedlot beefbecause all of a sudden you've gone frompersonally contributing to the problemto contributing to this solution so Ilike to tell when I do my farm tours Ido free farm tours every month I like totell people that we buy our future likea lot of people say Jake why don't morefarmers do it like you I'm like wellit's expensive the way we do it in termsof management labor we actually havelower input costs and our leverage ofland capital is a lot better but ourLabor's right up there and laborrequires constant cash flow so it's abit more expensive to farm this way whydon't other farmers do it this waybecause they've got nowhere to selltheir produce and get a better return onit it all just gets sold into commoditymarkets but if more and more peoplestarted going we want to buy direct orFarmers that farm with integrity andtransparencyuh more farmers will be able to step upand meet the demands of the market soinstead of advocating for more Taxationand more governance people just need tovote with their dollar and buy theirfuturesyeah I totally agree with thatum and you know to the additional ironyorin absurdity of the situation isoftentimes the people that espouse thatview are the ones you know and I'm beingvery stereotypical here but in Starbuckson their iPhone you know being one ofthose white collar workers so detachedfrom the the very thing that they'reclaiming to be a representative of oradvocating for you know and this speaksto your point earlier where and I I grewup the same way you know like when Igrew up uh all of the things that youmight aspire to were for you knowbroadly speaking White Collar be anentrepreneur be a you know uh be apsychiatrist as you said a doctor alawyer you know accountant something inan office basically and something boringyeah exactly something boring in anoffice where you know you just want tokill yourself most of the time uh andfarming was was seen to be beneath youlike it's just why why would you ever dothat that's that's olden times that'speople that have no other options that'speople that are stupid you know and it'sand I think it's turning around fairlydramatically right now there's probablya number of reasons for that I mean oneis more and more people are appreciatingthe idea of sovereignty and they'resaying well if I want true sovereigntynot just like a limited sovereignty wellland and and being able to uh sustainyourself on the land is certainly a hugecomponent of that so I think it'sattractive for that reason but I alsothinkthe kind of the conceit or deceit of themodern Progressive vision and I you knowa lot of these words are highlypoliticized so I I'm sure many peopleare kind of interpreting themdifferently but I just mean like thatprogress is those white-collar jobs thatthat we were just alluding to I thinkpeople are starting to have a differentperspective on that be like you knowprogress can just as easily beuh you know going back to the land as itwere but doing things a little bit moredifferently leveraging modern technologyso you can build better infrastructureso that you can interface with thatecosystem and manage it better and getmore get more from it and have it uhenrich itself over time or you know bebecome more enriched over time and Ithink that idea is just becoming youknow more and more attractive to moreand more people especially bitcoinersum and before we move on to some ofthose uh other issues because of courseI got to ask you what your when Bitcoincame on the scene buthow hasI guess interfacing with nature to sucha intimate degreehow has that influenced well I mean Ithink you you said that you grew up in aa family of faith and faith is somethingyou know very important to you has thathad any influence they just seeing thosepatterns that you referenced before youknow seeing howhow uh how one little change can affectanother change in the ecosystem and howthe different feedback loops work andand how you can either do you knowdegrade and destruct or you can beconstructive with your managementpractices how has interfacing sointimately with you know nature broadlyuh impacted your philosophy your faithyour way of seeing the world if at allI guess it's given a lot moreperspective and Clarity around the factof the weight that our decisions carryand that's not just as a farmer butthat's a consumer alsoyou know Landscapes can so like I saidearlier can so quickly uh degraderimprove based on the management and theinputs of themthat you know the way we interact withit as a consumer has tangibleoutcomes now like I remember before Iwas interested in this space at all youexist in natureas though it's it's umdetachedfrom your own experience so like inNature's almost a space like you'rewalking around in it and it's it's anarea for you to exist in but you don'tthink about well I never certainlythought about how intertwined ourexistences were because just like cowsare natureyou know we are nature too and andbeing able to be on the farm and makelittle just little changes like how longthe cows are in that Paddock how manytrees you plant uh what you build thebridge out of uh how often you drive onthe road you know your Chickenmanagement and seeingknock-on effects that last years onyears based on those little decisionsit's uhit adds it adds gravity I think to theway that you you become more purposefulwith your it's like I've I've nevercared too much and this is going to besacrilege but a few years ago I got afew letters in the warning for puttingthe wrong rubbish in the wrong binbecause I just never cared too much I'mlike yeah I'll put a I put a recyclingbottle in the trash bin like sue me I'vegot a few letters and I said do it againwe won't pick up your bins for twomonths uh but now uh even though I can'ttie that you know the the waist going tothe tip I can't tie that directly to afunctional experience on the farmI'm very conscientious of the way Ihandle those little externalized outputsin my life now because I know what sortof knock-on effect it can have out thereand all those little one percents add upover the life of you know 80 90 yearsand and if everyone did that there'd bea large accumulative massive outcomewouldn't they yeah totally it must alsojust expand your world in a sensebecause again the stereotypical likeCity dweller so-called modern person youknow you have the cityscape and you havetransportation and you have online andmedia but being you mentioned earlierlike the the feedback loop or cycle isso so quick right you're constantlygetting feedback and you're constantlyable to see what happens when you changea certain input and it must be just sofascinating it's like just again mindexpansion is the word that comes to mindbecause you're you're witnessing andobserving and increasingly understandingkind of a whole new world right you'rejust you're seeing all the differentways that these animals and systems andplants work together how much they'rereliant on you know Cosmic forces ofweather and stuff like that and just howit it all gets shaped and then how youcan be you know a middleman or anintermediary somewhere there and justnudging things in this direction nudgingthings in that direction and seeing howthings rebalance and whether or notthat's what you're looking for andwhether or not that's what the land ornature is is willing to give up let'ssay it must be fascinatingit's really fascinating and watchingspecies of uh plants and animals comeback to the farm that we had never seenin the first sort of 15 years of usliving there just all these littlethings you know blow your mind and Iguess a good analogy would in terms ofthe relationship with the environmentand the ecosystem it'd be like goingfrom the passenger of a car to thedriver of a carlike you know you as as a consumer oryou know a civilian in the city you seethe birds there uh in around town andthe birds that are there are just thebirds that are there and you take it forgranted but if you become a driver andyou start putting a bit of feed out inyour backyard and you you modify theenvironment and you can attract morespecies of birds and all of a sudden yourealize like where we're not passengerswe're participating you know we are theenvironment and and that's it it'shumbling and it's motivating becauseit's sort of there's this motivationaspect of it that we've got all theopportunity to improve everything and wecare we've got the tools we know how todo it it's just a matter of factors ifwe want to do it but then on the otherhand parallel to that there's now thisduty of care like you can't unknow thisstuff so you have to go and live itmm-hmmis there a notion I mean I this isprobably kind of a silly question but isthere a notion of like Perfect Harmonybecause you know you're here you'reobserving things you notice when animalscome back you notice how things changehave you seen the documentaryum the biggest little farm I thinkthat's that's what it's called so youknow basically they started with Barrenland and you know they were gonna monocrop originally or I think you know theywanted to do something regen but thenthey they got advice from an old hand inin that world and ended up just you knowadding tons of different plants andfruit trees and animals of all differentkinds and when you know the uh animalInvaders or you know like came in andate half a crop or killed some of theiranimals they just they found a way toaccept a certain amount of you know thechaos of nature while also being able tobuild you know a thriving diverseecosystem and you know anytime you youhaveumyou have a system and you're noticingthat your inputs into it canharmonize it better can bring morebalance to it and can have it not onlybe more in Balance but even moreproductive with more balance does it notconjure up Notions of like well howharmonious could this system be likewhat is the the maximalmaximum harm like balance of Harmony andproduction that that is possible hereand you know there's broader ecosystemconstraints I suppose like you knowAustralia versus northern Europe versuswhatever but does it conjure up those isthat what you strive for when you'reattempting to continue to hone orperfect your craft herewell by proxy of just being involved inregenerative agriculture you know wedeliberately don't call ourselvessustainable agriculture because whywould you want to sustain the status quoquote like how mundane can you be it'sabout improving and regenerating andReviving restoring and you know what agreat film biggest little Farmers one ofthe yes we don't watch much TV there'smy TV behind me with a picture hungoverso the boys don't ask for it but wewatch it very sparingly that's one ofthe films that we like our children towatch because it's you know it'swholesome and it's um it's it's visuallyengaging and it's motivating and there'sfull of lessons uh you know they tookthem about seven years didn't it to sortof stop having plagueuh plagues on their farm that would justwipe out crops and and for everything toharmonize and balance outand you know it's definitely somethingthatwe haven't had plague events but I thinkbecause you know they got into umuh cropping like fruit production andstuff and vegetable and fruits harderthan animals let me tell you moving afew cows around the paddock is anabsolute piece of cake compared torunning a small Market Garden becausethese things they drink themselves theyeat themselves they've got their ownlegs to go where they need to go couldcompare the carrots and kale absolute uhbeautiful how elegant cattle farming isthe thing that I think about uh quite abit actually is that no one alive todayhasever met somebodywho's ever met somebody that's ever seena landscape in Full full bolt naturalstatus being highly productive and notdegraded by human intervention like youcan you can research um you go all theway back to the Romansand the Romans were cutting down uhabsolute masses of forestsall around their cities so that rivalarmies couldn't sneak up on them andthat ended up having ecosystem collapseand because all the forests were goneand then a few a few areas a few notableareas turned into lagoons because theecosystem would collapse and now they'dbasically formed into stagnant riparianareas which caused an explosion ofmosquito population which started wipingout all the cities with malariayou know that was thousands of years agolike we have you read you read about uhyou know the closest examples of ofpristine balanced ecosystems that we'dhave would be eitherum settled Australia or America you knowtwo and three hundred years agoyou read the books of the settlers whocame in these places you know they theytalk about the explorers that go throughthe Midwest of America and on Horsebackand the grass is so tall they can tieknots in the grass over the back of thehorse while they're sitting in thesaddle they can just grab the grass andlike to ex and they've got mobs ofmillions of Buffalo and wildebeestcoming through and these Landscapes areeasily supported and building fertilityI think the Midwest in America hadsomething like 30 foot deep in Topsoiland they're down to two foot now becauseit's all been mined out of the place sono one alive has ever met anyone who'smet someonethat understands what these ecosystemsare even meant to look like the bestClues we have are in old books and maybea few paintings like I love looking atold uh Explorer paintings of Australiabecause you can pick up there's a hillnear us called Big Ben and you can findwhen people were here a couple years agoand they painted Big Ben they didn'thave cameras and then you go and look atit today and you stand in front of itand they're not the same they're they'reso back when the indigenous peoples werelooking after it and we didn't have umfire trucks so if a fire started thatwas just a natural expression of thatlandscape and it wiped everything outyou'd have these big mountains with umtrees just spotted over at these big uhfully expressed three four hundred yeargum trees that just uh were like amosaic just scattered out over the hillnow because fire bad we put every fireout with a uh with a fire truck becausethey're a liability you can't see ablade of grass on these Hills they'recompletely choked out dense bush withyoung trees none of them look older than20 years old because they've allsuffocated each other and can't growlike I just don't think we can eventhat's sort of a bit of a tangent so Iknow it's not really what you ask but Idon't think we can even wrap our headaround what these Landscapes uhpotential expression is and you knowthat you could chalk that up to be somesort of sob story but I think it's it'sincredibly motivating because look athow productive I can be the last time Ispoke to my bank trying to get somemoney out of them they wanted myfinancials so I gave them the financialsout of the farm this was my 22figures 23 Financial year and there's noindustry to Benchmark me against becausethere's no industry that they have dataon that's mixed Enterprise stackedEnterprise like mine so the closestthing they benchmarked me on was beefproduction because all my neighbors arejust beef farmers and my biggest incomemyself is beef and out of my 100 Acrehobby Farm I was doing 26 times moredollars per meter squared than theindustry average around my areayou know and and to be that productivewhile using no synthetic inputs and nopoisons no fertilizer and having massesof grass compared to everyone around meit's so motivating already having thoseresults then thinking we haven't evenscratched the sidesof the potential production of ourLandscapes we don't even know how tophrase what that could potentially looklikeyeah well that's one of the things I wasgoing to ask you you know we talk abouttheseuh untouched Landscapes let's say like300 years ago midwest U.S or somethinglike thatand you know you as you say the topsoilhas come down a lot and the Bisonpopulation is has been decimated and allthat stuff but does it not I mean I gotto think that one of the exciting thingsnow is that you can takeyou know a large amount of knowledgeabout how to re rebalance orre-establish Harmony in these ecosystemssuch that over time they're buildingrather than degradingbut you can also you also have moderntechnology to assist you in that so youknow and I think to my mind the thingthat would be exciting about that is youmay be and we as a species or whateverlet's saymight be able to establish a type ofbetter is probably the wrong word butyou know like a better Harmony than hasever existed right because even in thatnow we're kind of comparing apples tooranges because in that untouched insome of those untouched Landscapesnobody was relying on them forsustenance you know and we have to be sowe have to impact our our ecosystems forthat reason but is it not exciting tothink like wow likewith all that we know and the technologywe have and we'll continue you know mostlikely to continue to have will we beable to do more with this land than hasever been done with it you know are wenot able toyou know like do something completelynovel with it you know for on the upsideon the good side and how exciting isthatabsolutely and that's why for me thefuture is not Bleak there's not thisdoomsday outcome the future is full ofuh possibilities you know if if a coweats the grass at the right time itimproves the landscape it sequesterscarbon it nutrient cycles that grass soit takes this grass that would normallystand there and oxidize turns it intomanure which gets eaten by the soil andand on your go when you've got these bigmigratory herds uh in the wild theseCycles might have been annual you knowthe animals might have come through andeaten that grass and done a lot of goodand then come back a year later whenthey're bouncing you know migrating backthe other direction they're what we knowabout the grasses in the landscapefunction now is in spring when thatgrass is growing really fast it's gotitself to a levelum it's it's repaired itself andrecovered and expressed itself to alevel where it might be ready forgrazing again in 10 or 15 days withoutnegatively uh impacting and on the flipside actually positive really impactingthe ecosystem but there's certain otherSeasons where it does need four or fivemonths in different Landscapes so wewe've got these tools now if you've gotan open mind and you do the research soI guess to your point we we can now withour management leverage systems thatwould take thousands of years Millenniato build that fertility and and we canmanipulate that and work those systemswithin the natural context andaccelerate it extremely aggressively soinstead of grazing that grass once ayear we can graze it eight times a yearand get eight times the amount of manureon the ground but if you've got to havethe right decision-making matrix it'simportant toyou know in in farming you don't want tostick to systems like you need systemsin in terms of uh what what time do youstart your shift when do you let thechickens out of the sheds in the morningthese sorts of things but if you saythings like uh we move our cattle to anew Paddockum every single day that's a rigidoperating system but the it's not movingthem to the new day that's actually thetrick it's how long you let that Paddockrecover before you come back and grazeit and that can't be systemized becausethe weather changes the amount ofanimals you're feeding changes the rainchanges all these all these your soilgets more fertile less fertile over timedepending on how you're managing it soit's aboutum it's really about forming thatrelationship with the environment you'reowning and having the decision-makingMatrix to be able to think about theseall these different moving parts and forus on our farm that's why it was soimportant to do a holistic managementcourse there's I don't know if you'veseen Alan Savory he did a very famousTed Talk a few years ago and talkedabout how he killed all the elephantsbecause he figured out elephants are badfor the environment and now it sees youknow greatest regret because you realizeit's not the cow it's the cow it wasn'tthe elephants degrading the environmentit was the fences trapping the elephantsmovements so he's written in a fantasticblueprint for decision makingcontext and actually you know looking atall the different moving parts and howto apply that onto your farm without itbeing a rigid system because the rigidsystems fail so the futures right therewe can absolutely leverage naturallandscape function to accelerate itsrepairing[Music]um going back to the bank meeting I'massuming with 26 times uh Revenue persquare meter is that what you saidat that stage it wasum probably be closer to 40 now so thebank gave you some money I'm guessingbased off those figuresyepum my question ispresumably that's a fairly what you'redoing and what others have doneought to be generating a fairly strongincentive or at least peaking theCuriosity of other Farmers because youknow and this will be different independing on where you are butpart of the reason we alluded to earlierwhyum farming was such a uninterestingcareer path when you and I were growingup and part of that although I'm morecognizant of it in later years soperhaps not too much a part of it but isthe the plight of farmers like uh youyou've heard many SOB stories or youknow you've heard how difficult it is tobe a farmer whether it's you know therising cost of inputs whether it befertilizer or you know energy inputs anduh you've heard about Shady practiceswith uh you know the monsantos of theworlduh you know you've the debt that farmershave to take on in order to keep thingsgoing and how inflation is is they'rehaving is making everything harder sopresumably people that are coming alongand doing what you're doing and sayingwell I figured out a way to be you knowway more profitable and good for theenvironment and you know less stressless inputs less subject to the themachinations of macroeconomics in termsof the cost of inputs so is that notgenerating you know a lot of interest inFarmers that previously were doing ityou know a different way mono crop bigfeed lot that kind of stuff and I I meanI think it has to be mentioned as wellwe'll break into this in a little bitbecause it's super interesting whatyou're doing but the Dynamics havechanged as well like 50 years ago youproduce something you sell to awholesaler and they or a distributor andthey they sell it right now with theinternet and with social media you cansell direct to Consumer and so you'reable to retain a lot of the profit thatotherwise or previously would have hadto have given up so all of these thingsare changing the dynamic uh or the theopportunities that are available toFarmers so are they not starting to lookover your fence and be like I want someof that I don't I don't want to besuffering it over in the way I've beendoing itit's really mixed you know I get a lotof young people that want to startfarming reaching out wanting informationhave a zoom call which I'm always happyto do uh a lot of the old-timersum although they're not wanting to rollit out because they've sort ofum you know they've done their farmingJourney but a lot of the older boys whomight be in their 70s and 80s that Imade at different events that I speak atand things are incredibly uhcomplementary and interested and saythings like I wish I thought of thissooner but the the my peers the farmerswho are out there inheriting broad AcreFarmsin their 30s and 40s and working wellnot even inheritance take that out of itbut are working and stewarding these bigfarms like America has guys around myage I generally get a bit more Flack offthem because to them it's allsensationalizedum it's all hobby it would never work atscale it's all a bit too romantic it'snot the real image of what farming is soit's a really uh mixed response and Ifind it really interesting that they'rereally young and the in the old peopleboth love it but it's it's that uh it'sthe workinggroup like the groups that's actually Iguess a little bit more in control ofwhat we're actually doing that most ofthem tend to see it as a little bit of ajoke I guess I I do think the way thatwe're doing thingsis is necessary and I think that there'sa lot more opportunity for young peopleto get into a stacked Enterprisedirect-to-consumer Farm compared totrying to get into a traditional farmingexperience but I wouldI would be remiss if I didn't sort ofput some sort of caveat on that and sayyou know no business is free and nobusiness is easy but people since I'vestarted only four years ago I've watcheda dozen local Farms trying to do what wedo young people on lease land or hobbyblocks start and finishstart online telling everyone howthey're going to fix the world sellingeggs selling pork whatever it might beand then within two or three years I'vealready given up because they didn'tmeet their expectation and it was uh toodifficult for them and I think one ofthe things where New farmers go wrongcoming into it is that they think theycan do it with no Capital behind themyou know whether you're whether you'rebuying or starting a bike shop a recordshop a restaurant an InvestmentPortfolioFarm businessyou know you you don't get value fornothing you know they're called Ponzischemes you've got to have somethingyou've got to buy your livestock you'vegot to Market you've got to haveinfrastructure to store your produce andto fence your animals in so you know Ithink I'm a little bit of an anomaly uhbased on on my tradection Traction inthe last four years with how quick we'vescaled from a you know kid who knewnothing about farming toum you know we'll easily crack a milliondollars Revenue uh this year but I'veinvested somewhere between four and fivehundred thousand dollars in the farmingbusinessas well to to purchase the the animalsand the infrastructure like I had to goand spend in you know over half of thatmoney that I just said I've invested isto purchase my Butchery and renovate itand stock it with equipment becausethere's no access to Market without itum so I thinkI wouldn't want to dissuade anyone fromdoing it but you've got to be realisticthat if you if you don't have the equityif you don't have the capital toSnowball the the farm as soon as you getinto it you've got to be willing totrade off that Equity with your laborwith your unpaid Sweat Equity and that'sgoing to make scaling longer isn't it itmight take you 10 years to get to wellwhat you could do in four years withhalf a million dollars might take you 10years if you've only got 100 Grand inthe bank to because you'll have tonaturally breed your animals up insteadof buying them in all these sorts ofthings and I think a lot of people seesmall scale stacked Enterprise low-costinfrastructure portable infrastructureall these things and they think they cando it on the smell of an oily rag uh butthen they never hit that scale they needto actually be able to afford to put afarm hand on so they're not working 80hours a week doing it all themselves andever seeing their familyI've never heard that expression beforesmell of an oily rag I like itum whatyeah I'm sure it is what would you saytobecause you know I suspect a lot ofpeople listening to thisyou know perhaps including myself atsome point but you know as we weresaying a lot a lot more people are beingum are finding thisway of life or at least this type ofEnterprise very compellingyou know what would you say to peoplethat are looking to start out obviouslyyou just said you know if you want toFast Track things you can if you haveCapital then you can deploy it and FastTrack things that way but for peoplethat maybe have less than Capital thanthat and can't get access to it or youknow want to hold on to their Bitcoinmore tightly or whatever the case may beif someone's just trying to getsomething started on a small scaleyou know is there anything that pops outthat you would um you know you wouldadvise them to make their 100 Journeyeasier and more successful and not beones like the the 10 you mentionedwell you've got to you've got toidentify what you actually want firstlike are you trying to start a viablefull-time business or are you justtrying to Homestead to build up somefood security for your family becausethey're they're different scenarios andthe way you're going to attack themdifferently but if you're just wantingto have enough of your family and maybesell some Surplus to community friendsand family you knowpeached canned peaches for SATs onTwitter every now and then or somethinglike that you need less land than youthink okay I laugh about my 100 acresbeing a hobby Farm but if you're afamily of four or five and you canscratch together two or three acres youcould absolutely it depends on climateyou know there's so many variables butI'm just going to go out there and saythat you could absolutely be uh themajority you you could be food securewith most of your foods like obviouslyif you're going to be wanting to eatmangoes and rice you're going to beimporting these Commodities fromappropriate climates go to the shoppingcenter to get them but on a few acresfor the average family you could raise abody of beef every year you could havehalf a dozen pigs you could have ahundred chickens like what if for meatand eggs and do all these things and Iwould just um encourage people that youcan't Google Experience like the famousJoel Salton says and just to get outthere in the trenches and do it now thisdoesn't mean being irresponsible andneglecting your animals there's there'sa there's a level of Duty of care andresponsibility that comes with acceptinglivestock onto your farm but I I knowand see so many people that have readall the books watched all the YouTubechannels gone to all the courses andthey're still planning three four yearslater they're still planning they've gotthe land they're on the land and they'rejust uh they've bound themselves upthey're their high level ofconscientiousness has just killed anypotential productivity that they mighthave been able to excrete so I wouldjust encourage people to actually getstarted you don't have to do it all atonce just get 20 chickens if you ifyou've got a Suburban I live on a 800meter block so it's like a two and ahalf thousand foot city block and I'veGot Friends in in town with the samesize blocks and they raise all theirmeat birds every year in their backyardstheir broilers doing daily moves onpasture you know like there's so muchpotential on smallum Landscapes so even if you're livingin a high-rise complex put some potsoutside and start growing some tomatoesand just start getting those Hands-Onexperiences uh as quick as possiblebecause they gain momentum and as youtalk to people about them it'll it'llbuild opportunities rightum you mentioned you had to purchase aButchery so there was an existingButcher and and you purchased it or youhad to start one up and and staff it orso when you when you want to sell directto Market in Australia you have to sendyour animals to a processing plant whichwe call an avatar that's where theanimal gets uh killed slaughtered andthen it gets delivered to a localbutcher so your local Mara and pad thatyou'll go to to buy your snags andScotch steak for dinner T-bone steak andthey'll cut it up for you put it in yourpackets and charge you a price for doingthat and I was using a great localbutcher who did a fantastic job for mebut his capacity was extremely small andso I started nosing around at multipledifferent butcherstrying to see if I could run you knowanimals through two or three differentlocal processes just became a nightmarebecause they're all busy running theirown shop they've all got differentequipment so all the meat would bepacked and labeled differently I'd haveno consistency in my product which wasimportant to me coming from a retailbackground on you everything needed tobe consistentuh timelines all over the place costingsare all over the place some of them area bit hot-headed and hard to deal withso I just thought my business is I wasso micro at that level and I was alreadyhitting these bottlenecks and I thoughtI just need to process myself so Ipurchased a freehold a building of aButchery business that had recently beenclosed that had been in town for over 70years and the the family that had at thePeter's family had sold the business theperson that bought the business wentbankrupt and so they liquidated all themachinery and then they sold theFreehold and I'm the one that bought theFreehold the timing worked really wellfor us and then we renovated it becausewe had to get it back up to code becauseit was a bit old and tired put all newequipment in it and started processingour own animals and in the beginning Ihad a butcher working two days a weekthis was only two years ago I had abutcher working two days a week in TheButchery and then two days a week in mybike shop building bikes and then a daya week on the farm driving the tractoraround slashing all the neighbors weedsand doing all sorts of different choresand he loved it he thought it was greatto have all these different thingsexperiences and now we've got twofull-time butchers and a part-timePacker doing our custom processing andwe also custom process for about 15other local farmers so other Farmersthat have also identified the challengein getting uh into the market with theirproduce can use us and because we don'trun a traditional front of house retailspace we're not getting distracted bythe phone ringing at the door buzzingwhich is out the back processing sowe're able to make sure thateverything's very consistent and timelyand packaged nice and neat so that'sbeen running for about two years nowthere's no way we could do our businesswithout it but the the next week link isthe abattoir because I've gone from fourlocal avatars servicing our needs to onein two yearsfor a range of for a range of reasonsit's not a they're not singling me outthey've stopped doing any custom Procustom slaughtering uh purely justbecause the economics of it are just apain in their backside dealing with allthese little micro producers that arealways late and send animals that aretoo big or too small they just don'twant to deal with it anymore so we needan abattoir in our supply chain uh thatwe can control just to have thatsovereignty over our own businessbecause of this sabatoire turns me offyou know we're standing in standingstill yeah but I guess I don't know didyou see what we've done with our retailspace onlineuh uh is I I saw your Tick Tock that hadyou know hundreds of thousands of viewsI want to hit on that in a second butbefore we doum have you you know gotten involved inin the butchering and that kind of stuffup to this point is that something thatyou if not you know will youno look I just I I bring in the laborfor that into my bike shop I can'trepair bikes in my Cafe I can't makecoffees I'm not I know a lot of businessowners like having their fingers on thepole to be able to do everything but tome that really slows progress and turnsyou into a micromanager and and it makesyou uh probably more open to hiringpeople that aren't as suitable for thejob because you can fill theirshortfalls you know one of my rules isto hire people better than me for thetask that they're being given why wouldI want to hire people worse than me Imight as well do it myself it just makesno sense so I deliberately shy away fromthose jobs and and it also makes youtreat your staff differently to a degreelike I've got great workplace cultureacross my businesses but if you knowthat you can't step in and do that man'sjob or that woman's job for them uhthere's there's a certain level ofmanagement that needs to come along withthat for the for the uh ying and theYang of the business to keep progressingso I'll go in there and I'll cry back anold label bags and all uh I'll slicesteaks in a pinch if I need to but interms of the proper technical butcheringI'm starting to figure out where certainthings come from a bit better I'm notinto these sorts of details on bigpicture you know a lot a lot of peoplejust obsess about all these littledetails and as long as the meat in thepacket is good quality I'm quite happyto just know as little as possible yeahso you might think this is a sillyquestionum and in a sense it you know it perhapsis but it's still something I thinkabout and uh you know for contact thequestion I'm going to ask you is youknow you said earlier you're an animallover and you used to be kind of uhdismissive of like you know the thestereotypical vegans refrain or concernor argument or whateverbut you know now part of your businessis yes absolutely raising animals in thebest possible environments and ensuringthat they have a good life and that kindof stuff then part of that is harvestingor killing animals and you know uh it'ssomething that I've had to think a lotabout as you know I eat a ton of meatbecause I think it's the best sustenancefor me and umyou know I won't go too deeply into youknow my own philosophy on it but it hasif nothing elseumand this again this may sound somewhatfunny but like if I'm going to uhsacrifice an animal's life for my ownsustenance it has impressed upon me acertain responsibility to make as bestuse of that sustenance that they'vegiven me as I possibly canyou know for lack of a better term bethe best that I can be or or lead a goodlife some you know something like thatmake it make that sacrifice asmeaningful as I possibly can and I'mjust wondering you know now that you'reup close and personal with thisuh these activities you're part of thisprocess uh how has that influenced if atall you'reyou know your mentality or yourperspective on that stuffyeah absolutely to to the same extent oftaking my own health more seriously wewe work extremely hard to use the wholeanimal nose to tail we want us we wantas smaller amount of the animal beingthrown out as possible which is alsobetter financially for us but not all ofit it's a great Roi struggling throughhow to figure out how to use these bitsbut we want to umpay respect to the you knowthe the yield that these animals havegiven us they've worked their wholelives and now we've taken their proteinthat we need for our own sustenance andit is about honoring that thatum sacrifice to use the word that youusedum I Ilike I can't eat factory farmed meat soif we go out to a restaurant and it'sit's caged pork and feedlot beef on themenu I'll eat I'll get the vegetarianoption and I'm basically Carnival like Idon't eat vegetables but I would rathereat vegetables than eat a pig that'sbeing confined into a concrete box itswhole life and and just being abused youknow part of the reason why I do what Ido is not only so my family can haveaccess to what we call Healing food butgreat quality food that makes us feelgreat but it's so that we can also eatit with a clean conscience knowing thatthat animal hasn't been violated like ithasn't been put in a jail cell its wholelife and I know that's hard for the thevegan population to wrap their headaround the reality is for me being onone end of the spectrum and most vegansbeing on the other end is if we actuallysat down and had a round tablediscussion I think that we would have 95of things in common uh we would we wouldagree that the the way we've raised alot of our animals stinks the way weprocess a lot of our animals thinks theenvironmental outcome of the way weraise our animals is no good like wewe'd agree on all these things I'm likewe're Partners in this but the one thingwe would disagree is um on the the finalPoint morality of being able to consumethese animals or not whether whetherit's somethingum appropriate or not but we actuallyand this is what you see acrossum society as a whole isn't it you seeyou see tribalism and sides pitchedagainst each other left versus right allthis sort of stuff when their reality isis that we all want the same things weall want to be healthy we all want to behappy we want our family protected wewant good quality food like very fewoutliers on these main things assist ourthinking process as to how we get therediffersyeah I totally agree with thatum last point on that but you know againas you said like the Vega the veganswould come back and say yeah it's greatthat you're giving them a better lifebut you're still taking the life at somepoint in the processum and you know I that's that point isprobably not reconcilable either youthink that you're uhyou know you have a kind of right orprivilege to do that or you don't doesdoes your faith impact your perspectiveon you know so-called dominion overanimals to do that or did you make upyour mind on on that absence you knowhaving to invokeuh maybe that's the wrong framing but Ithink you know what I'm getting at youknow you're yeah well you knowbeing raised in a Christian household webelieve that we will put here to Stewardthe Earth which isn't something thatwe've uh I I don't think it's somethingthat we can claim we're doingfantastically well at the animalum so you know trying our best toactually live that Joel saliton who Ikeep referencing he's he's the farm Gurufor me he wrote a book called TheMarvelous pigness of pigs and it'sbasically an open letter to the churchgoing all you guys think you'reChristians yet you sit by while we abusehis creation and Destroy his environmentin the process and you happily eat itbecause it's cheaper off the shelf youknow it's hypocrisyum so like my decision to Source uhbetter quality food wasn't a faith-baseddecision it was just a decision goinglook at that video of that Pig'sdisgusting environment of the way ofsuffering I don't want to be part of itit was you know it was it was a visualuh Game Changer but I Iyou know for me this this goes back tohuman welfare you know we're talkingabout animal welfare and you have toobserve the species in the context ofits natural environment well if we stepback over time and look at the speciesof humans in context to our naturalenvironment we ate meat almosteverywhere and in some places we onlyeat meat and of course there's someplaces on with very heavy vegetariandiets but it's just not the normexceptions you know you've got you'vegot ideals norms and exceptions and whywould we make our own personal decisionsbased onum exceptions that are there because ofsmall amounts of culture or smallergrants of geographical location you knowI think the norm is that we've eatenwe've eaten meat but the norm isprobably that we've eaten really goodhigh quality meat from Wild game andanimals that haven't had antibioticslike we've only had antibiotics inanimal agriculture since the 40s youknow so you know we're just uh I I alsothink there's a fantastic book calledDeep nutrition by Dr I think she'sAmerican and Dr Catherine Shanahan andit talks aboutepigenetics I don't know if you've comeacross epigenetics yeah and and for mewhen we againhow environment allows for theexpression of certain you know latentgenetic attributes basically yeah soyour environment and your in your dietwhich is a you know part of yourenvironment can turn basically turn offor turn on certain parts of your uhgenetic information but that's heritableso the the part where your health is atat the time of your breeding when youbreed with your partner is sort of thestarting block for your progeny so if ifyou want to be a if you want to masteryour personal health in the name ofanimalum care that's we could argue whetherthat's Noble in its own right but ifyou're doing that prior to breeding andyou're handing down that starting blockfor your future uh progeny I would saythat's really poor welfare on a holisticsense you know it's you're predisposingyour child to a range of enormouschallenges throughout its life and noneof this is Airy Fairy stuff you know youcould pick up a book and educateyourself so I thinklike I've I've got I've got familymembers that are vegans and they'reraising summer raising children infantchildren vegan and the other ones arenotyou know it's it's a real it's a realcognitive dissonance to sort of findyourself in as a as a principal veganand I don't want to become the veganBasher like I said I've got more incommon with them than I don't but it'sjust you know there's conversations tobe have around this and humans beingliving mammals in our environment sopart of the environment we have our ownwelfare and I don't believe that umyou know if if not for yourself whatabout for the kids you know like there'sthere might be just a better time andplace to be living theseum virtues yeah I agree with you and youknow sure we can skip on the the veganbashing but what we can probably do isis Bash on the standard Americanso-called diet you knowum and it's amazing that the the acronymis sad but you knownothing nothing is a better indictmentof howuh the sustenance so-called that thosepeople are consuming is being producedthen what its outcome is in in the theform and the health status of the peoplethat consume food produced in that wayand you know drawing broad brush Strokeshere again but I I think most peoplewouldn't find too much argument withthat doesn't result in what nearlyanybody would deem to be a healthystrong longevity oriented physique orhealth status when you eat food that'sbeen produced in that way so you I meanthat alone if we're just judging thelandscape and saying well what should weeat and how should the food that we eatbe producedyou look at someone who's eating youknow the mono crop the high fructosecorn syrup the you know the factoryfarmed all this kind of stuff and thenyou look at someone who's eating a dietyou know of the manner that the foodthat you produce and it's evident whichone is I mean it's extremely evidentwhich one isum most appropriate for for for athriving human being let's sayyeah absolutely and those thoseSupermarket diets where everything's youknow wheat and fructose corn syrup youknow not only does it have horribleeffects for human health on agenerational level but it's alsodisgusting for the environment if you ifyou look right exactly yeahum heavily medicated monocultureenvironments the interesting thing isand this is where I think it all startsto get into the weeds and this is wherelong-form discussion is really helpfularound these butcropping large-scale cropping and animalgrazing can both cause desertificationthey can both destroy landscapesbut in in with the current tools that wehave in front of us only one can rapidlyrestore the landscape and that's theruminant grazing if if managed properlyum so I don't know the the for thecropping areas around me when you drivethrough them yeah they look prettysometimes of the year because you've gotall these yellow flowers but you comeback a few months later after they'vejust finished burning it off to get ridof all the stubble and it sits in thepaddock and then they come through andthey poison it they put 14 tractorpasses over a crop nowby the time they prepare the ground seedit fertilize it come through and useherbicides and pesticides to clean upall the pressure on the crop to to sprayit to kill it at the end of the seasonso it all dies uniform and they don'tget late season bolting to actuallyHarvest it 14 times these tractors goover these films these fields you knowjust the um the input the input alone isincredibleit almost makes me think as you'resaying that thatum managing it with rumen and animalsproperly doing the regenerative approachis almost inevitable because the landwill give up the ghost you know in theway that it's currently being used andyou'll have to introduce the style offarming in order to rehabilitate it atsome pointum I know we're coming up on time so Ijust got two more things for you but uhone isI think you had you know two or threetwo or three hundred thousand views on atick tock slash Twitter video you putout recently and this was the retailexperience for the farming that you'vebeen doing and it was super coolbasically for anyone that hasn't seen ityou know you go you you you only havemembers and so each member gets a pincode to this retail location let's justsay it's on a normal like Retail Roadand uh you go in and there's all sortsof stuff you know Beef Pork eggstons of stuff it looks amazing and youjust fill up your cart and then you havean app on your phone Express checkout orsomething like that you scan the thebarcode on everything that you're takingthere's nobody in the store there's acouple cameras up in the ceilings youso you're you're relying on the membersto be honest in what they have in theircart they scan everything they pay thatway they walk out the door there's noPersonnel whatsoever and then at the endof the video you say thatyou've been doing this for two years Ithink you said and uh you've never hadum you know you've never had a lossbasically so nobody's ever screwed youwhich is amazingum but I thinkyou know and you you you vet as you saidyou vet the members they come and do afarm tour so there is a relationshipthere but I think the industry you're inand what I'm beginning to notice or havebeen noticing for a while in Bitcointhat I think our future and thevalue for value and what you're doing isobviously not the same and you knowthere's no additional marginal cost toDistributing information let's say butjust this notion of well people beingmore honorable people being more honestand being willing touh pay for for what they're receivingand not not needing to be policed youknow I think that's a an attribute ofthese these twouh Industries communities whatever youwant to call them that I suspect andhope we will see proliferate far more sothat there can be more of this style ofdoing business rather than you knowstarting from a a premise of extremedistrust and you know and and the kindof how that pollutes a relationshipbetween either individuals or you knowcustomer and andentrepreneur or orshop owner or whatever so yeah tell metell me if I missed anything and whatthat retail experience has been like andhow you came up with it and all thatstuffno that was a great recap look I Ididn't want to open a traditionalstorefront because you know one of thethings that lets us be so efficient anddisciplined out the back with ourprotein processing is that we don't havea door buzzer going off and we have toput tools down and go surf people andwith my with my production it there'sjust it makes no sense to throw anotherwage out the front to stand there andscan backs like I I'd have to be doing alot more than I am and it'd all have togo through there and it just wasn'twhere we were at so I initially decidedyou know we need to have a big meatvending machine and I couldn't findanything suitable and then I justsomehow came up with this I don't knowhow it popped into my head but basicallyit's like a 24-hour gym that you cansell service on using your phone as thehardware instead of having like a youknow if a fixed scanning device and thememberships aren't free like they theydon't cost anything but I do requestthat people come along to one of my farmtours which are free I do them monthlythey always book out you know within aday or two of Hosting them uh listingthem uh they don't cost anythingfinancially but I do request three tofour hours of your undivided attentionon a Sunday which is not easy to getfrom people you know it's a it's a it'sa long time to donate to walking arounda field and hearing about a guy rant andRave about each cows and obviously Iattract a certain clientele that areinterested in food Providence and animalwelfare and regenerative farming andcommunity building and all these thingsbut for me that's been a really greatfilter to onboard people who areactually serious about wanting to puttheir money where their mouth is and andbuying their future and then in turntrusting them within the facilitythere's a certain level of trust withthe facility but there's also a certainlevel of Big Brother you know uniquecode for Access high def camerasrecording Visual and audiofootage uh you know Rolling Stock takesjust to check things but like like Isaid earlier sure it's not a free thingno you know there's some disincentivesthere butyeah but but for the you know for themost part someone could just walk in andgrab a big box full and off they go butfor me it's always been you know worseeven if somebody breaks into the placewhich I've my other stores my bike shopmy Cafe they get broken into everycouple years and you sort of get alittle bit desensitized to it like it'sjust you don't take it personal after awhile it's just a cost of doing businessbut even if somebody walked in andloaded a couple boxes up with as muchmeat as they could possibly carry outlike what are we talking about 30 40kilos of meat maybe a thousand bucksworth of meat no it's just not the endof the world I saved that in a in fourdays worth of wages so the downside forme when I started was everyone was goingyou're going to get fleece you're goingto get fleece I'm like well maybe butI'll just cut my losses at a fewthousand dollars and I'll just reinventthe wheel and we'll have a go again butit's never it's never come to that pointyeah I saw it and what everyone thoughtit was pretty interesting I gatherbecause it kind of went viral as far asvideos go as far as uh yeahthe video I had about um the video hadabout a million views between Tick Tockand Twitter in the first week and uh mywebsite crashed it had over threemillion Landings in a week and uh youknow people click it around and Bug itup my website for a little bit there butwe're back on now did it translate muchinto boost in in salesnot not enormously because I don't priorto the video going viral I didn't have ashopping cart on my website becauseeverything I produce is selling outlocally so I haven't really been chasingyou know it's it's a it's a chicken andegg sort of thing because toonce I scale production on the farm I'vegot to go and find out a place to moveit because it's time sensitive materialI can't just you know sit it on theshelf for years it's got to get outthere and get into people's freezes buton on the other hand when demand doesBoost production takes time like uhhard to finish breeding a cow and havinga finished animal to sells three yearsyou know after to turn a pig off to geta pig weiner in and finish it off andsell it into the markets about fourmonths so there's certain I'm scalingmeat chickens broilers they're calledand uh pigs pretty quick at the momentand I've invested a lot into cattle andsheep but they're just a slower burn Ijust can't make the market as fast it'sjust the way it is yeahum all right last one for you uh theBitcoin element when did you you knowcatch the Bitcoin bug go down the rabbithole andwell I mean we could discuss a lot aboutany element there but perhaps most uhinterestingly oryou know one of the elements of thiswhich I've discussed with other peopleyou know doing the regenerative farmingthing before is is just howuh ironically perhaps or surprisinglyyou know this digital protocol thatlives on the internet that you know younever really see touch or smell oranything like thatis very much in line with you know theprinciples of farming and soil and youknow uh and work and storing you knowthe proof of your work storing valueum and of course a lot ofchange in perspective often comes withunderstanding Bitcoin and it seems likethat perspective is also very conduciveto seeing the value in something likeregenerative agriculture so justwondering what what your rabbit holestory was and and how if at all uhyou've integrated it into what you'redoing or it influences your perspectivein terms of what you're doing it changesyour idea about the future of whatyou're doing floor is yours just tellthem tell me yeahthe new Bitcoin stuffwell like I guess most civilians I'veheard about Bitcoin I knew that it was aonline digital currency but I I probablyyears ago Googled it and couldn't figureout how to buy it within two or threeminutes and just you know Chase the nextbouncing ball and got on with it thenJerry and covered a friend of mine goton an exchange and started basically daytrading coins so he said come dothis with me and I like when I tell thisstory I can just hear all the bitcoinersroll on the horizon the background butwe've all got it everybody did it maneverybody did it so for me it was a bitof fun because we had uh we hadlockdowns all over the place you knowAustralia being probably the most lockeddown place in the world and um maybemaybe bar China anda lot of pressure across my businesseswith onerous compliance and Regulationand Audits and things and so I justjumped on one of these exchanges with myfriend and we're just sending each otherscreenshots of the trades and the pumpsand dumps and for me I didn't look at itas an investment I was it was literallygambling for me I think I threw in athousand bucks uh made some money onsome Lots I ended up getting out abouteven but along that process trying toeducate myself I realized that not allcurrencies were equal in theseMarketplace there were some that werejust absolute Ponzi schemes and therewere others that did profess some sortof uh value and I sort of thought youknow which ones the which one's the realone which one's the most legitimate outof all of thembut I always ended up getting bored withthe day trading I sucked out all my cashand I walked away from it and then a fewmonths later I had somebody called myButchery and say I want to I want tobook in a body of beef for processingand you've been recommended to me to doit I've yeahsorry my stud here is uh just seeingsomebody out the window come here bigboy and uh I'll show youoh boy sorry sorry for the people justlistening but I've got my standardschnauzers overlapping he's got amassive head big news gorgeous man aneasy people outside anywayback in the dayI've got a mini here next to me as wellbut my sister breeds Minnie's a businessI set up with her and then I sold her myportion and I imported these standardsfrom Croatia and I I breed and sellstandards now nice anyway uh this guysaid I've got a blind Club in Melbournewe raise our own beef on adjustment outof town and we want to get a process tostart selling it to our friends and usin our community I said yeah great andthen he said if I send you a list ofeveryone's orders can you pack theorders for us and now this is theabsolute worst part of the job for usbecause it's so uh laborious and andFarmers always haveum things sold and split into packs thatare almost completely impossible becausethey're just clueless as to how manyT-Bones a cow gives you so I said yeahlook I can do it for you so he sent mehis spreadsheet with everyone's ordersand there was a column so it would sayyou know Mark is getting 20 kilo mix boxwe're delivering it to him at hisaddress or he's picking it up from thisaddress and then there was a column witha paymentand I'd never seen anything like it inin you know 15 years of business andbeing self-employed it was it was umFiat Fiat Fiat honey Bitcoin BitcoinBitcoin Fiat and when I called him Isaid your order's ready it's on thetruck coming down to Melbourne I saidare you selling some of this meat forBitcoin and it didn't click with me atthe time because I wouldn't havedescribed myself as a bitcoiner butum it was aproof of work beef was what he calledhimself uh which was really you know Isaid he's selling some of this forBitcoin and I thought what a strangename andhe said yeah I am you know if you wantme to pay you for the process againBitcoin too and I said oh look not thistime maybe we'll talk about that in thefuture but I've got bills and you knowstuff I want to get on and I didn't havea wallet didn't even know what a walletwas and that guy John has basicallybrought me into the Australian beefinitiative which we just had Texas slimat our farm giving a uh we had a big funweekend the the inaugural Australianbeef initiative Summit with 100 peoplethere that was great cool cool that wasmy first intro I guess into Bitcoin andthen um John actually came up to one ofmy farm tours and met me and physicallyuh showed me how to get a wallet on myphone with me and sent me some SATs anduh gave me as a gift a uh a uhhard wallet what what type was it I gota couple now but he gave me one andreally just sort of mentored me throughthat process and motivated me to keepsort of digging deeper and to look intoit and um I I you know I'm I love it nowit's a part of our business we've justwe're just about to roll outfunctionality so people at our bike shopin our Cafe can buy coffees mealsbicycles services with SATs through anapp called vaultpay which was developedby an Aussie guyuh so we got a big window stickergetting printed up we've got this frontfacing our stores on one of the mainstreets of town so we've got thesewindows at about three and a half by oneand a half meters and I've got this bigBitcoin accepted here posts are about toget put on one of the main streets ofAlbury the busiest intersection inAlbury uh we accept it for ButcheryGoods Farm Goods uh our website's gonnahave uh SATs integration within the nextweek or two hopefully so people that arebuying our meat boxes or honey or pettreats or hats or whatever there's youknow limited we don't sell our wholecatalog on our website but it'scurrently expanding events we've gotwe've got a lot of events coming up overthe next 12 months including a QuantumHealth Summit with all these uh doctorsthat want to talk about light and coldbaths and diet and epigenetics is goingto be super nutrient dense that's inNovember we want to accept stats for allthat sort of stuff because I'm the sortof I'm not an investor I'm a businessmanso I don't want to buy my Bitcoin I wantto earn it yeah I I don't like it likewhen investing is fine everybody shoulddo a little bit of it some peopleprofessional investors that's great butfor me investing is acknowledging thatsomebody else is better going to giveyou a better return than what you can dofor yourselfand so I'm a little bit arrogant in thesense that like obviously there's athere's a million different companies Icould invest in and I'd probably createa better Roi than what I could do butI'm also giving up flexibility because Iall my businessesnot only are they generating me incomebut they're also contributing to mylifestyle uh my my security my my accessto different markets different peopledifferent connections so I'm verybullish on investing in myself and myown ecosystem my own infrastructure andI bought myself my own portable TimberMill so I don't have to go to thehardware store anymore I can just go outinto the public and build my own Timberoff trees that are falling down on myfarm that's the sort of thing that Ilike air quote investing my money intobut with the SATs I'm very uh excitedand having a great time acquiring andstackingthrough sales and earning my turnyeah I couldn't agree more with thatum I imagine thatthe only people paying in sats are thebitcoiners well I guess now you'reshipping across the country perhaps withthe with the new website but prior tothatum or even still even still it's justyou know the bitcoiners wanting a whackof meat and they're you know willing topay in SATs there are are many peopleavailing of that to this pointso at our last event the beef initiativeevent a few people got signed up and nowthey're wanting to use their uh walletto you know do transactions with mewhich is you know they'll fee atcustomers before then so that's excitingbut it's thethe bit the Bitcoin I guess uh optionhasn't taken any fee at trading awayfrom my business it's only added Bitcointrading to my business because there'speople out there that want to spend itand as soon as someone realizes that youcan do it you posted in that many signalgroups and telegram groups and Twitterfeeds and then they all come out of thewoodwork so I'm shipping a lot of meatevery week I'm down to Melbourne up toSydney across Canberra from people thatare just wanting to buy my meat uhspecifically primarily because I'maccepting SATs but then they do theresearch and they realize that theproduce is what they want for theirfamily as wellman that is that is so cool I mean andthat's the way it's supposed to be andthat's the way it's happening in manymany areas now especially with the addedyou know gasoline of the the beach in itthe beef initiative you know bringingthese people together and and creatingthese relationships uh I love it is isthe guy what would you say the guy thatfirst hit you up proof of work beef wasthat his name well it's he it wasactually it was actually proof of workhoney was what he was trading underbecause he's um he had beehives and thiswas his first Venture into beef Ibelieve he set up proof of work beef isanother company now but his name's JohnTiernan he's one of the directors of theAustralian beef initiative he's anawesome guy and like we just had thisevent with a hundred people and he gavea presentation presentation on bitcoin101 sent everyone in the crowd sat it'sgot them all there to download wallet ofSatoshi sent them all set in lifetime toshow him how easy it was and then heasked me to email all hundred people ablanket email with his private mobilenumber and private email addressencouraging them to call him for any andall Bitcoin help they need movingforward but the guy is just a uhabsolute Powerhouse to the you know forthe message and I I love I love whathe's doing for me uh where I'm at in myBitcoin journey is I'm just reallytrying to encourage you know everyone'sgot their own Journey nothing I don'tthink there's any wrong all right butI'm really trying to encourage peopleespecially local people here to um notjust stack and hold but to earn andspend because you know that's thefunction because one of them isinvestment to me and obviously store ofvalue you know set yourself up all thatstuff's great but one's investment andand um one's currency you know like youknow I think if if everyone that'sreally serious about Bitcoin justaccumulates as much as they can and holdon it the the economy is going to takelonger to get going so you know andwhether that means instead of justspending me two hundred dollars for youthat could just mean buying theequivalent in sets and then flicking theSATs over but you know so you're notactually losing your stockpile if youwant if if you want to sit on that andstack it but I I just think thatwe we need to see more of the actualtrading for goods and services if that'swhat we're wanting it if we're wantingmore people to accept it for goods andservices yeah yeah I couldn't agree moreand look I know there's you know capitalgains considerations and accountingconsiderations but you know generallyI don't know why you wouldn't spend ifyou have the opportunity because notonly not only could you just replace itbut that 200 you're holding in Fiatuh and spending on the beef it couldhave easily just been held in in Bitcoinright it's 200 it still wasn't inBitcoin one way or the other again itdepends on you know what your toleranceis for the volatility and all that kindof stuff but uh I totally agree you knowand I think a lot more people arebeginning touhwell let's put it this waypeople have begun it seems to reorienttheir life and so they huddle as much asthey can but for the things that havelet's say uh ascended their valuehierarchy the things that they deem tobe the most important and food andsustenance healthy food and sustenancethat is you know aligned with theirphilosophies or their ethics around itsproductiondefinitely seems to be one of the thingsthat people deem worthy of spending SATson and what I hope to see is that it'snot just like a parallel economy that'sa copy paste of of the Fiat economy butjust transacting in Bitcoin It'sactually an entirely different economybecause what's going to happen and Ithink you know beef and is the firstum Exemplar of thisis only the things that can compel orextract the SATs away from you are goingto be the ones are is are going to bethe things that people spend SATs onright and so it has to be extremely highquality extremely important extremelymeaningful whatever it is so whetherit's high quality beef and sustenancewhether it's really awesome art whetherit's really great causes that you wantto support like it's going to have to bein that upper strata of really awesome to get people to relinquish theirstats but what we're finding I think isif it does fall into that you know areaor category or elevation people arewilling to do it and you know so that'sit's so encouraging because you you windthe clock forward and so at first it'sbeef and sustenance and then it becomesall these different things and all youknow over the course of time you have aparallel economy that is just filledwith the most awesome you know andtransacting in a frictionless mannerborderless manner everyone can beinvolved you know and of course you havethe savings element of of continuing tohuddle your your excess or what you'renot spending on on the things that aremost meaningful to you and you know whatwhat could be better I mean this is whatwe're all working towards is is thattype ofcircumstance and market so it's it'sreally awesome to see that um it'sstarting with a product like the onethat you're selling and people likeyourself that are aligned with these youknow certain values and principles andexpress them through everything thatthey're doing I mean again this isalways howthis is always how I wanted it to panout and seeing that it is panning out inthat way uh is extremely encouraginglast one for you man and then I'll letyou go but what do you see as you knowthe future of of your firm you know itit sounds like it's doing extremely wellif that continues it's probably going tobe a very lucrative you know so-calledbusiness opportunity but what what moredo you see from it when you look outfive 10 15 years in the futurecool so like I said to you earlier we'renot big planners we don't have we don'thave timelines but we are dreamers youknow and there are there are things thatmy wife and I would love for our familyand love for our community so where weyou know when we're sitting down andletting a table uh talking about wherewe're headed uh we want to move on landand owner own a piece of land we don'thave to own heaps of land to do what wedo we just want enough space that we caninvest in some permanent infrastructurebecause everything I've got at themoment is mobile but if you want to dolike a red meat abattoir a small redmeat Avatar a lot more sense to haveconcrete on the ground so we want enoughland that we can have a family home somepermanent infrastructure there I'mtalking to a few doctors in Australiabut we would really love to have a bigHub on our farm so we would love theAvatar The Butchery the Tannery formaking leather goods uh the restaurantall to be on site I spend my whole lifedriving between businesses I want to getout of the car and into the pastureright we would love to have staffquartersum we're homeschoolers so some somefacilities to serve as homeschooling forus in our community because we dohomeschoolers share a lot of classes soeven though we're all individuallyresponsible for maintaining our child'sprogression we do get together and dojoint activities all the time and welove our church I've got this littledream in the back of my head of the uhthe little church on the on the top ofthe hill doubling up as the classroomfor all the homeschool kids to come anddo their uh arithmetic once a week orwhatever it might be and then we'd alsolove to have eco-tourism on our propertyso if we all can pay and have a farmstay and we're talking to these doctorsabout having a decentralized uh HealthRetreat so you can actually come to thefarm like we want to get intopreventative health so we don't want tobe a triage-based system or a pilldispensary we want people who go youknow what like we're not we're not uhwe're not dying we're not in in Mortalpain but we know that life could bebetter if we were healthier and we'regoing to go to this place where we canstay for a weekdo a detox do a heap of Education withall these different doctors ACCESS foodto shore up our food lines movingforward and actually get into adecentralized health system where theycan be given information and andum you know helping care that theywouldn't normally be guessing in astatus quo Health industry uh and andthat sort of and then obviously all theEnterprises need to scale around that sowe're breeding I've got about 60 cowsthat I'm breeding at the moment and ourwhole herd including carbs and steers isaround 100 at the moment I'm pushing asfast as I can to get to 500 cows I thinkto sustain a little abattoir on our farmand all the other overheads that's sortof where we need to be um so I'm I'mbreeding this amazing species of cowcalled enguni they're a South Africangenetic uh just incredible animals smallframed highly fertile disease resistantuh very maternal our very and they'vegot 80 different colored pods so whenyou when you want to evaluate to youranimal to respect the whole animal andcreate leather goods you've got you'vegot a big catalog of skus there which isexciting to me so you know it so on topof all of those infrastructures andcomplementary Enterprises That We'reDreaming about the whole Farm has toscale to reach that so in regenerativeagriculture there's a there's a largeportion of the market that romanticizesstaying micro because it's moreCommunity Based it's uh just you andyour neighbor it's getting out of bigbusiness and monopolies and all thesethings at a um deemed to be evil that'sfine I think we need more Farmers moresmall farmers is great because it givesyou know resiliency to certaincommunities and production types butthere is people in Sydney and there'speople in large Metro areas that need toSource through you and there needs to beproducers to to give it to them and myprimary objectives is to get animals outof sheds restore Landscapes and feedpeople food that's going to make themhealthier so we're bullish about scalingour Enterprise we're romanticizinggrowing bigger not romanticizing stayingsmaller and uh we have absolutely havegrowthum you know as what we're sort ofworking towards because the market needsit you know people need access to thisstuff Landscapes need restoring and it'sall well and good to say all the smallfarmers are going to do it but where aretheyuh you know there's a lot of landscapewe've got millions and millions of Acresaround the world that's beenum you know managed to not to thepotential so we're going to do as muchas we can to do our partwell that sounds awesome man and that'sa amazing dream and it sounds like umyou're kind of putting together acitadel sort of vision there you knowall the all the essential bits andpieces with with like-minded people thatuh can contribute to it support it Availof it in in many different ways I'm sureso it sounds like a phenomenal dream tobe working towards and thank you guys ifI couldanother 20 seconds but I've actually gotthis dream in Australia you can leasereally marginal land very cheap likescrub land off in the bush yeah uh verycheap and the but it's not veryproductive obviously the cattle of thebreeder cattle that I'm uh breeding isthrives in those events they're made forreally low fertility events which is oneof the reasons I've sidestepped intothemumI've got this little niggling dream inthe back of my head there's only 250 ofthese animals in the country purebredbecause they're quite new in the in theso we're just building up numbers butI've got this dream in the back of myhead of leasing uh you know 50 000 Acresof this marginal country towards CentralAustralia and putting a thousand andgoonie on it uh with the the Bitcoinlogo branded on their rump and having abig Bitcoin hurt I thought how cool ifyou want to own 20 cows or 50 cows or 10cows do crowdfunder herd and have thisBitcoin heard of these apocalyptic cowsout in the Aussie Bush I just think thatthat would be so fun so maybe that'llhappen in the next few years too yeahwell that sounds pretty awesome and I'msure you get a lot of support from theBitcoin crowd for something like thatwhether it be SATs or Word of Mouth youknow spreading the word or anything likethat I'm sure they'd be super into itum well man thanks for uh getting upearly in the morning for thisconversation it's been uh reallyenjoyable and lightning and you know Ilove love what you're doing I love theattitude you bring to it and uh yeah Iwish you nothing but success in thefuture and hopefully we can have anotherchat sometime maybea year 18 months and see where thingsare at thenawesome yeah John thanks for having meI've had a lot of fun all right
