them out linksare down below let's dive into thetutorialso here we are with sideswap justfreshly downloaded from the google playstoreand we're greeted with two options whichare createa new wallet or import a wallet so ifyou previously had a liquid wallet youcould just hit importand type in your seed phrase or yourbackup phrase hereand be able to access it but we're goingto be starting from scratch so i'm goingto hitcreate new wallet now at this point ofcourse we're greeted with some terms andconditionsall good and i'm going to hit agree atthis point do youwish to activate biometricauthentication i'm going to say yesand for me it's just a face scando you wish to back up your wallet thisis a good thing to getout of the way right away this will bebasically a backup of the keys to yourmoney so treat it as such it's going tobe a series of words you're going towrite them down and keep them safeso i'm going to hit yes i'm going tohave them show up right thereand this is a 12 word recovery phraseyou've got to keep this saved just likewith a regular bitcoin walletand i'm gonna write these down and thenwe're gonna answer some skill testingquestions within the wallet to make surewe've done soso we'll be back in just a momentnow it is worth mentioning that on paperis not always the bestbest method of backing up your walleti've heard some horror stories of peoplejustaccidentally throwing it out or you knowwater damage fire damage all susceptibleto that when you have your seed phraseon paperso if you want some additional securityand peace of mindyou can pick up something like the billfoddle which is a solid steel platewith little metal tiles that you slidein to back up your seed phrasethis is personally how i back up all ofmy wallets especially if there's goingto be ameaningful amount of funds in them soi'll have a link for this down belowif that sounds appealing to you butanyways let's jump back inhaving written down my words i'm goingto go ahead and i'm going to hit confirmmy wordsand it's gonna ask me a series of themhey whichis word number one word number six tenand twelveand i just tap on the corresponding oneso i'm just gonna hitjump and modeland alwaysand measure and confirm all goodand we have officially set up the walletso let's take a lookat the interface and what's in front ofuspretty basic here we've got receive andpay soreceive and send more or less there's ascan button so you can scan qr codes ifsomebody's in front of you with aliquid wallet if you go down to thebottom you have a few tabs there you canclick on accountsthis will show you any liquid assetsthat you may want to deal withright now they have a limited selectionbut i imagine that will grow over timefor relevant onesif you want to add or remove you can tapin the top rightand there are little toggle switches toturn these guys on and off i'll leavetether on for demo purposes laterand then finally there is a swap buttonand this is where you wouldswap between liquid bitcoin and otherliquid assetsor where you would peg in and out ofliquid bitcoin from regular bitcoin andwe'll get into how to do thatmomentarilybut now we've got a nice overview ofwhat is within the app as far assettings go when you hit settings youcan go back and see your recovery phraseand then you can turn on and offbiometric protection and you can deletethe wallet if you no longer want to usethis onewhich of course i'll do after this videobecause you guys have seen the full seedphrasefor it so let's first talk about gettingyour handson liquid bitcoin there are twodifferent ways to do thisyou can just trade regular bitcoinfor a liquid bitcoin and you can do thatat a variety of exchanges you can dothat via something likesideshift.ai which is a website thatallows you to swap coinsso you can do it a variety of differentwayshowever liquid bitcoin are actuallycreated through a process calledpegging in and you can actually do thatvia side swap hereso it's up to you which way you want toget your hands on liquid bitcoin buti'll show you what's available in theapp herewhen you hit the swap button down in thebottom rightyou're taken to swapping between liquidand other liquid assetsbut there's a little toggle up top andyou can tap onpeg in peg out and this allows you toswapregular bitcoin for liquid bitcoin thereis a conversion rate although it's veryminimal it costspoint zero one or sorry point onepercentis the cost of a conversion so reallyreally minimalbut the way it works is when you hit peginyou're presented with a regular bitcoinqr codeand an address that you can copy and youcan sendbitcoin to that address and depending onthe amount you send if it's a smallamount it will betwo confirmations on the network beforeit is swapped for liquid bitcoin if it'sa larger amountum then it can be up to 102confirmations and the reason for that isthey want to be absolutely surethat your bitcoin transaction isconfirmedand in custody among the federationbeforeissuing a token that representsthat bitcoin so they want to maintainthat one-to-one peg and that's kind ofthe best way to do it for larger amountsso that there's no funny business goingon in the backgroundso again all you would do here is youwould take thisaddress you would go to a regularbitcoin wallet perhaps something likeblue wallet here you could hit send youcould paste in the address that youcopiedand then send any amount of bitcoin thatyou like to that addressin order to have your liquid bitcoinsent back to your walletwhich would be going to the address thatis listed at the bottom thereso basically you're just sending bitcoinhere and waiting forenough confirmations to be issued yourliquidor lbtc now on the other side of thatsame thing if i go back to swap we're onthe peg and peg outyou will be able to do the opposite ofthatas soon as they are issuedtheir key and there was a warning onthis but i was playing around before butit'll be a pop-upwhen it's not active um the liquidfederation is in the process ofoff uh authorizing side swap to do pegouts okay and so this is aprocess that may take some time but sameideaapplies when you want to swap yourliquid bitcoin for bitcoinyou can do that through any federationmember and pegout and the way it works again there's aconversion rate in this case it's 0.25percent so againa quarter of a percent pretty minimalandall you do is you say hey how much doyou want tosend how many liquid bitcoin and thenwhere do you wantthe on-chain bitcoin sent to once itswaps so you need to provide a bitcoinaddressand you can do so through something likeblue wallet again you can goand hit the receive button and copy youraddressand then just paste it in there and youcan see it just shows upso that allows you to peg out and againthe same thing can applyyou can always just trade your liquidbitcoin for bitcoin on an exchange likesitessideshift.ai but this is another optionhowever we're gonna just be sendingliquid into this wallet so we're gonnado that nextokay so to receive liquid bitcoin intothis walletreally simple and i'm sure you've madethe inference you're just gonna hit thereceive buttonthis gives you your address and you'regonna have a qr code that you could scanand you're gonna also have an addressdown below that you hitcopy now i have anotherliquid wallet sitting here on my phoneuh blockstream green allows for bitcoinand liquid walletsi'm just gonna hit login and enter mypinall right and as you can see i alreadyhave some liquid bitcoinsitting in this wallet so i'm going togo ahead i'm going to hit the sendbuttoni'm going to tap up top and paste theaddressthat i had copied from side swapand then i'm going to hit add amount i'mgoing to choose the asset that i'mdealing with i only have liquid bitcoinin here so i'm going tohit that and how much do you want tosendyou can choose your amount i'm going tochange it to us dollars just so it'seasierfor my brain here but i'm gonna hit 50bucksand uh we're going to go ahead and sendthis transaction offnow if you'll notice uh the amount ofthe fee is less than one sat per bytewhich amounts to about 14cents i don't know if you noticedearlier when i was looking atsending a regular bitcoin transactionbecause it's quite busy right nowto get it through in the next blockguaranteed it would have been like 50bucksso again this just kind of beckons tothe fact that you can getfaster transaction speed out of thisum if that's what you're looking for soand obviously not just fastertransaction fee butspeed but alsoway less in terms of feesokay so that has been sent off i shouldget a there's mynotification from side swap there we goit'sbeen received and that transactionshould actually be confirmedwithin a couple minutes okay soit takes two confirmations to go throughand one confirmation takes a singleminute so within two minutesfully received and spendablenow when everything is confirmed sendingback out isthe exact same process very simple youjust need to geta liquid bitcoin address and let'sjust jump back to green wallet herewe'lllog in and we'll get an address thereso same idea sending out you copy anaddresswe jump back we can hit send we canpaste in the addressthen put any amount of liquid bitcoin0.000one what is that that's about fivedollars surecontinue and the network fee is going tobe about 252 satswhich is negligible hit confirmand off it goeswe can see sent unconfirmed let's jumpbackto green walletand if i swipe down it should updatewith the new transaction in a momentthere we goso i can see i've got 10 000 satscoming in that'll be confirmed withintwo minutes hereso now that we've been doing somesending and receiving we have liquidbitcoin in our walletuh we can now take a look at havingother assets within the samewallet so under the accounts tab you cansee we have liquid bitcoin and thenthere's an option fortether or liquid tether which is astable coin peggedto the us dollar so in order to get someof this we can go to the swaptoggle switch down at the bottomand we can swap liquid bitcoin for usdtether in whatever amount we choose so ican put 0.0001i believe and that should be yeah justover five dollars thereso if i hit swap it's going to execute aswap there that'sthere's no like confirm screen oranything so just be aware like ifit's not something you want to do don'tgo hit that you're ready to do it whenyou're notand then when i go back to accounts ican see that alreadyi've got tether coming in it'sunconfirmed but it'll take two minutesto confirmand then i've got that asset within mywalletand we're actually also going topractice sending the tether backout once it confirms here over to greenwall and we'll see what it looks likeover there as wellalright so now that it's confirmed we'regonna go backto green wallet we'll just log in reallyquickand we're gonna get an address and as wegeta liquid address here it's important tonote that when you'rewhether you're receiving liquid bitcoinor another liquid assetit does not matter you do not need tohave aseparate address it's all the same andit will show up as a separate assetwhen you need it okay so we're justgonna hit receive we're just gonna copythat regular liquid bitcoin addresswe'll jump back herewe're gonna hit send we'll paste in thataddressand i'm just going to send all of thisover nowit's important to note that if you havea liquidasset like usd tetherokay so if you have liquid tethersitting in your wallet you do need toalso have liquid bitcoin becausethe way you pay transaction fees is notwith the tetherbut with the liquid bitcoin that is thethe native currency of this whole sidechainso you need to have liquid bitcoin tocover the whatever it is thethe 10 15 cents of transaction feesin order to send the tether out if youdo not have that then you will not beable to move it okay so just keep thatin mind that's kind of the fuel for yourtransactionsso continue hit send and confirmand that looks all good it's all sentoffwe'll close out of that we'll just uhupdate make sure yeah that's allsent okay i see a zero balance fortether nowand we'll jump over to our block streamgreen walletand there we can see there is anincoming transactionit says usdt beside it as compared tothe other transactions which isliquid sats or lsats and we can now seeit saystwo assets in this account and if i tapthere it shows meliquid bitcoin and it also shows metetherokay and it shows me those two separateassetswhen i go to send out it will prompt meand i'll just paste the old address justjust becauseit will prompt me what asset i want tosend okay sothat will always be the case if you havemore than one asset sitting thereanyways i'm not going to be sending thattether back i'm going tojump back here to side swapand yeah now we can see that we haveliquid bitcoin we have tethereverything is all hungry dory if iwanted to swap backi can always go usdt to liquid bitcoinand i would be uh two minutes out ofhaving that transaction confirmed backto liquid bitcoinokay so let's just do a quick review ofwhat we saw herewe were able to spin up a liquid networkwallet via side swapin about a minute just by writing downwords we needed no credentials orsignups or anything like thatwe had then the option to send bitcoinand peginto liquid bitcoin which has aone-to-one peg via their federated modelthere are trust tradeoffsthere so of course keep that in mind butthat thenallows us to move liquid bitcoinwherever we see fit with cheapertransaction feesquite a bit in the context especiallytoday ofa 50 transaction fee that was beingquoted to mefor sending one from a regular bitcoinwallet versus this where it was around14 cents um we're alsoonce we have liquid bitcoin able to swapinto and out ofany other liquid assets very easily fora regular transaction feewe were able to get a usduh us dollar stable coin send it to andfrom walletsimportant to note that bitcoin or ratherliquid bitcoin is the fuel for thosetransaction fees so you do need to havesome in your wallet when you go to sendoutand we were able to send all of that toand fromthe block stream green wallet as wellalongsideside swap so very easy to dovery easy to interact with cheaperfaster andall of those transactions that we didwhen i said confidential transactions atthe beginning of the video as a featureof liquidon the outside looking in when somebodygoes to audit the liquidside chain they are not able to seeone if you're sending liquid bitcointhey're not able to see the amountnor are they allowed to know whatthe actual asset that you're sending isso to somebody on the outside looking inthey see that a transaction happened onthe liquid side chainthey have no idea if it was lbtc if itwastether and what the amounts were forthey just see that a transactionhappenedthe only person that would know what theactual transaction was forwould be the sender and the recipient sothat's what i saywhat i mean when i say confidentialtransactions on liquidso of course if you're curious aboutthis be sure to check out side swapas well as blocks from green i also dida video on jade wallet which is ahardware wallet that allows you tosecure your liquid bitcoin if you dochoose to go that route and i'm surei'll be doing more videos on this topicin the futurei hope you enjoyed thank you guysso much for watching of course
