demanded everyonedanceexcept for himselfthis may sound ridiculous but is itreally more ridiculous than maskingoutdoors during the summersecond trusting means that your sense ofreality will be seriously distortedwhenever there's disagreement on anissue there will always be arguments forboth sides instead of verifying thetemptation will be to pick what you wantto be true first and then adopt thearguments for that side not only is thisseriously lazy but it leaves you veryvulnerable to believing a bunch of liesthis is a great way to disconnect fromreality and suffer when your desiredbelief is found to be falsethink about all the people that lost aton of money on ponzi schemes most ofthem wanted to believe and didn't seektruth and suffered as a resultthird trusting means that you'd neverlearn responsibility going with thecrowd is always much easier thanlearning to defend something unpopularbut it also makes you depend on othersfor your arguments you never reallylearned arguments
