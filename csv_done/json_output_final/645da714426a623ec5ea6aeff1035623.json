turning at a time when ournationseems to be turning very rapidly I couldnot be any happier to have you with metoday Neil hello greetings from KeyLargo welcomehi hi Danielle how are youyeah go ahead I'm no I'm doing great I'mdoing greatwe don't have enough time I mean I'mjust going to say that from the get-gowe do not have enough time today I can Ican say that much if I get questions andI don't ask them sorry I've got too muchwe've got just too much to talk aboutthere's a lot on the plate I I will sayand I just say uh you mentioned KeyLargo as you know Florida turned out tobe a very interesting place uh in thislast election butwe can we can get to that as we as weproceed well uh let's let's startum with what didn't happen in Floridalet's start I'm just going to jump inthere let's start with Trumpand the midterm election resultsand the rejection of the electiondenialistswhat does this all mean what is it thebillionaires have stepped back from himsomebody there in Florida Ken GriffinStephen Schwartzmansome 63 billion dollars worth of supportfor the GOP has said it's not going toback Donald Trump what does this meanabout where we are in political Americatodayright you didn't even mention the theMurdoch press with Fox News and and WallStreet Journal uh clearlystepping in a different direction rightumyou know it's interesting I I havetalked and um actually you know this isnot that this this was not designed tobe an answer to your question butum I'm I'm writing a book on uh you knowwhere the fourth turning is right nowand kind of where we are uh we did entersomething of uh What uh those thosereaders of the book will recognize theterm a regeneracy uh in 2016 with theTrump election and how it's um uhenergized both sides right the red andblue of our of our political divide uhis an intense partisanship uh Risingvoter participation uh a huge interestin what's happening at the nationallevel and obviously just polarizationacross across everything across uhgovernorship Supreme Court all the waydown to election for dog catcher in yourlocal neighborhood I mean and andthis this change is not necessarily theonly regenerative we will have right itcould shift in other words you couldhave a new definition of the two sidesand I do believe that there's a realpossibility of that and and let me justsummarizewhat I think we've learned in this lastelection if I could in terms of what didnot change and what did okayum what did not change is some of thefundamental uh shifts that have gone onin uh partisan ship and engagement Imean if you look at the turnout againvery high not quite as high as 2018 asthe last mid-term year but completelydifferent from every election before uhTrump election in 2016 right where wehad that huge jump in participation ofevery age bracket every income group andthat is continued still quite Highturnout rate uh the electorate is evenmore polarized in terms of uhRepublicans and Democrats you seeRepublicans even more likely to vote forRepublicans democrats for Democratsum and you don't find any fundamentalchange ingender I mean we'll get to that probablybut gender age uh income you know thatkind of stuff no fundamental changetherewhat explains the poor performance okayuh and here's the years I would put itand and a little little concession firstthe Republicans did an excellent job inthis last election at getting their sideto turn out right uh compared to 2018the Republicans uh uh got a million morepeople to the polls uh Democrats sevenmillion less so the share of Republicansversus Democrats coming to the pollswere basically back to where they werein in 2014 you know the last midtermbefore 2018. where 2018 the Democratshad a big advantage in turnout theDemocrats were agenda the Republicansare a little bit demoralized today itwas the reverse that was a greatAdvantage for the Republicansum but what happenedthey lost a huge share of theindependent vote now I'm I'm sure we'regoing to talk about this but right nowwhen you think about elections you'redealing with a third or third a thirdright roughly a third people identifywith Democrats a third with Republicansa third with Independence they're allequally important quantitatively whathappened is yeah they got all theRepublicans out Democrats didn't as manycame out but they lost 10 percentagepoints of the independent vote that's 10percent of a third that's more thanthree percentage points of the totalvotethat's what killed him and that's whatthey were counting on and that's whatthey didn't getum why didn't they get that now I get tothe question you asked which has to dowith the Maga candidates right we'retalking about the stop the steel the QAnon you know the people like that theyunderperformed everywhere theyunderperformed relative to the othercandidates in their same state or versusRepublican you know Biden versus Trumpin the same district back in 2020. doyou see what I mean yep so everywhereyou look and you just see that I meanyou can you can go down you know myfavorite example is you know Laurenbobert who is still on the bubble rightnow she's like one of the congressmenthat is not elected she's a 27 28 yearold total Republican she was in adistrict that was considered solid forRepublicans it is still undecided all ofthe other places where Republicans couldactually win are aremoderate candidates in toss-up districtsand you see that across the board whydidn't Kerry Lake win governorship inArizona I mean that should be a slamdunk and it could have been for anothercandidate uh Doug mastriano inPennsylvania when the world was he doingright right he didn't have a chance andhe pulled down uh other Republicans inthat state and when you go into to theSenate candidatesnow Don bullbook versus Maggie Assadthat just killed himum Maggie assana is one of the mostbeatable vulnerable candidates in theSenate she's in uh she's in NewHampshire and they ran this you know uhtotal kind of you know total Trump TrueBelieverum they could have had obviously ifsomeone who had run they would havewalked away with it but they could havehad any other candidate beat him OSversus fetterman Blake Masters versusMark Kelly you just go down the listright and and Herschel Walkerum what explains that no one in in inGeorgia wanted Herschel Walker I meanthe Republicans in Georgia didn't wantHerschel Walker but Trump intervened andgot him and we'll see that one's goingto be decided uh obviously next month sothis is kind of answering your questionit killed them and I think everyoneunderstands that this is why you'regetting the reaction this is whyyou know the media is Shifting why thebig donors are shifting the realquestion is is the base connection rightare the voters gonna shiftum and and how much can you you know howlong can you vote for a loserwell and so how many times can you votefor a loser and yet he's thrown his hatin the ring and he obviously means to bea disruptive element in 2024 in some waywill this not splinteruh the party do are we not faced withthe potential Ross Perot momentwhere we have a third candidatewell this is the question you raised andI've actually talked to several peopleabout it would TR the real question iswould Trump actually run a third-partycandidacy right and the real question iswhat does Trump and you mentioned likeyou go back to the examples of you knowTeddy Roosevelt and and Ross Perot andyou think of all your great third partyyou know originally the Republican partywas a third party right and these wereprincipal candidates of people whowanted to sit up and do their thingbecause they thought it was importantfor the country it wasn't aboutthemselves or willing to loseumI'm wondering whether Trump is that kindof candidate does he want to dosomething where he's sure to lose youknow come in a third you know be justthe total loser right the totalI'm not sure that he that he would dothatum and I I've talked to many people II don't know we would do that what hewould love to do is is when theRepublican uh nomination and I'm notsure he can do that I don't think that'sgoing to happen I mean you're in Floridayou are you are in the state of what Icall the next JFKyou know Ron DeSantis is is seen as youknow I mean we've got a bunch ofoctogenarians running the country and Ithink that there is a tacit rejection Ithink the country is ready for somebodyYoung new blood and you know hisresounding Victory is resounding Victorytells you that the country wants to goin a different directionit was it was it was a huge Victoryum I mean my gosh you know takingMiami-Dade I mean that's the ultimateright as well as the um the the sizablemargin that that many of the Latinocandidates got here you know CubanLatinoum he won he it was very impressiveum and I I've looked at many of thesurveys that have come out you know withvoters and so on uhhe's Rising a lot and he's been rising alot obviously since the election uhTrump sometimeswins some of those surveys but here'sthe thinga lot of people still aren't terriblyfamiliar with the sentence righteveryone in America everyone in theworld in fact knows who Trump is rightso they all have an opinion about themthey've all made their decision uh butthe scientists is stillum I I would say he has a huge amount ofimprovement Rome Trump doesn'tum you look at many of these polls theyhaven't they have a majority ofRepublicans saying he should not runright so in other words they've alreadymade up their mind but if you ask peoplea lot of people aren't quite sure whothis hand this isum I think he has huge upward potentialumum and you know that'sI think you know I think that's adefinite way that the Republican Partycan go so let's stay on the subject ofof octogenarians for just a second whatdo you make of of of the fate of thedemocratic party if Joe Biden continuesto insist that he may run again in 2024.doesn't this isn't this setting up fordisasterI don't think he's gonna runokay I think he's climbing his doctoraround because he doesn't want todeclare himself a lame duck instantlyright uh you know that just kills youyou know I'm not gonna run therefore noone really cares anymore aboutcooperating with me so let's stay on thesubject of lame of lame duck so let'sdispense with Joe Biden and move on andand move on to the idea of lame duck ofthe debt ceiling of shutting thegovernment down why wouldn't KevinMcCarthy shut the government there's nota single government employee who's goingto vote Republican anyways they're notgoing to offend anybodyso what does Kevin McCarthy taking thegavel mean after after the Democratsjust just destroying rubbing the gop'snose in it for two solid years what doesthis mean in a nation where we've grownvery accustomed to stimulushere's here's my assessment of itDanielle and this is why I think thatthe markets responded positively to theelection uh late last week I don't thinkit was just the inflation number I don'tknow about you but I was underwhelmed byanything you know you look at the pceparticularly it look I don't want towe're not talking about inflation rightnow but I don't think that was thereason I think the reason was themarkets were positively impressed andfor this reason it looks as though theRepublicans will have a a majority abare majority enough to veto anythingBiden puts through but not enough to doany damage on their own in other wordswith a three-person majority you can'tactually do anything all you can do isblock stuff right soI think the markets thought that wasabout as good as we can do so you so soJoe manchin said no to to basically toresolving the debt ceiling uh during thelame duck sessioncan we see the U.S government shutdownwill we violate the debt ceiling is anyof this a feasibility given thepaper-thin margin that the GOP has inthe houseI remember going through the debtceiling in 2010 and 2011 and I rememberit was all smoking mirrors and you knowplaying chicken and you know I'veremoved the steering wheel for my carand you know all of that kind of stuffand I'm really not impressed by it uh itkind of makes my eyes glaze over when Isee people trying to do it a second timeyou're not alone but it took the marketsdown in 2011 Neilyou know I think the markets mayactually respond less this time uh firstof allI I think it's very clear that uhgiven appropriation law thatuh you know interest on the debt wouldbe paid even if I mean if it came tothat I don't think it would be but Ithink if it came to that uh uh uhinterest on the debt and the ruling ofrib debt and all that would would not beimpaired uh in the in extremis but Ithink all of this is uh showboating andmore importantly again I come back tothis point with a three-person at mostfour I mean we'll see actually Laurenbut bobert maybe the the reason thedifference between a three and a fourperson uh uh a member majority for forumuh for Kevin McCarthybut with that he can't reallyActhe can't really take any kind ofdecisive action there's been a fewmoderates to say this is crazy I'm outof here rightand so it's unclear I I think umI'm not worried about that at the momentfrankly all rightMcCarthy has bigger worries he has toget elected you know you know he has toget elected as uh as as Speaker I thinkhe will because I can't imagine any GOPperson actually voting for the Democratit's going to be two you know one partygets to nominate one one pretty gets tonominate the otherumbut if you're worried about somethinghappeningI don't I don't know Iif that doesn't concern me right now I'mmore concerned about where the country'sgoing well let's let's okay let's talkabout let's talk about the first realrecessionthat the Millennials have ever had tosurvive let's talk about Jay Powell thenew Jay Powell I call him make my dayjay he does not look like he's going toPivot he does not look like he's goingto bail out this economy it looks likewe're going to have a real recessionwhat does this mean for The Quietquitting generation the Millennials a aterm you coinedyes umwell you know this is going to be forfirst wave Millennials uh born in the inthe early 80s this will be their thirdrecession but it's it but it's not arecession that the FED is necessarilygoing to bail out that's a game changerthat's a game changer for a lot ofpeople oh yeah it's a game changer for alot of exers who never remembers themnever remember that either it's been along time uh since how how many peopleremember volcker I mean seriouslyum and and so we do ever repeat of thatum I think it is going to be harsh Ithink the marketum you know we're talking about marketsbut I thinkuhthey pivoted a little bit too stronglyon some of this um on some of theseinflation numbersum and I know that that well you youknow a lot more about this than I doDanielle but certainly some of them arehinting that you know we can slow downnow and and so onum but I I do believe that inflationcould be a more enduring problemand if if ifJerome Powell really wants to get theum full employmentinflation ratedown to under two percent I'm I meanfull employment inflation rate meaningit's not enough that it just goes downbelow two percent while the economy isin recession right I mean he's supposedto be thinking longer term it has to beunder two percent coming out of therecession right so think about that andI I keep telling people a Taylor rulewould mean a much higher fed funds rateright now that's right you understandwhat I mean so but so there areimplications for the Millennials havingtheir first true recession wherenobody's going to bail them outthere are even bigger implications forinequalityif Powell gets interest rates up and asyou suggest keeps them high somethingnone of us have experienced because wedon't so if you remember the volcker erabut if he keeps interest rates high it'sgoing to be an effective war on an oninequality an effective war on thebillionaires because they've always beenbailed out they've had the rulesRewritten since August 12 1987 When AlanGreenspan stepped in office what doesthis mean for inequality in Americacould this be a good thingwell it could be a good thing becauseit's one thing you're forgettingumthere is an opportunity forumand and this all depends now it couldget let me let me actually rephrase thiscarefullyum the real problem is not just thatPowell's raising rates and we go intothis rather severe recession the realproblem is is that with these muchhigher interest rates on top ofeverything that the federal governmenthas borrowed since you know 2008the long-term projections explode youknow I I actually do a presentationevery year Danielle on the long-term CBOprojections you know going up to youknow 30 years up to the late 2050s anduh that's already beginning to shiftright you have this enormous uh We'veborrowed as much as a share of GDP sincethe GFC as we borrowed in World War IIand you might just say well you know wewe haven't exactly saved the world fromfascism right I mean you know what havewe done with all that right what do wehave to show for itand and and what if we actually have toconfront a real crisis where we have toborrow that amount where do we go whogets rationed out who gets rationed in Iwill say this in these kinds ofemergency situations often that's notbad for equality because what happens inin real crisis situations is you start auh allocating everything according tonecessity you know what I mean you takewealth away from the wealthy and yougive people enough to live in and you'rebasically in a command and controleconomy and I would like to remindpeople going back to the climax of warturnings that always happens right thatalways happensum you basically live in a regimentedeconomy and everything gets you know youhave Financial repression andconfiscations and and price controls yougetyou do what's needed in other wordseverything gets socialized in anemergency and that's just the rule ofnecessity it's the role of History solet's talk aboutthe fact that we've got nothing to showfor all this debt that we've piled onin the past when other countries havepiled on this much debtand accumulated enemies along the waythe reserve currency status now this isthis is a very I mean talk aboutturnings more than 100 years here thatwe've enjoyed this status is that atrisk and I'm going to shift gears just alittle bit because I'm getting to whateverybody wants to talk aboutwould it necessarily be since the fallof Rome right Neil since the fall ofRome it's always been a hot war that isunseated a reserve currency status allthe way through British pound sterlingwould it be a hot war or could possiblyare the bitcoiners rightcould we have a non-sovereignReserve currency I I'll leave my opinionout of this I'll let you answeruh no uh a non-sovereign currency at atime of Crisis that's a non-starter okayyou can enforce it okay so that neverhappens and in factum this is a very bad time forlibertarian Solutions look I meanlibertarian Solutions are great at atime of peace right when everyone feelsconfident everyone feels that theirindividual rights will be enforced nomatter the circumstances uh that's notwhat happens in a crisis right Danielleandum and I think you know this is whyduring during times of Crisis we all goback to things which areumagain we go back to the kind of commandand control situation look I would saythat umthere are dangers out there uh what I'mworried about is the fact that uh thenetU.S indebtedness to the rest of theworld is rapidly Rising I mean you justsee that that you know it's it's goingnegative for the first time and it'srapidly plunging now every year and umand andand and the in the large share of thisdebt as you know is now owned byby uh by foreigners andone solution and I'm sure you talk aboutthis to investors Danielle um Icertainly mentioned it sometimes is thatwe are not going to end up with a veryyou know a a perfect Jerome Powellsolution we have a very low inflationratethat a higher inflation rate and so longas it's not accelerating is actuallypart of the inevitable solution rightinflate away the doubtwe do it every time we certainly did itafter World War II and a large reasonwhy we got that that World War II uhshare of debt downhardly because we ran surpluses duringthe Truman and Eisenhower years butmostly because we had a lot of input wehad a lot of economic growth too realgrowth we had a lot of inflation overthose years and during the 1970s whoa itjust went way down nothing like a lot ofinflation to solve your debt problemsinflation always works in favor ofdebtors and at the expense of creditorsand the United States uh was um was adebtor right so that's how we that's howwe solve that problem I'm not sure ifwe'll do that again and remember thisalso works in the private sector youknow for everyone with I don't knowanything from student loans to mortgages[Music]uhthis is one way to affect incomeequality and I will say there are manymany historical Parallels for this we'vewe've done it many times before inhistory this is certainly not a first uhit is in a way for instance during theWeimar Republicit's how basically Germany now theycouldn't pay the Allies back in aninflated currency because that had to beyou know gold Sterling right but theycould mobilize and they could defund allof Germany's middle classes and all oftheir Industrials take all the wealthaway from them by inflating awayeverything that they had saved in thepast they did thatuh at the cost of fomenting a horriblesocial Revolutionumand we're all I think familiar with whathappened thereum Let's uh let's move on to the thingthat I think probably90 of the questions coming in arerevolving around I mean when you thinkof of share or prints you know iconsthat go by one nameand then we have SBFand this Cult of crypto and what appearsto bea fearful regulatorycommunitythat is just hoping this whole situationwill just go away vanish that thesethese bankruptcies will stop happeningthat these crises will stop popping upwhattalk to me about the cult of cryptoabout about an effective Ponzi schemethat was built on Leverageand a million a million accountssmithereenswhat is happening what what does thissay about our societyreally not just a million accounts butuh we've actually done a number ofpieces on this sort of the associateddemographic characteristics of ofBitcoin investors and when you look atthe actual number of investors notnecessarily the actual asset amountsa big expansion of the people who cameinto the market particularly in the lasttwo or three years are unsophisticatedinvestors uh lower income and minorityright and these are the people that arelosing they're buying in late andthey're losing big time uh I would justsay this the reason why uh cryptouh valuations shot up so muchwas theunnatural negative real interest ratesthat we experienced uh since you knowjust before the beginning of thepandemic uh you know up until about sixmonths ago right Danielle uh and whatthat did was it just made anything agood investment you know what I mean Ijust just you know anything it didn'tmatter whatum and and now that's all coming to anend in other words I think there's noway to separate what's happening tocrypto from the reality of the thechanging real interest rate structurewe've gone from negative one percentreal you know long-term real interestrates tooyou know 250 basis points up right nowlike a 1.5 realthat just changes everything it justrevalues everything it anything when thefuture gets devalued that's the attackright we've seen Tech come down and andwe see uh uh we see credit marginsincrease for the same reason suddenlymoney actually costs something again yeppeople care about you know what they'regetting in return for they didn't caretwo years ago about that so what happensto the rejected masses who came in latewhat do they do where do they where dothey funnel this anger because let metell you they are they're on my Twitterfeed and they're madum well if they're in a 200 feet that'smy first question where do you thinkthey'll be focusing the same seriously Imean no I I have another way ofanswering that question but I'm firstcurious what do they say who are theymad atoh they're mad at the systemthey've been done wrongis it the system that didn't regulatethem or is it the CIS you know what Imean it could be the democratic systemthe Republicans you know in other wordsthat's my questionno you know what Neil to me theparallels are so distinct becausethey're the same exact people who are ofthe opinion that I'm not going to takeit anymore you will pay me what I wantCorporate America doesn't belong herewe're going to put the big guys out ofbusiness it's the same exact mentalityas the people who were playing the memestocks or s packsand they all think it's it's us againstthem it's us against the one percentin my opinion this is uh another versionof the subprime it's the same thingpeople who bought late got the sub crimemortgages they were the ones who boughtthe houses when they were expensive theywere the ones who lost the most Iremember very well Danielle how thatworked out for them right I it washorrible uh you remember all those uhall those uh shows about you know theseIum I I think we're we're kind of doingthat with a with a somewhat new set ofpeople I will say one thing though veryinteresting uh that now that you raisedit about uh particularly with minoritieswhich I just said we're actuallydisproportionately uh investors incrypto lateand I'd be interested Danielle in yourreaction to this becauseuh this also came clear with the exitpollsum as you know in 2018 since 2016 theRepublican party has done progressivelybetter in 2018-2020 uh in minorityvoters they made another huge pickup inthis last election and I just was gonnawas gonna note this white men and womenincrease their share of the you knoweveryone increased their share of theRepublican you know of of Republicansbecause Republicans did a lot betterthan 2018 if you're comparing with 2018but it's the differential that interestsme uh Danielle that's what I wanted tolook at here if you look at white menand women they increased by about sevento eight percent voting more Republicanthan they did back in 2018. uh black menand and black women is seven and elevenpercent okay seven and eleven percentLatino men and Latino women is 14 and 21more than they did in 2018. and AsianAmericans it's it's off the charts it'suh almost 30 percentage points up nowadmittedly 2018 was a very badperformance uh for Asian Americans forthe Republican party but it's it's ait's a big differencethis is intriguing to me and I'm I'mkind of asking you I I you know thisthis data is just coming up now and sowhat do you think of this now we we'veseen you know South Texas we've seen thecommute tubing Community we certainlysaw what uh Ron DeSantis did in inFlorida among Latinosumbut I'd be interested in in your takeum how do you assess this trenduh maybe it's becauseI I don't know maybe it's becauseTrump was not on the ticket this time hewas neither president nor not on theticket for for the first election in uhin uhyou know since since uh since 2014. wellI mean uh look look Trump is isperceived I you know I live in Texas Iyou know I was George W bush gottwo-thirds of the Hispanic vote when heran for the governor the second time inTexas so I've witnessed the phenomenafirst handum people don't want to be discriminatedagainst it doesn't work that way and andTrump was probably the mostdiscriminatory president that we've everseenand the rejection of thatamong people who have very very goodsocial values hard workers they don'twant to see this crime either by the waynow I look I I totally get that and I Iactually agree with your assessmentwe're dealing with the community one ofthe biggest strains within theDemocratic party is that it has a uh youknow the leaders uh Highly Educated uhby Coastal almost entirely white uh andthey are veryshall they say Advanced and Progressivein their cultural values and then youhave Southeast during uh SoutheasternAmerica area of African Communitycommunity that's among the mostreligious and the most culturallyconservative Community along withLatinos this is an enormous strain inthe Democratic partyumand it's it's it's showing itself rightI mean if I were a Democrat I'd besaying this is a problem moving forwardhow do we deal with this because if theywere losing these people at this ratewith Trumpum you know what I mean I'm not sure Ihave to finish that sentence right surewhat are they going to do when Trump isnot there uh and you continue to havethese strainsthat's exactly right and I think thatthat's something to be considered on along-term basisum I'm getting a million questions aboutsomething you mentioned when you were upin Greenwich last time I saw youyou were saying at that time you werelike it's a toss-up it's either going tobe civil war first or a hot war first orCivil War so you know before theOlympics it looked like there was a muchmore formal if you will Chinese RussianAlliance after the Olympics not as muchwe see that China doesn't have as muchmoney as we thought it's not going to bethe global economy's Savior and yetwe've got a dictatorship that's takenhold so everybody's asking me what isthis is this is Taiwan next is a WorldWar next or do we have a greater chancewith the divisiveness that we have ofCivil War firstumwell I I can give you my answer whichwill you know partly I don't know ratifypeople but may also disappoint them inthe sense that the question of of greatpower award versus Civil War I guess youknow and and just to to preview a littlebit something I talked about a lot inthis book uh the the choice between thetwo is sometimes overdrawn because everycrisis we have is usually a combinationof both and this is actually animportant point that people often don'tunderstand uh everyone looks at you knowWorld War II as you know the the goodWar because it was you know us versusthem abroad but they don't realize thatwhen you take the entire crisis era fromthe Great Depression the New Dealto World War II you realize that the NewDeal part of that crisis was enormouslydivisive and polarizing in America andto some extent to some extent Elliotstill is among people right I meanRoosevelt was that man uh you know uhyou know Franklin Stellino Roosevelt ohlook my my mother still talks aboutbeing in South Texas and Rooseveltcoming in and killing all the cows Imean there are some there are somelong-standing bitterness about that manso you got that and and and you know onthe on the on the right they called the1930s the red decade and on the leftthey called up the fascist decade anywayyou don't have to go into that but mypoint is is that that crisis wasactually unusual that it climaxedfinally in almost an entirely US versusthemdeal you know what I mean it was Americaagainst against fascism well that wasthe last time inequality was as that wasthe last time in U.S history thatinequality wasit as it is todaywas in that era I mean you know theleading up to the the Great Depressionand the Haves and the have-notsduring the warafter the war the late parties and 50san enormous reduction inequality I meanthat was the great compression Economistcalling and you know Tom Thomas pickettytalks about that and he says well that'sjust an exception to the general rulethat's not the exception that happensevery time during and after a crisis Italk about that in the book anyway uhCivil War was obviously totally almostentirely an internal crisis right theAmerican Revolution is was much more ofa civil war than most people realize andI I often remind people that during theAmerican Revolution a lot more Americanskilled Americans than British killedAmericans and in fact in much of theSouth it was a veritable it was a bloodyCivil War uh you know with reprisals andand massive deaths within the Southum and when we finally uh when theBritish finally left a hundred thousanduh loyalists went with them today thatwould be equivalent to about sevenmillion Americans leaving and by the wayat that time in uh 1783 those were themost educated wealthiest those are theAmericans that knew how to do everythingright they were the bankers the thepeople who managed Commerce and uh andand uh uh that was an enormous economichit for America but my point is when yougo back through these crises they'realways on a spectrum of internal andexternal that's the first point I wantto make Danielle it's not just you knowyou have totally one or totally theother all right and I think we see thattoday in America whatever even if wehave an external crisis uh there willalways be somehow the internal crisissomehow feeding into that theumyou know the second point is is thata very very interesting point aboutRussia and China and you said this youknow and certainly you know I talk aboutChina's fertility rate all the time andthis is a completemind-boggling new reality for China thatthey've suddenly seen this precipitousand unexpected Decline and now the UN islooking at the future and they see mostof the rest of the century they're goingto be losing 10 million Chinese this isthe most rapidly in absolute numbers themost rapidly depopulating country in theworld for you know the next I don't knowseven decades sothis is the lesson of history and thishas to do with a political Scientist bythe name of argonski who actually talkeda lot about power trajectories rightpower in other words every great powerit looks at its future power trajectorygoing forward and what they pointed outwas when a country sees that it isthreatened in its long-term prospectsvis-a-vis its rivalthat actually precipitates more rapidaction right the psychology becomesDanielleI better do something now because I'mnot going to get a better chanceremember that for so long China'sphilosophy remember dang Xiao payingonward and then uh you know when dalbaoand all the others the philosophy waswasum uh was was just you know you knowhide your capabilities and and prosperright the future is on our side we canalways wait the more time goes by thestronger we get relative to other peopleso why in the world we want a home in acrisis right we just keep gettingstrongerI think the time it's kind of China isseeing that's not actually going tohappen we need to actually change thingswe need to shuffle things up we need tochange the reality change the psychologywe need to interveneum and and people that say that whenChina realizes it's it's its future andits resources in terms of productivityuh employment growth uh uh technology isnot quite what they expected that thiswilldiminish the chance for for uh for warI'm afraid I I differ I I think itactually pulls up right well uh thewindow look if if you'reif you're a corporation that used to runthe world and you used to have Monopolypower and you start to becomemarginalized what do you doyou acquireyou buy revenues so my question was itto take more chances because if I'mgoing to be if I'm going to be in thedust bin anyway I might as well try tomake something happen right okay so Ihave a different question I'm just goingto LeapFrog overwho does Taiwan chooseum who did what do you mean here doestimeline choosewith the Taiwanese feel that it was theywere better positioned to side withChina or would they side with the Westoh I ain't tired I think Taiwan I thinkTaiwan has totally made up its mind onthat question rightum and by the way whoever was undecidedwas decided after looking at Hong Kongright I mean that just decided all ofthe remaining and in fact the theNationalist chromaton party hascome over to the side of TaiwaneseIndependence to survive as a party Imean they they had no future in whatthey were you know this idea the idea ofof amalgamation with mainland Chinatoday is dead in Taiwan I mean just deadand the younger you are the better it isright in Taiwan so I'm gonna I'm gonnaask you the same question but as itpertains to a different country becausethere's been more foreign directinvestment there's been more tradethere's been more exports who wouldGermany choosehmmwell you know you knowGermany likes to go along the get alongright uhyou know I don't know what they wouldchoose the real question is who wouldthey be compelled to choose just giventhe realities of geopoliticsumno I mean if Germany you know is justworried about uh you know you know thehandle the tradeyeah they would just do anything tochoose to do business with mainlandChina right Schultz was just the chanceit was just there exactly but rememberthey had to move rapidly to keep up withchanging events in the Ukraine and withNATO and you know this this this greatuh this great turning point you know andthe amazing thing in in in Germany is aum uh is a a is a uh uh a DemocraticSocialist uh party which has always beenyou know in favor of us politique andand Dayton and getting along with Russiahas been at the Forefront along with thegreen party of rearming Germany andrearming Europe against the threat ofRussiaum uh I don't think Germany is as strongas you think I don't think Germany canjust make its own National choiceswithoutwithout getting a consensus of the restof the EU uh and and and the rest ofwhat we used to call the Free Worlduh okay I've got I've got I've got toomany things to cover here there was a60-minute story uh recently aboutChinese children being limited to 40minutes of tick tock and even that 40minutes had to be salubrious it had tobe about museums or sciencehow do we turn America's children offhow do we turn the damn devices off andget our children backyeah I think look uh whenever wheneverChina does that yeah they getI think sort of secret Applause from GenX parents all over America you know whoare thinking my God you know if only Icould do thatumlook I Ithe the problem of appearance as youwell know is thatyou know cell phones and all thesedevicesum are also the means by which parentskeep track of the children right so thisis the problem because the parentsalways want to keep track of what theirkids are doing and so so they're inthey can't it's it's practically verydifficult to take these communicationdevices away it's very difficult toactually have an app that the uh thatthe teenager won't know how to undoumthe real question is whether or not I ITick Tock itself will be banned bygovernment as you know that may happenfor reasons having nothing to do withteenagers watching it uh and I think adecisionthat by the administration is studyingit and I think a decision is expected uhsometime in you know March or April ofnext year uh when they're going to reacha decisionum that would be you know great news formeta I guess right uh but but you knowat least a short-term great news I thinkthat has bigger problems but than thatbut I I I I it's it'sI think a lot of it has to do with justgood parenting Danielle and keeping yourchild interested in life and and makingsure they're actually involved andengaged in the real world and if anextremist that means actually taking thedevice away well so be itum an interesting question ishow could government actually helpparentsum now a lot of these a lot of these GenX parents as you know are are prettylibertarian it's not exactly you knowhard to imagine them actually supportingI mean these are the parents who youknow don't like face masks right notthat kind of stuff yep it's hard toimagine them actually favoring that kindof thing but I will say that when shecame out with those with those proposalsthere was a part of every parent thatwas saying God I wish I could do thatyepso uh the the last great big questionthat everybody wants an update on iswhere are we in the fourth turning hastime been pulled forward has time beenpushed back are we still looking at thetail end of this decade where are wewhy the theyou know the the full period the fullera uh willmy best guess is comes to an end in thein the early 2030sumthen something againthat's a decade that that's 10 yearsyeah that's that's a good 10 years andand the reason is thisumwe've seen changes in the length of theof the secular you know I've seenchanges in the length of the cycle overthe entire history of modernity you knowstarting from the Renaissance onward andthe the the changes in the length ofthese turnings and the cycle is reallygoverned by uh changes in the amount oftime required to Traverse each phase ofLife Meaning from birth to adulthoodfrom adulthood to midlife meaning youknow theyou know being deemed capable oftaking over America's you knowlargest institutions like presidency andthen again you know when are youconsidered sort of you know completelyretired uh I thinkthroughout most much of History theseact these phases of Life are actuallybecoming more compressed right as asyoung people actually became uh moreactive in public life earlier and I Idocument actually how that has happenedthrough the middle of the through themiddle or even late into the 20thcenturyin recent decades we're going veryrapidly the other way Danielleum look at young people now how long ittakes for them after they're born to doanything we consider part of actuallybeing an adult you know what I meangetting married having kids being trulyindependent in your career owning yourown home I mean that's just hugelyRising we did see seven six seven eightyear increases now in marriage age yourfirst child age of homeownership andwe've seen the same thing actually inrunning for office now into Congress inthe Senate and my God uh we have we havethree octogenarians by the end of thisyear uh as president as um as a as aspeaker of the house in his SenateMajority Leader right uh that's onwithout president so every phase of lifeis getting longer and I do think thatthis dilation of phases of life isactually slowing downum uh the the cycle a bit and actuallyexpanding a little bit the the length ofgenerations and this is leading to asomewhat you knowlonger period and you can actually justsee that look at politics look at thefact that young people don't have thevoice in politics that they used to haveright and older people were dying atyounger ages and certainly weren't inpower uh uh and and superintendinginstitutions of the same age that theyare todayum I've got an interesting question thatcame in about a central bank digitalcurrency obviously we took Universalbasic income modern monetary Theory wetook that all on a test drive and we gota whole lot of inflation to show for itso do you think it's conceivable that weend up at some point you never know whatpoliticians are going to allow ifthey're pressed do you think we couldpossibly see kind of a a ControlFunction if you will a central bankdigital currency or will it be more ofthe same what we've heard from the NewYork fed that there are 12 largeinstitutions that are going to talkabout digitizing uh the dollar and awaywe go with one more chapter of U.S banksrunning everythingwell I think one of the reasons why theU.S has been slow to move and why someof the European countries think ofSweden for instance has been faster tomove in the direction of a of a justwhat seems like a no-brainer right Imean just an Easy Digital currency tosend abroad or you know what I mean justarrange your transactions is because ofthe banking Lobby in America I meanBanks don't want that yeah and that isjust a bunch of Bankers I mean they'rethe last person in the world that aregoing to want a digital currency notbecause it isn't a good idea but becausethey all are Bankers I meanyou know these are the people whowould truly be undermining uh their ownRevenue source and what they do as abusiness uh byuh by this but it makes eminent senseit actually I think it can be donesecurely it doesn't have to be done in ain a um you know and it and it had beenbeginning Bitcoin obviously and itdoesn't have to be it doesn't have to itdoesn't require the same technology itcould just be sort of a a top-downsystem for keeping track of anyone'sLedgerumbut but I I do think that demand for itpublicly will be will be strong enoughuh particularly as younger people justthink it's crazy you know not to takeadvantage of thisumI mean just think about the fact that somany more young people are now usingBanks now that banks have gone digitalright they don't have to go to somestupid you know branch office somewhereand drive their car and actually writethese you know what I mean andso I I think that the electorate willinsist on it and I think one way oranother that the FED kicking andscreaming and all those Bankers uhthey're gonna have to give us one rightand and whoever's president is everahead of a party that really wants toplease people uh is going to figure outhow to way to provide us for that so umwe've got about three minutes left I'mgoing to ask you one last selfishquestionum since Elon Musk took over Twitter thesituation with my Twitter feed beingabsolutely bombarded by Bots is justmaking me great I mean there's obviouslya machine somewhere cranking this out bynefarious charactersdo you think we could see a social mediaplatform failwell in my opinion most social mediaplatforms are already failuresI mean I don't visit them I don't use itI I have a I have a 200 feet and I doenjoy you know I do enjoy looking atwhat comes across butI must say uh social media just isn't mypreferred method of acquiringinformation I Igotcha Elon Musk is uh is kind of a GenX CEO going crazy I mean you know youthink souh he's got uh probably 500 percent moreon his plate than he can possiblyaccomplish uh I wonder now about thatyou know rocket headed for the moonwhethermusk is even tracking where the helllet's gothe guy is scattered in a milliondirections right now and um uh and I dosay that I think that it's not helpingthat it's not helping Tesla's no Godbuilding it right no I mean he's lostwhat 150 billion dollarsunfathomable net worthum right and and it seems to me in termsof the morale of the company uh whathe's doing with the with with Twitterseems to be exactly on par with whathe's already done at you know Tesla'sbasicallyall right now any parting thoughts we'vegot about a minute left what did I notask youum I just was going to mention one thingactually it was one of many things on myplate uh women actually showed up asmuch as they did in 2008 there was nodifference in that rate but here's theinteresting thingthey actually moved slightly more to theRepublican column than did uh than mendidwhich means Daniellethat the abortion issue just simplyfailed to show up in other words the theshares of the two genders that showed upto vote was the same uh but we saw noparticular change if anything a changeuh uh uh toward the Republicans that mayhave been actually really pushed by thisoutsized increase in minority womenvoting more for the Republican partythan they had but I think that's aninteresting development given that somany people were talking about it beforethe election well we will follow thatwe've run out of time I'd like I said wecould have done this for two hoursumbut let's do it in person next time andI just I want to thank you so much thishas been so eye-opening and enlighteningand insightfulit's a total pleasure to be on with youso I I really had a good time thank youthank you Neiluntil next time I mean blown away I'mgonna have to watch it three more timesmyself and thank you for joining ustoday take care[Music][Music]",
