an Xfinity crisis until thethe system collapses entirely I thinkit's hard to predict or you know is thisthe last cycleum it's probably not but um I think thatthis isif there was 2008 and there was 2020this isuma financial crisis that is consistentwith the scope magnitude consequences ofthat yeahis it the onset of the crisis are welike in the middle of it becauseobviouslyI meanthe how you define lead up right likegoing back to 2019 2020or even 2008.the first in 2008people often look back to Bear Stearnsbut it was really the summer of 2007when the writing was on the wall whenthe first cracks happened so I thinkthe cracks in the facade had alreadyhappened and then it's when things getto Crazy Town and just start fallingapart when I say that we're in thecrisis it's you know when it becomesobvious to a wide range of people yeahno this is whyit's great to be here in the BitcoinCommons and have access to youin person because I think consideringwhat's going ontoday what has been going on over thelast week obviously the Tremor startedwith silvergate you had to run on thatbank last week spread to Silicon Valleybank then we wake up this morningevery Regional Bank stockuh has traded is halted Trading we hadsignature get shut down yesterdayit seems like something is happeningon the back end of the banking systema lot of the pundits are like oh thiswas a a crisis onset by crypto and therisk taken there but I thinkbuilding on the conversations thatstarted many years ago on my Rooftop inBrooklyn talking about Ender's Gameuh building up to today I think sittingdown with you and getting into the firstprinciples of actuallyeverything that's going on from aliquidity profile behind the scenes isvery important so you've been looking atcharts over the weekendand diving into some stuff that willpull up on the screen but at the end ofthe day this isa crisis that seems driven by the fedand their interest rate policy over thelast year yeah I think that that'ssomething we should talk about whereumto an extent this does feel or like partof this feels like choke point 2.0butum I think that that the the biggerthing that's happening in thatultimatelypeople will say that you know the cryptosell-off had you know causedsilvergate and thenum and then there were knock-on effectsbutin reality and I thinkumwho somebody put out a tweet about theunrealized losses for all the banksand it's important to recognize thatthis whole messis 100 a function of the Federal Reservelike they set it upyou know and knocked it down themselvesum I think the the statistic is there's700 billion of unrealized losses onbonds that the banks holdright and uh we can talk a little bitabout that but the FED functionallyprinted a lot of moneystarted tocreated a dynamic where there was out ofcontrol inflation and then in an attemptto try to Reign that in they startedaggressively raising interest rateswhich caused the value of bonds whichthe banks heldto collapse or I mean collapse is astrong term in terms of bonds but ifbonds drop by 10 to 20 percentum that's a significantuh reduction in the market value ofbonds and that is really what causedsilvergate issues right it wasn't theoutflow of demand and I think you knowwe'll go into a lot of other things buttake the opportunity just to to givesilvergate credit that they withstood a70 to 80 percent draw down in depositsthey did not need to be taken over bythe FDI see they weren't taken over bythe FDICum the the thing that created issues forthem was that in the in the midst ofthem needing toumto satisfydeposit withdrawalsin that intervening period the FEDincreased interest rates seven or eighttimes to four and a half to five percentand didn't matter what you were holdingwhat credit instrumentthe the the valueum decline that happens when you raiseinterest rates cause those cause thoselosses to be realizedum and and then that createdum the big issues which then uh SiliconValley Bank signature realistically anybank that was holding treasuries ormortgage-backed Securities or any creditinstrument rightumthey the FED created a holeum and and they didn't just create thewhole by raising interest rates theycreated the whole bywithdrawing or basically draining 25 ofall the cash that exists in the bankingsystem in a 12-month periodafter inducing a massive creditexpansion so it's not just the mark toMarket issue it's that they werecreating a mark to Market issue byraising interest rates but at the sametime they were taking actual dollars outof the systemum andthe weakest were going to be exposedright and silvergate wasn't the weakestSilicon Valley Bank might have been theweakest right theyyou know silvergatesustained an 80 drawdown in reservesdidn't need FDICum or the FDIC didn't shut them down andat the end of the day that happened overa four-month period Silicon Valley Bankbooma day 24 hours gone yeahum no and I saw Alex leishman tweetingover the weekend that even thoughsilvergate has since shuttered theirdoors they're still processingwithdrawals even to this day yeah and Iwent in that to say like this is 100about the Fedthe FED printed a ton of moneyin between September of 2019 and may of2020 and then in a more controlled waythrough 2021functionally or at least through thefall and that's when inflation reallystarted to rip right and then start toget a lot of pressureand also and there are kind of corefunction of quote price stabilitytried to rein that in by jacking upinterest rates and literally on on bothsides onthe consequences of flooding the systemwith a bunch of Reservesas well as then how they tried to exitthat this had nothing to do with quoteBitcoin crypto like didn't even haveanything to do with FTXum it had had to do with the fed andthey might like to say hey look overthere but like if you look at what'sactually happening systemicallyfundamentally it's all of their you knowof by for the FEDum having nothing to do with Bitcoinyeah this problem becomeslike very obvious too when you considerthe fact that post 2008 dot-frank comesto light and it changes like the reserverequirements or the capital requirementsand they dedicated like a tranche ofbanks Reserve Capital to thesequote-unquote risk-free bonds so asyou're jacking up rates the price ofthose bonds is going down and as a bankyou're required by law to hold a basketof those of those treasuriesin capital reserves andthe problem seems pretty obvious when wethink about it now in retrospect eventhoughit's hard to even call it retrospect asit's happening right now but thinkingabout it like oh they put these Capitalrequirements in for these assets thatare verytightlycorrelated to Fed policy like you raiserates the bond prices are going to falland so that the capitalin that that requirement is going downand so then maybe you got to pull fromfrom more liquid deposits buy more bondswhich then creates a liquidity crisisfor people want to withdrawal and thenit's an exacerbating Doom Loop yeah Imean could we pull up the it might be ifwe could pull up this uh Silicon Valleybank balance sheet just to like talkabout like some of these Dynamicslooking actually atum a bank balance sheetokayum let me zoom in a little bit Loganyeahthis oneokay my eyesight's good enough for thereyeah perfect okay soand this is Silicon Valley Bankit looks like it but Silicon Valley Bankyeah it must be yeah it doesum okay so they have so as of Decemberthey had 13.8 billion of cashand then they had 26 billion availablefor sale Securities at Fair Valley says26 billion then held to maturitySecurities 91 billionum and then because it and I I'm notgonna like they have probably some ofthese loans are areum in a different category bro like ifyou see the 74 billion in loans rightthat those loans at amortized coststhat is functionally like the core of Abank's business like that's that's themissuing loans to to their customers the26 billion and the 91 billion that areup in total investment Securitiesumthat that is them buying bonds that'snot them originating loans and holdingthose loansthat was the FED increasedtheir balance sheet to stem a 2020financial crisisand then they can't go out and issueloans they can't create demandfor loans soa bunch of deposits flood into theirsystemand what do they do rather than holdthose deposit just deposits as reservesthey went into the market and boughttreasury which is very different thanoriginating loans now those those 74billion of loans those those are highlyilliquid andumthe you know kind of just like drawingthe distinction between what those twothings are now if you go down Loganand you see like they had 173 billion ofof deposits soumand I don't know what break see we'vegot demand deposits of 80 billion ininterest bearing deposits of 92. I don'tknow if you know to what extentthose interest-bearing deposits havetime you know kind of like we're ademand deposit you can show up tomorrowand get your money back at the timedeposit is generally like you can showup in 30 days or 60 daysum butrealistically what happened was and Ithink my order of magnitude might beslightly off but if you scroll back upLogan thattheythey started havingumbasically I think in in Silicon ValleyBank's case because a lot of theircustomers were Venture back customersthey were cash burning so they're sotheir deposits started to decline on netat the bank level and they needed tosellsome of the available for saleSecurities in the health of maturitySecurities well when they did thatbecause the value of those had gone downand it's the exact same thing thathappened in silvergate they had torealize losses of like when they boughtthem versus when they needed to sellthem and they incurred a two billiondollar loss well if you were aggress ifyou're sitting on over a hundred billionofum even if they're short-term but Ithink in the cases of Silicon Valleythey were longer duration likemortgage-backed Securitiesmortgage-backed Securities or justlonger dated treasuries what do you whatis the Fed expect to happen if theyflood the system with a bunch ofReservesand then those naturally flow into okaythe bank's gonna buycredit instruments and then you jack upinterest rates and now what what the FEDfunctionally did was they createdthe wholein these bank balance sheets they shouldhave told them like hey don't you knowget rid of your treasure get get rid ofall your credit instruments before butthat's what the bank is in the businessof holding credit instruments like theremight be a distinction between the loansthat they originate that 74 billion andthe you know 120 billion ish thatthey're holding you know because theydidn't have anything else to do with thecash but that that is ultimately whatcreated the environment that let thatmade them so susceptible to a bank runbut it's not specific to Silicon ValleyBank it it's systemic it's at every Bankyeah I mean there was stats going outover the weekend like the four majorBanks they're sitting on these losses aswell or not realized yet but yeah and Iand but the other point I bring up isthat that 700 billion I don't have thetweet I think it was Caitlyn long thatput it out that had like that showedthat the unrealized losses on the bondportfolios of 700 billion butum the point being that Bitcoin in totalwas 400 billion right so likeum that that unrealized Mark to Marketloss is a direct consequence of the FEDhaving in raise interest rates seven oreight times andum you know the the FED funds rate goingfrom zero to four and a half percent orwhatever it is today yeah and Bitcoinsprobably like 450 billion Market Cuptoday with the price screaming uptowards 24 000 but likein the context of the banking crisisthat was all businesses built aroundBitcoin and crypto and that market capis even significantly loweryeah than the whole Bitcoin market capso Logan can you pull up the the cashassetsum for the banks yeah because and thencan you um can youmove theum the time scalefrom like to basically that period whereit looks very low is um is likebasically pre-qeum yeah soone of the things here is thatif if you go to 2000s or like leave itleave the chart as it is but if you'rekind of looking at the 2017 time periodthe amount ofand what we're looking at here is thecash ass like the total cash that thethat the banks hold so the left side ofthe bank's balance sheet if we were justlooking at Silicon Valley Bank's balancesheet it was the 13 billionumthat in 2017 when the FED started tosignal that they were going to start toundo QEthe total cash the banks held in totalwas about 2.4 trillion and they theywithdrew about700 to 800 billion of cash basicallyjust going into a black holeand that caused the repo markets tobreak they're basically taking thebuilding blocks of liquidity out of thesystem it's just going into a black holeand in so from 2017 to 2019 two-yearperiod they drained 700 800 billion ofreserves which equated to 33 percent ofall the cash that was in the bankingsystem and the important thing I wroteabout this in Bitcoin is not a hedge aswell as Ender's Game which we talkedabout several years ago is that whenthat happens the amount of debtliabilities that exist in the system donot magically changethey're basically just taking out theliquidity that could be there to fund itso it's like thinking about like in inarithmetical terms like the numeratorstays the same but the denominator getsshrunk massively and what theyfunctionally do each time they drainreserves isdollar for dollar introduce incrementalleverage into the systemthe liabilities don't change the amountof cash to service them does and theratioyeah it gets blown out so when we lookat what has happened over the last 12months or really since June you knowthey they took outum over a trillion dollarsright and there's still more cashbut the credit system is also expandedexpanded significantly and so they tookout more dollars in a shorter period oftime they took out a trillion dollarswhich is about 25 percentso you say well they weren't asaggressive but it's like no they tookout a trillion dollars over a six toeight month time period whereas theytook out a 700 to 800 billion over atwo-year time period and that resultedin the financial crisissoeverything that can like like people cankind of get lost and like with theconsequences of the bailout and themoral hazard but it all comes down towhat the FED is doing and it's like itis it is all a function of the fed andit all comes down to the amount ofliabilities that exist in the systemspecifically debt liabilities as well asthe dollars that exist in the systemthat could service it and if you takeout 25 of all the cash in the bankingsystem after having induced massivecredit expansion this is what happensand it's also why it's systemic to allof them right like we it's difficult toknow until the dominoes start to fall asto who the weakest is but when theydrain the reserves from the system it isactually what induces the bank runbecause it exposes the weakestum the the dollars come out from oneplace but then it's like a it's like asuctionum whoever is weakest is going to beexposed first yeah and like you saidtaking these dollars out of the marketadds Leverageto that credit exposure or that creditexposure as the monetary base wasexpanding as cash was being injectedinto the system was alreadyessentially being leveraged as well whenyou think about the context of SiliconValley Bank like they were issuing loansto startups or VCS VCS looking forbridge loans their next Capital call orstartupstrying to monetize before they go publicor get acquired as well which is bothlevered bets yeahbut yeah so I think that's all rightbut what's actually happeningis it's not specific to Silicon ValleyBank no right uh any I mean well like itcould bring it back to the context ofthe weakest get exposed first likeVenture Venture companies are high riskEndeavors right so it makes sense thatit might start there right but it couldalso be that if you if you have a bankthat has a high concentration incommercial real estate in a market thatis you know a low growth market and theFED starts to increase interest ratessignificantly like that's probably justasprime a place to look as any rightum that there's probably a lot of whatmight appear to be idiosyncratic reasonswhy someone is weakest but it's allcorrelated because the FED is slowingeverything like it's not a coincidencethat Venture slowing down at the sametime that the fed's drainingCapital out the system and you know it'sall related to each other yeahsoWhere Do We Stand now I mean is thiswhat forces the hand the feds revertwell I think that one thing I would sayis soI guess last night came out that the FEDbasically fed in collaboration with theFDIC in collaboration with treasurybecause I think it required all three ofthemtoum someone can correct me on this but Ithink that it required all three ofthose constituents including theirboardsto basically determine that SiliconValley Bank was systemic or what what'scurrently happening in systemic suchthat they can go uh says the FDIC couldgo beyondum their 250 000 yeah to ensure all soso basically they came out around 5 p.mbefore the market the future's open andsaid that that they were taking care ofall of theum insured and uninsured deposits ofSilicon Valley Bank and that they werethat they that they theumSignature Bank have been shut downum and entered receivership and thatthey had this new facility which theycalled something like the banked TermLoan facility and this is this is theother this is the crazy thing becauseeach time each with each passingfinancial crisis they have to dosomething crazier and what they didyesterday was insanely crazy yeahum and then there were a few things thatwere Casey won the fact that theystepped into to backstop alluminsured and uninsured deposits becausethe thing with Silicon Valley Bank wasthat like 93 or 94 reportedly of theirdeposits were uninsuredum that was crazy too but thenkind of if we go back to the financialcrisis of 2008they started QE with just treasuries andthen they expanded that tomortgage-backed Securities and therewere people in at the time in the FEDincluding Richard Fisher who was theDallas fed president who basically waslike we are operating like a hedge fundwe shouldn't be choosinguh sectors of the economy advantagingone or the other and there were otherpeople in the FED that saidlike don't don't call us a hedge fundlike you know that's not what we'redoingum but but that kind of movement awayfrom just buying treasuries intotreasuries and MBS and that that thenkind of normalizedum the fed using MBS or mortgage-backedSecurities as a way to pump more dollarsinto the system well then in 2020whenever you know like the market brokeagain for predictable reasons becausethey were draining the dollars ofliquidity that the the the of that thehighly leveraged system neededit wasn't just treasuries andmortgage-backed securities it wasum they basically started creating uhfunds to buy corporate creditum not just corporate credit but Munibonds like basically the The Leaky shipwas bursting it ever at every scene andthey had to they had to buy every formof credit out there when you go back to2019 I'm not sure if this was a creditfacility but during the repo spasm theyadded a new facility that essentiallyallowed them to fund hedge fund margintrading accountsthat I know I I remember seeing likereports about that but I never dug intothat myself to to verify whether or notI thought maybe like some hedge fundswere participating in like the theumthey got access to the window oh theygotta okay that's that was the facilitythat they added in 2019 via proxy likethe fmic or something like that yeah butbasically just like kind of highlightingthat they had to they had to go plug theThe Leaky ship at more pointsum because the credit system wascollapsing that's that's functionallywhat's happening the credit system iscollapsing when we're seeing thisum and this time the thing that they'veadded the wrinkle is oh okay so theproblem was that we started we floodedthe system with a bunch of dollars andthe bankscertain of them probably most of themwent and boughtthesemid to longer duration Securities theystart increasing interest ratesthe market value of those loans comesdown and as inflation's going upand then what they've done now is theysaid okay so say you've got uha treasuryand I think it's it's not just specificto treasury but I think it's everythingthat counts as like hqla or like ahighly liquid quality assetsum not 100 sure but basically let's justuse treasuries as an example if you havea treasury that's trading at 90 cents onthe dollarand say you have a hundred million ofthat and say that that's worth 90million if you were to sell it they'dsay you don't have to sell it come tothe FED pledge it and we'll give you aloan of a hundred millionthat is functional in QE right if theywere doing QEthey would say oh you have a treasuryworth 90 millionall buy it for 90 million you give meyour Treasuryand I'll give you cash cashum I'll credit your account with another90 million they're basically that's whatthey're doing they're just not saying itright because they're saying hey nowe'll actually do you one better we'llgive you a hundred million the par valueof itand we'll take those as collateral it'sbasically a repo but a repo not atmarket value at par and the reason whythey did that was because as these Bankruns were happening or are happeningpresentlyum and I don't I don't expect thatumwhy they would stop really and we cantalk about why that is butas silvergate had to selland realize losses like anytime you haveto go into the market and sell a loanthe market is setting the price of it sothen boom if if they if and I I'm notsaying this in the sense that like theyshould have done something differently Ido think I mean like I'd do somethingdifferently but the whole system is so it's like damned if you dodamned if you don't like yeah they'restuck in the worst yeah of all time butif they had allowed Silicon Valley Bankto uh not necessarily not I'm nottalking about bailing out the depositorsbut if they had allowed it to remainopenand not shut it down on Friday then asthosedepositors had said send my money toChase or send my money to Wells or sendmy money to a citythen that 120 billion or however muchwas left I know that they had sold a 20billion dollar portfolio for a 1.8billion dollar lossthe only way that they could havecontinued to satisfy that was to sellcredit instruments cascading loss yeahcascading losses for for the next bankfor them because because if they have tosellMBS or they have to sell treasuries thenthe next weakest Bank whether it's FirstRepublic or whoever else is weak whichthey're all weak because the wholebanking system isn't solvent and not topick out a few but the point is that inorder to satisfy those withdrawalsthey're having to move the market lowerand so then it creates an actual largerhole for the next bank that gets in thesame situationand again that doesn't the thethe issue of in of guaranteeinguninsured deposits except from that thatthat's really what what you know my viewwhy they had to like stop thethe svb piece because there's a knock-oneffect but that then informed howum I think why they basically said heydon't you don't need to sell thesecredit instruments post them here andwe'll give you the full value whatthey're going to have to do is they'regonna have to reintroduce the formal QEto to walk the value of those bonds backup they're going to have to be the buyerthat gets the value of the bonds back upso such that that is actually the mostquote Capital efficient way to stem thismassive collapse of the bank run likethey'll convert this post your you knowpost your unrealized losses here at thefed and we'll give you the mark tomarket value at par or not at Mark toMarket but at par and then over timewe're gonna have to go back to themarket and be the buyer of these bondsand then as we get the value of thebonds back above paryou can then you know reverse out ofthis take your take your bonds backwe'll give us cash you know that that'show I see it playing outyeahit doesn't seem good and when you thinkabout like the compressionof these crises obviously we had 08start unwinding in 2017 fast forward endof 2019 beginning of 2020.credit problems Arise at the reversecourse print money for two and a halfyears or yeah two and a half years likebeginning of 2021 uh yeah like 2019 tothe end of 2021 yeah andso that's a two three year period andobviously we have this aggressive ratehike regime the last let's call it yearnot even yet and now here we arebeginning of 2023.q1 2023 having to reverse course againyeah March 12th is a day that it's likeMarch 12th March 12 2008 was when LehmanfailedI think I mean March 12th 2008 was whenumwhen David Faberfamously went on CNBC and askedsomebody at Goldman why they weren't ormaybe no yes someone at Bear Stearns whythey weren't um white Goldman wasfailing to novate tradesum and that was basically the collapseof within a few days then March 12th of2020 and then March 12th yes you know2023 yeah yeahyeah so it seems like things areaccelerating like the the pace at whichthey're losing control yeah I think Imean I think that's apparentumthatmore people you know the system is moreleveraged they have less control theyyou know each time in my view if youthink about what's actuallyumthe mechanisms by which they tried toquote fix the system it always itthe function of introducing new dollarsit's like the the problem at its core isone of Leverage both in terms of thetotal amount of debt in the system aswell as the relationship between debtand the available supply of dollars thatcan that can fund the debt andum if anybody's interested in learningmore about that they can go read Bitcoinis not a hedge that I put out earlierthis year butthat is the core of it and each time thething breaksthey have to put more dollars that theythat they had put in before but alsothe system needs to be growing thecredit system in order for it to notcollapse needs to be growing and as thecredit system becomes larger that'sactually it necessitates more nominalcredit be created for it to growumbecause a certain amount of liabilitiesare rolling off each year right soum so what what functionally happens isthey have to print more money each timeas the system becomes more and morefragile that induces more and morecredit creation which then as they tryto you know reverse out the consequencesof it as as it you know kind ofmanifests itself and inflation andvolatilitythen each next time it's like it's impthe timing is impossible to predict butbut I think what isfoundational or fundamental about it isthat the problem only gets worse yeahthe outcome's very predictable it's justwhen it will happen nobody knows butagain another important point to reallydig into well and also but on that pointthat you're making about the timingaccelerating it's like if you look atwhat they did was post-financial Crisisthey waited until 2017. so theyintroducedcash from2008to 2014.then they started raising interest ratesin 2015 but they didn't change thebalance sheet until 2017.so from the last dollar that they putinto the systemto when they started to withdraw it wasthree years approximately and then theywithdrew 700 to 800 billion over a24-month periodwellthey put 5 trillion in the system over atwo-year period versus 3.6 trillion overa five-year period from 2000 the 3.6trillion was 2000 in the 2008 to 2014.so like they're accelerating the therethey put more money in the system fivetrillion from September of 2019 toSeptember 2021.and thenthat had set off this I meanrealistically it was the cumulativebuildup of all the money that theyprinted over decades butit gets exacerbated andthey start to signal in the fall of 2021that they're going to raise interestrates which they start in March but theydidn't start withdrawing the liquidityfrom the system until the summer of lastyear 2022. well they took out a trilliondollars in less than a year right sothey put money in Faster they took moneyout fasterwhat does that do accelerates thetimeline of the of of whatever financialcrisis was going to happen yeah and Idon't the point I was going to make toois like another important thing to leaninto which you touched on but we didn'tarticulate it this way is that everytime they add more cash that they getunique in the ways that they add cash in2008 will buy a mortgage back securities2020 will buy your corporate bonds yourMuni bonds who knows what's going tohappen now but not only are youintroducing more cash into the systembut you're expanding the landscape forpotential moral hazards right becausethe the announcement they made lastnight with the FDIC the treasury and theFED saying essentially said we're goingto backstop all your deposits likethere's no scenario which depositors arenot gonna be able to get their cash andthat introduces moral hazard to thebanking sector we're like oh they'regonna they're gonna backstop all of ourdeposits like we can go take any bet wewant well I think thatumyeah I think and maybe we talk aboutkind of moral hazard like the wholesystem the system is built on moralhazard soit's difficult to say that theincremental moral hazard that they haveintroduced materially changes theum the broken incentives that thatalready existed they they certainly dobut to like folk that's like focusing onthe The Edge rather than the coreum I think one of the things thatum you know Bill Ackman uh Jasonkalkanis David sacks have been out therehammering for a a Silicon Valley Bankbailout now the shareholders weren'tbailed out but the depositors were andthere's the depositors have more valuethan the than the shareholders did thesame signature whoever it might be andthey said like now's not the time Ithink I saw something from uh LarrySummers too that guy's a clownum but saying like now is not the timeto be lecturing us about moral hazardit's likerealisticallynow is always the time but they're alsoright in the sense that likethe system from its from its mostrotting core got to where it is becauseof more Hazard the moral the ultimatemoral hazard is the Fed has the abilityto print money and so we can kind offocus or get distracted onyou know kind of the the occurrence ofthe daybutthe moral hazard was when the financialcrisis happened they they always had theability to print money and they did itin a wide scale waylarger faster than they ever had beforebut it was functionally the same and andwhat they did though from a umfrom a legal perspectivethey they I think they codified too bigto faillike they said these banks aresystemically important Banks they aretoo big to fail likeand and when these guys are out thereit's like they're both wrong from likethey were they were wrong in the sensethat they were only like these guysthey're only looking out for themselvesthey don't give a about Americaabout Main Street about jobs they wereworried about their money interest rightlet's just be absolutely clear aboutthatumbut they also weren't necessarily wrongin the sense of like this is a this is areal problembut and and I think one of them saidlike if they were maybe they were allsaying this and this was this was thebrokenum thing about it was if you do not bailout Silicon Valley bank depositors thenthere's going to be a bank runeverywhere well even today there was aSilicon Valley bailout and the logicalthing to dois to like still is to move yourreserves to a too big to fail Bank likebecause what they didn't do wasguarantee all deposits for allinstitutions so if you're sitting thereat institution you knowthree through a thousandthey have not guaranteed anything andand if you're in a scenario where youryour bank has been taken over by theFDIC and you're waiting to learn whetheror not what they're going to do withthat next one you still have theincentive to move your depositstoJPMorgan to Wells Fargo to city likethey codified that in 2000 in the periodafter the financial crisis they theybasically said hey we've got this moralhazard ofum too big to fail Banks which everyoneknows that we're going to bail outum oh wouldn't this be a great idealet's let's make this lawthat these banks are too big to failwhat do you think is going to happen youknow likeum and so when they bail out you knowthe93 of deposits that were there it's likeI don't really care the system's brokenyou know like it just hopefully awakessome additional people up to the factthat it's broken and that we accelerateover to bitcoin but the moral hazardbasically the moral hazard was alwaysthere it was the FED can print moneythey can they can choose who and whenthey bail people outum humans are fallible they always willum in terms of like you know not theywill always bail people out they willnot always use that powerum radably or in an unbiased wayum and you know like there's a reasonwhy signature bank's out of businesstoday and first public slope no maybeFirst Republic isn't open by the end ofthe dayfor over 24 now bitcoin's ripping holy yeah like but that but that's theother thing that comes back to it whichisumpeople you cannot figure Bitcoin out ifyou have no knowledge of it but thereare people that have been aware of itthat were on the periphery that weren'tyet there and then they see this andthey realize holyI can't trust anybody or they realizeholy this whole thing is based ontrustright so imagine four days ago youdidn't know what Bitcoin was you knew itwas out there but you hadn't like youhadn't started to think about it wellwhen all the banks fail you can't justmagicallyunderstand Bitcoin but there's a largeswath of peoplethat next wave of adopters that werelooking at it and saying like thisdoesn't make sensebut maybe you know like you know I'm notgoing to totally dismiss it and they'vegot 10 million dollars in their bankaccountand then this happens and they'relike holy like yeah that's howthey've dealt withum Silicon Valley Bank and signature andif you think about the psychology it'slike that's connecting the dots for arange of people you know over the lastthree days and they're not all of asuddenly gonna move all their money overbut they're gonna be like yeah let melet me get some of these chips off thetable because that those things that thebitcoiners have been telling me aboutthat I didn't think that the bankingsystem would have an all-out collapse orthatum uh 170 billion dollar Deposit Banklike Silicon Valley Bank can be you knowseemingly perfectly fineone day and literally gone to the nextyeahum that maybemaybe I need toown Bitcoin because it does solve thisproblem of eliminating trust from thesystem well that's been the mostinteresting thing over the last few daysisobviously we talk about number go up 21million like you want the scarce assetyou want to sound monetary system but Ithink the real value prop of Bitcointhat's being highlighted over the lastweek is the lack of counterparty risk ifyou're appropriately holding yourprivate Keys like I think Silicon ValleyBank going under and for a three-dayperiod people being like am I going tobe able to access my money really drovehome the concept of holding Bitcoin in awallet that you control and whether theprice goes up or down no matter whatyou're gonna have access to that moneyyeah andbut probably most realistically in thisscenario the FED is going to print a shI mean one well that's that there's acertain what is the magnitude of thenext right but there's a certaintythey're going to have to print aton of money like I would say thatthey're gonna have to print more moneythan they have before in the lastepisode to contain thisumthe you know bigger boat needs moredollars to to plug the Leaky shipum and the the boat is leaking in moreplaces and that's becoming apparent topeopleum so that that's a cert like they willhave to print more money I mean they'veemitted so much like in my mind qe5 hasstarted as of last nightum the the swap facility is functioningthe sameso so that's thereumbut there will like there's some recencybias to this too which is likenormies will getall worried and then the FED will makesure that they can get their dollars anda certain swath of them will just goback to their daily lives and say thatthat was a scare yeah there's going tobe more turbulence in the market but theFedthe FED took care of it rightum so it's not going to be like I don'tI don't expect that like magicallyeveryone whoyou know is cognizant of what'shappening right now is going to connectthe dots but I do think that at afundamental level that idea of andSatoshi Nakamoto whoever he might beum you know in terms of like you knowthe impressions of you know one of hisquotes wasI think it was from February 2009 rightafter you know a month after Bitcoin waslaunched where he said the problem withum traditional currencies I think is theterm used the problem with traditionalcurrencies is all the trust that'srequired you know we have to trustcentral banks not to print money uh wehave to trust that Banks do not you knowlend the money out in waves of creditBubbles and that trust has basicallybeen broken wellthis you know2008 broke that trust but the systemsustained itself or persisted it justbecame more fragile 2020 the same thingnow the same thing each time thosepeople will sayor not those people but more and morepeople on the margin we'll look at itand say yeah I I value this thingBitcoin not just you know for differentreasons but more people will value itand they will come back to this episodearoundcounterparty risk around the fact thattheir entire monetary system is based ontrust and that trust is broken and themore people that that signal reacheswhen you're talking about a uh you knowthat signal has reached 170 billiondollars worth of depositors right atleast that's Silicon Valley Bankum I mean if you add it up with FirstRepublic because the first Republicdepositors are sitting there in the samescenario that's another 170 billion 100of those people do not connect the ideato bitcoin but the signal has been sentto all of those people holythis is fragile and my money is based ontrust and that will be a key buildingblock for a lot of people to then saylike hey this thing Bitcoin 21 millionand I don't have to trust anybody Imight not understand exactly that butthat that makes sense if it if it holdsyeahcompletely I mean I had a number ofconversations over the weekend of peoplehitting me up like ohI finally get it and then like in theBitcoin space too due to the fact thatit has been hard historicallyto get a bank account I know many peoplein the space who are running companieswho had a large dollar amount sitting atthese bangs seriously considering hey Ican't wire it to another bank I don'thave a JP mortgage account I don't havea Wells Fargo account don't have a Bankof America account like the smartestdecision I can make right now topreserve my treasury or the cash and mybalance sheet is to wire money to aBitcoin exchange and convert it tobitcoin and hold it just wait till thisblows overyeah I mean I think that if if you aredown the Bitcoin rabbit hole that is avery logical thing to do it's the onlything that you can do to eliminate trustand what do you get with that same timeyou get to hold something that isfinitely scarce rightumthat only becomes logical for peoplethat are far enoughdown the rabbit hole to connect thosedots now it might move people down therefurther to take a chance to be likeI can't wake up andhave this all be gone or a fraction ofit be gone or not be able to access itand that's when you also start torealize that when we talk about thisword trust that it's really about accessright when we talk about permissionlessaccess to the Bitcoin Network thatpeople still realistically need accessto theum to the U.S banking systembut the that access point isn'tinherently fragile because it iscentralized andYou Can Get Zapped and outovernight yeah it just happened like wejust said to many people over the lastthree days yeah soI mean going back to that point of thestate ofthe Bitcoin industry their access tobanking like we mentioned earlierI mean do you think that thisI have an opinion on but I want to hearyours is thischoke point 2.0or is Bitcoin and crypto being caught upinbroader systemic issues I think it willbe used as a patsy as a scapegoat Idon't think it's obviously I don't thinkit's driving any of this I agree thatit's purely fed driven but I do thinkI don't know it's like the conspiracytheorist because it was all there's alot of perfectuh sequence of events that have happenedum starting this time last year whereyou just have the blow up a Terra Lunathe blow up three AC the blow up a blockby Voyager Celsiusand inevitably FTX you get a cooling offperiod and then boom First Bank to godown to silvergate Second Bank issomewhat tangentially related silverSilicon Valley and it seems like if thegovernment wanted to pointin the in that and in the last threemonths you've had Elizabeth Warrensaying this is creating a systemic risklike these companies should not havebank accountsI think they're rearing The Narrativeengine to to pinpointthis cause of the crisis on bitcoin andcrypto but no I don't think it's a causeand I do worry that it could besuccessful in painting that narrativeand it could be hard for businesses toget bank accounts to begin onboardingpeople to bitcoin but who knowsyeah I mean I think thatumthere's clearly constituents what's thesaying that uh never let a crisis go towaste yes right thatI think this is something similar wherethe FED has caused the crisis I don'tthink that they hadum Bitcoin in mind but then others willseize on it to try to makepeople in the world of Bitcoins livesharder rightum I don't think that it's a coincidencethatumsignature out and that they there werethere were reports on Bloomberg thatthere were at least three other Bankslike realistically there's a lot morethan three other banks that are in asimilar situation but it's likesignature out now I would guess thatmore banks are going to be taken over bythe FDIC so it's like hey maybe it wasjustthis Capital could move a lot quickerbased on the nature of the depositsum but thatat the end of the day bitcoin's there toreplace the dollarand thatthe idea of everything is good forBitcoinand that Bitcoin strengthensin stress thatpeople are going to go out and findother banking relationships right and soif we're here in Austin again like allthe regional Banks seemingly haveproblems butum but jpmorgan's also banking coinbaseall right soumreleased they were and I expect theystill areumI know that coinbase was using SiliconValley Bank andum signature as well butum that people are going to go have torely on relationships to get access tobank accounts but at the end of the dayBitcoin has to survive independently ofthe dollar system and that episodes likethis will actually accelerate thatprocess right and that'sum I don't want to turn to it just yetbut that's like part of my issue withthis whole Noster thing too that's likethere's a lot that needs to be builtlike well everyone wasn't expecting youto bring them down well everyone's around with like social apps islikeyou know for the last month and a halftwo months like then the banking systemcollapse and then the banks that thatBitcoin companies have been relying onare gone overnightbut everyone's talking aboutsocial appsyou know I see now and we're in themiddle of this I seeParker's been screaming at me in thecomments for like two months like stoptalking about monster we've got to fixthis money system first it's like if youdidn't have access to the U.S bankingsystem as an on-rampwhat would you buildright that's what people need to bethinking about in Bitcoin because that'swhat that's ultimately what's going tohave to exist and that on the one handit's going to make a lot of people'slives more difficult of like access tobanking because the bank dollar systemis still the predominant system and it'slike we can't we can't put our heads inthe sand and act like that's not thecase butultimately that won't be there it'll allhave to be rebuilt and so thinking aboutwhen when these type of events happenwhen whether it's choke point or justyou know like go back to when I meanthis was before I was even in Bitcoinbut just using as a relatable examplewhen Mount gox failed could be like oh this you know dreams over it'slike no what what did people what didthe free market do it set off a wave ofof advancement of self-custody rightwhat will this do it will set off a waveof advancement of of transactionalcircular economy yeah and and not justlike circular economy in the sense oflike uh I'm gonna go buying in good butbut the tools that are necessary toum to make that happen right becauseit's not just like as easy as I'm goingto facilitate a payment like there's alot of infrastructure that needs to getbuilt between then Payroll Servicesthing you knowum so it's like what what if I couldn'trely on the dollar systemto to be this intermediary good whatwould I doum and I and I think that that will setoff a wave of people thinking not to saylike everything that people decide tobuild is just going to magically work orthat they're going to get the timingright but those are the type of thingsthat happen when you know kind ofeveryone's waking up and saying ah yeahlike maybe I took this you know I canuse the dollar as an intermediary forgranted what would I build if thatweren't the case because it seems likenow maybe I need to be thinking aboutthat on a much shorter time Horizon wellwith this context in mind what is yourpriority list of things that need to getbuilt look likeI mean I thinkit'sumultimatelyfacilitating direct Commerceum and that doesn't mean like hey wereally got to focus on this wordcircular economy but it is like hey likethinking about you know what would itlook like toum pay for power in Bitcoin or whatwould it look like to pay for gas andBitcoin orum you know how do we educate the peoplethat have the resources becauseeducation is a big part of this rightlike the I think the biggest risk tobitcoin is surviving the the dollarsdestabilization event because the dollarcoordinates economic activity and we allrely on the dollarum and that it'smaking Bitcoin functional and viable asa directum competitor or or like afunctional in directly facilitatingCommerce and directly facilitatingCommerce means not using the dollar asan intermediary you know so so and theanalogs is like what are all the thingshow are all the ways that the dollarused rightum because like an e-commerce payment isdifferent than aum like if you were thinking aboutsettling oil for dollars it would bedifferent than if you were buyingsomething on the Internet and it wouldalso be different than if you werebuying something at a point of salesystem yeah right in person so like theword payment has many different variantsif you were managing payrollin Bitcoin how would you do that there'sa lot of privacy concerns when you startto think about you know well ifum a company wasyou know out of a single transactionpaying all of its employees than everyemployee could theoretically knowyou know like what everybody else wasmaking right so the word payment is likeoverly broad right but it's thinkingabout all the different types oftransactions and then what are the mostimportant or what are the most importantrelative to where we find ourselvestoday so that's like one half of it theother half of it is like help educatepeople who have critical skill sets orthat you view as critical right becausethere's everything subjective but thingslike you know energy and food andtransportation and you know right likethe getting getting those people to bein a position to be able to see thislike one of the things I put outyesterday was like we got to get buckiesI saw I retweeted that you know wherebut it's like wellthere's actually a technology that needsto be builtum and when I say technology I use theterm loosely there's infrastructure thesoftware infrastructure that would needto be built if someone wanted to be ableto take Bitcoin and payments for as agas meters running it's similar to whatcompanies likeum sonoda orumum satoshi's Satoshi energy there's afew other distributed charge arethinking about like ways to to use thelightning Network to facilitate paymentsbut but realistically it's like hey ifnobody who sells gas accepts Bitcoin anddollar hyperinflatesthat's a real problem but how how areyou going to get there just using it asa I'm not saying gasoline is like theonly thing we have to be considered butbut what I'm talking about is likethinking about the problem firstsomebody that sells gashas toknow enough about Bitcoin to be willingtodeploy it right or to be able to putthemselves in a position to receive itthat's one half of the equation theother half of the equation is well howwould you technically do that you knowwould it be feasible andum and things critical points becausewhen I think about something like thatit's like okay well if someone who isdelivering gas toyou know a community of people wellthey've got a bunch of customers toobecause then they got to go up the chainright because there's ultimately that'soil and refining getting into gasolineum but like thinking about like thecritical economic pointsthat matter the mostum because those things don't justmagically happen overnightum and if people are diligent aboutspreading the word the more people thathave Bitcoin and understand Bitcoin atthe at the point of the dollardestabilizingthe more probably the less pain that'sgoing to have to be felt yeahI completely agree no I see why you'vebeen telling us not to focus on Masterfor the last couple months yeah I meanit's like if you go into a full-onbanking crisis it's like it's like beingthrown into the you know being throwninto to water you either sink or swimyeah right and that that's also whyum you know I don't get too caught up Ilike I I do think that there is a likethe hypocrisy of like the people likeBill Ackman andum David sacks and Jason kilcanis likelike to a certain degree it makes yourblood boil but then you have to kind ofput that down and be like honestly likethe whole system is broken and you gotto keep your eye on the prizeum it's like yes those people werelooking out for number one they don'tgive a about you knowthey're not Patriots they're not youknow they're not in this for theAmerican peopleumand and if you kind of detach from likesome of the cronyism that happens likeyeah it's like yeah so Silicon Valleypeople got bailed out whatever likethe whole the whole system is broken andwe have this new system Bitcoin and butif we don't focus with urgency to tobuild the things that we need and getdistracted then it's not to say that Imean Bitcoin Will Survive it's just weeither have to tolerate more pain ofeconomic instability or less and themore focusedand the um the quicker that we can buildinfrastructure to divorce from thedestabilization of the dollar the betteragreedand again it's pretty crazy that this isall happening right now as we're leadinginto the Bitcoin takeover at the end ofthis week there will be a lot of Bitcoinevents herein Austin during South by Southwestthroughout the week andagain talking about the motivation thefront end the first orderthat you need to knock down before youget to that implementation is educatingthese key stakeholders throughout theeconomy about why Bitcoin like how hasthe events of the last few dayssharpened what we're about to do thisweek in Austinyeah and I really think about it as likethis is Bitcoin week every ever I likesay every every week is Bitcoin week inAustin which it isummore and more bitcoiners are showing upto the shoresum from wherever lessuhthey're retreating yeahfalling back yeahumconsolidatingum and but so Tuesday we've gotumthe Austin lightning developers meet uphere at the commons Wednesday we'rehaving an hrf event with Alex gladsteinhuman rights Foundation kind of talkingabout what he's doing not only with thehuman rights Foundation but also inaround Bitcoin to advance freedomthroughout the world Thursday we've gota series of events Lisa's doing uh Lisafrom base 58 is doing a node LARP sokind of I've never done it I'm lookingforward to doing it an interactive kindof red mastering Bitcoin understandfairly well how Bitcoin transactionswork but a live interactive sessionwhere you're actually participating inat a technical level to understand thatthen we're having awesome bit devs laterthat night and then that that leads intothe Bitcoin takeover on Friday where thecommons will be wall-to-wall we've got20 speakers 12 talks kind of cover therange of you know the kind of reallytrying to do do a number of thingsthrough the Takeover but um it's reallybuilt for people that are highly engagedin Bitcoin as well as expanding the tentand sending that signal tonew people as much as being valuablewhich is hard to solve for both of thosetwo but but striking a balance to kindof go into kind of deepening people'sunder understanding of Bitcoin was likesending a signal to stakeholders thatmight not be as engaged or engaged atall to say like yeah I thought that thisthing Bitcoin wasuh uh you know kind of just like anotherthing to trade on the screen but there'sa bunch of people here that are laserfocused a bunch of smart people doing alot of interesting things buildinginfrastructure and talking about Bitcoinon a planethat I had never thought about it onum and soum you know really that's what theTakeover is about and I think thatit happening this week where we're inthe midst of you know Bank runs and bankfailures and systemic crisis that Ithink it will sharpen a sense of purposeof why people are here sharpened senseof Engagement also help Galvanize peoplebecause it is like it was a little bitscary like you know what if you went tothe bank and your debit card didn't workyou know like that would be like whatthe would you do you know so it'snot to make light of any of that but Ido think that it hap you know theTakeover in Bitcoin week in Austin thisweek happening with the backdrop ofwhat's happening in the Legacy Financialsystem it does renew a sense of purposeas well as individual focus of of whywe're here what we're doingum and how we're going to move forwardyeah what would we say to those thosepeople that we're trying to bring in toexpand the tent like this weekyou think any of them were saying like Ican't go to Austin like things are toocrazy I need to put my house in order uhbecause the banking crisis unfolding whyshould you take time this week to comelearn about Bitcoin yeah I mean I thinkthatum there are certain people I mean likeif you work for Signature you work forSilicon Valley Bank like I get it butumanybody else it's like the time now islike the only way we're moving forwardis is by forward Directionum and that now is the time to engage soit's like it like everyone has totake care of their their home base rightbutum but you have to do that while youcontinue to move forward and there I Irefuse you know it's likeI'm so glad that the the Takeover ishappening this week because it is thatit is a galvanizing Force but it alsorefocuses or it's like whatever you weredoingon whatever timeline whatever interestyou had in Bitcoin it should beaccelerated by this agreed right youshould be more motivated than ever ifyou're building in the space and that'sanother interesting thing to bring upobviously Bitcoin was birthed in theaftermathof the 2008 great financial crisisbetween now and then we've had Europeancredit crisis Cyprus like 2012 20112012. yeahumfast forward covid March 12 2020and now today 2023 we have this bankingcrisis bitcoin's reaction to thisparticular crisis that's unfolding rightnow seems to me to be very differentthan in the past like it seems like it'shit a point of maturity where people aretreating it differently in the midst ofthese crisesyeah well one I think that the crisesare all differentum and the timing is also differentright likeum I mean it remains to be seen butumthe the timings different sense of likeBitcoin has been going down for twoyearsyou know or like and when I say downlike I really try not to think about itlike you know likestock trading but like there's been alot of sellingyou know from really starting in the inMarch of 2021 April right like now kindof like rebound a little bit but thenyou know end of 2021 2022 is like that'sall it all feels like one cycle to meum and so it's just like anybody who wasa weak handlike doesn't mean that somebody elsedoesn't you know have some liquidityneed that pops up because of everythingthat's happened or get skittish or doubtsomething for some random reason butthatany weak hand has functionally beenselling for a long time already andthere just isn't that and you knowdirectionally can't be that much moremarginal selling pressure because ifyou're still holding Bitcoin after allthe that's happenedum you probably know something thatother people don't and that does notmean that everybody does rightinformation isn't perfect and there'sstill a chance that there's weekendsthere but that directionally there's alot less of them so at the same timethat that setup happens that oh yeahthere's this other banking crisis oranother banking crisis that has happenedthat's reinforcing the exact reason thatyou were there in the first place thateach next time that that happens youwould expect some different Behavior nowin a dollar liquidity crisis thougheveryone still needs dollars so everyonehas to be likemassively like have your head on aswivel you know like survive allweathers don't expect that just becauseBitcoins reboundingin the face of this like that is both avery good sign but it's like keep youreye on the ball like you know check yoursixyou knowprepare your life that at any pointBitcoin could drop 40 overnight or 50overnight because a Canada hasum but I do think like taking in what'shappening it is all relevant like allthis is playing out at a time whereumweak hands have already been shakenviolently out of the Bitcoin treeum what is unfolding is exactly whatbitcoiners broadly have been talkingabout why Bitcoin is so importantand they're starting qe5rightum soum the the future is uncertain but 21million Bitcoins are going to print a ton of money yeah I mean you haveto imagine there's a Hank Paulson likecharacter somewherethroughout the banking sector on hisknees in front of the buyingAdministration or Jerome Powell like youneed to step in and not only step in butstep in massivelyyeah I mean that was Jason calcanusand David sacks and you know but I hearyou like I'm saying like in like thepolitical climate I bet I would guessthat you know people in theadministration were looking at you knowthings that those people were sayingonline saying we need to do this I'msure there were people within the FEDthat were saying that as wellumit's inevitable though I think likethat's that's what I try to you knowkind of Rise Above The Fray be like thisisn't about this episode it's like if ifI think about the broadest picturebecause people were also talking aboutthis where that well if deposits aren'tinsured above 250 which they never werebut like if like if they actuallyhonored the the system then people arejust gonna hold treasuries and I it'slikewhenever Silicon Valley Banks sold theirdeposits their reserves to buy treasurysomebody else now has them so 100 ofdeposits are held Always by everyone 100of reserves are 100 treasuries but ifyou like look at the broad Dynamicum the I thinkthe amount of deposits that are outthere which is kind of demand deposittime deposits M2 is like 22 trillionif you if you pull we don't need to pullit up but but theum the amount of cash all cash the bankshave is 4 trillion or no three trillionit was four trillion and then they tooka trillion out there's seven X leveredto deposits right because like inaddition to deposits there's you knowwhich is one form of credit is there'streasuries and there's MBS and there'sall these things you know like you wantto get real scared like go look at theFannie Mae balance sheet they have likesomething like 70 billion of cash andlike 4 trillion of loans holy youknowum and they've got to reserve again someof like point two percent soum but but the point is thatlikeas soon as you go beyond there are22 trillion uh like M2 is 22 trilliondeposits 22 trillion those are claimsyou know not all demand deposits butbut you knowI don't we could pull up thedistribution but like those are adeposit is a deposit deposit someone'smind that if they show up to the bankand they ask for it it's there 22trillion of those and the banks onlyhave three trillion so doesn't matter ifyou say I'm going to honor allinsured and uninsured deposits fromSilicon Valley Bank that is the dynamicthat exists and if you have this too bigto fail prepscenario the people are going to havethe the incentive to moveum but it all comes back to the factthat there's too much debt and there'snot enough dollars and the amount ofdebtnecessitates that they have to printmore moneyandthe whole economic system breaks downbecauseas they print money the actual utilityof the currency degrades or debilitatesthe point where it can no longerfunction and we are certainlyaccelerating that path of when it nolonger works yeah I mean toto fix the systemic crisis that existsin the banking SEC sector you have tocreate a systemic currency crisiswith the value right because because ifbecause if you think about that we'reall 22 22 trillion of deposits threetrillion of actual casheach time there's a runthe reserves say the same the depositsstay the same they're just moving fromthe weekto what is perceived to be a strongerplace and the only way to make thesystem as a whole quote stronger is byincreasing the 3 trillionsuch that the the relative movement ofthe deposits on top expose a bank asbeing insolvent less and lessuh and that's what they will have to dothat's what they always have doneum and uh so they will have to toincrease the money supply that it willcause the function of credit tostabilize increase but the but thecurrency itself will degradeum because it will exacerbate it willallow existing imbalances to besustained and cause greater balances togrow yeah you heard it here first forxqe5 has started it started yesterdaystarted yesterday about6 30 PM Eastern less than 24 hours agoanything else we should add before wewrap up here I mean I think it's just tostay focusedum and it's like not to get caught up inthewhat's happening at the edges it's likeI kind of had this like mixed emotionwhere it's likeit doesn't really matter whether theybail out Silicon Valley Bank doesn'tmatter whether they bail out and likehow you're thinking about I mean thedepositors got bailed out 100 it wasabout Signature Bank same the only onethat didn't need a bailout was sort oflikeum you knowso and others willneed bailouts too but that it doesn't itdoesn't really matter because like it'slike it doesn't doesn't matter where theChrist the next Crisis was going touh where the symptoms of it we're goingto emerge first they were always goingto have to print moneyand Bitcoinever sinceyou know 2009 or a few years after whenit's when it you know kind of initiallyprobably fortified that it workshas been the solution so nothing haschanged in that regard right and likepeople can be pissed off thatum some wealthy people got bailed outbut like getting hung up on that isdistracting distractingum and that the the productiveuse of something like this is like okaylet's let's refocus on what it is we'rebuildinghow we're doing it what timeline how wethink about it because at the end of theday like Bitcoin is not like any anybodywho thinks that the dollar in Bitcoinare going to coexistin my view or it's like they're eitherliving a fantasy land because they andthey don't want to think about the whatwhat it means for the dollar todestabilize orum or they just haven't connected TheLogical dots that that it it won't makesense to have a currency sit on top ofBitcoin or in parallel I've never I'venever liked the theory that Bitcoin isgoing to strengthen a dollarI think that is I think it's it'sliterally just something that people sayum you know oftentimes because theydon't want to to become a politicalPariahumbut it's also not accurate you know likeif presented with a scenario where Icould have Bitcoin and it would betrustless and I could havepermissionless access to it and I couldhave you know both permissionless accessto hold it as well as to transmit itthat is always going to be better thanany other currencyif you put a dollar on top of that wellgive me the Bitcoin everyone's in thatlike in that trade-offum and soI think thatkind of the the productive thing to dosay okay likewe're not always going to live in thisDollar World andum and there's things that if we startto say like hey maybe this thisnon-dollar world is is sooner than wethink it might be because ofyou know the accelerating eventsprobably always has been the history waswritten but you know what am I going todo different today with that knowledgebecause it is an immunizing function forBitcoin boom a few banks that everyonerelies on gone well some people aregoing to survive other not everybodymight but some people areum and the ones that do are going toadapt and it is going to create thisfurther decentralization of the BitcoinNetwork because ultimately thedecentralization of bitcoin's liquiditycomes into eCommercesomeone selling something at a store acar dealer selling cars that liquiditybuilds and right now liquidity inBitcoin is logically and and I thinkreasonably Consolidated in the mostliquid asset which is the dollar or theEuro or the Yen wherever whateverwhatever currency it might trade againstum but ultimately money is not only themost liquid good it's the good that hasthe greatest diversity and that whenpeople think about selling a stock fordollars that's the thing about thedollar is liquidity but the Dollar'sliquidity is goods and services andthat's what Bitcoins will become and wedon't have to focus on like we needcircular economies it's just that weneed to be building infrastructure toallow for direct Commerce to allow forbitcoin's liquidity to diversify becausethat's where it was logically going togo anyways and now the the risk to thesystem is more clear and more presentthan it than it was to a lot of peopleyesterday yeahbatting down the hatches Freaks andumcome to all the Bitcoin events in AustinumI've got a few tickets in my back pocketum that I've held on to so if uh ifthere's any if there's a freak or twothat that sees this and says hey I needto get to Austin this weekuh just for the freaks yeah hereDME DM Parker I was gonna say battendown the hatches get focusedif you aren't invigorated right now andmotivatedto fix these problems because like yousaid was a bit unnerving over theweekend to watch all these bangs failandprominent people prominent companies notable to access their money reallydrove the problem that we're trying tofix to the four very aggressively in ashort amount of timewe've got a lot of stuff to build yeahwe've got a lot of people to educate alot yeah that's a big part of Educationlike helping people that have theseskill sets that are criticalum to our energy Supply chainsparticularlyway more important than a lot of otherthings agreed all right let's go get towork yeahpeace and love freaks",
