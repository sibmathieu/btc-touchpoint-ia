you're backing up any importantbitcoin wallet including the one we'regoing to be talking about today you'regonna want to get it in solid steelbecause just jot it on a piece of paperis not the best and it opens you up tothings like water damage or fire damagei have heard some horror stories pleasegive yourself the peace of mind ofknowing that a simple little mistakeisn't going to erase the backup to yourmoney uh bill foddle over at privacyprosdot io can help you out there with thatlet's dive in and get ourselves startedwith sparrowlet's just get a couple terms andconcepts out of the wayso first offbitcoin a bitcoin walletit does not just hold a singular balancewhen you receive transactions into yourwallet they are still separate much likewhen you hold a physical wallet and youreceive multiplebills with various denominations intoyour wallet those remains separate asyou receive them these are known asutxos in bitcoin so if i receive 0.1bitcoin and 0.2 bitcoin i don't justhave a singular balance of 0.3 bitcoin ihave a utxo for 0.2 and a utxo for 0.1when i go to spend those outi actually in some cases combine them soif i want to spend 0.25 bitcoin i'mgoing to need to combine the 0.2 withthe 0.1it's at that point kind of like smeltingdown pieces of gold and then creatingtwo new ones one for .25 and one for .05which would be my changein that processif eitherof those utxos are in some wayassociated with me like i bought someoff of a custodial exchange that knowsmy identitywhereas the other one i gotfrom a transaction from an individualprivately well now both of those utxosare now associated with having beenowned by myself and through this processpeople can begin to paint a picture ofhow much bitcoin you own this can beworrying not just in the instance ofoverreaching governments that may try toconfiscate your wealth if you're livingin a nation that does sobut also from the outside looking inindividuals may target you if they knowthat you hold a large amount of bitcoineither physically or digitally okay sojust keep in mind that it is in yourbest interest to try and protect yourprivacy when using bitcointhe process of coinjoin or in this casea whirlpoolimplementation in sparrowtakes your utxos combines them with theutxos of many other people all at thesame time and spends them back out intoyour own walletwhat is unknown is the um the bitcoinwho owns it at that point uh so ifsomebody knows you have a certain amountof bitcoin and you run it throughcoinjoin they know you still have thesame amount of bitcoin but it protectsyour privacy moving forward in that theydon't know which bitcoin is yours atthat point so that's what we'reaccomplishing here with coinjoin it alsosegregates individual utxos orindividual pieces of bitcoin so thatwhen you spend themuh it does not give away how muchbitcoin you also own previously to newpeople that you're transacting with sowith that said let's take a look atsparrow wallet and its coin joinimplementationall right so here we are with sparrowwallet you can get this onsparrowwallet.com download it directlytherei have previously done a video onsparrow so if you haven't checked thatone out already and you haven't usedsparrow at all you might want to go backand take a look at it because there's afew things that i'll briefly touch onhere but they may seem a little glossedover just because i already have thatresource for you so i'll link that inthe show notes down below if you're notfamiliar with sparrow but right nowwe're just gonna start from scratch andget ourselves set up with a new walletthat will be a our designated mixingwallet okay so from this main screenhere we've started we're gonna go up tofile and we're gonna hit uh not openwallet we don't want that we want sorrymiss click file we're gonna hit newwallet that's what we want and we'regonna give this a name okay so i'm justgonna call it uhtutorialmixes so there's no and zips or buttsabout it i know what this is okaytutorial mixes create walletnow we're going to do our basic walletsetup which we've done in previousvideosbut we're going to have it on singlesignature we're going to leaveeverything else be we're going to go tonew or imported software wallet and youcan choose your number of words here uh12 or 24 it's it's not really going tomake a big difference for you just forsimplicity's sake for this video i'mgoing to do uh 12and we're going to hit generate new i'mnot going to add a passphrase for thisyou could if you so choose againup to you but i'm going to hit generatenewandthat looks all good now i'm going tojust for the purposes of this videoplease don't do this this is the worstthing to do but again i'm going forspeed here i'm taking a quick screenshotof this so i can uh i can confirm thismomentarily much better to actually backit up well okayso please do not screenshot this that isbad practice i'm literally just doing itso we can do the confirming the backupright now okaysoi'm gonna go ahead i'm gonna hit confirmbackupand it says have you written them downyes obviously would you would have oryou would have put them into a billfoddleas i recommended as well i'm going tohit re-enter words and this is wherewe're going to retype in uh the seedphrase that we just gotokay great so i've retyped in my seedphrase i'm just going to hit create keystoreand then import key store this now givesme all the information i need to have awallet i'm going to hit applyand i'm not going to add a password hereagain you could different from apassphrase which would uh change theseed and create an entirely differentwallet this is just to get into thewallet itself so i'm not going to dothat right now just for simplicity sakeagainand this creates a brand new wallet forme which i can now utilize and that'sthat so we're all good and this looks alot like a regular sparrow wallet thatyou would set up that's because at thetime uh right now it is all right whatwe need to do is we need to add fundsinto this wallet before we can turn itinto a mixing wallet with all of thewhirlpool functions so we're gonna dothat nowwe're going to go to receivewe've got an address right here that wecan copy and i do have another walletpulled up that we're going to be sendingfromso this is green wallet or block streamgreen if you're unfamiliar i also have avideo on this onebut again i'm going to gloss over someof this stuff if you want to go back andwatch that you can so i've copied myaddress i'm just going to uh send somefunds we're actually going to send overumwe're gonna send over two transactionshere because i just want you guys to seewhat it looks like when you havemultiple utxos or or multiple uh piecesof bitcoin for lack of a better termsitting in your wallet i'm gonna pastein that address that i just copied ishould double check it to make sure it'sthe samelooks good to meokay now how much do i want to send overi would like to send over i'm going tosay600000 satsokay andi'd like this to go through relativelyquickly because i'm doing a video soi'll set my fee higherreviewokay that one is now sentand we're actually going to do one moreso first we'll go into transactionsand if you don't seeuh if you don't see ohthere we go okay finding transactionsthere we go we already see it anyways ifyou don't see your transaction rightaway and you know it's there you can hitrefresh all you do is you go to view andthen down to refresh wallet it'll checkthe mempool for any new incomingtransactions so we have that now thatthat has popped up we'll have a newaddress available in the receive screenandi can just hit copy therei'll head back over to greenwall i'll doone more sendi'll paste that in and this one i'mgoing to do for 500 000 setsand we'll bump up that feed and get itthrough quicklyall right that one is now sent off aswellwe can close at a block stream greenlet's do that refreshthere we gookay so we have two incomingtransactions once those are confirmedthen we'll be able to start mixing sowe'll be back when they are donenow that the transactions are confirmedand we can see this just from over herethis little pie it says we have oneconfirmationthis shows up to six confirmations butregardless you'll still be able to mixafter a single confirmation and the waythat we do this iswe're going to go down to on the lefthand side utxosokayand what you can do is you can selectoneor both utxosand you can seethe option tomix the selectedor send the selected we want to mix theselected we're going to do this withjust uh one of these utxos okay so i'mgoing to hit mix selectedand this bumps us into our introductionto whirlpool okay and soit says here uh mixing in bracketscoinjoin is provided in sparrow throughsamurai whirlpool coordinator sparrowcontains a whirlpool client whichcommunicates with the coordinator usingblinded inputs as such the privacy ofyour utxos is unchanged when using thisservice if you are using tor to connectto your server or you have configured ator proxy communication with thecoordinator will be over tor the feesfor using whirlpool service are deductedfrom the utxos that you mix these feesinclude the whirlpool fee and the minerfees required for the transactions allfees are displayed for review beforemixing begins so we can hit next by theway you will only see this the firsttime that you utilize whirlpool insparrow and after that it'll just beautomatic you don't have to go throughthese screens againit says you're going to uhsee a new type of wallet in fact a fewnew wallets that will sit okay so you'regoing to see premix postmix andbad bank okay and this basicallyseparates it into coins that have yet tobe mixed uh coins that have already beenmixed and are still actually being mixedthe they're they get remixed repeatedlyand we'll go into that momentarily andbad bank is the change from your mixesthat was not large enough to enter intoa mix itself okaythenif you have any sort of a codeto reduce costs of mixing you can enterit here if you so choosewhich i don't at the moment and theni'll hit next and then it says choosewhich pool you'd like to use below andyou get a drop down here of any that mayapply so it depends onhow much you are mixing now at the timeof recording this video i believe thereare four different pools you can enterinto100 000 sats1 million sats5 million sats and 50 million sats orhalf coin okay so those are the onesthat i'm aware ofyou can see here whenever you selectyour pool and again we can't see otherones because we don't haveenough to enter in to the next largestpool okaybut when you select your pool it willsay the pool fee to enter so in thiscase it's 5 000 sats to enter the 100000 sat pool okayuhnow i havefive utxos that i will get out of thisbecause it'si've selected my 600 000 sat utxo butbecause there are fees involved i canonly getfive mixes out of that and the restwould go to my bad bank wallet aka thethe change thatwould ruin my privacy if i combined itwith other mixes okayso uh yeah basically you're gonna choosethe pool that you're entering right herewe're gonna hit previewand here we get a good breakdown ofexactly what's happening with that utxoso i can see that i'm going to be takingmy 600 000 satsandpart of this is going to go 5 000 satsto the whirlpool fee for theircoordinator feethen there's going to be some changethere's going to be the change that'sgoing to go to my bad bank stuff thatwas not large enough to be a 100 000 satoutputthen there's going to be the individualoutputs which will be a hundred thousandstats plus the minor fee okayandwe can see the minor fee what it's setup right now it's set to high prioritywhichcould be changed initiallydepending on how you do that but we'vewe're already starting to go into themixing process you would change thatbeforehand in your in your send screennowwe can see again we can we can look allthrough these uh it actually has a fullbreakdown of all the utxos up here aswell you can click on them individuallyand kind of seewhat's happening with them umbut yeah that's that's pretty much itif everythinglooks good then i can go ahead and i canhit broadcast premix transaction so i'mgoing to go and do that nownow this popped up on my other screenbut i can see there's my broadcastokay so that has now broadcastedlet's talk take a look atwhat we're looking at and then we can wecan see new mempool transactions we cansee all of these different things thatare happening and i'm gettingnotifications up in the corner of myscreen so what is going on here what hasjust happenedwell as you can seein the top right here along the side ofsparrow there are now four tabsand each one of these is a separatewallet okay a totally separate walletthey're unlinked okaythis currently we are on the depositscreen or the deposit wallet and thenthere's all the typicalscreens all of the the other tabs thatyou would deal with within a regularsparrow wallet there's the transactionsthe send screen the receive theaddresses the utxos and the settingsyou're going to have those for everysingle one of these wallets okay so wecan seehere on our transaction screenwe had000 incoming 500 000 incoming and thenwe had 600 000 outgoing so there's still500 000 sats that we had previouslydeposited that are available within thiswalletnow from the send screen again it'spretty basic receive is pretty basicsame thing is still there addresses youcan see ones that we've interacted withalready and utxos we can see there'sjust a single utxo left in our depositwallet because we sent out the sixhundred thousand okay kind of get mydrift here so right now again we're justin the deposit walletlet's jump down to the pre-mix walletand here we seea totally different transaction screensend screen address screen utxo screenand settings all of this is separatefrom the deposit wallet we were justlooking at we were switching betweenwallets okay so now i seean unconfirmed utxo for 512000 sets now you might be looking atthat and goingwait512 you spent you sent out 600 000 satswhat's going onkeep in mindtransaction fee just the regulartransaction fee to send that money andthecoordinator fee the 5 000 sats it goesto samuraiand then on top of that anything thatwould not amount to a perfect 100 000satsactually got sent tobad bankand here we see just shy of 80 000 satssitting in bad bank so this is changethat would not have been a large enoughutxo to be mixed okay so that is sittingtherethe rest is in premixwaiting to be confirmed and then we'llsend out from here into mixes okayso now we have a little bit of a waitinggame again we gotta wait for aconfirmationso that this this 512 000 sats can besplit up into five utxos and mixed allright sojust so you knowand there's sometimes a little bit ofpanic people they look and they go wheredid all that money go what's going on isent out i don't understand this is whatyou're looking at you're looking at thesix hundred thousandminus the pool fee and transaction feeand then the change that went into badbank okaysowe will be back once this confirms andwhen we start seeing some mixesso it's been a couple of blocks since welast left off and now we can see acouple things are starting to happenwe see that the deposit into our premixthat we madeis now it has a couple uha couple confirmations okay twoconfirmations on that initial 512 000sets and we know thatthere were fees involved with that andthe rest is sitting in bad bank overhere and that also has two confirmationson ithowever we also see now a newa new transactionfromthe premix walletand it's for 102 420 setssowhat's happening here what is thiswe can seethat this transactionis actually and it's unconfirmed rightnow but this transactionis headed intopost mixand here's what's going onlet's go back to premix here that 102000 sats is a hundred thousand sats thatwill be our mixed utxo and then thetransaction fee attached to it okaysothat means that when that confirms wewill have one utxo sitting here in postmix that now has the links between usand those coins brokenand you'll continue to seenew transactions split off from thisfive hundred twelve thousand sets andfive of themthat will result in five separateone hundred thousand sat utxos that aremixed with the links between them and usbroken all right so you can see actuallythe subtraction here you can see theinitial incoming transaction for 512and then you see the withdrawal or thespend of just over a hundred thousandand then the remaining balance here of409 the top is the most recent okay sothat's what's now sitting in pre-mix is409 000 sats okayin post mix we can see waiting to beconfirmed a hundred thousand cents andwhen we get another one that number willgo up we'll see another hundred thousandincoming with a balance of two hundredthousand until it gets all the way tofive hundred thousand with the leftoverssitting in bad bank right here okayso let's reiterate what we're looking atlet's go todepositoh i see a new one oohmore coming in all right let's let'sjump in let's see what's going on herelet's jump back to premix oh we seeanother outgoing for a hundred and twothousand satsand in post mix we see another incomingfor a hundred thousand sets fantastic sowe're starting to see more mixes comingthrough all right soit can take a minute to wrap your headaround where coins are going and what'shappening but let's just reiterate whatwe're looking at we have our depositwallet this is where you add funds thatyou would eventually like to mix okay wehave our premix wallet these are fundswhere you've selected and said startmixing these now they will get depositedand then they will automatically startgetting spent outas mixesinto oh here comes another one there wego intopost mix okay and this is where all thefully mixed coins will reside asseparate utxosand your change from everything that wasnot large enough to be mixed will residein bad bankand to look at it another waylet's go up to deposits we can look atutxoswhat's left in here well we did twodeposits but we didn't mix one of themso 500 000 sats are still sitting therewe had decided to mix the 600 000if we switch to the premixand go down to utxos we can see thatwe've gotuhunspent transaction outputs we've gottwo of them sitting there i believe allright um and we also have the post mixgo to utxos we've got three of them hereand here it actually designates how manymixes they've been through because aslong as they're sitting in here and theoption to stop mixing is not ticked theywill be re-put through mixes until uhyou you tell them to stop basically oruntil you spend them out and thenfinally bad bank same thing if we go toutxos we've got a single utxo for 79 000sats okayso wewill wait for at least a single mix forall of them oh and i should sayhere we're in premix right nowevery once in a while you will see thisnotification mix failedtypically what happens hereis if they start setting up a mix andsomebody in that that mix disconnects itwill cause a failure of that set mixokay and so they'll add another personand they'll retry so don't panic toomuch about thatbut i will give some tips and tricks ofif you notice things failing more or ifyou see that things are not mixing afterextended periods of time things that youcan try but we'll come backwhen uh the premix is effectivelyfinished and we've got at least a singlemix on everythingso here we are with everything now inthe midst of well having already beenmixed and in the midst ofgetting a full six confirmations foreverything so right nowwe are sitting in the post mix and i cansee there are now five utxos all ofwhich have been through a mix if we jumpback to the premix we can see thetransactions of those utxos going out wecan now see there is a zero balancesitting in pre-mix okay so everythinghas gone out of this wallet either topost mix here or to bad bank here whichis our change umthat we could utilize once this uh getsbig enough to actually mix itself okayum so let's take a look in the post mixhere we just got another confirmation soalmost six confirmations for everythingnow i want to take a look now atdo we want this to sit here in post mixforever just in a hot wallet well i meanif if you're trying to hold for a longtime which i hope you are then ideallyno you don't want this constantlysitting in a hot wallet howeveryou probably do want it to go throughmore than a single mix probably probablya fewnow let's talk a little bit about howthese mixes work so effectively thefirst mix of each utxo is likely to bethe quickest okay so and the reason isbecause you're paying the fee for thatandyou're also covering the fees and thetransaction fees for everybody that'salready been through a mix and joinsinto the new mix with you so what i meanhere is you see all these five utxosonce they've mixed a single time theycan keep remixing again and again andagain as many times as i like but thatmay take some time and i don't have topay any further fees for that to happenbut i do have to wait for new people tojoin and start mixing new utxos orsimply i just need to wait for new utxosthat have never been mixed by otherpeopleto request to create a coin join andthen myalready mixed ut exos may be eligible tojoin those okay but the requirements arethey need i believe either two or threepreviously unmixed or or premix utxosfrom people in order to cover the feesfor the remaining ones that go into thisand sothey will sit sometimes it can take sometime you got to be patient butideally you want to have a few mixesto to really separate you and your utxhoststhat said you probably want these incold storage eventually now sure youcould go and you could send eachindividual utxo to cold storagethe problem with that is one you'regoing to be paying the fees for that thetransaction fees and twoyou can make mistakes in doing that inthat if you send all of these togetherthen it kind of joins them and anddenotes common ownership and ruins itruins some of your anonymity that youestablished there okay so it's not idealto do that however there is a killerfeature here on sparrow what you can dois you can actually set a threshold forhow many mixes you want these guys to gothroughand then have them auto mixinto cold storage you heard that rightyou can have a mix execute and then thatutxo go out to cold storage that youhave establishedso if i go down so right now we are inpost mixand we look at our utxos you can seeokay each one of these has a single mixokay fair enough what ifand and you know like a offive mixes would be pretty pretty solidbecause then it's uh25 utxos because each one of these areare umone out of five that's kind of youranonymity set so25 that would be pretty good okayhowever for the purposes of this videoi'm just gonna set a threshold of twookayand what i'm doing here is firstwe need todecide where these are going to be sentto what wallet are they going to be sentto umand where are they going to be held welli've got a cold cardnormally i would air gap this but it'splugged in right now just for thepurposes of this tutorial if you'reunfamiliar with how to useany hardware wallet with sparrow again idid a full video on it you can checkthat outbutfor this video all i'm going to show isjust adding a wallet and mixing to itokay so i've got my cold card it'splugged in right now and what i can dois i can go filenew walletand let'slet's name this atutorialcold card because that's exactly what itis it's my cold card that i keep fortutorials okay so i'm going to hitcreate walletnow i want this from normally it wouldbe air gapped because i would use the sdcard but we're going to do connectedhardware wallet because it's currentlyconnected and i'm going to scan for itit pops up right now that's plugged ini'm going to hit import keystoreokay and then i'm going to hit applyno password for nowperfect okay so we now have our tutorialcold card all set up um againaddresses everything is all right thereso what i can do now and by the way yourwallets are still up here my my mixingwallet is up and then i can click thetab to go over to the cold cardso in order to utilize this you have tohave the designated hardware wallet thatyou wantthe account for that or the wallet forthat needs to be open okay for this towork so what you're going to do is ifyou want to mix after a certainthreshold directly into your coldstorage you can hitfirst of all i believe you have toselectall the utxos you you click mix2and then you say mix to walletlook at thattutorial cold card how many minimummixes do i want i'm just going to say 2and then i'm going to hit restartwhirlpooland there we goso what should happen nowis thatwhen any of these utxos get to two mixesit should mix directly intomy cold card and keep in mind it needsto be open and the reason for that isthatthis wallet heredoes not have the permissions to justpull my public keys and generateaddresses it needs to be actively openso sparrow can say okay we need areceiving address to go over here sothat this mix will go intothe cold card okay so that is what'shappening you can see these ones arebeing queued up for subsequent mixes andthen they should go to the cold cardafterwardsso we'll come back when we see thathappen at least oncesuccess we do have a successfulsecond mix on one of our utxos which wasthen subsequently sent over to the coldcard now normally if you had set this toa higher threshold of oh there'sthere's another confirmation on itanyways if you had set the thresholds tohigher than two then it would show thesenumbers as subsequent mixes happenhowever since our threshold was sent toset to just two mixes we won't see thesenumbers change we'll simply see utxosdisappear and be sent outto our cold card and we can navigate tothat through the top here again rightnow we're in our tutorial mixes walletthat we created and we're in the postmixwallet of that but we can click over tothe cold card and we can see thatthere's a utxo there that has been mixeda second time although it won't show howmany times it's been mixed herebut it was sent immediately once it hitthat threshold it was sent directly tothe cold card so it now resides there weknow what our threshold was before so weknow it's gone through two mixes um akait's got a anonymity set of tenone of it's one of ten possible utxos umone of ten possible ownerscould have this so that's what i referto when i say our anon setlet's just walk through exactly what wedid in this video one last time just toclarifyinitially when you start a new wallet insparrow it will be a regular wallet andit will not have all of these littlesub tabs that you can navigate betweenthese will not currently existwhat you will dois you will go to receive and you willsend bitcoin to your regular walletonce that is confirmed you can thennavigate down to utxosselect the amount or all of the utxosthat you want and hit mix selectedwhat this will do is create atransaction and send outand create a new set of walletsthese will bethe deposit wallet which you had justusedand then it will add premix postmix andbad bankas this initially gets set outsent out rather you will seea few things happen you will seeutxos pop up in your premix wallet okayyou'll see incoming an incomingtransactionuh and you'll be able to navigate downto utxos and see them hereall right and you will also see moneycome into your bad bank which is anychange that is not large enough to bepart of a mixeventually you will be able to mix thisand i'll explain that in a secondbut let's jump back to premix you willhave utxos here and you will havetransactions that gradually go out inthe size of the pool that you are inwhether it be a hundred thousand amillion five million 50 million satswhatever it may be they will go out inthose chunks gradually over time not allat the same timeeventuallythis entire set of satswill be sent outinto post mixyou will see transactions coming inagain one at a time into this wallet andif you navigate down to utxos you willsee them here and they will have anumber of mixes that they've beenthrough anything in postmix will have atleast one mix behind it meaning thatit's one of five possible owners whenlooking at the utxo it could be you orit could be four other possible peopleand somebody on the outside looking inhas no ideathese will continue to be mixedindefinitely with new participants intosamurai whirlpool uh and into thesparrowwhirlpoolimplementation until you say otherwiseand the way that you can say otherwiseis if you hit the stop mixing buttondown belowif you close down the walletorif you choose to mix to a separatewallet which we did too okaywhen we mix to a separate wallet youneed to designate what that wallet isand it needs to be open at the same timewhich we had right here with the coldcardand ifyou have that selected what you will seeis whatever your number of mixesthreshold you will see those numberstick up and once it hits the number thatyou've desired for example in thisinstance we did too rather than seeing atwo it will immediately be sent out ofthis wallet into your hardware walletas it hits that threshold and we sawthat happen with our cold card and we'vegot one utxo sitting there fully mixedas per our specificationsfinally let's take a look at your badbank one thing i wanted to quickly touchon is these aremixable but over time you may just haveto build up enough to hit that thresholdso right now we have a utxo here that isthat is about 80 000 sat that's notenough to be into that 100 000 satmixing pool butif we do another mixwith some new utxos the change may addup to be enough to actually mix themtogether so you would click and selectall the utxos that are in here and thenyou would click mix selected and you'dbe able to choose your pool size and mixthem through and they would be sent outfrom here into yourpremix and then your post mix just likebefore and any change would remain herein the bad bank wallethopefully i know that's a lot buthopefully that will start you down thatpathlet's talk a few tips and tricks just incase you run into troublenow one of the main names of the gamehere is patience as i said before thesethings don't happen immediately you haveto take time particularly if you'rewaiting on remixes the initial mixeswill be a little bit quicker the remixescan take quite a bit of time becausethere needs to benew utxos ones that have not previouslybeen mixed in every round of mixing sothat means two or three out of the fiveneed to be new utxos brought in byyourself potentially others probablyothersand they need to be part of that mix ifthere are not enough you new utxosentering whirlpool well then you'regonna have to wait and there's a queueof people waiting to be remixed so againit can take some time be patient howeverif you're not seeing any action on yourinitial mixes you can do a couple thingsyou could go towe'll use postmix as an example becausewe don't have anything in premix you canstop and restart mixingif that fails to do anything you canshut down the entire client and reopenit again and i did see some success withthat when i felt like things had stalledup a
