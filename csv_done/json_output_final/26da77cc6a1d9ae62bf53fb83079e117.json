  "text": "[Laughter][Music][Applause]hello everyone I've been with the BTCsessions I'm here in downtown CalgaryCanada and today I'm gonna be checkingout the electrum wallet for desktop andI'm running this on Mac OS so electrumis a little bit more of an advancedwallet so if you're not privy to how toconstruct a basic Bitcoin transaction orperhaps you've never used Hardwarewallets and you're just a beginner Iencourage you to check out the linksdown below with content that I'vecreated around those subjects do thatfirst before checking out this walletbut for those of you that are a littlebit more advanced in your Bitcoin usageI wanted to check out this walletbecause it's been around for a long timeand it enables a lot of differentfeatures that most wallets do not sowithout further ado here is my video onelectrum for desktop after these CDswould be do you guys enjoy my content ifso there's two easy things that you cando to make sure you always know whenstuff comes out number one of course hitthat subscribe button number two hitthat little bell icon right next to thesubscribe button so that you make sureyou turn on notifications every time Iput out new content now on to the videoso I've already downloaded electrum fordesktop I will have links for that downbelow but once I open it up you're gonnasee your wallet name here now you canrename this to anything you like becauseyou're being you're creating it fromscratch so I'm gonna name this one BTCsessions test and I'm gonna go ahead andhit the next button now we get to choosewhat kind of wallet we want standardtwo-factor multi-sig or import we'restarting from scratch so we're justgonna select standard and hit next noware you gonna create a new C do you haveone do you have a master key do you havea hardware again we're starting fromscratch we're gonna create a new seedswe'll hit next now we get to choose astandard or a seg wit wallet addresstype here now and please note back 32 isgoing to be used here which meessentially it's not backwardscompatible some waltz will not be ableto scan your addresses unless they havesig wit I'm okay with this because I'dlike to drive segment forward so I'mgonna use the segment option if you'renot okay with that you can just hitstandard and it will work fine with anywallet now this is your walletgeneration seed it's basically a backupof the keys to your account so you have12 words here that you need to writedown and soar safely do not share thiswith anybody because they will be ableto access your funds so you're gonna goahead and you're going to write downthese words and come back okay so nowthat you've written down those wordswe're gonna help go ahead and hit nextand it gives you a screen where you'regoing to go ahead and type in all of thewords in the order you've written themdown you'll notice that it gives yousuggestions of words that it could be tokind of speed up the process and makesure you don't have spelling errors onceyou get through all 12 words you willsee the next button actually light upand you can go ahead and hit it downbelow to move on now this is where youencrypt your wallet keys I highlyrecommend you do this select a passwordone that you will remember there is nosuch thing as password recovery here butthis prevents somebody from being ableto spend from your wallet if they getahold of your computer or just yourwallet file so if your computer getshacked now it can be brute forced butkeep in mind it's just an extra layer ofsecurity we're going to go ahead and hitnext and your wallet is now set up andready to useokay so now that we've set everything upwe're just gonna do an overview of whatwe see in front of us okay so up top wecan see the electron version number thename of your wallet and the type ofwallet in this case standard that wehave we have three tabs up top yourhistory of previous transactions a sendscreen you can tap on and a receivescreen that you can tap on and we'regoing to get into those too in a momentbut let's go back to the main page hereis where you're gonna see all yourprevious transactions you can sort bydate description amount and balance andall of your transactions would be in themiddle here of course we don't have anyright now down below your balance inBitcoin in u.s. dollars and you can seea peg of how much Bitcoin is worth inu.s. dollars and you have some moresettings down here if you tap the lockyou can change your password you can tapthe Settings here and you have a wholebunch of stuff we'll get into this in amoment if you tap here you can get yourseed to the backup phrase we just wrotedown we don't need that right now so I'mnot gonna bother entering the passwordand finally you can tap here to get yournetwork information servers all thatstuff we're not gonna dive into that yetso we're gonna close that up and move onoh and one other thing up top here youhave all your other sub menus we wantI'm gonna use those right now butmomentarilywe will okay so I'd like to dive intothe settings a little bit more just tosee what's in there and change somestuff for myself the first tab iscentered around fees so you can changethings as to how the fees are set youcan have a static amount you can have itkind of change as is or you can checkthe mem pool for how busy it is you canedit these fees manually this is on bydefault and you can use RBF which isreplaced by fee so if you find atransaction isn't going through fastenough you can change the fee after thefact so I'm going to keep that on if wehead over to the transactions tab herethere's all this stuff regarding changeaddresses now if you're unfamiliar withwhat these are you can hover over eachone it will actually give you anexplanation as to which these optionswhat they'll do is all sentimproved anonymity with yourtransactions now if you go to appearancethere's a couple things I'd like tochange languages find decimals are fineI'm gonna change the base unit toSatoshi's which is the smallest amountof Bitcoin you can have I just likeseeing this because it keeps me in asaving mode and that's kind of where I'mat right now you can change your blockExplorer so which company is running thenode that you see your information fromand you can also go ahead and change thetheme so the theme here I'd like to usethe dark theme and we won't see that inAct until we restart now I'm gonnachange my currency my fiat currency I'min Canada so I'm gonna go ahead and findC ad select that a lot of these optionsin the middle I don't really need to seethe history of the rates of Bitcoin atthe time so that's fine I'm gonna leaveall that off and then I'm gonna changethe source of my price to local bitcoinsI just find it's a bit more accuratehere in Canada when I do that now thisis all related to identity stuff youdon't need to know about this but thereare links explaining it I'm gonna leavethat stuff alone and I'm gonna hit closenow it's gonna tell me here if I want tosee those changes I have to restartelectrum so I'm going to go ahead I'mgonna hit quit and once that closes downI'm gonna open it up one more time andwe should see those changes enacted so Ican already see that the dark theme isbeing used now so I'm just gonna plunkin my password and when I hit next weshould notice the other changes whichare actually down here in the bottomleft I can see that it's now Canadiandollars and I can also see it'sSatoshi's as opposed to full Bitcoinokay so I want to show you one morething before we get into everything elseis how to create a backup of your walletas a file so you're gonna go to file andsave copy and this is where you get toactually save a new copy of the exactsame wallet so I'm gonna name this BTCsessions test1 and I want to save it tomy desktop so I'm gonna click on desktophere I'm gonna type in the name of myfile up topBTC sessionstest one and then I'm gonna go down tothe bottom right and I'm gonna clickSave so what this does is it creates anew file on my desktop which is an exactcopy of the wallet I had on my desk onmy computer already so in order toaccess that what I'm actually gonna dois I'm gonna shutdown electrum so I'mgonna go up and I'm gonna hit quit I'mgonna reopen and so once I get to themain screen its gonna say which walletdo you want to use so I'm gonna hitchoose and I'm gonna navigate to mydesktop and click on BTC sessions testone when I hit open I'm prompted for apassword this is the exact same passwordthat we use for the other wallet and I'mgonna hit next and that opens it upagain exactly the same wallet regardlessof what computer you're on where you arethis is a copy of your wallet now keepin mind when you have a file like thissomebody can try to brute-force itsomebody can try and use your passwordand try and get in so I'm gonna quit I'mgonna go back out and I want to show youthis because I did this the first timewhen I open up electrum again I wasn'tsure where my old wallet file wasbecause I'm neglected to check so I wasa little confused cuz I defaulted to thenew file that I had created so if youactually delete the file and get rid ofit or move it somewhere else what you'llsee instead is you're gonna see defaultwallet because it's not sure what fileyou want to use if you hit shoes it willdefault you back to the folder and youshould see your old wallet file therebut depending on your computer whatyou're running it may be stored indifferent areas so I'm gonna select myold wallet file put in my password andhit next and here we are back everythingback to normalok now that we've gotten through all ofthat let's test out receiving atransaction so when I hit the receivetab you can see you're receiving addressyou're gonna see a QR code and you cantap this button to copy your address tothe clipboard which can then be pastedwherever you like alright so that's theinformation people need to send youmoney you can actually specify an amountyou'd like to receive so as you typethat in notice the QR code is changingand it also shows the Canadian dollaramount beside ityou can also set that request to expireeventually but we don't need to do anyof that right now if you tap on the QRcode it opens it up in a separate windowas well now what I'm gonna be doing justoff screen here is I have samurai Walleton my mobile phone and I'm going to beconstructing a transaction and sendingsome money to this wallet now if you areunfamiliar with samurai wallet I willlink down below to a tutorial on how touse it but right now what I'm doing isI'm sending over some bitcoins so thatwe can then play around with it once itarrives I believe we'll see some sort ofa notification here and we'll be able tocheck on the status of the transactionso on and so forth so let's just waitfor that to come through okay we nowhave a notification in the top right andwe can see down below we have someunconfirmed funds if I tap on thehistory tab we now see the transactionlisted here we can see again down belowif we double click on it then we can seeall of the advanced transaction datahere and you may or may not need thisyou can see the size you can see the feethat was paid all of that inputs/outputsif that is not important to you thenthat's fine but it's good to have therejust in case so we will return when thisis confirmed and we can actually sendout the funds from the wallet all rightso we have a confirmation on thistransaction if I double click into ityou can see one confirmation all of thedetails there and the pie chart on theLeft starts to get filled in eventuallyafter six transact confirmations it'llbe all filled in so if I go to the sendtab we're gonna try sending out nowthere is a QR code scanner here or youcan paste in an address I have a filehere with an address that I'd like tosend to so I'm going to paste that intothe pay to field now I could enter adescription here I'm not gonna botherand then you're gonna set the amountthat you'd like to send it oh right it'sin satoshis so I'm gonna send outhalf of this I'm going to send out50,000 Satoshi here and you can see theCanadian dollar amount beside it nowdown below you get to set yourtransaction fee and it's actually aslider so I can slide this left to rightand it'll actually tell me how long it'sexpected the transaction to officiallyconfirm and it'll tell me the totalamount for the the transaction you canalso preview it here and see all of thatinformation right in front of you I'mfine with this so I'm gonna go ahead I'mgonna hit Send and I'm prompted to entermy password again so if you do leaveyour wallet open you've got that extralayer of security still and it sends offand everything is all good now I didnotice that transactions tend to not popup in the history right away it is alittle bit of a pain kind of annoyingthat it doesn't show up super fast ifyou do restart the wallet it does tendto be there right away sometimes if youclick around a little bit it'll show upI'm not quite sure the reason for thedelay you know it's it can be worryingwhen somebody goes to send it off andthey don't see it immediately sohopefully we see this show up prettyquick there's no refresh button that Ican see here but yeah so I don't know ohthere we gothere it is so I guess it's not a superlong wait but it can be disconcerting ifyou don't see it right away againtransaction you can double click on itand see all of the relevant informationif you'd like to go into that but otherthan that transaction is sent and we'regood to go now there is one other coolthing I want to show you with the sendfunction here so if I go to sandnormally you can just put in a singleaddress but there is actually one othercool thing I believe it is in the toolsbar so if you look down a little bitthere's an option that says pay too manyand when you click on this you can nowenter more than a single address soyou're sending to multiple people at thesame time so in the document behind mehere I've got two addresses now so Icould copy one and I could paste it inon topand then I could go down a line andenter a second or third or fourthaddress and pays it in and once I havethat I can continue on to thetransaction as normal and send off tomultiple parties in a single transactionthis actually will save me ontransaction fees as well because it'sbeing optimized now one last cool thingI want to show you guys with electrumI'm just gonna reopen here and we'reactually going to use a hardware walletso I already have a ledger plugged inwhat I need to do is I need to type in aname that I'd like to have for thatwallet and it's gonna tell me it doesnot exist you're creating a new filethat's fine we're gonna hit next whatkind of wall do you want I just want astandard wall in this case I'm gonna hitnext and now the keystore you're gonnalook down and the last option it tellsyou you can choose a hardware device andwhen I hit next if it's plugged in andyou've put in your PIN and everything itshould recognize the device you're gonnahit next you need to choose your wallettype so do you want a legacy address doyou want segue or do you want nativesegue which is not actually availablewith the regular ledger software soelectrum actually gives you some extraoptions here so I'm gonna choose thatI'm gonna hit next encrypt wallet filethat sounds great to me I'm gonna hitnext and it will open up and you havethe exact same functionality as you didwith the regular electrum wallet butyou're utilizing your ledger or whateverHardware wallet you happen to be usinghere everything is the same you can sendyou can receive all of that is the samewith the added security of having ahardware wallet so I'm just super happythatelectrum is so versatile and it givesyou options above and beyond actuallywhat the native hardware wallet softwarewould so for advanced users that reallywant to get the most or their ledger ortreasure really great with electrum andI'm super impressed with it can't sayenough good things about this so yeahfeel free to dive in nowlet's just take a quick look if we quitand we go back in we should be able tochoose now so it defaults to ledgerthat's the last one was open but if wechoose we see both files so BTC sessionstests to sell their Ledger's is stillthere now if I go to open it it is stillplugged in and initiated and I can justopen it up like normal but if it wasn'tplugged in you would not be able toreopen and get in and start sending andreceiving transactions so just keep thatin mind don't panic if it's not pluggedin and it's not working thank you guysso much for watching please don't forgethit like and subscribedrop the tip of you're able to can sharethis video I'll see you guys next timeon the VTC sessions[Music]",
