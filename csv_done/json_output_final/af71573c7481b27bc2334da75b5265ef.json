With a U.S. popula­tion of 325 million, 3% is 10 million.Nassim Nicholas TalebA fintech fund that’s been in the Bitcoin space since 2012 recently ran intense analysis resulting in the best estimate I’ve seen for Bitcoin owner­ship.  Just 7 million people globally are storing $100 of value or more in the Bitcoin protocol.  For round numbers, let’s assume half of those people are in the U.S., and that one-seventh of those are above a more signif­i­cant threshold like $2500.  That’s just 500,000 U.S. citizens with a meaningful amount of Bitcoin.  And of those, what percentage actually under­stand and care about Bitcoin to the point where they would fight for it?  Let’s be generous and say 20%.There are approx­i­mately 100,000 Bitcoiners in the United States.  This means that just to get to “intran­si­gent minority” levels, we need a 100x increase.  This is why adoption dominates all other prior­i­ties for Bitcoin.Bitcoiners have already knocked out so many potential attack vectors and handled so much FUD that there’s not much downside risk.Cory KlippstenAnother concept Taleb refer­ences throughout the five volumes of his Incerto is: Protect Your Downside.  Bitcoiners have already knocked out so many poten­tial attack vectors and handled so much FUD that there’s not much downside risk left for Bitcoin.  But there is some, whether you handicap it at sub 1%, sub 10%, or more.  And by far the most threat­ening attack vector, in my opinion, would be a concerted effort of the U.S. govern­ment at many levels attempting to stamp out Bitcoin in an effort to maintain dollar hegemony across the globe.Let’s be clear: Bitcoin would survive even the most concerted and vicious attack by the U.S. govern­ment.  It might even thrive, Antifragile-style (another Taleb book), with people around the globe snapping up sats en masse as they witness the erstwhile hegemon lash out.  But it could also play out differ­ently, with a massive drop in network activity and value, thousands of individual lives irreparably disrupted, and the delay of our bright orange future by decades or longer.This, to me, is unaccept­able.  That is why I have dedicated my life to recruiting the other 99% of our intran­si­gent Bitcoiner minority here in the United States.  There are 100,000 of us already.  Help us recruit the other 9.9 million.Sign up to start saving BitcoinBuy automatically every day, week, or month, starting with as little as $10.Open your AccountCory KlippstenCory Klippsten is the CEO of Bitcoin financial services firm Swan.com.
