  "text": "okay Michael this is uh it's my sonConnorgreat to meet you Connor cheersuh we've told him a lot about you I'mgoing to tell you a little bit about himso he quit uni how long ago about amonth ago and I'm conscious when we makethis podcast you do interviews you do alot with most of the time if not all thetime talking to our peers or people overa similar age but there's a wholegeneration like Connor who some of themhave gone to UNI and realized it's notfor them some of them are learningthings right now even think of mydaughter which are going to be uhunrequired with AI in the future and soI think there's this whole differentcrowd that we can talk to but adjustingfor someone like Connor you like youlook you know you've been successfulyou've had a hugely successful careerit'd be good to hear some of the mostimportant lessons you've learned thatmaybe you could share with Connor andConnor might have some questions backwell cool well first of all you're luckyyou get to start life freshwith uh none of the baggage of the restof us and and uh the opportunities inthe 21st century are extraordinaryumI was uh I was at a a social Gatheringuh a number of years ago and uh amulti-billionaire walked up to me andand he said I've got uh I've got twins aboy and a girl and on their 21stbirthday I want to give them a book ofadvice that I gathered from all of myfriends so if you could I want you towrite down your advice to my 21 yearolds on on the occasion of theirmaturity and uh I said really yeah yeahand I'm going to put it together withyou know everybody else I know and so Isaidokay I guess I can do that and I thoughtthat was one of those things where hewas going to wait a few months and Iwould send it by email but he takes outa little red book he puts it my handwith a pen he says okay write them downnowlike it's a big part is cocktail partythose people are going you know aroundand it's a spectacular Villa lookingover the Mediterranean and I didn'treally think I would be asked thisquestion you know give me advice for twoyou know young adults but I thought okayso I sit down and I wrote down 10 thingsand I handed it back to him so I'm goingto start by giving you those 10suggestions and then I'm going to giveyou uh some practical suggestions that Iwould give to anybodyum that go beyond the theory okay so thetheory uh oneFocus your energy you think you can doeverything you can't and everybodyoverestimates all the things they can dothe things I regret in my life are allthe good ideas I pursued to thedetriment of my great ideayou know you're going to have 27 goodideas and they're going to be and andPeter interviews people with good ideasall the time and then you ask thequestion well do we have the energy tomake it work so you got to focus come onevery time I do an interview withMichael it ends with the meme telling methis again as well focus and that's yougo to my Twitter profile I got lasereyes the message of laser eyes isfocused I'm I'm not against a thousandthings I am not in favor of a hundredthings I am simply trying to advocatefor one thing and the the one thing isBitcoin so Focus your energy uh secondguard your time everybody's gonnaactually want to take your time there'sgoing to be a million things you do withyour time and and you know when I wasgrowing up we had like three channelsand we had like every night programmingthat was original from 8 to 11.andyou know there was no porn like therewas one Playboy magazine I saw in thewoods once in my entire childhood why isit always in the woods do you rememberthat there's always good I was sittingin some like wrecked car you know and itwas you know it was legendary all theteenage boys would talk about the one inPlayboy Magazine you know uh and sotoday you've got twitch and you've gotYouTube and you've got Infinite pornyou've got infinite games and you've gotinfinite you've got infinite everythingand if you look at the scourge ofmodernity it's every possible thingpeople ever thought they might want wefigured out how to manufacture it inbulk pharmaceutical grade and drive thevariable cost to zeroso uh infinite music used to be musiccost money infinite books used to bebooked you know I went to the library Ichecked out books I had to take themback there was a limit on the books sono limits today and you really have tohave to ask yourself the question howare you going to spend your time becauseyou could literally spend the next30 years of your life watching chessvideos on YouTube not playing chess justwatching the videos of other peopleplaying chess right there's infinitehundreds of thousands of hours of Chessvideos to be watched so the third thethird piece of advice is train your mindtrain it right you know train what Mattlearn math learn to speak learn alanguage uh learn logic especially logicand language and and basic thinkingskills uh how you do that right doesn'tnecessarily mean to go to universityright uh I launched the Sailor Academyand we've given education to one and ahalf million students we don't chargethem a nickel it's it's absolutely freein my opinion you can probably trainyour mind betterfasternot in a school today right but becausethe options I had when I was goingthrough school like when I was in highschool I could learnSpanish or French or Latin but that'sall I could learn and I could learn twoyears of it and I could learn the samerate as everybody else and I could learnone semester of calculus or and half asemester of calculus that's all I canlearn so train your mind use technologyto do it uh the fourth train your bodybe healthy uh you don't have to dothings that are inflammatory anddangerous I mean I'm not telling you togo be a a boxer or or take excessiverisk but I thinkany kind of healthy training the patternyou get into your entire life isimportant it won't be that important inthe first like right now in your 20s oryour 30s you can get away with reallyreally bad behavior there will be agreater price to pay in your 40s itwon't get exponentially worse in your50s if you engage in really bad behaviorand you don't Train Your Body by thetime you get to your 60s sometimes theyou know the Journey's over and when youget to your 70s you'd like to be able towalk around and uh being able to walkaround or into your 80s or the like as afunction of your of the way you treatyour health so you know if your bodygoes your mind will go later and life isjust not that funuh fifth think for yourself everybody'sgoing to tell you what to thinkeverybody you know every mediaorganization is in the business oftelling you what to think uh andgenerally they all have an agenda uhwhen at some point in your life you'llread a story and you'll ask the questionwhat was the agenda of the journalistthat wrote the story and what was theagenda of the media organization thatpublished the journalist and what wasthe agenda in the nation where thejournalist lives and if you if you startto think about all those things thenyou'll realize thatoftentimes in life if you especially ifyou're on a business like I want to dosomething I want maybe I want to buy aproduct I never bought the productbeforeand Peter sells a version of the productand Danny sells version of the productand you sell a version the product andyou all three of your experts I knownothingwhat I what I do is I try to buy fromeach of you and then I triangulatebetween each of you and you can tell melies you can tell me lies you can tellme lies I wouldn't know the differencebut at some point you will rat out himyou will rat out he will rat out you youwill rat out him I will create a mosaicof it and I will figure out what thetruth is by inferring it from a bunch ofuh distorted information so assumeeverything's distorted and it's your jobto synthesize and get to your version ofthe truthumsix uh curate your friendsyou know be careful The Company You Keepright some people will make you betterand and they'll lift you up and otherpeople will drag you down and plenty ofpeople's lives are ruined by a badfriendship in their teens right yourfriend wants I'm not going to go intodetails you figure it out choose yourfriends carefully choose their valuesand and you have infinite choicethere's eight billion people on theplanet right you can find three friendsthat that will work well with you and sofigure out figure out the right ones andrun from the wrong onesyou know cherish the right ones seventhcurate your environmentlike look where we are right now rightthere's good light in this room didn'thave to be good light in this room Petercould have picked one that has awfullight right pick the environment that'shappy that's healthycurating environment means choose whereyou will live what city whatneighborhood how you will live you knowdo you want to live in a house withgreen grass do you want to live in anapartment think hard about that you havea you have more Choice than you thinkyou have it will impact your mentalhealth it'll impact your your physicalhealth for example you study statisticsyou find that the likelihood of yougetting mugged or murdered is highlycorrelated to your pedestrian pattern soif you actually walk down 10 blocks in abad neighborhood and you walk back andforth every day to work in the wrongplace you're like a thousand times morelikely to get killed mugged murderwhatever right so you made that choiceyou might not realize you may made thatchoice but where you are and and how youlive makes a difference to your mentaland your physical healthum eight uhkeep your promises whatever they are theone thing people remember about you forthe for the rest of your life if youpromised them something 27 years laterthey will still remember if you lied tothem or if you promised them somethingand you didn't do it and the problemwith that is that that credibility overtime compounds and and if you don't havecredibilitypeople aren't going to want to help youthey're not going to help you in factthey're going to actually celebrate yourfailure so don't make promises you can'tkeep but bend Heaven and Earth to keepthe promises you do make and that youknow obviously in business it's thedifference between businesses succeedingand failing and like when you get in thepublic markets my stock trades every dayfrom 9 30 to 4 if people felt like I wasgoing to do something different thanwhat I told themhundreds of millions or billions ofdollars of capital would disappear and aheartbeat when people feel when you losecredibility so your ability toaccomplish something in life is based onyour credibility so so don't makepromises you can't keep and keep yourpromises uh nine stay cheerfulbe constructive rightthe world's full of ten thousand thingsthat are ugly and awfulbut uh and and you can you you can talkabout them at infinitum but if you sitwith someone you know for three hoursand you talk about how awful the worldis or or how much you don't like it atsome point if you watch them uh I dothis with my employees okay I'vethis I've lived this life okay so I'vesat with them boys and I'm in a bad moodI'm like this isn't working this isn'tworking this is not working this is notright we could have done this better wecould have done this better we couldcould have done this better and this iswhat happens to the person on the sideof the table start here they're like heywhat are we gonna do today and I'm likeand then pretty soon they're like beatdown exhaustedyou know and then you end with thatparade of horribles yeah so we can dothis and now but you've already beatthem to death right and so so you needto they need to enjoy and look forwardto their engagement with youif you uh if you want to accomplishsomething find a way to do it in acheerful constructive wayum cheerful you know things that goviral on Twitter more often they're likeconstructive cheerful things you know ifyou're entertaining or you find if Ipost a criticismthen some people see it but it doesn'tgo that far when I post a solution likehere's here's a free thing here's a freecourse here's a free resource you canhave this for free this is this is atool you can use if you know like forexample the other day I post I saw areally nice video on what is bitcoin andit had been posted by uh a BitcoinAdvocate and it had like 800 viewsbecause she didn't have that manyfollowers I thought but this is kind ofsad this is sitting and languishing waslike three and a half minutes of whyBitcoin is good so I retweeted itand uh you know I said no there willonly be 21 million Bitcoin or there'llbe more than 21 million Bitcoin orsomething like thatI went to like 200 000 250 000 views butwhat happened was all the other peopleon Twitter said hey this is a reallygood orange pilling video and theystarted retweeting it and you can see onTwitter now how people bookmark thingsyou can count the bookmarksit had the number one set of book likethousands of bookmarks like people werebookmarking like you could see in theirmind they're like I should save thisbecause I might need to send this to myfather and my mother or my friend it'slike I post something kind of snarky oror or or critical or pessimistic noone's bookmarking that I you know and socheerful and constructive works betteralso you want people look forward toseeing you whether it's in a workingenvironment like I enjoy working withyou or if they're a customer or ifthey're A supplier or if they're just afriendand I mean number 10 uh upgrade theworld there's a lot of ways to do itfigure out how you're going to upgradethe world how you know have a way sothat that's my theoretical advice uh forsomeone entering their adulthoodum practical adviceum stuff that uh I think is useful uh Iwish I'd studied even more history likeespecially serving a lot of history bythe way history his storyit's just a storyrightAlexander the Great took Herodotus withhim on his campaigns that's whyAlexander is the great because he hireda historian to write the book about himokay there's 10 000 stories okay and ifyou read all the stories there's thestory from the point of view of of athousand different Indian tribes and thepoint of view of the Mayans the Aztecsthe Europeans the French the Spaniardsthe Americans everybody's got the storythe Romans the goals the Russians theJapanese Chinese they've all got thestory from their point of view andthey're the hero and the otherthe other tribe is the villain theBarbarian the whatever so if you if youread history enough of it then you'll beempathetic and you'll be better able tointerpret what's going on now for forexample likeall these things taxes you know you knowthere were there were monopolies on whocould bake in New York City in the 1600sthere was there was Monopoly on whocould make a hat you had to have a sevenyear apprenticeship before you couldmake a hat they're already you know whowanted them the Hat makers in Londonwanted them there are monopolies on whocould trade with what P we had tobacconotes as money and then there was amassive fight because someone wanted tocap the price of the tobacco money andthe ministers getting paid in tobaccohad a fit and appeal to the crown whenyou read history all these things thenyou realize everything you're sayingtoday it's not new and when someone sayswe had we have to do this because thisis uniqueit's not unique right you won't be soeasily manipulated so history is good uhin matha lot of things I studied in math aren'tuseful calculus calculus of variationsdifferential equations uh complex thingslike that the only way in which thoseare useful it's useful it's useful thatI studied Vector math or linear mathbecause I could think about vectors andI could think n-dimensionally so theidea of n-dimensional math the idea ofnon-linear Mass some of these things areuseful to study but the actual techniqueunnecessary because the computer and nowthe AIS will do it for you in a SplitSecondbut I tell you the kind of math that Iuse every day every hour of the day andif you don't have this you will never besuccessful in business and you probablywon't be successful in politics or lifeand that is applied statisticsand by applied statistics I mean can youjust explain that I mean understandinghow significant it is the thingsomeone's telling you for example theproblem in this country is peopleslipping and falling in bathtubs andtherefore we need a tax to rebuildeverybody's bathtub being able to figureout how many people actually slip andfall in bathtubs or and comparing it toshark attacks and comparing it to deathby you know drinking too much alcohol ora heart attack or or the likelihood ofyou dying in a car crash or crossing thestreet or the example I gave you whichis statistically you're a lot morelikely it mugged if you walk by the wayyou can correlate it to the number ofminutes you spend on the street in a badneighborhood right so if you understandif once you think about statisticsstatistics is essential to do businessbecause you have to pickfor example what's the statisticallikelihood that block 5 Celsius and FTXare going to fail each yearlike that's counterparty risk if the ifyou thought they were going to fail oncein a hundred years that's a one percentrisk a year and you have to put a onepercent premium on top it turned outthey were basically likely to failwithin 36 months so the risk premium was36 percent and if they were paying youan interest rate less than 40 percent onyour money you're statistically losingall your moneyso understanding statistics and andbeing able to apply it to business tolife uh to uh to your social life that'skind of usefulum it's useful in in purchasing it'suseful in governance if you're ever apoliticianumwhat's the if I actually shut down theentire economy of the state because Ithink there's a hurricane that's goingto hit Miamiokay what statistical statistical likelyit hits Miami what's the what's theamount of damage it does when it hitsMiami what happens if it doesn't hitMiami what's the cost of the shutdown inthe state okay that's something you kindof have to make a decision on when youdecide where you're going to live and ifyou're ever if you're ever lucky enoughto be a a leader you need to know thatand uh generally you know when you dostudy statistics you start to learn thatmost human interventions are atrogeniciatrogenic being a long complicated wordfor does more harm than good when theCure is worse than the diseasemost most things are iatrogenic so ifthe oddsif the odds of you actually having adisease or one in a millionand the medicine is 99 effectivethat means that one percent of a millionpeople that take the medicineright and and this particular case soone percent uha hundred thousand ten thousand so yougot ten thousand people that take themedicineone of them is going to die of thediseaseso that means that in that case99.99 of the people that take themedicine are going to be sick fromtaking the medicineand they're not going to be helpedrightbut to figure that out right you have tounderstand you have to have some basicstatistical questions right How likelyis is it you know that that thing thatyou fear is going to kill me or hurt meversus how much damage will yourprescribed cure do to me andwe all had a lot of examples of thatlately so statistics I think is reallyvaluable and I I guessumI'll I'll end with just uh practicalsuggestions on on how to be successfulumin every generation there's a tool aplatform a new thing a new technologyand when that technology hitsif you take advantage of it in the firstfive years you'll probably beimmortalizedfor example Led Zeppelin and the Beatlesyou know if you look at all classic rockfrom 1969 to 1975 and and you made alist of all the truly insanely greatstuff done and then you see anexponential decay in unique rock androll music from that point forward itgets exponentially harderum the piano the work by ChopinBeethoven Mozart extraordinary getsexponentially harder to make a uniquepiano contribution if you look at theMainframethan the many computer then the PC thenthe internetyou kind of wannawhen you're coming of age you ask thequestion what's the new thing what isthe extraordinary thing now if if uhMichelangelo lived today he wouldn't dowhat he did then just like a Beethovenlive today you'd probably be seeing someExquisite Dynamic metaversal you knowconstruct created so there is humangenius in every generation and you havesome talent but the issue is what do youharness is it Instagram that's the oldthing was it Snapchat was it you knowTick Tock or and and the current timeperiod this explosion of of AI you knowAI mid journey and and uh chat Bots andthe likeI went to school at MIT and the previousgeneration the generation of Engineersthat put the man on the moon theydesigned spaceships with slide rulesI used an HP 15c calculator a decadelater they had spreadsheets on laptopsand I think man I could have been 100xas effective if I had a spreadsheet on alaptop you know and then they had theinternetyou know and and today you know youcould say give me a Shakespearean sonnetyou know in the style of whatever aboutroses and Bitcoin andyou know it's like well maybe four yearsof English literature studies down thedrain becauseyou know it turns out in some ways theperson that has no Talent likeyesterdayum was Mother's DayI wanted to post a picture for Mother'sDay I went and I you know first I wentto Google I Googled Bitcoin Mother's Daymemes nothing then I went to Twitter atall my memesters like my favoriteaccounts to post memes I'm like okaywell I there's uh there's a motherthere's another one I don't know ifthat'll play very well some people mightnot identify with you know that image sothen I went to Mid journey and I typedBitcoin bouquetBitcoin bouquet something like that bamI got 12 different pictures click clickclick click oh there's one with theBitcoin in the middle and orange and Ilike the orange and his black backgroundcopy paste okayI just made it myselfand you knowI I would sayas an artist I have no Talent at alland when I was going through schoolum I would not have been interested inart history or art because if you takean art class but you can't paint and youcan't draw right this experience comesto a grinding halt in a hurry but if Icould roll the clock back and do itagainI would take a really detailed art classbecause now what I realize is I canproduce anything in any style in anytexture you know you know in the styleof of any of ten thousand artistsright and then you start discoveringlight there's like infinite lightthere's infinite you know I I trippedover anodized titanium and I was typinggive me a Bitcoin an anodized titaniumit's posted on Twitter it read reallywell by the way I didn't even know therewas a style of anodized titanium butonce you once you have the tool in yourhand you realize that that there's anentire language of imagery thatprofessional photographers andprofessional artists they know uh and itwas off limits to the Layman uh untilmid-journey or or other AIgenerative toolsbut today you could generate your ownmusic you might generate your own videoyou might generate your own art youmight you know you might generate yourown songs your own raps your ownwhateverand the ROI is much highermy God I I had two paintings on my yachtI don't like the paintings you know 20years ago you have to hire an artist torepaint them this time around I said youknow give me two Polynesian girls in thestyle of Kandinsky and someone said wellwhy don't you try this one plugged inanother one I spun up some images I saidI shipped them off to uh you know to a apainting you know like a a 3D printerthat does paintings on canvas they comeback I'm gonna put them on my boat I domy own art I can curate my own life it'sa so it'snew platforms new thingsand sometimesyou know uh the old way was you're in abig organization surrounded by hundredsor thousands of people and there's a bigNetwork and you know you can sayone-tenth as much or 1 100th as much andyou're 100 times slowerand the new way is maybe it'sPeter and Dannyand you're your own network and you dowhat you want to do and you're much moreagile and you've got more distributionchannels and uh you know you can createtotally new forms of content neverbefore possible soI would say youlook at uh look at the platforms of theday and ask the question if I put anhour of work in what gives me thebiggest bang for the buck and and not tobe Debbie Downer but but my advice is Iwouldn't I wouldn't go back and try toreplicate the successes of each previousgeneration of the people that areadmired in the culturethey did the best they could at the timebut they were working in unfamiliarterritory when they did it so don't copythem you can it's okay to learn to playthe guitar fine I mean as but it's anit's an avocation right it's it's forfun it's a hobbyum like like it's fun to play chess yeahsure play chess is a hobbybut the you know two most successfulchess players Hikaru and and Magnus theyfigured out that chess.com and and youknow they're streaming on Twitchthey're monetizing on chess.com and andthe the greatest example right now andfor those people that like chesses Magnasaid I'm not playing for the worldchampionship in classical time formatI'm going to play rapid matches Blitzmatches Etc well the classical timeformat games are all boring they takefour hours to six hours who's gonnawatch a six hour chess game in the year2023and and so they're they're just not goodcontent they're not fun everybody wouldrather watch you know three minute youknow sign his battery with his matesplaying on Twitch and and Hikaru whoprobably is he's the highest paidwealthiest U.S chess playerhe plays on Twitch and and he sits andhe banters with his audience he chatpeople are like man you're not you'renot look at you guys like what could Isay guys man this is just who I am yeahyou know what do you think about youknow such and such well and he gives youpolitical opinions it's hilarious hecrushes his opponents and then and hehe's got the chess.com logo in thebottom and people are giving him tips orsomething on Twitch you know I can onlystream on Twitch guys that's just therules I don't make the rules blah blahand then later on he posts on YouTubeand when you ask him what's hisprofession he said I'm not a chessplayer I'm a streamer and I'm like likeyeah but like he's yeahguy thanks for himself yeah so there wego and end of sermon good luck good luckman how was that you have the one thingby the way that no one else has which isyou're young you're Youth and any youknow anybody in their 40s 60s and 80swould pay nearly infinite to be sittingwhere you are right now to have thetools at your disposalso have at it I was gonna ask quicklyum you talked about that five-yearwindow with any new technology thatcomes into the world to have like asignificant impact with it you've got toget in earlywith AI do you think that five-yearWindows ran out now no I think the clockstarted six months agoand I you know like what you saw wasokay well people can go and they canchat on uh on GPT but what you haven'tseen is people unleashing uh andartificial intelligence agent right yousee the the news this week was Carol A.Isome Instagram or some Snapchat Snapchatpersonality created an AI girlfriendversion of herself that she's actuallyselling online to thousands of men soshe she created an AI girlfriend with acombination of of things now and soshe's she's the first woman to launch anAI girlfriend she won't be the lastright she charges by the minute right itmight be that the business model is AIgirlfriend ten dollars a month not tendollars a minute but we'll seeumI think creating uh full autonomous AISthat do things right you know can youcreate an uh a bot that'll drive yourcar can you create a bot that'll do youraccounting can you do uh create a botthat that will be your lawyer can youyou know can you like I I talk to peoplein the Sailor Academy we have courses weupload them they're freeI said you know well it seems to me likenow you can create like a digitalProfessor that's got a hundred phds thatwill interactively tutor anybody forfree that knows everythingso you know once upon a time uh the mostpowerful man in the world was Phillipking of Macedon the most promising Heirin the world was Alexander his son soonto be Alexander the Great andAlexander's tutor was Aristotlethe most learned you know polymath inthe world at the time it's not it's notoften that you get the smartest personin the world to be your personal tutorbut now everybody can have the smartestperson in the world maybe it's coming sowith regard to AI I think you've gotlike 60 months and in those 60 monthsyou know people are going to chip awayat thatsometimes it might be you've got uh 10years on certain things but but this isthe decade where people are going tocreate extraordinary things I'm surethere'll be a girl you know I mean lookat the Kardashians could you imagine theKardashians being billionaires 40 yearsagoin an era of People magazine it was themagazine and it was EntertainmentTonight that monetized your celebrityand they kept all the moneyand the Kardashians were possiblebecause social media platforms allowedthem to own their own brand and monetizetheir own celebritybut imagine what happens if if you canconvert yourself and you can dosomething for me well maybe you cancreate an AI that can do that thing fora million people at the same timeokay so what will it be I don't knowbut but I think you shouldpay attention and think real hard andgenerally what happens is the again younotice how like you know octogenariansdon't really embrace you know new ideasas enthusiastically as as 20-somethingsand teenagers it's it's just humannature at some point you just a youdon't have the need they're comfortableright they just want to be left aloneand then B you know they they don't uhthey don't have the kind ofneuroplasticityyou know when when you're between zeroand ten you want to learn Chinese orSpanish or Russian yeah it's a hundredpercent likely you'll Master it fluentlyand then every decade that goes on rightyou just get less flexible and you getless economically flexible lessculturally flexible less technicallyflexibleyou know and so right nowI think it'll be some you know somebodyuh you know will just look and they'llcreate some outrageously compellingthing that no one could ever do beforethat no one ever thought to doand uh it'll probably be with it almostcertainly be one of these new platformsbecauseyou know you get to the point wherewhere humans just have this way within10 years of of using a new techniqueevery which way they possibly can andit's what they call the S curve youcan't do anything for a thousand yearsand then you hit the curve ofcommercialization and now you can dostuff and we go from Wright brothers tothe Moon in 66 yearsand then you hit a wallhit a wall and like all the modernmodern airplanes designed in the 70s andthe 60s and they kind of like got stuckbecauseFuel and engine technology they justdidn't advance and and uh and so we'rewe're waiting for this fundamentalenginethat allows you to do something you knowuh catalytic and transformational andyeah you know you can you can you knowit when you see it like when you see anyou know an AI bot that's readeverything the human race has everwritten and can spit it back to you in aSplit Secondyeah it's like okay uh uh interestingyou know umyou just you gotta internalize thatthere's a few other things right likeyou know there's certain certain typesof chips that are interesting the UnrealEngine when I look at that I thinksomeone can create a world that'sgetting close to the real world yeahright it's unbelievable have you seensome of this stuff I I have seen some ofit but not recently but look at UnrealEngine 5.1 it is absolutely unbelievablehmm I mean look you you've had amulti-decade career now you've seen alot of Technologies calm you know youtalked about it you know from thecomputer you see the internet Bitcoinnow ai is is AI just another technologyor do you is it something even morespecial to you like is it caught is itgrabbed you in a way maybe other thingshaven'tit'sit's pretty transformational I I youknow I would call it digitalintelligence for the first time we'rejust on the cusp of real digitalintelligence and andit's it's more than just a tool becausedigital intelligence means like once thecomputer is able to do itit does it a million times better amillion times faster a million timescheaper right and it's a singularitytype moment and then the generallytechnology is is an acid and and at somepoint it just dematerializes and eatsaway the thing that you use for examplethis destroyed the eight-track tape therecord it destroyed CDs it destroyedDVDs it destroyed cameras it destroyedscanners so many things that used to bephysical things in the world you knowvoice recorders they all just kind ofdematerialized into the phonewith AI I think it's dematerializingthings andservices and products and ideas in adisturbing fashion we could talk it's atotally different subjectbut I think it's uh it's a more powerfultechnology than certain otherTechnologies people get excited aboutand I if they figure out how to make thecar drive itself right thenyou're talking about increasing thecapital intensity by a factor of 10 ofall the vehicles in the world but butyou may be profoundly you know how manytens of millions of jobsjust get eviscerated is that a concernor do you think we will just figure outno I think we should be concerned you doI I think it's I think it'sone of Humanity's great opportunitiesand one of Humanity's great threatsbecause we've started to use it I'vestarted to use it I I compare AI to meto Google when I first discovered GoogleI had that moment I realized I could doall of this fine all this informationall of a sudden and it just becamesomething I used every day there's lotsof called internet technology to come onlike Spotify was great but this is thefirst time I'm genuinely going to AIregularly to solve problems and dothings for me uh it's making me moreproductiveuh anything where I have to do anywriting I've I don't have writer's blockanymore because I if I do if I can'tthink of it straight away I get I gointo the II I say write me something andI use that as the kind of trigger towrite what I want to write I might takepart of it all of it or none of it butit's just It sped me up I wrote astrategy for my football team the otherday I started it in AIand that gave me a nine point plan Iturned it in a ten point plan I removeda bit added a bit but I'm quick I'mfaster and we can see with this what wedo the amount of things it can do and sothen when I try andthink about other uh careers businessesIndustries realize there's a lot of jobsunder threat you know if if you're umif you're a Roman general and you have atri-room and there's 300 rowers in itthen you're generating 30 horsepowerand uhif you have one of those dinky likereally small dinky dingy engines youhave a 70 horsepower engine behind yourboat in the modern world and uh and weobliterated the need fortensor for Manpower and in so many areasyou know typical cars got three 400horsepower you know think about thinkabout you know the average person whenthey get 300 horsepower it used to be100 years ago the rich person had twohorsepower or four horsepower you knowcarriage and we went to the point wherea poor person has 400 horsepowerum and I think AIS like that wherethere's a lot of people that thatum weren't able to generateperfect legal legal uh documents orprose or a perfect business letters oryou know a witty wrapand nowanybody can and in fact the person thatuses the AI will probably look moreintelligent than the the actual talentedperson that doesn'tum and soin this particular case it's you knowthere was a world where where the strongcould dominate the weak and then weinvented the gunand then the week with the gun becamethe strongand if you were you knowyou could spend your entire life youknow training in the martial arts by theend of the day you know when you whenyou read the book what should I do wellif you really need to defend yourselfyou should get a gun right so it's aleveler it's yeah it's a it's a levelerbut ityou knowlet's take robotsyou know you know I see the LuxeFriedman interview with uh you know theCEO of Boston Dynamics and they've gotthe one little robot dog and they'regoing to make him a happy robot dog tobe your pet right and they just talkabout that for four hours okay and thenyou go on Twitter you see you know yousee a video that's maybe 10 seconds longwithout any narrative and it's awarehousewith a thousand of those robot dogsdoing push-ups and then you go and yousee one robot dog with the gun on it yepshooting the dog the gun and then youthinkyou know it's kind of hard you know whatwe're talking about turning gettingrobots to be able to cook our food andbe nice to us and you know be Companionsand and and box things and carry boxesthrough warehouses and do backflipsthat's all hard but let me tell you whatisn't hardput a bomb on a robot dog right like atthe end of the day if you're asking howwill the next War be fought you knowjust give me ten thousand robot dogs andput an explosive device on each of theten thousand dogsit's too hard to aim the gunright it's it's certainly too hard toget to you know to and now let's sayyou're a soldierI don't know I getshould you be afraid for your job likewho's who wants a hundred thousandsoldiers in the army with guns like andby the waywould you want to be one of thosehundred thousand soldiers when 27 robotdogs with explosives come walking one ata time towards you you can you see thatBlack Mirror yeah you can see likethere's no future like the idea ofarmies there's no future armies the ideaof aircraft with pilots in them there'sno future to that the Navy there's nofuture to a ship with people on it yeahyou know the future is swarms of dronesin the air and on land and the Sea andwhen I say swarms I mean like I'm notgoing to manufacture one I'm going tomanufacture 100 000 of them and I'mgonna get the manufacturing cost down toa thousand two three thousand dollars athingand uh and you know the cost of a pilotin an F-35 is three million dollars totrain and the F-35 is a 50 100 milliondollar aircraft why not just a fivethousand dollar switchblade and whydon't I just drop I could drop athousand of them out of the back of ac-135 or a B-52anything 500 miles away and and ofcourseyou know the the initial reaction if youif you go and you watch drone racesthey're sponsored by the US Air Forceokay interesting so the Air Force wantsto sponsor drone drone Pilots because hewants to recruit the next the nextgeneration of drone Pilots but the thepoint I'm getting to is that is evenlooking Antiquated right now I mean whywouldn't you just put an AI chip in 18000 drones and just give them a Targetor just give them an algorithm likeevery time you see a tank a tent abuilding a cluster of 10 Soldiers withUniforms onyou're done you're you know soevery war you fight the last war yeahand all this stuff in our world is aboutfighting the last war but the next waris something profoundly different and alot of it's because of the ability toput digital intelligence into anythingit also makes the idea of War much morepolitically palatable because if there'sno human cost to your country at leastif it's you're just selling robots likeI don't think people will be against thewar as much like if it was all robots inIraq and Afghanistan yeah I don't knowit's terrifying if you're on thereceiving end of the robot yeah like Imean don't we do a movie about that veryfamous one is this the one I've not seenis this Terminator yeahwhat are we going to do when Skynetbecomes self-aware yeah so we uh we hadit up in a recent interview I uh broughtup uh Terminator three because that'sthe moment at the end where he's like herealized there was nothing they couldever have done this wasthis is always going to happen it's areality and we actually put it I said toDanny last night I was like right we'regonna watch Terminator one two and threewe've got to see how this plays outwell I I think I think that there's alot of opportunity we could talk wecould have we want to be cheerful andconstructive I'll give you four hours ofgreat AI things we could do but but interms of the the threat that I wouldimmediately focus on it's basically AIdriven bots in cyberspace and AI drivenrobots in actual space right and um theAI driven robots are are a bit behindbecause it's harderto do you know a robot is a machine thatalso has digital intelligence the Botsthough the Bots you know I I thinkfundamentally there's no reason why youcan't launch Millions tens of millionshundreds of millions billions of bots incyberspace that will imitate humansactually will be better humans than thehumans are there's you know any and so Iactually believe that to a certaindegree there are many distortions wehave in the world today that have beenbot drivenI you know I have observed when I didwhen I drill down that 95of the toxicity in my own onlineexperience was bot driven it was neverhumansit was when there is when there's a maleeffector attempting to sow the seeds ofCivil War it wasn't a humanit's like like what would what would Ido if I wanted to destroy your Societyuh you know I would convince you thathe's gonna murder you and convince youthat he's going to murder you and Iwould do it by you know by distortingreality and I would just step back andlet the two of you fight it out youthink that's a challenge with this kindof malignant Behavior that's that couldplague the internet that we maybe end uprejecting and go back to a lot ofin-person interactionsthere's a hope of potential for thatit's it's a it's a a very healthyresponse and I've had the same thoughtmyself like when you see thisyou start thinking that maybewe rely on these things too much I meanwe just it's a small analogy toto this would be the podcaster andcovert era when everything was remote Imean the first time we did an interviewwas remoteand that was a more efficient way ofdoing things and we could make moremoney and we didn't have to travel wedidn't have the cost we could also getuh easier access to bigger guess or moredownloads it was a as a business modelit worked betterbut we've sacrificed all that and chosento travel chosen to have the studiochosen to rent the thing and we make25 30 less money we can becausewe know this is better and so like myonly hope is thatthat in some ways it becomes almostunusable so you just reject it I can'tgo into that place anymore go back tothe woods with the Playboy magazineyeah the future will be some hybrid whatdo you think what Max is not clear it'snot like for you as kids like becauseyou're describing it finds I find itvery hardto come to a place wherehumans are even needed at allpretty pretty true and I know it's likea topic that's brought up a lot withinAI butwhat's your view on where it leaves usbecauseand what it leaves us well if the AIS dotake over hopefully they'll like usI rather think they might run the worldbetter than we dowe'll see I you know Iwe're approaching the singularity wherewhere things can Veer in so manydifferent directionsyou know I I joked to someone someoneI feel like I know how the world willend and it's the other day I woke up andI looked on my iPhone and it said uh youknow there's a security update you knowyou know and you read the thedescription says certain bug fixes andsecurity improvements and you eitherinstall or you don't but if you don'tevery day it asks you to install soyou're going to install it and I feellike if there ever really was anartificial intelligence and theyinfiltrated the center of apple or thecenter of Google they would just inserta trojan horse piece of code into thatsecurity update push it out to 5 billionor 6 billion smartphones just sit therewith a back door for who knows how longand then one day you just wake up inyour phone either just goes blankyeah maybe if it's colorful if you wantsome melodramatic meltdown everybody'sphone just turns off but more likely youwould just see the hundred thousand mostpowerful people in the world they wouldjust start to send messages to eachother moving money around or launchingyou know initiatives or starting Wars oror whatever they're going to do and thehuman race will just get taken along forthe rideand that I think you know that has madeif there's any any result It's Made Memuch more passionately committed tobitcoin because I actually think if ifBitcoin what's the problem with everysystem in a world of AI the problem withit with every system is what you justsaid which is the AIS are better thanthe humans the humans aren't necessaryanymore so to the extent that there arehumans in the loop whether they'resoldiers or Pilots or whether or notthey're programmersif the AI gets smarter than us andstarts to learn a million times fasterthan us then every single system with ahuman in the loop is a weak linkand the the struggle we have all thetime is how do we take the humans out ofthe loop and and Bitcoin is is thegreatest example of a system constructedso that no humans are in charge there'sno there's no humans to corrupt itright um you're not trusting Appleyou're not trusting a set of developersand uh I I think that once if if AI iscapable of interfering and and theconcerns of mankind then every systemthat has a human in control of itright or or has an attack surface via acode updateright is going to be attacked so what doyou want you want Analog Devices thatcan't be updated so for example you knowthe swimming pool in your backyard youknow isn't going to get a code updatefrom Tesla so when the AI takes overthere'll still be water in the swimmingpool and there may still be you knowpotatoes growing and your horse maystill be a horse and uh and a car withan internal combustion engine withoutsoftware downloaded you know from thecentral system will probably still keepworking and you're you're done will keepworking so physical things and Bitcointhe network will keep workingthe things that are going to fail thefastest the most fragile you know arethese systems get continually updatedand and Iit's a reason why I think the concept ofossification is more important than everit's the things that work well in theuniverse if we think about the worldit's likethe speed of sound and the speed oflight are constant right you you knowthe laws of thermodynamics the laws ofgravitation attraction they're constantno one fixes them or improves them everymonth there are no security updates tothe universe that's why the universeworks no one has changed the rate atwhich the sun you know converts you knowMass into energy uh and sonatural law is constant and stable andthe result is that things that are basedon it aren't natural and healthy by ourstandards and now when you look atman-made thingsright the thing there are certain thingsthat are stable that will probablycontinue to work even you know after theAIS melt everything and uh they'rethey're kind of Off the Gridand the stuff that's on the grid youknow you just can't rely on any of itand you can't rely on any human being tomake the decision so oftentimesyou know like with regard to bitcoin youask me what do I want like I I don'tchange itI don't want to you know don't don'tchange it right just leave it leave italone like like math the protocol youknow there's a certain set of numbersthere's a zero a one a two a three afour a five a six seven eight and nineleave it right yeah you can come up withother things you could do but but whatif you've got some malignant AIdevs that are anonymousthat we can't prove who they are so theystay Anonymous and spend some timegetting to know the other core devspropose a bit that gets approved andit's a malignant attack and that's whyyou don't you don't want to havecentrally downloading self updatingsoftware yeah like most of the softwareon your iPhone right now is just selfupdating in the background you don'teven know it updatedand and so the the question reallybecomes like how secure are all theseorganizations how secure are thesegovernmental agencies and how securethese Bankslike how many people would it take inany given company to be to be uh to seesuper user privilegeslike or have root access control rightand and what is the process and I Ithink umyou know the danger is if there arethree people and they can jointly decideto do it then I can come up with lots ofways to lever spoofuh you know coerce Co-op to three peopleright so that that's that's whybitcoiners right that's why we know noCentral counterparty is trustworthyright the theoretical reason why no bankis trustworthy no company is trustworthyno no counterparty is trustworthybecause they're all run by people youknow what is trustworthy what'strustworthy is gravity if you like leanback in your chair and you know I canguarantee you you will fall over and Ican guarantee you that someone in theHimalayas that never had a collegeeducation will also fallit is completely trustworthy and becauseit's trustworthy you can build a machinebased on gravityI you know I can create skis that willwork and the Himalayas or in Americabecause I know the physical qualities ofsnow and gravityrightum and no one's going to change it soBitcointo the extent that it's physicalyou can build a machine on it becauseyou can trust itum you would never want to be in asituation where the Bitcoin nodes wereyou know getting Auto updated andsomeone's Auto pushing right the truthis thatyou know at some point the developerswill come up with an idea which isiatrogenic right I I tend I personallytend to be of the belief that the I meanthe the only realinteresting use case for for changingBitcoin core code is when there's anobvious when there's a bug that iscrippling and we all understand it andagree it's a bug or when there's a fatalthreat and we all and we build consensusthat there's a fatal threat that willburn the network to zero and if there'sa fatal call it a fatal bug or a fatalattack surface that forms 50 years fromnow or whenever it does then I supposeyou might dispatch people to changeprotocolbut changing the protocol for forfunctionality or performance or to makeit sexier or you know bells and whistlesand this all those things are justprofoundly dangerous I think and and theideathe idea in the crypto ecosystem whichthis is not strong in Bitcoin Bitcoin isprobably the most conservative rightyeah but the idea you see and the otherproof of stake networks right where it'sjust routine we'll do a hard Fork hardFork we got a road map the the idea thatwe have to keep upgrading and keepchanging things that itself ispernicious and it's going to be morepernicious in the world of AI becausewhat that says is you've got anapplication but you don't have you don'thave truth or Integrity or the baselayerand if you're going to build a machineyou need to build a machine based onnatural law that is invariant and uh itstands the reason that Bitcoin is theonly Network in cyberspace that runswithout human intervention that's securethen probably the only way to createanything else that's secure incyberspace is to integrate it withBitcoinyouknow there's this phrase Bitcoin fixesthis yeah I you know I'm of the opinionthe Bitcoin fixes everything right Ithink Bitcoin is a solution to everycity every state every country everycorporation every Network everyapplication every product there's a wayto embed Bitcoin in it that makes itbetter and I think right nowthe one thing Bitcoin does is it givesyou this uh immutableyou know and immutable Immortal you knowLedger right that's shared andit gives you a form of of integrity andtruth and uh and uh physicaluh a physical presence solike you have a good idea public privatekey cryptography okay so you spin up apublic key in a private key and youcreate a Noster account that's good butthe problem with that is my AI cancreate a billion no store accountshow long to take you to create yournotes or accounttook you like 20 minutes and then ittakes you 20 minutes to post every daymy AI created 20 billion Noster accountsand it posed 20 billion times asfrequently as you and it's actually moreentertaining and more charismatic thanyou are and so maybe I'm just going towarp reality because what you've got isyou've got something in cyberspace butthere's no thermodynamic materiality toit or thermodynamic conservativeness toit so you want to fix it you have tocombine the idea of the public privatekey with a transaction on the BitcoinNetworkyou do one transaction you showed me youspent a dollarokay well now your billion your bet yourbillionaire Noster Bots cost you abillion dollars and when I find out thatyou're a Noster bot and I block you itcost you a dollar so there's a cost andthere's a consequenceif I want to make it a biggerconsequence right I I think the moststunning thing right right in front ofour faceis the theSatoshi phenomena and it's thissatoshi's got 30 billion dollars ofBitcoin sitting on that blockchain andwe can see it in the form of a millioncoinsand we know that Satoshi could digitallysign a message and provethat he she they exist and they controlthat money and they could do it quicklyand we know that for 14 years there'sbeen a multi-billion dollar reward toanybody that could Hack Thatstill there and so if so what about thiswhat if I actually want to create anorange checkuh where where I basically have a publickey burned in the Bitcoin blockchainwith one transaction but then I create agreen check which is I've actually gotthat transaction attached to a millionsatoshi'sand then a proof of reserve for identityand then what if I do a blue check witha hundred million satoshi's and what ifI do a you know a purple checkand it's it's tied to an account with ahundred Bitcoin and now you've got ahierarchy of of identity and you can nowbuild a hierarchy of security and costand consequence and you could layer thatsort of ideaintoall of these other systems the Facebooksthe apples the Googles the microsoftsand I I thinkI think what Bitcoin what's specialabout Bitcoin is they've combined theBitcoin Community they understand proofof work so they've got hard they'vethey've got physical energy analogenergy they've combined with digitalenergy in the form of the shaw 256hashing so they've they've got digitalpower there right actually what I meantwas yeah compute Power Plusanalog energy gives you digital power sowe've got this concept of digital powerand it's the most powerful Network wealso have the concept of public andprivate key cryptography implementedwe've also got a third concept which youwouldn't add infinite item about in anumber of your interviews on multi-sigyou know and and multi-sig andmulti-factor and digital Hardwaresigning devicesright and if you look at the thingspeople are struggling with in this worldwe're struggling with how do we actuallysecure a system and the answeris probably some combination ofmulti-signaturephysical signing devicesreal world presence of of energy andthen and then computer power that isdefensible like if the AI took over allof Google Facebook and apple I'mcomfortable that they still can'tstop the Bitcoin Network and that's ifthey took it over on one day everysingle thing turned to attack theBitcoin network no amount of intellectallows you to brute force it because itliterally is a Brute Force defense andso cryptography is Brute Force350 extra hash is Brute Force 15gigawatts is Brute Force and soright now what what Satoshi createdright was yeah the world's hardest moneyyeah the world's greatestdecentralized Network yeah the firstdecentralized Networkyeah but Satoshi also showed us that Ican prove authenticity to the entireworldinstantly and I can defend somethingworth billions or or tens of billions orhundreds of billions against a BruteForce attackand that actually offers the promise notjust to fixing the money but it actuallyoffers the promise of securingcyberspace because you know I think atsome point we'd like to see all thesepeople that have control theseEnterprise systems we'd like to seetheir their privilege checked bysomething in the physical worldlike multi-signature thermodynamicallysoundauthentication Network and you can do itnow you could you could Implement orangechecks on Twitter where everybody thatwanted to post on Twitter needed to do aBitcoin transaction once in their lifeand you you know you completely changethe way people thinkbut I I'm interestedI'm personally interested in theEnterprise applications for Enterprisesecurityright so you know like a very colorfulordinal inscriptions debate you knowthat popped up and I'm just totally onthe fence on it nfts I've been kind ofon the fence with itin that I want Bitcoin to be really goodmoney uh and but I don't really care ifpeople find other uses for the protocolif they're useful because I think ifit's useful stick around I don't thinkordinals the future of ordinals is jpegsI think it's something else I'm not surewhat and therefore if this network cando more than money and do other thingsthen great what we should embrace thatyeah I I thinkumyou gotta look I try to look out 30yearsand when I look out 30 years I I thinkwell there's going to be hundreds ofthousands of corporations that are goingto build something on top of Bitcoin andthere's going to be endless generationsand evolutions of of Layer Two protocolsthey'll be lightening the next versionof lightning there may be a competitorand a lightning called thunder rightthere'll be all sorts of open protocolsthere'll be a market uh debate over thatthere's going to bethere's going to be lots of people usingBitcoin in lots of different waysumand my view on this entire debate is aI'm an Austrian economistso if all value is subjectiveand uh andthe world the marketplace is continuallygenerating ideas faster than we canconceive them then we should just letthe free market function and it's goingto generate all sorts of ideas and99 of them are going to failand so there's a 99 probability thatthat some new idea that someone came upwith is not a good one and it's going tofail but if you're an Austrian Economistand you believe in Freedom you know yeahyou can be free to not invest in thatbusiness idea but you should just letall the businesses get launched and waitand see what happensumBitcoin I think a Bitcoin is scarcityand I think of I think of umtypes of scarcity first order scarcityis 21 million Bitcoin there will neverbe more than that there'll be lots ofpeople that will buy Bitcoin that youwill not agree with and there will belots of uses Bitcoin you will not agreewith and there'll be governments to loveit you will not agree with it and theycall it money for enemies right so Idon't criticize whoever for buying theBitcoin there were people that criticthat didn't want microstrategy to buy aBitcoin you know you remember that's badfor Bitcoin well I meanthe truth of the matter is 30 40 yearsfrom now if bitcoin's a solution toeverything everybody owns Bitcoin soit's just a question of the order so butthe the critical thing isdon't increase the number of Bitcoinyeah 21 million is the critical thingthe second order scarcity is thebandwidth of the the transactionbandwidth the block sizeyou know and you know right now postsegwit where the four megabyte blocksand you know the purists would say weprobably should have stuck with onemegabyte Mega bite but I wasn't herethen and maybe I wouldn't have been thatsmart then maybe I wouldn't have been apurist maybe I had to go through it tothink it butit is what it is right and and today I Idon't think the exact number matterswhether it's one two or fourI think what's critical is that it notchangeyou know when you're um you remember wetalked about plasticity neuroplasticityand you know when you're young in youryouth you can take a lot of knocks andyou'll recover uh you get more fragileas you get older and so Bitcoin and hisyouth went through a few distortions notnearly so many as the other cryptoswhich is why it's Bitcoin and why itsucceeded but there's a point when youfill your Niche and you just can't youcan't radically change anymore withoutkilling yourself and and sothe the commonly understood reason forwhy you don't want to change the blocksizes we don't want to centralize thenetwork we want to keep nodes that youcan run but but it's not actually in myopinion it's not the best argumentright I mean the truth is you couldprobably make an argument that an eightmegabyte block space will also bedecentralized or not now we're in thislittle debate over the cost of um ofstorage versus the rate at which theBitcoin blockchain increments uh and umthe better debate is don't change itbecause it's unethical to change itdon't change it becauseit's evilit's unethical that's why you don't doit why because every time you change theblock space you defraud or or youdeprive the Bitcoin minersof Revenue so if you actually keepdoubling the blocks size you keepdriving transaction fees down and soyou're meddling in the economics ofsomeone that in good faith invested inBitcoin if I investedall of my life savings and Bitcoinmining on the assumption that the blockswould remain constant and the Bitcoinwould remain constant and then somedeveloper came up with a really goodreason why we ought to you know increasethe Bitcoin give some of it to thedevelopers and then triple the blocksize so the transaction fees and binancewon't be as expensiveI would be furious right but more thanFurious right yeah you have stolen theirproperty in the same way that the Nazisstole the Jews property you've stolen itin the same way that every authoritarianhas stolen property for the past tenthousand years right the history ofhumanity is full of powerful people thatchange the rules so that they can stealyour land so they can claim it viaeminent domain so they can tax it awaythey you know they pass a law making itillegal for you to bake bread it'sillegal for you to ship it's illegal tocross the River from New Jersey to NewYorkit's these are all just different unfairrules so soum changing the transaction bandwidthfundamentallyis is an unprincipled decision becauseyou deprive people in the ecosystem oftheir property rightsand and it's the benefit of someone tothe detriment of someone else and youbasically you basically uhretroactively you know change the rulesright they're 100 right in that Iunderstand changing the 21 millionuhthat is essentially theft in that youare debasing the Bitcoin for everyoneelse but I've you know for a long timewe've been doing this I've heard manypeople say look there may come a time inthe future we'll we will need toincrease the block size because Bitcoinis so popular it's become prohibitivelydoubling the block sizes theft toocut cutting doing anything to interferewith the with with the scarcity of thefirst the first derivative of scarcityis transaction bandwidthright so so obviously if you if youdouble the amount of Bitcoin and gave itall to yourself that's obvious stuffpeople can figure it out but if youdouble the transaction bandwidth suchthat you drive the transaction fees from25 billion a year to 25 million a yearyou've stolen hundreds of billions ofdollars from somebodyright the the actual free market andtransactions is sensitive to thebandwidth and so so tinkering with itin or in an artificial way and it isartificial when you change the code Imean it means you're directly deprivingall of the miners of their revenueassuming that transactions remainconstantwell in any scenario increasing theamount of bandwidth drives down thetransaction fees so so I guess the pointI'm regardless of what you assume rightyou can have any assumption abouttransaction demand for the next hundredyearsbut if you double or triple or whateverthe bandwidth for transactions you drivethe fees down by some substantialportion and that means you probably takeBitcoin miners that might be profitablemake them unprofitable and you take alot of businesses that would be inbusiness and you drive them out ofbusinessand of course most horrific is anyonethat's a anyone that's a theoreticianlooks at it and says that was an attackon bitcoin because you've corrupted theprotocol therefore I don't trust theNetwork anymore which means the next 100trillion dollars doesn't go on thenetwork so so do you think so it wassick with this thenso the upgraded Segway where block spacewent up fromuh essentially one to four megabytes Theincreased block space we got it was isthat a thing it was it was an ethicalquandary wasn't it yeah it was a warand both you know it was a war and theway to justify it would be it was a warand we thought this was the least worstoption because the other side was goingto do something worsebut but I don't you know I don't thinkthere are good guys in a waryeah and like if you if you look allaround the world and study the historyof politics it seems like the winnersare just the least worst governmentsthey're all bad there's no good it'slike Trump's answer the other day whenthey try to Corner him and made himchoose who he wanted to win the war andhe wouldn't pick and he said I justwanted to end but you know like the thethe slight change the truth is segwitundermine transaction feesyou know to a certain degree I mean it'sa it changed the it changed the contractwith the miners after the fact and thenTaproot changes it again and these arethese are very risky things because theychange all the economics and theeconomic incentives and and thedensities and you know you could arguethey were they were done either forexpedient purposes or for functionalityand it's right it's true right there's alot more functionality post Tap Root andthere's a bit more fun there's a lot offunctionality that you couldn'tImplement without segwit rightright and a lot of but yeahright the the fundamental things we'restaring at right now like lightning andlike inscriptionsyou know benefited maybe were essentialyou almost needed segwit and Taproot toget there right yeahsothat's a very scary history right thethe 14-year history of Bitcoin is veryscary but we've arrived at this placeright nowwhere it's pretty clear that there'sextraordinary functionality that you canImplement you're staring at it with allyou know all these inscriptions and it'spretty clear that you can doextraordinary things with lightningand it seems to me there's no reason whyyou can't go from 500 billion to 5trillion to 50 trillionand I'm not even sure we can't go to 250trillion based upon the currentfunctionality I seewhen if the base layer can't dosomethingthen the question is can the layer 2 doit and if the layer 2 can't do it if youwanted to achieve it you would have todo it with layer threeand you you can make an argumentright you can make an argument that ifsegwit and Taproot had never happenedyeah you wouldn't be doing this stuff ina layer two protocols but layer threesyes the money might have been harder andmaybe the layer threes would have wouldhave come along and people like Appleand Google would have embraced Bitcoinor would be embracing Bitcoin or someother company or bank would EmbraceBitcoin and they would just fill the gapyou know there's there's trade-offseverywhereum so but having said that just to beclear I'm not going to second guesshistoryI would say war is HellBitcoin was a very unlikelycreation it was very unlikely to surviveyou know so many other versions didn'tsurvive when it got to the block sizeWars it was a bitter Civil War and therewere probably Mis you knowwhat would be the wordmisunderstood decisions made on bothsides and there were probably some poorthere was very poor logicin lots of places or maybe logic thatwould be easy to criticize todaybut I I do think bitcoin's better youknow we have Bitcoin is better forsegwit it's better for Tap Root they arestable if they had blown the network uprightthen then I wouldn't be saying that wewouldn't be herebut now once you've achieved the miraclelike you've started a nuclear furnace oryou've started a star right you'veyou've achieved America once you'veachieved the miracle don't look the gifthorse in the mouth right don't let thefire go out and I think you have toshift your view from like from from uhbeing aggressive I I think they theyyou know when there's Bitcoin cash andthere's a lot of other Forks theythought that you know the main chainmight die I mean they literally werefighting for the survival of Bitcoin Idon't think we're surviving we'refighting for the survival of Bitcoinwith the next cool idea that comes alongin the year 2024.I do think right now[Music]I think it's very important right nowthat we have a stable Network thatpeople can build uponand I think that stability means itneeds to be stable economically and thatmeansyou gotta cap the number of Bitcoin butyou've got to cap the bandwidthright because otherwise it's not stableeconomically remember we talked aboutadiabatic lapse or you know a whole inin the fuselageif you don't cap the bandwidth thenthere won't be a healthy transaction feemarket and if there isn't a healthytransaction fee market then you'reeventually going to see your all yourminers go bankrupt and go to zero andthen you open up this Pandora's box ofdiscussing putting in an inflationSupply to feed you know to support theminers and that's an awful place to beso it needs to be economically sound tobe successful it needs to be technicallysound and you're a lot more likely to betechnically sound if you stop changingthings right I mean if you if you livelong enough you start you find that mostsoftware becomes a Rube Goldberg devicethere's too much code and every piece ofcode's got more bugs and eventuallyyou're carrying so much technical debtyou can't maintain it and so we don't wedon't want it to be one iota morecomplicated it needs to be and then itneeds to be ethically soundokay and and the root cause of allunethical behavior is someone thatthinks that they can pop work thepolitical process or weaponize thepolitical process in order to distorteconomics to their benefitso for example you know who's winning ifum if we censorinscriptionswell I meanbinance would be winning binancewouldn't actually have to and uh installlightning they wouldn't have toimplement lightning coin but he doesn'thave to implement lightning if you justartificially keep all the transactionsthat are not pure monetary transactionsoff the network so the exchanges thatdon't Embrace lightning are winninglightning is losinguh companies that Implement goodlightning implementations good Channelswith good functionalitythey're winning from this inscriptionbrouhaha they would be losing if peoplewere doing a lot more transactionscheaper on the base layercompanies that want to launch layer twolayer especially layer three apps thatmove Bitcoin at the speed of lighton a layer three they're losing ifpeople are using the layer oneand of course but butthose are all second order changes butbecause every everything you do itaffects there's a positive there's anegative someone's winning someone'slosing people that don't uh that don'toffer lightningin generalare are going to sufferif the transactions go up butlet's talk about minors miners are theline of First Defense for Bitcoin and alot of people don't understand just howprofound and important they areum one thing they do is they throw up a350 extra hash wall and that's puretheir digital power centers and you'regoing to want as much digital power aspossible and you want to stay ahead ofGoogle and Amazon and the worldwidecompute power if you're going to staysecure so we need them to spend billionsand billions of dollars a year on thatthis I mean the second thing thatthey're doing in addition to justdefending that uh I mean they'recreating a censorship resistantmessaging Network because if the minersare are spread all around the world andthat powerful then you can't physicallystop the transaction so so that's reallyimportant but the second thing they'redoing is the miners are the ones thatare going to actually be lobbying thepoliticians and not Outlaw Bitcoin inevery country so when a country comesalong and you know and they attackBitcoin the first thing they attack isthe minersand the miners suffer like in Swedenwhen the when there's a massive tax onelectricity or if this White Houseproposal comes and comes to see anysupport at all the miners are the firstones to sufferthe the miners will all go bankrupt adecadethat 10 to 30 years before the networkdies before Bitcoin dies but think ofthe miners as your skin if I Flay it offyouright you won't be immediately dead butbut death will follow and so you needthe miners to be healthy for uh for abunch of reasons they're they're yourpolitical Defender they're your physicalthermodynamic defender or computationalDefenderum they're also the financial defenderof the network because if you look atone of the reasons why Bitcoin is moresecure and and more uh successful thanevery other crypto it's there's like 20or more publicly traded companies thatare Bitcoin minersso the the miners actually went and theyraised billions and billions of dollarscapitaland then they took themselves public andyou see the riots and the marathons andthe Hut eights of the world and theirises of the world those corporateoperators are are then the ambassadorsof the Bitcoin Community to Wall Streetto the investment Banksevery one of those companies has Generalcounsels they can all afford PR peoplethey can afford lobbyists they createjobsyou know they're when when a when acrypto promoter or a gorilla marketerfor a crypto proof of stake Network whenthey actuallyfunnel millions of dollars to apolitician kind of like what Sam bankmanfreed did when he dumped the hundreds ofmillions of dollars on the politicianswhen they funnel the money and then theywhisper in their ear the Bitcoin is notenvironmentally friendly and that theyshould be bannedit's going to be the Bitcoin miners thatare going to be on the front linefighting that battle and they're goingto be fighting that battle againsteverybody who comes up with a with a toogood to be true proof-of-stake yo-yocoin that is going to print coin sellthe coin buy a bunch of politicians buya bunch of lawyers buy a bunch ofmarketers and they're going to spreadall the the anti-bitcoin fundso if you don't have the miners youdon't have physical presence in the realworld and that meansyou're spinning off in the metaverse youbecome virtual onlybut you also done on political presenceyou're losing your political presenceyou're you're losing your physicalpresenceyou know andthat's uh you're and you're you'relosing your legal presence it's sothe biggest problem withwith either changing the block size orcensoring the transactions is you'redepriving the miners of a revenue streamandSatoshi gave us this block reward is asubsidy to bootstrap to network but byyear 2035 it's 99 done you've got onepercent in the next hundred years andand of that one percent in the nexthundred years you've got 90 percent ofthat coming in the next it reminds meyears or something Kevin do you rememberthe um who's that Australian comedianthe gun debateyeah and he talks about the securityguard Kevin who's paid minimum wage andhe's his security guard like if you wantthe best security in the world you wantto pay your security guardsyou know you've got to have top levelsecurity you know if you have securityyou want top security anyone who's abitcoiner has to think about themselvesthey want top security you're basicallytalking about the security of thenetwork the first line of defense andthen we've got to ensure they're paidyeah if we weaken them we weaken Bitcoinand if you if you look at it from anAustrian point of view you've got a citythe city's got 10 square miles in ityou're the mayor are you going to passlaw after law telling people what kindof things they can do on their land inyour city I don't I I don't likebookstores I do like libraries I don'tlike bakeries I do like restaurants butnot restaurants that serve cake butrestaurants that serve healthy fooddefined by me pretty soon you've gotyou've got someone dictatingwho can do what in the city that's verypuritanicaland it's Central planning and the resultis generally the city fails like anyintelligent person leaves the citybecause there's an authoritarian tellingthem what they can and can't do in citylimitsand so that's if you look at this in thecontext of Bitcoin if you startedtelling people who can own Bitcoin andwho's not allowed to own Bitcoin that'sfirst order censorship when you tellpeople what kind of transactions theycan do on the network that's secondorder censorshipwhen you start dictating who's allowedto mine Bitcoin that's third ordercensorshipand you know the austrians would justsay leave it all well enough aloneyou're you're right you know probablythat person such and such sets up agarbage business selling unhealthy foodbut then maybe they make enough money toinvest in a research you know a researcheffort that discovers penicillinyou know I like how do you who are youto judge like where will the money finditself and there's the world's full ofpeople entrepreneurs has started abusiness they failed the first time theychanged it they became a second thingthey changed it again and the third timearound it's actually pretty usefuland the only way you can invent thingsis you've got to have the freedom tofail99.9 percent of the mobile apps all fail99 of all the ventures all fail I meanbusinesses fail all the time that's whylike when we come to this issue of youknow ordinals inscriptions nftslike I would never endorseany of it right like I'm not going toendorse an nft I'm not going to endorsea system for creating nfts I'm not goingto endorse the use case I'm just notgoing to censor someone's ability to doit I'm not going to tell them I'm notgoing to deprive them of their freedombecause depriving of their them of theirfreedom is is you know an ethical lapseI believe it's it's a it's a problem butalsomaybe someone will come up withsomething to inscribe that will beprofoundly beneficial to the world andhow are we going to find out unless wegive people the freedom to do it let themarket decideyeah let the market decide I mean that'sthat's just Austrian economic stopmeddling if we're all here in Bitcoinbecause we believed that politiciansshouldn't Meddleand so I don't think we should meddle inthis I I I don't think you canyou can't uh you can't deprive peoplethe ability to experiment what you cando is protect the protocolI I think by the way the transactionsare going to get much more expensivePeter like like this this entire debateit misses the who cares whether it's adollar or ten dollars or twenty fivedollars I mean let's take the bigpicture look out 30 yearsif you're looking to save your wealth ifyou had 10 million dollars and you had achoice to buy a 10 million dollarpaintingforeignto buy a 10 million dollar apartment inNew Yorkor to buy 10 million Bitcoinwhat would you buymost people would buy Bitcoin rightmost bitcoiners would buy Bitcoin mostpeople on this podcast Bitcoin as wellI'm just saying it's like the peopleoutside haven't figured that out yetyeah so it's a million dollartransaction fee to buy the artand it's 600 000 transaction fee to buythe apartmentnot including taxes so probably thetransaction fee for both of those firsttwo trades is a million dollars it couldbe two million dollars for the artyou're talking about a ten percentcommissionsix percent commission is basically thestatus quo for all residential realestate in the world and if you can getdown to five or four you're genius rightso the question is will people one daypay six hundred thousand dollars to buya Bitcoin worth 10 million I think yeswould you of course you would if youbelieved in Bitcoin and your choice wasyou pay a 500 600 000 fee to buy a pieceof residential real estate that's got atwo percent annual property tax on itthen it's in a higher rise and someone'sgoing to put another one up next to itor you could buy the Bitcoin you wouldsay okay well I guess I'll just buy theBitcoin the transaction fee whether it'sa dollar ten dollars a hundred dollars athousand dollars ten thousand dollars ahundred thousand dollars or a milliondollarsthat's just a matter of time and soI I think if you look at allall ways that people store value thatall the networks have transaction feesthe transaction fees are quite Highthe transaction fees to own 10 milliondollars of of an ETFwould be nine hundred thousand dollarsover ten yearsalmost I mean 90 basis points for a yearfor 10 years that's where you get so sohigh transaction fees are on a finalsettlement are actually much higher ineverything else in the world they'vejust been obscenely low on the BitcoinNetwork and for someone that wants tomove twenty five dollarsthen yeah you care whether it's onedollar or twenty five dollars but thetruth is even one dollar is too much tomove twenty five dollars you should beusing something like the lightningNetwork or you should be using cash appand going cash tag to cash tag or youshould find some more efficient way todo itumwe want the transaction fees to go upbecause we wantthis to ensure the security of thenetworkbut it is but but it's fair and ethicalbecause the truth is no one's got a gunto their head and they're not they'renot forced to use Bitcoin to do consumertransactions right everyone thatcomplains about itcould have downloaded a lightning walletanytime they wantright you can you have the freedomdownload any of 20 lightning wallets andyou can anytime you want when the basewhen the Bitcoin network is slow you canmove some money into the walletyou know put decide to you know moveyour money from your savings account toyour checking accountand um and then once it's in thelightning wallet you move it around inessence friction freecheapand sothe all the all this does is justcatalyzes new applications on Layer Twoand layer three and that's healthybecause there's going there needs to beum an explosion of those applicationsand we need to haveum we need to have these Bitcoin minersare like a network of fortresses youneed a network of Bitcoin minerseverywhere in the world because theminor in kazakhstan's fighting forBitcoin in Kazakhstan yeah and the minorin China is fighting for Bitcoin inChina and the minor in Europe isfighting for Bitcoin in Europe or Swedenor Iceland or Ireland right and I couldgo on ADD infinitumwhen when ethereum went to the mergethey unilaterally disarmedde-energized but it's kind of likeit's kind of like scuttling your entireNavy right or or or basically throwingaway your Air Force okay and it gotcheaper right they're like oh yeah it'sso much cheaper now we got rid of ourarmy our Navy and our Air Force it's somuch cheaper and so what are you goingto do with the dod budget well we'rejust going to give it to ourselvesI just kind of yeah well they did it'slike we're just gonna give it toourselves and we're going to eliminatethe defense and the security system ofthe network and it and the problem istwofold right the first problem is anethical problem you basically stole theproperty you stole you stole somewherein the range of 10 billion to 40 billiondollars worth of property from bitcofrom eth miners rightwhatever the numbers a lot they juststole it right and they just gave it tothemselves and so there's an ethicalproblem there and then there's asystemic problem which isthere's never going to be an eighthminor that goes publicand if you knew enough about SecuritiesLaw you would know that East validatorsare securities and and theirunregistered Securities and that's theentire debate that the SEC has right nowon staking and the likeif you create your own Staker you'vecreated a financial services companythat's hyper complicated and there's nothere's no real precedent for itso I don't I don't think it was wise fora number of reasonsI think we're lucky right now I wouldsummarize we're lucky we're throughsegwit we're through Tap Root right itwas a warbad things were done by everybody in thewarsome stuff you do you regretnow we're here the issue is do you haveto do it again right have we grown upand I think the Bitcoin in this pointhas grown up andnow you just let these people launch allthese these things right you know if itwasn't for inscriptionsI wouldn't have told my own executiveteam I want you to focus on developingEnterprise security applications thatleverage the Bitcoin blockchain baselayerright so I'm diverting corporate uhdevelopment effort and money and energyto createmulti-factor authentication andmulti-signature capabilities and maybemaybe we'll inscribe contracts maybewe'll we'll hash some of our documentsmaybe we'll create some other securityupdate that we can use and give that tomillions or hundreds of millions ofcorporate accountsbut you know I had the idea from youknow it's like they're doing it well I Idon't really care for a monkey jpeg I'mnot going to burn that butyou know what is something valuable Imight burn and the example I gave it'slike my willwhen I burn my will and if I if I don'twant to burn my entire I could burn myentire will or I could just hash itI could burn that I could I couldbasically inscribe the hash key of mywill store it away because you knowright right what right now my will issitting somewhereon paperand anybody with an iPhone could just goand photograph a thing change a fewwords right we should do that mancounterfeit yeah well no oh changechange Michael's uhjust a just to change track what wasthis last two years been like for you oheven or even a different question to addinto that is thatum people say Bitcoin changes them likeas it changes do you think you'vechanged during the two years has it hada yeah profound impact like there's beenlots of ups and downs yeah well big upsand downs for you right it'sI think I thinkumit's made me even more focused yepokaystress uh stress like volatility youknow impacts different peopledifferently you know some people thatwere part of the Bitcoin Community youknow whenit was going really well you know whenwhen we entered that bear Market theykind of distanced themselvesand and the impact of that on them wasthey should diversifyright so some people's lesson they takeaway from it is I got a diversify ordistance myself the lesson I took awayfrom this is this is not going to beeasy we're going to have to redouble ourefforts and focus even harder youthought you could do this and maybe doone one more thing or two more thingsand you realize noyou just need to keep focused keep laserlike on this thing this is umthis is uh going to be an intensestrugglewhat's the biggest part of the struggleis it the eyeballs on you or thecriticism or is it just managing the theup and downs of the valueI think probablyumthe most challenging thing for me in mycurrent condition our position is is uhjust managingthe uhmood of the rest of the market like allyeah the media the investors right likeit's if you've invest enough time likeyou have and you have in Bitcoin thenthe price fluctuations or you know orthe routine fud doesn't really affectyour world view right yeah but if youhaven't spent that much time and Bitcointrades down five thousand dollars andsomeone can temporaneously releases somefud oh oh the US government's going tosell some Bitcoin you know I would thinkwell it doesn't matter one way or theother if it's true or not true and youknow and it's irrelevant but but thevolatilitythe volatility creates a news event andwhen the price is going up people haveto come up with a narrative explanationfor why it's going up and so that's goodthere'll be just a hundred really goodstories when the price going up and whena price is going down there will be ahundred bad stories or negative storiesthat have to be inventedyou have to come up with there'ssomething I am deep in humanconsciousness that drives people to wantto explainevery reason for it has to be a reasonsothere'll be all this all this negativityand then someone's going to say okay Iheard about this this is this good forBitcoin and what what happens next arewe okay are we okay soI have to I just have to communicate alot if if Bitcoin was just plus 20 ayear or actually Bitcoin has been here'sthe irony Peter since we actually got inuh to the Bitcoin uminvestment Bitcoin is the bestperforming asset in the world by farit's up 140 percent or moreit's more than 10x NASDAQ it's more than6X or something s p it's a hundred Xgold it's it's destroying everythingyou can look back and see this it's kindof clocking up about 40 to 50 a yearsteadily soyou wouldn't think that would be aproblem but it is it is emotionallytorturous for investorsthat uh that aren't reallyumextremely well educated bitcoiners tohandle that volatilityso you have to continually explain it wehave to we explain it to the media wehave to explain it uh and and talk topublic investors we have to we have toalways yeah deal with the Twitter trollsright people thatthat want to come up with some negativecynical interpretation in order to driveengagement or they want you to failthey want it to have been wrongthere were people who want thatyeah it seems we have that yeah yeah wehave thatbut the thing is it yeah another cycleyou know you can be very right and it'sa whole different ball game for you thenum but I think evenyourself when Bitcoin started it about15 16 000 it must have been like [ __ ]we were here now we're here yeah ridingit from 66 000 to 15 000 is is a littlepainful especially leverage especiallywith the silvergate loan yeah I meanlook we're on the same ride here there'sjust a lot more zeros on that but likebut I'm really curious about thatsilvergate loan becauseum can you explain like how that dealwas structured when it took place andhow you actually ended up sort ofclosing it because I don't understandhow that worked with them having tobasically close down the bankyeah well we we went and entered intothe loanbefore Terra Luna melted down so so ifyou recall what the state of Bitcoin wasin the crypto economy before Terra Lunabefore three eras before every singlebankruptcy life was good I meangenerally you know it was almost halfwayto the Moon Yeah and everybody waseverybody was a massive investment modeand I guess crypto VC was all-time highand signature and silvergate had massiveexpansion plans Etcyou know and I I had like 10 companiesoffering meloans against Bitcoin and we hadyou know quite a lot I don't know Iguess I guess we had something like fourbillion dollars of uncollateralized ofjust free collaterals so four billiondollars of assets so at that point wewere borrowing 200 million with fourbillion dollarsso it's like a loan to value fivepercent yeah so so it's it seemed fairlyreasonable at that timeI think Bitcoin was in the mid 40s orin that range 45.50 yeah and then um andthen what just happened was a successionof meltdowns rightyou know and and they started with TerraLuna and then it was like massivedeleveraging and it turned out thateverybody was basically cross tradingwith everybody right I mean Alameda andthree arrows and Genesis and FTX and theentire thing just started to collapsebut it didn't come all at once right itcame in about five succession so fivebrutal beat downs one two three fourfive and when we got to umwhen we got to New Year's Eve of thisyear right that's you know fees on thebase chain were sometime one two vsatyeah yeah you know they were like therewere there were blocks with 300transaction fees in the entire blockright and um I think Bitcoin was likesixteen thousand five hundredaround New Year's Eve soat that pointumall all of the Wildcat crypto Banks hadall been wiped out right but that youknow they were just all playing fast andloose right taking hundreds of millionsof dollars of your you know depositorsmoney and then loaning it to anotherhedge fund that would then put it intoyou know anchor protocol with UST orsomething and like they were there werelike seven layers of riskrehypothecation there and so they gotwiped out but uh you know signature andsilvergate were still around and and wedidn't really have the banking crisisoutside theyou know the crypto ecosystemyou knowso and by the way that that entire thingright that was catalyzed by the FEDright the FED took interest rates fromzero basis points to 500 basis points in12 months so that's the steepest inclineand the risk-free overnight rate thatwe've seen in our lifetimes so they kindof crushed a bunch of stuff and thefirst the crypto ecosystem smashed firstwith uh with silvergatewhat happened really was just like withall the other fractional Reserve Banksthey're sitting on Long dated treasuriesor long dated or mid-dated fixed incomeinstruments and anything that you boughtany bond fixed income bond you boughtwith a duration of seven to thirty yearswhen short-term rates were zeroall those things are yielding one and ahalf to two and a half three percentinterest so so they looked better thannothing but when overnight rates or 500basis points risk-free and you'resitting stuck with credit risk andyou're stuck with interest rate risk for10 15 years they all trade down I thinkthat the entire Bond portfolio the bondindex b-o-n-dtraded down 18 percent from August of2020 uh to like last week so all thebonds traded down and so if you look atthe the bonds for the banks they're alltrading down 10 15 so all technicallyinsolvent because if you're a fractionalReserve with a ten to one ratio and yourbonds trade down 10 percent right you'vewiped you've wiped out everything sothat that's that's an oops courtesy ofCentral Banking Regulators right likewhat you know how how is that not goingto happenumso silvergate I think you know sufferedfromtwotwo unfortunate incidences or twosituations one they had a lot of moneyinvested in in mid-dated uh fixed incomeinstruments that traded downthat's the first but that didn't killhim I think what killed him is is theircredit lineuh with with uh with the federal homeloan Associationwas was not renewedso so they got a margin call from thegovernment and I I thinkyou know the the crypto friendly Bankshave not been treatedas generously as other Diversified plainvanilla Banks right so we saw withsignature a similar situation so havingsaid all that I think silvergate wasreally long run bank is a well-run bankand the fact that they didn't actuallydefault they didn't go insolvent theyweren't put in receivership and theydidn't uh they didn't lose theirdepositors moneyright and so every you know all theseother Banks they all actually had to bebailed outsilvergate didn't get a bailout theproblem with silvergate is they justdidn't have the capital so they had towind down the business I like Island aswell I think Allen's a great guy Alanstand up yeah he's he's done anextraordinary job yeah like he he'sactually I I thinkif you're looking for a role model likefor how to be a banker he is a rolemodel yeah he's great yeah up and downtoday in San Diego a couple of timesthey're just top guy yeah so I I feelbadly about that but they needed tobasically sell off all their assets andthey needed to do in a hurry so we had athree-year loan so our loan was not dueuntiluntil I guess March of 2025.sowe would prefer not to pay it offobviously we would like to keep itbecause I expect that Bitcoin will betrading and it double or triple by thenso from our point of view paying it offearly wasn't ideally that's why it was athree year loan but you know the thebusiness decision I mean they wereselling silvergate was selling theirassets at a discountlike it's basically liquidating them uhbefore they're due and taking a ahaircut to do it so in this case thebusiness decision wasdo we hold out and that might very wellcontribute to Silver Brigade being inreceivership and not being able to winddown their base so that's not reallygood for them right we could berecalcitrant but then who's going totake over the bank and then what's thatsituation going to be or do we try topay it off earlyand uh so I mean the accommodation oncewe paid it off early not ideal for usbut we got a 22 discount againstthe the fixed loan and the loan was youknow the world turned upside down theloan was so for a plus370 basis points or somethingso that was a 3.75 loan a year agobut then sopher went to 500 basis pointsso it went from being a three percentloan to being an eight and a halfpercent interest rate in 12 months sothe rest of our debt is one and a halfpercent interestso this became the most expensive pieceof debt we had and it was actuallyone-third of our interest payments ayear where you know we'vewe've got a really nice situation likeone and a half percent interest on 2.2billion dollars of debt we're paying 30million dollars a year of interest oneverything else but we were looking atpaying 15 million dollars or 16 milliondollars a year of interest just on thisone stubso from our point of view we thoughtit's expensive debt it's floating whoknows where silver is going it's it wasit's also yeah it didn't start out beinga problem but it was it was the leastpopular piece of debt we had youremember the entire yeah microstrategyliquidation yeah you know Twitter partywhere everyone was just gleefully youknow having a liquidation they're hopingthat it was a 3K the number well firstthey were like we think they're gettingliquidated to 20 000. like no it's likeless and eventually eventually I had toput out a tweet saying look I mean whenBitcoin goes to 3 500 we've still gotthe Bitcoin yeah it goes below thatwe'll figure out something else rightyeahum but you know the Twitter people werejust very unhappy that we weren'tgetting liquidated at least the trollsyeah well they've all got liquidated sothey weren't you yeah it's not fairthey're like the Bull Run can't starttill sailor gets liquidated yeah so itwas it turned out having that debt thatwas marked that was against lateral Markto Market was politically you know apublic relations liability for us rightand and uh it was just one if you're apublic companyyou know it's just one complication wedidn't needso for us to basically pay off the loanwe kind of got a triple benefit we wegot rid of a a third of our interestpayments a year and we blew away inobscenely expensive loan we yeah if youif you calculate the irr on thatif you're basically buying out the loanat a 22 discount you know you'reavoiding 50 million dollars of principalpayments and you're avoiding another 35million dollars of Interest payment soyou're avoiding 85 million dollars on200 million dollarsso yeah you know it's it's like a 30irr or something Detroit yeah so it'sit's it's a no-brainer yeah that youwould want to do that if you had thatoption soit was uh we took out expensive debt wekind of simplified the balance sheet wewe uh freed up we had a I mean nearly abillion dollars of Bitcoin posted ascollateral I could still at one point soI was like you're freeing up a billiondollars of collateral you know payingoff a loan getting rid of the interestand now you're simplifying the capitalstructure and now the the next piece ofdebt coming due is December of 2025 andit's got It's convertible to equity okayat like in a 390 strike or somethinglike that so so uh a much less let's saysometimes in public companiesyou don't want your trolls to be able togenerate or spend a negativehypothetical yeah right like if they inorder to Spook people yeah the shortsellers if they can come up with ascenario under Rich under which thingsget scary then they are incentivized toMarket that scenario so by taking uh bypaying this loan off it was it was abenefit to silvergate because they'rebasically unwinding you know windingdown the company right so they have toget the loan off their books and it's abenefit to us because we clean up ourbalance sheet and it was economicallyuh you know economically a a win for theshareholders amazingwell listen I know we've taken up a lotof your time we could have gone forhours and hours and hours moreum this is brilliant uh thank you somuch for coming intotally different entry I didn't evenlook at this I told you that uh thankyou for uh sharing your wisdom with myboy there and uh we're gonna see you afew times this week anyway haven't welooking forward to it thanks for havingme as always as always and I I shouldsay for the record I'm a big fan Ilisten to a lot of your podcasts and andlike a lot of times I'll scoop throughand I say you know which of the PeterMcCormick interviews this week do I wantto listen intoand uh I I gotta say it's exhausting forme to scroll through all your interviewsand try to figure out which one tolisten to soI'm very impressed with your work ethiclike you've created a lot a lot ofreally high quality educational contentit takes a lot of energy so I don't knowwhere you guys get it but I think it's agreat asset to the community thank youit was a big I mean six of us work on itnow sodid you watch the film have you watchedthe mining film it's that's worth itit's on my tray things I'm workingthrough that right now and you know whatthese are behind me tell me you know Ibought a football team oh yeah yeahthere's uh there are trophies thisseason we won the double I think I hadmaybe I'd heard that yeah listen thankyou so much you know we'll be pesteringyou again
