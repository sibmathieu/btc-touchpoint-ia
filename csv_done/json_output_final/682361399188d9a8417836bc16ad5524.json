  "text": "thanks michael um i wouldi'd like to ask you a question actuallywhich i don't think i've heard you talktoo muchon and i've listened to a lot of theother podcasts funnily enough actuallywhen wewhen we first emailed each other yousaid yeah i'd come on the show i've gotabout another 10 hours worth of stuff totalk about and since then i think you'vedone about another10 podcasts so i've been trying to thinkof of different things to to talk aboutand one thing thati'd like to explain isyour your education platform sailor.organd the reason i ask is because i'vetaken my kids out of um mainstreamschool state educationuh we traveled around the world withthem for two and a half years uhthree out of the four are now onlineplatform learning self-directededucationcaitlin who just met chooses to go tothe local collegeand i think you have a quite unique takeon on education andwhat that means and and where this isheaded so i'd love to get your thoughtson that pleasesure yeah it's a subject near and dearto my heartum i grew up in a military familymy father's a non-commissioned officerandwhen i graduated from high school ithink the sumtotal of my family's life savings for200 years would have covered the firstsix weeksof college at mit it'sit's it's expensive now to go to collegeit's always been expensive it's gettingmore expensivebut my recollection then wasthe life savings of a middle-classfamily would payfor halfway through your first semesterand then you're bankruptand so i the only way i went to collegewas i got a scholarship from the airforceand i went as an rotc cadet you know ijoined the militaryand it was that or i just couldn't gothere right and umwhen i got there it was it was anobscenely expensive education paid forby the united states government andi remember my first class was physicsand i'm sitting in a physics hall andevery freshman at mit goes through thisclassand it holds like 500 peopleyou know it's a 500 person lecture hallso you can imagine sitting at the veryback row of a 500 person lecture hallwatching someone come outand and scrape on a blackboard and theguyis about a hundred feet away from meand we're sitting in the back and we'rescribbling down and we're trying tofollow the lectures and then we go backto ourour dorm or fraternity or wherever youlive and then you study the books reallyhardand then you take a test once a week andfor the privilege of thatthey charged somebody the u.s governmentor individuals they charged themabout the amount that a middle classperson would save in three yearsexpensive now if you fast forward todayit occurred to me at some point thatwell couldn't we just record thatand put it online on a website and letpeople watchthe lecture online and today if you goto sailor.org which is mynon-profit organization you can find thesamephysics teacher and the same lecture iwatchedfor free and by the way it's not justfor freeit's better because it's a lot better toto start and stop the video watch it atyour own rateand then be up close and be able to zoominand see what the guy was scribbling onthe whiteboardso it's not just free but it's betternow if you think aboutyou think about this entire subjectdeeply and let's take mathematicswell when did they invent algebrait's like it's not a hundred years oldright it's notisaac newton invented calculus in thecalculus of variations and he publishedprincipia mathematicaand that was what 1776 or somethingso that's like 90 of all the higher mathyou're ever going to learnone guy printed in the 18th centurybut most people you know they getthrough algebra and geometry algebra'sthousands of years old geometry isthousands of years old rightso here's the question why is there acopyright on thatlike why why do you have to pay for atextbook why do you have to pay for thateducationby the way why do you actually need 250000 mathteachers to teach something which is 2000 years old and there's only one wayto teach itit's like you know you wouldn't hire 250000 people orwhat would it take if we wanted to playbeethoven's seventh symphonyin your living room with the fullorchestrawouldn't it be prohibitively expensiveto provide music in such a fashionlike it seems kind of ridiculous rightlike like no i'm not gonna hire 250musicians to play beethoven's seventhsymphony as my technique to give themiddle class people musicit's i mean it's somewhere between sillyand moronic right i don't know what youwant to call it butso why is it that the the federalgovernmentor or a university would hire someone toteach algebraor calculus or calculus of variationsor matrix algebra or thermodynamicsor physics right in fact if you look atall the mathematics and computer scienceandand engineering disciplines and then youask what are all the things you learn incollegeand then you say what do you what'swhat's the portion of a collegeeducation thatthat can be decomposed into virtualeducation and what's the portion thatrequires physical educationwell i get the country club aspects ofschool likesometimes you're actually paying forschool because you need someone tobabysit the kidor you want to play tennis or you wantto meet people or you want to walkthroughyou want to play golf or you want toplay intramural sportsor you need a place to live right therethere's that elementand then there's the element of learningcalculusand now we get to this issue of umif i hire a hundred thousand people toteach calculusare they all equivalent in quality or issomebody better than somebody elsepresumably in a bell curve there'ssomeone who's the best teacher andsomeone that's the worst teacher andeverybody in the middleyou know and uh we only listened tobeethovenor brahms or mozart right it was aprices lawyou know they said like there's fivethis is jordan p i'm channeling childrenjordan petersonthere's like five classical musiciansthat are responsible for 50of all music we listen to andthere's like five percent of their worksthat are responsible for 50of that sowhat's the idea behind sailor academythe idea is why don't we just makeeducationfree for everybody forever and could youwell i can't make golf and balletlessons free forevery forever yoga is not you know ican't quitedo some of these things but uhjittered bug square dancing lessons andand you know if you want tolike a laboratory maybe i can't quiteget that freebut anything that's virtually teachablein theory you can decompose to thetextbookthe lecture the online examinationthe the um the exercisesif you do that then you should be ableto upload it and if you upload ityou should be able to reduce thevariable cost fromwhat is it like it's it's two hundredfifty thousand dollars of variable costfora high-end college education in theunited states todaywell shouldn't the variable cost bereduced to the depreciationon the computer and the electricityyes so what is the real variable cost ifyou wanted to learnhow if you wanted to learn mathshouldn't you be able to get amathematics degree forabout 97 in electricityor maybe it's 19 of electricity insteadof 250000 dollars so umi started thinking about that and istarted thismore than a decade ago and the idea wassimplycreate an online university nowi have one other observation on thissubject dan which isif you want to cure cancer or invent afusion reactoror go to mars or if you want to solvethe problem of global warmingwhatever your problem is you want toclean the oceans of the earthall of the really difficult problems inthe world probably requiremore than a high school education infactif you think about school right highschool gets you to the point where youcan move through play to societyuniversity undergrad gets you the pointwhere you recognizeknowledge exists everywhere a master'sdegree gets you the point where you're amaster practitioner in some area givengiven a set of tools and a phdtheoretically is defined as the point atwhich you've mastered a body ofknowledge enough to make a seminalcontribution to the civilizationif you have a phd in biochemistry intheory you're supposed to be able tomake a uniquecontribution to the body of knowledge inthe human civilizationergo you want to solve really difficultproblems you need to get to the graduatepostgraduatephd level and last i checked there werelike10 million phds in the world i mean10 million to 20 million but i think itwas like 10 millionum and there's seven and a half billionpeople in the worldso you want to make the world a betterplace you need about a billionphds well i mean what we really wantrightwe don't really want 250 000 people toteach algebra and calculusand geometry what you want is a computerto teach algebraand calculus and geometry because thecomputers first of all it's freesecond of all it's on demand third ofall is probably bettermuch richer in every one which way youknow augmented with software tools rightlikeyou want to learn to build an airplane igive you the lectures and i give you theairplane simulatorand i give you the wind tunnel and youdesign your airplane and the simulatorwind tunnel snaps the wings off and youtry it againyou don't kill anybody and eventuallyyou know how to design an airplane or atleast a nice gliderthat makes sense so we can do that for amillion people for a nickelright so i mean or or you can spend aquarter million dollars at mit which isthe otherapproach then it does take a rocketscientist to figure out the problem herewhich is there's no way you can affordwhat's it cost for a phd a billionpeopletimes it's a million dollars to get aphd five maybe five hundred thousand ona budget in the western world and uhyeah let's just say 500 000times a billionhow much is that right a thousandbillion is a trillion rightfive hundred thousand is 500trillion dollars a lot of moneyso even if you had the 500 trilliondollars right who's got you knowcan we actually do it the old-fashionedway with bricks and mortar'sinstitutions so the answer is no it's anintellectuallybankrupt idea but it's kind of sillyidea rightlike why in the world do i have toactually pay that much money to learnhow many people do you know that youwent to school with the new moremathematics than isaac newtonknew because i don't know manyright not many isaac newtonput it all in the public domain dan200 years ago and yet right now theimpedimentis a bunch of gatekeepers people charyou know charging expensive money fortextbooks expensive coursesyou know expensive certifications andwe're going to hold back all thesepeople because they don't have fivehundred thousand dollars to get amaster's or a phd in mathematics eventhoughthe information's in the public domainand you couldargue well you can download principiamathematica from google butyou know we want to augment it there's alot of ways to augment itso the fundamental issue iseducation's too expensive but itshouldn't beand we need a lot more of it and theonly way to get a lot more of itis to a drive the variable cost to zeroand b create softwareto teach people you know software canpeople will say well i need to go dothis wellyou're not really i mean you can likecreate a you can create a virtualsimulationwhat happens when a you know when afour-year-old kid can create a bridgein a simulation umand then build a bigger one and a biggerone and then apply an earthquake to itand then blow a wind past it and hit itwith a cat5 storm and then watch it andthen change the material on it andthen drive cars over it and put truckson it and then have umyou know a really heavy truck smash itand then rebuild the bridge the rightway and they can do that allinstead of watching netflix between agesof four and eightmaybe maybe we'll find some realemergent geniuses like the mozart's likethe gauss's like the isaac newtons ofthe worldbecause we give them those kind of toolsi i wasn't going to mit without an airforce scholarshipi wasn't going and i wasn't gettingthose lectures and there was no internetand now you know i guess the best thatcan be said is today you can kind ofbypass that and go to youtube but westill don't haveum as much formalized structurededucation as we needso my passion around the sailor academyand sailor.org is let's justmake uh education free to everybodyforeverand uh we're just biting off one thingat a timeyou know the the stem science technologyengineering courses are the easiest onesundergraduate umwe first started doing that then westarted doing cross accreditation withother universitiesin the next 36 months we expect to getto the point where we're a degreegranting university it'll flip to be thesailor university and then anybody canget a full degreeand we'll expand the the courseofferingsyou know as as time and capability allowthat's the idea man i'm all ini love it this is music to my ears i'vebeen beating the drama against like thethe education system for well since weleft it it wasn't until we left it andlooked at it fromyou know an outsider looking in and fromfirst principles that you realizewhat it is and what it's become and whatit was actuallyever meant to be and um you know just away toorganize society and uh create factoryworkers or soldiersand it's pretty much the same systemso what you're doing i think isabsolutely incredible andthis this ties in nicely actually towhat i wonder about becausei've been hearing you talk about thevirtual wave a lot and obviously youryour first book was the mobile wave soone i'mi'm getting thinking perhaps there's a anew book coming out at some stage calledthe virtual wavebut this idea ofeverything going virtual and what you'vefaced at microstrategypretty much going from brick and mortarcompany to virtual companyin the course of days and taking onbrick and mortar educational system andtaking that virtual as wellwhere else are we going to go virtualand and are you going to write anotherbookyou know um i wrote the mobile waveand uh you know that i kind of laid outa future which is a future whereapple amazon facebook and googledematerialize everybody andand uh i think i made 50 000 dollarsin royalties on that book and nobodyread it[Laughter]on the other hand you invest 50 milliondollars in those stocks you would havemade 10 to 20x your money soso it's the lesson i learned but by thewayi invested in the stocks made a lot ofmoneyright my company got the benefit of memarketing the bookyou know and i got 50 000 in royaltiesand andi made a promise to myself if thishappens againi'm not going to write the book i'mgoing to buy the thingas much of it as i could possibly buyand then i'll talk about it and so thevirtual wave is kind of an inversion ofthatyou know i the company invested its 500million dollarsin the virtual wave and in this caseit's virtual goldor virtual monetary energy calledbitcoinand uh i'll talk about it but nobodywants to read books anymore at leastby the time they read the book it'll beoverso you know authors don't really get therewardsyou know you have to actually takeaction so yeahmaybe one day i'll write the book but ikind of rather think that peoplethey learn via uhvia youtube podcast and podcasts andyoutube videos and the likeso you're probably better off just totake action and tweet about the thingwhich is how i feel about that yeahlet's talk about the virtual wave i meanthe virtual wave isis a fascinatingthe mobile wave was thedematerialization of a lot ofstuff that could touch a mobile devicethe virtual wave is thedematerialization dematerialization of abunch of other stuffa bunch of people a bunch of processes abunch of productsand if we take let's take university oreducationyou know the virtual wave has reallyaccelerated the dematerialization ofeducationand the decomposition of it i don'tthink people in the education businesseven understand what's happenedbecause the first thing that happens isyou shut down the campuses and thenpeople start to go online and theyattend classes onlinebut if you think about it as soon as youstart to attend classes online yourealize thatyou know maybe the platforms you'reusing aren't right and maybe the teacheryou've gotdoesn't teach very well online and thenyou're you're sitting in a very slowslot you know stodgy lectureand then you go on youtube and yourealize you can get find a betterlecture online on youtubefrom someone that isn't at youruniversityso if i'm really going to learnthermodynamicsyou know online from my professor at mitmaybe i would better rather learnthermodynamics onlinefrom the person that won the nobel prizeor maybe i'd rathergo to the khan academy or may you knowor i'm going to study the history ofwinston churchillor or somebody like that maybe i'll justgo online and listen to the speechmyselfmaybe i'll just go online and learn fromwinston churchill himselfhe gave a speech i might find that onyoutubeso it starts to screw with your yourviewswhen i talk to my executives i say youknowyou can now zoom anywhere at the speedof light and you can bend time and spaceso what are you going to do with thatpower and the bending of time and spacetwist it screws with people because theydon't right nobody everybody likes theidea that oh i can stay home and zoomsomewherethat's that's not that threatening okayhere's the threatening partwe used to have 40 hours worth ofmeetings in personand 75 of it was a presentationand then we went virtual we found thatwe could just ask people to record thepresentationas a video and submit it in advance ofthe meetingand so now my 40 hours of meetingsbecame eight hours of meetingsand you know what happens if i give youa two hour video of all my thoughtsyou run at 150 speed nowhen you're watching something forentertainment you watch it at one hourequals one hourbut when you're listening to someone foreducational purposes you listen toone hour equals an hour and a half forone hour equals two hoursso you speed listen because most peopletalkkind of slow and take a while to get tothe point and it drives you nutsso you're immediately more productiveand then of coursethey start telling you something youalready know so you skipso when you're actually listening foreducation you go twice as fastand you might go four times as fast sonow it changesyour view which is why would i invite 25peopleto a meeting to listen to someone talkfor an hour i could just send 25 peoplethe videoand they can figure it out but half thepeople already know the stuff beforethey get the video they already know itonly three people in the meeting thatare learning anythingand so now you start saying well what ifi had the ability to learneverything i wanted on demand at myspeed when i want toand then the next thing is well why do igot to learn from youwell in business what that means isour 40 hours of meetings become fourhours of meetingsokay you had to con what am i going todo with the rest of my timeokay i i want to suggest anotherdisturbing idea for you what if everytime you met with mei already knew what you were going tosay before you opened your mouthyou know what would our meetings consistoflike like let's say you work for me andand you run engineeringand i already know everything you'regoing to sayand every presentation before ourmeeting startsso the meeting starts like it used to bevery comforting like youlecture me for 45 minutes and at the endof the meeting i ask a couple questionswe talkyou get to warm up in the virtual wavethe meeting starts at 8am and it goeslike this click click how are you dani'm goodso dan why is it going to take you sixweeks to do that with four people whycan't you do it with two people in twoweeks and i don't really want thatfeatureand you go well i i guess we could dothat and i said well so and if you dothis can we do this this and this likewell i thought so but i can't do it lastthing okay so let's do the first seventhings and do it in half the time withhalf the people rightokay click 803 am meeting doneyes but what do i do likelike a three minute meetingthe only reason to have a meeting withanybody anymoreis negotiation interrogationcollaborationi'm gonna i'm gonna interrogate you andcollaborate a little bit and negotiateand then we're going to settle and themeeting's overso why would anybody ever come to ameeting that isn't going to be party tothe negotiationso that 40 people in the meet in theroom that took 40 hours becomes likefour peoplein 15 minutes and now what are yousupposed to do with yourselfnow let's take that to educationwell everybody got kicked out of schoolwell so the next thing is i gottaeducate you gotta educate your daughtersyourself so now youyou're not limited to what the teacherat school can you knowyou have a fourth grade teacher what'sthe odds that they're the world's bestgeometry teachernot high what's the odds that they'rethe best you knowhistory not high what's the odds thatthey're kind ofaverage and and moderately mediocre inevery possible waypretty high you know if they're theworld's best musician or world's bestmathematician or world's best teacherthey would do it in front of an audienceof 800 000 people rightand they are by the way on youtube orsomewhereokay so it kind of sends you into thisinteresting spiral which iswhy did i just go and put together astack of things for myfamily to learn and then why don't theylearn them at their own rateright there's a that classic rightyou're really going tohandcuff everybody to a desk and makethem listen for eight hours straightand they're gonna get one hour of thisand one hour of this and one hour ofthis and one hour of thisand if they're smarter than everybodyelse in the class they get dumbed downand if they're dumber or they're slowerthan everybody in the classthey get left behind and if everybody inthe class goes exactly at the same ratein a regimented fashion for 18 years orfor 12 years then you get to graduatefrom high schoolso what do we do we had a regimentedmediocre 12-yearslog which tests your umfortitude and your patience and ifanybody gets out of controlwe dose them with adderall you know givethem a prescription drugso that doesn't make a lot of sense anduhwhat does make a lot of sense by the wayyou want another interesting observationdan since the virtual wave hitif someone asked to meet with me i getreally irritatedat having someone present to me irllike in real life or that's to say ifyou'representing to me where one minute equalsone minuteand i don't have a stop start skipbutton and a speed up button on youit's really an imposition it makes meimpatientlike i'm very impatient now likeanother way to say it is like you wantedto spend two hoursof my monday talking to me aboutsomething why didn't you submit thevideoin advance so that i could cover yourtwo hours in like 37 minuteson a saturday afternoon so that i couldactually reclaim my timeduring the working day to do somethinguseful i'm irritated that you'reforcing me to take 120 minutesand think as slowly as you speak rightbut it's everybody can listen50 faster than you can talk everybodyyeahtry it go back on youtube pick anythingpunch it up to 150 percentokay so now don't you think i just gaveyou a third of your life backand by and so now let's take that toschool let's apply that to 16 years ofeducationcan you imagine putting a billion peoplethrough 16 yearsof 2000 hours of mediocreregimented authoritarianyou know force-fed uhlowest common denominator you knowdogma it's like it sounds like a recipeforbrainwashed mediocrity or at least butforget about theyou know your value your view as towhether it's a better or worse way toeducate someonedoesn't it sound like an expensive wayto do itit's like custom manufacturingeverything sohow about a better way to do it what ifi'd justuploaded everything you wanted to knowis streaming on demandfrom kindergarten all the way through20th grade and then what if the parentsor you know maybe you want to homeschoolyour children but maybe what you want todo is gatherwith the neighborhood group if you wantyour children to be together for socialreasonsmaybe the emergence of a of a village orneighborhood school system where there'sone tutor and that one tutor guides thechildren and if you've gota daughter that's going to actually getthrough calculus of variations by age 14fine let her go that fast if you haveyou know someone that wants to learncivil engineeringyou know i i went to school you wereallowed to learnuh latin or spanishi think maybe french french or latin orspanish those were your three choicesokay so like what was the odds i wasgoing to master russian or chinese itwas likei wasn't getting that now you thinkabout it today and you thinkwell why can't we just give everyone theability to learn everythingfor free whenever they want and theanswer is well we canso i think you've got threethree things in the educationestablishment right now that are vyingcontending with each otheron one hand you've got the mission ofeducatingand you can take um what is this like atrillion dollaryour industry something it's somegod-awful expensivething you can take that and collapsethat by a factor of a thousand or tenthousandlike if the united states governmentinvested a million a billion or twoa few billion dollars a year they couldupload all of the courseware in justabout everythingyou could imagine and maintain it everyyear for like0.1 of the amount of money we spend oneducationso the production of education untilactuallythat's a problem that can be solvedtechnically and the secondproblem you have is the certificationregulationyou know of education it's like you knowi used to meet with people and i goyou know we can teach all these coursesin uh in virginia you know we could likeprovide free education uh for all thenurses in virginia on 75of their courses and the person's likewell that's good we're not going to givethat to west virginia are wewe don't want them to have it like wellbut you know butokay i'm about to say well you know wecan actually give it to pakistanand india and the world and they'reangry that we're going to give it towest virginiabecause we only want to do that invirginia becausewe can't have people from other statesgetting the benefit of thatso there's an entire educationestablishment that wants to controluh control uh this by certification andregistration and licensingthat's a political problem it's not atechnical problem at allyou have to actually find somebody thatwants to educate the worldmost of what we have is all about uhcreating scarcity and the credentialsright we all know about digital scarcitythere's a lot of creative scarcity ofeducational credentials in order to holdprices upand then the third part of educationright is is theis the country club nursery schoolbabysitteryou know bricks and mortar aspect that'sjust in loco parentisyou know from k through 20 you knowsomething to do that's not going to besolvedquickly and easily by technology whathappened this year ispeople had to stop and reassess theirviews on educationnow um you asked about virtual wave ijusti think this is just rippling like awave through everything the realquestion is to what degree can youvirtualize and de-materialize theproduct or the serviceand and it's a cultural issueas well as a political issue more sothan a technical issuebut i rather think i i think when thedust settleswhen the dust settles i think uh peopleare going to realizethat a lot of concepts are obsoleteand they need to be reformed in in adifferent fashion because of the virtualwavethe way especially the concept of localfor example i said uh i say to peoplethe definition of local is you speak mylanguageand you're in my time zone like you'reawakein my time zone we're local right nowas long as you speak fluent englishand you're awake and and to the extentthatyou're not awake and you can't speak mylanguage then you're differentso if i redefine that then what's thepoint of having local schools and localuniversities and local businesses andlocalpractitioners like like a local doctorif you know at some point localaccountantslocal service providers all that'sbendingand this you know when that happens thesecond thing that happens is you startto ask the question what can beautomated and what requires a personand the third thing that happens isit totally breaks down all the laborbarriers becausewhy can't i you know have the laborcoming fromeastern europe and then why couldn't itcome from any jurisdiction and what if idon't know what the jurisdiction is andand so you you've got a massive umheat exchange heat a balancingof of energies where instead of hiring awhy do i want to hire a 250 000 a yearaccountantif i can find someone that speaksenglish that knows accountingthat costs 25 000 a year that livessomewhere else as long as they'reif you work the lake [ __ ] late shift ineuropeit's the same as working the normalshift in the usand so that means somebody in lithuaniais just as local as someone in newjerseyif they speak english and they want todownload new jersey tax codeand uh that i think that's going toripple through everythingand a lot of things and there's good toit and there's bad to it and theyou know the implications a lot ofpeople haven't quite grasped yet butthey'rebut they're happening pretty rapidlyso rapidly and you are clearly at theforefront of thisand what what kind of blows me awayand many of the other bitcoin bitcoinersin the spacethat have um seen youlike uh come into bitcoin understand itlike the way you understand it and theway that you tweet about itand um very so far deep down the rabbithole that was such a quickfall down to to grasp all of those it'staking me likefive years like just to try and pieceall this together so either your yourmind is justrapid and it just gets all of thesethings and puts the uh pieces of thepuzzle togetheror i don't know this likethis virtual wave that you're talkingabout the bitcoin way that you'retalking about youyou've been ceo of microstrategy for 3132 yearsbut is that right yeah since 1989right and now i i'm just wonderingwhat do the people around you what dothey seewhat what do they like all of a suddenwe were doing businessone way 30 years of doing business andslight iterations and now all of asuddencompletely on its head and i've heardyou say beforeyou're the kind of ceo that would nevereventhink about remote work now you'veflipped that on the headand you see the virtual wave clearerthan anyoneyou can talk about it clearer thananyone you've goneso balls deep into bitcoin that's justabsolutelymind-boggling what are people around youthat they must just see like thiscompletely different personor are you prone to these kind ofu-turns beforewell first of all the job of the ceo isis to guide the organization and toreactto changes in the environment so it's nodifferent than the job of every leaderof every organization right now and andwhat you have is some peopletaking decisive action there's plenty ofthem i'm not the only onei i'm i'm probably an obvious one inbitcoin i'm not the only one in bitcointhere are a lot of other very decisivemovers in bitcoinyou know stone ridge is a very decisivemover in bitcoinyou know what jack dorsey is doing atsquare is very decisive in bitcoinyou know what paypal is doing is verydisappointing in bitcoin sothere's a lot of decisiveness going onumi you should give yourself credit dan ii pointed this out to dan hell too youknow so you took five years to figure itout buti had you i had five years of youfiguring out to accelerate meright the basis of cryptois this idea of proof of work and andthe idea of proof of work isyou exerted an obscene amount of timeand energyor obscene amount of energy and andencryption powerin order to solve a problem which thenit's veryit's a billion times quicker for everyother nodeto validate that you solved the problemthat you did the workso the asymmetry is the secret to howthe networkworks and and so how dothings spread in time like for examplei'm an engineer i'm not a scinewton you want geniuses newtoneinstein mozart beethoventhey extracted stuff from the etherthat you couldn't do in a million yearsthat i couldn't do in a million yearsif i tried a billions i couldn't do it imeanfor thousands of years humanity workedwithout the calculus of variations incalculusand newton that one guy probablycontributed 90of everything around us that one personlooked up and extractedso much physics astrophysicsnow took him a lot of work or a lot ofsomethinghow about every single math student thatcame along after him how long did ittake them to figure out that calculuswas usefullike you think it's hard for me tofigure out that calculus is usefulno an engineer figures it out i'm anengineer i'm a very pri'm not um an engineer is not umdogmatic or or or umwell religiously againstthings that work i give you a chipi give you a math i give you a componenti give you steelokay it's not by the way is it hard tofigure outthat steel's a good thing not really isithow hard is it to build the buildingwith steelit takes some effort do you want a steelbuildingyeah if i gave you 500 million dollarsand i said build a big building wouldyou use steelyeah now could you inventsteel could you create the first steelfactor steel refinery that's hardright steel refineries blow up they killeverybodyright we could spend 10 000 years tryingto work that out that'sif you ever studied you know metallurgyright materialswhen you get to the part where you'restudying steelit's pretty intense and they give youall these umthick books thousand pages steamtables you know and and uhyou know what's the right amount ofcarbon to mix intoyou know into iron to get steel verycomplicatedi look at it and i think i would neverin a million years want to have to havefigured that out but i'm happy to acceptthe giftyeah i'm happy to accept it and and soproof of work is like someone did a lotof workbut you don't have to be as you don'thave to have as much horsepowerto figure out that the hash function isright as you did to actually do it inthe firstplace and that's why this stuff spreadsfast becauseyou did your work dan did his work vijaydid his workright all of all the maximalists didtheir workthey had less information and they hadmore uncertaintyand so it took a lot more effort you hadto thinkmore deeply i did my work but i had alot more information only took me a fewmonths toyou know a month to come to theconclusion because i had a lot moreinformationthen i invested 20 years worth ofearnings in a few weeks okayi took 20 you know you talk about workrighti took 20 years of energyand i put it on the blockchain in fourweeksand then i made it publici published the hash function right andi saidi did all my work i looked at everybodyelse's workand then i printed a block and my blockis 500million dollars or actually 600 milliondollars worth of energy that was thetotalnominal amount of cash i put into theblockchainand i put it out there and now i leaveit as an issueif you have 600 million dollars you cango back and spend six years and do whatdan prince didor you can do what vj boyle potty did oryou can dowhat dan hell did and you can thinkabout thator you can spend the one month and youcan go to hope.com and read everythingmichael saylor reador you can skip that and you can justsay hey here's a dude thatputs 600 million into the blockchainbecausehe thinks it's the first true digitalmonitoring network in the history of theworldand it's the facebook of moneyand and i think what people don't getlike not everybody getsi think they'll realize there'sinvestors out there they're justlooking for an idea this month i have ai have 10 billion dollars i have to put500 million in somethingokay what's this idea okay guy puts 500million into bitcoin why well because hethinks it's the ultimate safe havenasset it's better than gold and it'sgoing to be like facebookyeah and he put the 500 million in yeahlet me read that againokay give me some of that they don'thave to go down the rabbit holeright they don't have to do the workthat you didany more than a node has to do the workto validatethat the block is good they just have toread the hashright it's a it's a quite it's aquestion of do they trustme right and probably not everybody doesbut you don't got to convince everybodydan you just got to convinceanybody right there's 10 000billion dollar entities all you got todo is convince a handful of themand by the way i don't you don't have toconvince them as much as me i saidwell i've looked at it it makes sensethat i'm going to put substantially allof my free cash into thisyou know at the company level i had 500million in cash i'm gonna either buy mystock back or buy bitcoin with it asfast as i canbut you wouldn't have i mean that's athat's a treasury reserve assetcommitmentyou could copy that but you could alsosay welli'm paul tudor jones i have 10 billioni'll just put 500 million into thisthat's a much lesser commitment you knowthere are people that'll put 500 millioninto a bad idea if you've got a 100billionin your portfolio you might you mightbet 500 millionexpecting you'll get 100 to one returnone percent of the time or five percentof the time i think that's a good ideaso so i think that's whyuh you know everything's acceleratingright and it's it's a fireright it's a as i said it's a campfirethen it's a bonfire then it's a forestfireand you're like well i don't get it whyis the fire like spreading twice as fastwell because it's an exponential processbecause it's because it's spreadingtwice as fast because twice as manyat the end of the day by the way it'sit's important that 100 million peopleembrace bitcoinbut there's 10 people 10 people that cantriple the price of bitcoin10. right this isthis is not like facebook i make thispoint likenobody ever brought a billion friends tofacebook this is not like facebookthis is like when a person with 10billion dollars decides that they wantto adopt this network and theyput two or three billion dollars on thenetwork that's going to be moremonetary energy that flowed in thenetwork than the first 10 million peopleput in the network it's a 10 million toone gainyep but you know here's the other thingwhen a person with 10 billion dollarsputs 10 billion on the network they'vegot a friendwith 10 billion dollars right warrenbuffett plays bridge with bill gatesright you know and then they talk withmark zuckerbergso when this hits that social networkit's like okay well a billion to twobillion to four billion to eight billionand those four decisions those fourblockshave more impact on the network than thefirst 10 million blocksand so that's what's driving uh bitcoinand what what i expect is going to driveitbut we all we all stand on the shouldersof somebody right i mean thathuman civilization and engineering isbased on the idea that you figure outhow someone else worked this out youcopy it and then youdo it and uhif if you try to reinvent the wheelyourselfright no chance you got at some pointyou got to figure out who you're goingto trustare your friends and family like do theyquestionare you like the rest of us annoyingbitcoin guy at the dinner tableyou know it's like it gets in your headdoesn't it and then pretty soon it justkind ofyou can't get it out of your head youstart talking about ityeah like mac max kaiser the high priestof bitcoin he's likeno it's bitcoin bitcoin bitcoin it'sgonna get you it's gonna cleanse youi i love max i think i yeahand another people they don't understandit until they understand it and thenthey get itit's like that conversation with uh withkeith mccullough you know and it's likeoh my god he's goingwell when i sell bitcoin and i said wellkeith if you understood bitcoin youcould never sell bitcoinlike nobody that understands it couldsell if you're trading it you don'tunderstand ityou know it's a shiny object like a lurespinning at the end of a fish hookand you're you're thinking somehow thatthere you're playing with thestupid shiny object like juggling fireor something and it hasn't occurred toyouyou know i give you the gift of fire youcan change the civilization it's themost important thing of humanity andyou're trying to juggle these littlesparklers on the fourth of julyright you either get it or you don't getit but once you get it you're likehey we invented fire here let me i gottaexplain this to youthis is important this is a big dealit's not a shiny lure at the end of afishhawkthat interview uh thanks on behalf ofthe whole bitcoin community for going oni couldn't watch half of itjust because of the other guy and uh howdisingenuous he is uh and then when hefollowed up withum the the comments and stuff and thewholething the the guy is just yeahare you blocked by the way are you partof the blocks brigade because he's blindi'm not blind i noticed all the harnessgot blocked i thought that was reallyfunnyi thought that was great but well thememe's likehe's got a he's got some people now onhedge eye and we want them to hear aboutbitcoinand so it's an opportunity to spreadbitcoin and if he talks about bitcointhen that's good for bitcoin and soi think we gotta we got to deal withthati i'm obviously i'm not a big fan oftradersand uh and financiers like in generali think when we when we start to talkabout trading andwhen we characterize bitcoin as oh it'sa call option it's an it's anuncorrelated asset you know i've gotthis macroeconomic modelyou know what i want to do is i want toshake all these people and sayi give you the gift of fire it'selevating the human race above theanimals andand it's going to be the key to humancivilization and us spreading throughoutthe galaxyand you want to juggle itanyway um when we when we hit all-timehigh perhapssend him over a bottle of screaming evilscreaming eagle cab savjust to uh so he can cry into a glass ofthatbut uh i want to ask you about uhmicrostrategy have you hadhave any of the employees reached out toyou about this what's what's beenwithin within um within the companyyou know we have a very technically uhadeptemployee base you know they're softwareengineers we create software wewe sell software we support the softwarewebuild applications and and and all thesoftware is about intelligence soso this has been our i think a real shotin the arm i mean i think they reallythey like this they're excited aboutbitcoin they're excited aboutthe uh about the potential of cryptoum i think it's been a realgreat source of enthusiasm and and uhit's good for morale for us to be doinga good thingand be forward thinking with regard tothe technologyand it opens up a lot of really niceopportunities for the companyyeah tons and i wanted to ask you aboutis there anyare you already thinking about thingsthat you can build out to supportbitcoinnew bitcoin companies that are cominginto the space that need businessintelligenceis that something that uh that you guysare already looking at and thinkingaboutyeah we are i mean one of the reasons wewant to run our own node and in additionto justgenerally contributing to networksecurity and and uhselfishly protecting our own interest wealso think that's a greatsource of of uh cleandata and so we use the nodeto extract the blockchain and theblockchain becomes our data set and thatdata set is of coursequite interesting to anybody with the250 billion dollarsof money on the blockchain and all thosewalletswe've got um we've got some really goodtechnology for manipulating andanalyzing data setsand we've got hyper intelligencetechnology for creating hyper cardsthat give you insight into uh thoselargeum data sets and so sowhat you'll see is uh what we're gonnado next is start to release hyperintelligence for umfor the blockchain or for for thebitcoin blockchainand uh i think that'll be interesting tothe communityand then um and then make that hyperintelligence availablein a in a sas multi-tenant environmentso thatanybody can build their own bitcoinrelated hyper cards in a matter ofminutesand then they can embed them in thoseapplications and they can use themin order to in order to enrich theirofferings or to makebetter decisions and and we'll follow upwith other technologiesbusiness intelligence technology that'splugged right intoum to the blockchain data set and what'swhat's your thoughts around like thethe pushback against um chain analysisand that being bad forfor privacy and for people that have youknow been hoddling on the blockchain forfor many years and would prefer privacyoveranalyticsum i think that there's a a pretty richmarketright now of different companiesproviding different capabilitiesall integrated with the bitcoin standardright and and so you've gotfor those people thatwant to self-custody right if i'm thecryptoanarchist you know and i want to beready for after thezombie apocalypse whatever you know whenthe internet goes downthere's offerings for them and that'sgoodif i want to if i want to hold all of myuh my own monetary energy there'sofferings for them andif i want extreme privacyyou've got z cash you've got monerothere's a competitive market for privacyright and and which one will win will zcash win willmonero win will something else winunclearwe will find out um there's acompetitive market for crypto bankslike kraken and they're regulated inwyomingand there's kyc obligations and there'splenty of people that want to buybitcoinon a regulated kyc bank right i meanand why would you because it's illegalnot tolike i i i can't go ahead and buy on adecentralizedexchange without kycas a public company officer right sofidelity and coinbase and krakenthey all have their place now binancehas a much richer offeringhas more has this spot market againstthe futures market and iwhen i go to finance i salivate i'm likeoh this is great man all thatwouldn't it be cool to short the forwardand by the spotand lock in the spread and and then iread the part where it saysaccept if you're a u.s citizen i'm likeokay wellnot for me but it's out there forsomebodyand how do i feel about it am i going toleave the united statesso that i can trade on binance no likedo i think it's good for bitcoinyes nowif bitcoin was known as the network ofabsolutecomplete privacy it would becounterproductive to the interest ofbitcoinbecause right now the regulators in mostcountriesthere's there's two use cases there'smultiple use cases rightthere's one use case store of value overa long period of timethere's another use case medium ofexchange for coffeethere's a third use case buying stuffin an uncensored way so that governmentscan't stopthere are three different use cases nowwhich of the three is most important ihappen to thinkthere's a 250 trillion dollarvalue to store a value what's itwe can store all 250 trillion dollarsthat's inbonds and equity and precious metals andinvestment commercial real estate on theblockchainon the bitcoin network with the currentbandwidth with the currentuh with the current block size with thecurrent settlement speedswe can store all 250 trillion dollarsforever and keep it safefor 100 years 200 years 500 yearsis that valuable yeahis that enough yeah actuallythat's enough like do you need to havemore value proposition than 250 let mesay it againwe can store 250 trillion dollarsforeverokay so you think there's a problem withthe value proposition of a 250 billiondollar networki don't think so by one day there'll bemore than 250 trillionwe can store what's like 2 500 trillionhow much is that it's a lot of moneyright quadrillion somethingwe can store that much money on thenetworkforever that's enoughit's good now you want to buy a pizza ora coffeewould i use bitcoin cash no i would useapple payi would use you know would i use squareor paperi wouldn't even use paypal or squareright i mean i wouldn't bother todownload another tooli would use apple pay but you might usesquare or you might use paypal or youmight useyou know google pay or you might usesomething on amazonam i going to use a crypto network noprobably not i just i if you're doingsomethingwhich is uh compliant withand and is not multi-jurisdictional youdon't need a cryptoyou absolutely need a crypto a store ofvalue for the nextyou know 500 years across alljurisdictions it's pretty obvious if youwant virtual gold you need cryptoyou don't need crypto to buy a pizzait's a silly notion it's silly to sayyou're gonnayou're gonna run bitcoin 20 times fasterby doubling the block side becausebecause apple pay is going to run at 20billiontimes faster oh but likeif i'm a criminal on the run i can'torder a pizza with apple payyeah i guess give me a listlike what percentage of the world isconcerned about that use casei don't think many soi don't i don't really see the valueproposition forroutine medium of exchange beingdominated by crypto i think thatcentralized networks right like lookthe real question is will square be ableto compete against apple paythat's the question that's the hardthingthere is zero chance that a cryptonetwork is competing against apple payand there's zero need because theaverage person doesn't need to put morethan five percent of their monetaryenergyinto a mobile wallet any given periodrightif you had if you had a hundred thousanddollarsyou're putting 95 000 in a savingsaccount 5 000 in a checking accountif that maybe 2 000 a checking accountand then you sweep it in soso for your sweep working capitalaccounts you're going to use centralizedbanksmobile banks or conventional banksand that takes me to privacy is there aplace for privacy and censorshipresistancesure there is um who's going to do itprobably some special purpose cryptonetwork will develop itwhat's wrong with just sweeping yourmoneyinto that thing that you know if whatyou want to do ishave a bunch of non-censurable you knownon-trackable pure cash transactions dothatis there compliance risk yeah a lotright will will governments attack itcertainlyyou know will the chinese you betright there they're attacking bitcoinwhat do you think they do about privacycoinright well the russians the russianshave not have not shut down bitcoin butthey'llshut down privacy coin with the americangovernmentprobably like it seems to me like it'sputting a bull's eye on your foreheadso you have a choice if youjeff i'm sorry daniel i'll ask you thisquestion umif you had a choice you could makebitcoin completelyprivate uncensorable dark webuntraceable tomorrowor you could wait for bitcoin's price togo to a million dollarsand then we could talk about it againwhich the two would you choose it'syeah it's a great question and i i i'mseei get turned upside down on this becauseithe non-kyc and the kyc coin uh debateand i think um if in five to ten yearstime we havea two-tiered market for for these coinsi thinkmost people are just assuming that thethekyc coins are going to trade higher ithink it could be the other way aroundbecause we'll bewe'll be so so much further down theroad where bitcoin is so much moreacceptable byso many more people and ummore regulations and governments aroundthe world that thethe non-kyc coins could be the ones withtaint as we use in air coin uh airquotesum might trade at a discount whetherthis actuallydan you've got a two-tier market nowlike you've got one it's called zcashand monero and bitcoin you have atwo-tier marketthe market's already put a price on themyou can go figure it outthe price of a privacy coin is tradingat one200th or 1 100th of the priceof bitcoin the market's already givingyou the answerbut by the way it's common sensewho do you think's got more money in theworld the peoplethe institutions that are subject togovernmentuh jurisdiction and regulation orpeople that aren't subject to regulatoryjurisdictionlike for example you think i could buy anon-kyccoin no no i i can'tlike you think it's a debate like youthink you think there's a debate thereyou think i had an optiondo you think that any institutionalinvestor in the world has an option tochoosewhether or not they'll go the kycchannel or the non-kyc channelthere's not a single institution no onethat's going to investmore than 10 million dollars in bitcoincould possibly go the non-kyc routeand maybe no more than maybe a millionis cut off i don't know what the numberis but here's what i can tell you offthe top of my head99 of the money has to be going througha kycroute which means 99 of the valueof bitcoin is based upon the fact thatit'snot threatening to the status quowhat do you think happens to any bankthat says to the united statesgovernment we're not going to report theten thousand dollar wire transferswhat happens to that bank and how longwould it take for that to happenyeah okay so you run a bank daniel thebank's got 250 billion dollars in ityou have a choice your bank can become100 times biggerand you can comply with some to somedegreeor you can send a letter tothe local government saying you'vechosen not to complyand not only you're going to doeverything you possibly can to notcomplyyour bank's going to go to zeroyou know maybe if you're lucky it'll goto one percent of what it isum and and again what did you gain therelike what was the benefit becauseninety-nine percent of the moneysimply uh nine percent of the moneydoesn't have a choice they can't one waythe otherand we can have an intellectual debatea philosophical debate about the virtuesof privacy andand censorship resistance versusthe virtue of um store of valuebut here's one thing that's pretty clearthe likelihood that a politician willallow you to engineera system that that stores monetaryenergywithout power loss is much higherthan the likely that a politician willlet you engineer a system to laundermoneyi mean it's kind of that simple right ifyou say to people bitcoin is uh isvirtual gold and you can holdand and it works better than gold andthat and we're going to use itbecause it's a monetary energy networkthat doesn't uh have a power bleedwell it's a it's an engineering system iget itbitcoin is a way to to to avoidthe 10 000 limit on wire transfersand kyc that's an altogether differentthing that's a different battlei don't think that's a battle you winand so when i say it's counterproductivei think that um if bitcoin was hijackedby the uh privacy extremistit would probably kill the network butby the way if you really wanted that whydon't you just go to zcashyou've already got it right you'vealready got it with monero or zcash orsomethingso if you really if that's what you wantwhy don't you take your moneythe mon you want to be private and justmove i'm not being snarky i'm seriousliketake your money and put the amount thatyou want to be private in a privacywallet on zcashand the upside is you'll have theprivacy and the downside is you have therisk of them shutting down the entirenetworkand you live with that and that'sthat's life yeah i'm fine with bitcointhanks umthat's that's that's all for me um iwonderit's the main the mainthing about the privacy thing is and andwe i thinkyou know we're coming obviously fromcompletely different ends of thespectrum here many peoplethat have been stacking away for thelast however longum truly believe that they're going tobecome wealthier thanthey've ever been before and that'sthat's the fear i thinkwhere these privacy things come fromthat they don't want to bea target whereas you've beena very wealthy person for for a longtimeyou've probably never ever feltthreatenedor um personally uhattacked for for makingyour first million dollars sort of thingwhereas most people on the street herethat have been stacking their setsthey've never had that they can't theystill can'tget to that get to that pointbut i guess my point here is i'm notagainst privacy and bitcoin is notnon-private right i mean there's a fairdegree of privacy on the networkno one's publishing a list of thehundred thousandpeople that have the most money inbitcoin right i haven't seen that listright right i mean ii haven't seen a list of the top 10 bythe wayso you know there there is a fair degreeof privacyin bitcoin right nowand if someone said i like the virtue ofprivacy and i would like to not be outedi don't disagree with them i'm not infavor of like publishing a list of 50million wallets along with the socialsecurity number and theaddress of the people right like uhwhat i'm saying is bitcoin does what itdoes right nowand it's been successful because it doeswhat it doesi don't think you need to fix it likefor examplei don't think that i don't think thatthe lack of moreprivacy is an existential threatto bitcoin i don't think the networkwill be destroyed if you don't change iti i i can embrace the idea likeyou know with like taproot and snoreand uh and multi-sig and the like i canembrace the fact that some upgrades willbe bet we'll be good for itright and there and there are there areincremental upgradesfor security for privacy for scalabilityand those are good things so i iunderstandwe should do good things in a verycareful fashioni don't have another other comments onthati believe that uhthe fact that people have options isbeneficial to the networkright let me say it a different way likeif you operate on bitcoin and no oneknows who youare ever and you're anonymous wellthat's a good thingand the fact that that there areyou know self-custody solutions whereyou never have to rely upona kyc bank or you know or an exchangelike that's a good thing that keepseverybody honestbut um you know railing about railingagainst paypalwhich is a totally different thing it'slike well you can choose not to usepaypal because you don't likethe constraints that paypal puts on youand i respectthat on the other hand if paypalbrings 100 million more users on thenetwork you'll benefiteven if you're that privacy advocatethat doesn't want to bein that system you'll benefit from it infact every single time another bank oranother provider brings on anotheruh bitcoin uh a bitcoin service orbitcoin product it strengthens theentire network for everybodywe all beneficiaries i'm a beneficiaryof what binance is doing even though ican'tuse binance and people that use paypalto buy bitcoin benefit from binanceand hobblers that have their ownhardware walletsthat never would you that never usebinance that never use paypal thatyou know that are disgusted at theanathema of kycand disgusted it whatever anybody elsemight dothey benefit economicallyfrom the actions of other bitcoinstandard companiesand i i wouldn't be sojudgmental everybody's got their owncircumstancesright it's like there's an orthodoxy butlike butfor the for the guy that's got paypalinstalled that wants to buy a thousanddollars worth of bitcointelling them they can't do it in fivesecondsand they have to like there's this thingwith bitcoiners they talk about goingdown the rabbit holeit's like the guy wants to give you athousand dollars and he's gonna clickonce and put the thousand in a networkokay that's one wayor the other way is you can tell them tostop andattended a 90-day concentrated coursefor 500 hours of studyingand then he's got to buy 16 pieces ofhardware and he's got to memorize 24seed key phrases and then he's got tocreate three backups and twosafe deposit boxes and then you beat himhalf to deathso that he can like put a thousanddollars in the networkand the point is that i mean for for thelong-term maximalist and the hardcorebitcoiners it's a rite of passage andthey love thatthat's true but but i meanwhy don't you just let the guy put thethousand dollars on one click on thenetwork andlive his life if it's going to doublethe price of it's going to double thevalue of your bitcoindo you really have to let the perfectenemy the good if warren buffettgot up tomorrow morning and he just saidi want to buy 50 billion dollars worthof bitcoinjust get it done are you guys all gonnalay downin front of a tank and say he's notallowed to he hasn't gone down therabbit hole he hasn't earned the righthe needs to memorize 24 seeds and gethis own hardwarewallet and he better like go and read abunch of stufffirst because i would have talked to himabout you know something or otheror you're just going to take his moneytake the 50 billionand your bitcoin is going to triple invalueand it's going to be as private as theprecautions that you took to keepit private and if it's if bitcoin is notprivate enoughmaybe taproot will make it betteryou know and if that's not good enoughthen maybe you'll move some over to zcash and there's always the next thingyou can go to righti mean make your decision let otherpeople make their decisionthe guy that operates um a guy thatoperates a regulatedinsurance company they don't have theluxury of the debateover like you know the private hardwarewallet seed keyyou know it's like they don't have theluxury but it'sbe empathetic there's a dude that goesto workthat's surrounded by 27 other people andthey don't have the abilityto like hold their own keys and do thisand that and the other thingthey can put a billion dollars on thenetwork thoughthey're allowed to do that and so youhave to decide isis is bitcoin inclusiveto everybody and ever by the way ifi'm in a country and they're going todraw and quarter meif i do it that way and my choice is ican either give you all my money and notdieor i can take my money and i can try todo it with a defydark network stored hardwareasynchronous satellite up link while onthe runand if they catch me they're going tomurder me and my family it's likeyou know really you got to shove yourdogma down the guy's throat just takehis moneyhe buys the thing he doesn't haveprivacymaybe his government does whateverthey're gonna domaybe the person suffers maybe theydon't sufferwhat's the skin off your back youbenefited the guy the guy actuallybought in the network the network priceof bitcoin goes up you're a beneficiarysoi think live and let live i can'tmaybe i can't have a it's like thesurvivalist you know it's likesome people want to buy a flashlight andbatteries some people wantyou know their own cabin in the woodssome people want their cabin in thewoods with their own generatorsome people want the cabin in the woodswith their own generator and they'regoing to go ahead and become a doctorand they're going to stockpileantibiotics against the time whenyou know and then you could always havea little rowing machine to generate yourown electricity when thesun goes out there are different degreesyou know of buying into the visionlet everybody decide what they can doand and and make the and and keep inmind this one last pointnot everybody has a choice doesn't youcouldyou can convince me i don't have thepowerto do it the hardcore wayright even if you convince me i justcan't do itright and that's the difference betweenyou know being open and inclusive youknow and being exclusionarythe market will make the decision and ithink thati think that everybody should keep inmind in the crypto worldif paypal doesn't give you the right toself-custodythat's an opportunityright they don't you should be happythey don't because now you canyou can sell something that they're notsellingright at the point that um paypalembeds it in their product it getsharder for square at the point thatapple embeds it intoapple pay it gets harder for paypalrightright this thing rolls downhill and aslong as there's someone that's notsolving the problem if coinbase is notgiving you the privacy you likewell then that's an opportunity for thezcash people oryou know the you know the um thedecentralized exchange one way or theotherand if you're right in the world in themarketplaceand in and in the world then you willyour idea will prosper and it will growand if you're wrongit will linger and get snuffed outand that's darwinism soit is what it is the market will decidebest idea wins maybe lots of ideas whenmaybe just a few ideas when we will seebut right now we have bitcoin and youknow for me it'sit's pretty much perfect as it is andit's beenamazing to to see you come into thespace anduh and shout from the rooftops andum tweet about it uh your tweets arepoetic as some people are calling it andum you know great analogies as wellthe famous one the cyber hornets so it'suh it's brilliantum do i have any time for a few lastquestionsyeah i just we should wrap it up in thenext couple of minutes but go aheadall right well last one i always ask onequestion at the end of each showand that is if you had one orange pillleft to giveto someone who would you give that toand why[Laughter]you probably ought to give the orangepill to the richest man in the worldbecause he's the richest man in theworldthere you go put that straight on thenetwork you would have it's a monetarynetwork after allexactly and do you think would you iknow you've saidyou've been very vocal in the fact thatyou'd never selluh bitcoin this is something you'regonna huddle for a hundred yearsis there gonna be a point where you willbe payingemployees or um contractorsor business suppliers in in bitcoinwhen when do you envision happening youknowfirst of all i think the bitcoin is theideal treasury reserve asset sofor that reason if you're selling it youneed to be selling it because there'ssome other asset that's betterand i don't see a better treasuryreserve i wouldn't sell it to buy a bondor a stockor a precious metal or real estatebecause i don't think those are bettertreasury reserve assetsif you're st if you're selling it youprobably need to be buying a jet or ayachtyou know or your dream house right orget married right you need to be buyingsomethinga passionate thing something a passionto save your child's life right i meani can come up with an idea as to why imight sell but it needs to be somethingthat that involves passion not apersonal thingnot something that involves aninvestment decision so that's what imean when i say thatum with regard touh to paying people ii've articulated this before but i thinkthe point isuh it's an asset it's not a currencyi don't think it's a currency um itthe tax code is hostileto using a crypto asset as currencythat is to say every time if i getpaid a thousand times in bitcoin i havea thousand different taxableacquisitions at different bases if i paya thousand bills i have a thousanddifferent transactions and i have tomarkthe value of the bitcoin to the price ofbitcoin at the time i did it andcalculate the capital gain or cap thelossthe accounting is a million times hardersonotwithstanding the first observationwhich is i'd have to spend years fiveyears and 10 million dollars to rebuildall my accounting systems to do itdoesn't make a lot of sense my secondobservation isi don't think the accounting softwarecompanies could do it if i wanted themto saporacle jd edwards uhworkday i mean these systems don'tsupportthat complicated accountingso it's a massive systems problem butthe third point isif your employees wanted bitcoin there'sno employermine that wants 100 percent to be paid100 in bitcoinwhat they want is to save bitcoin huddlebitcoinso why as uh an employer would youpresumeto dictate to them how much they shouldhave just pay them in the local fiatcurrencyand then let them buy whatever they wantwhenever they want it right the naturalway that a multinational would work isyou're paying in 20 different currenciesall your billsand you're receiving all your revenuesand all the currencies and youraccounting systems work that wayif you work for me daniel i pay you uhyou take 20 percent of your salary youbuy bitcoin you take the other 80of your salary you pay your operatingexpensesyour decision not my decisionright as to what you buy and when youbuy it umthe employees get all the benefit ifemployees really wanted bitcointhey have the ability to buy bitcoin noone's stopping themright like what if i told you i wasgoing to pay you an apple stockwouldn't you be a little bit irked at melike isn't it kind of presumptivelike what if i thought i was going topay you in bars of goldright so i look i think thatthere's a you know there's a there's ahardcore set of bitcoiners thatthat love the idea of using it toreplace the dollarbut again now we're back to medium ofexchange andlet me say it again the value of amedium what do you think the value ofmedium exchange isdaniel in the free marketif bitcoin was as good a medium ofexchange as apple pay what would it beworthextra nothingthe value of a medium exchange isnothingzero nothing becausesquare paypal apple googlegive it away for free to 7 billionpeopleand it works a billion times faster andbetter than ourthan bitcoin cash or bitcoin satoshivisionor bitcoin it's it's it'san oddity it's like an interesting coolthingit has no commercial value what's thevalue of likeduplicating youtube's video server onthe blockchainwe could do that nothingright what's the value of the third bestsocial networknothing that's the problemthe best one has all the value once upona time they calculatedum they calculated the amount ofof uh profit in the mobile phonebusinessand they found that apple computergenerated 150 percent ofall the profits in the mobile phonebusinessanother way of saying apple made all themoneyand every other mobile phone providerlost moneyin aggregate competing in the space thevalue of being in the business wasnothing zeroand so the value of bitcoin as a storeof value isin theory up to 250 trillion dollars thevalue of bitcoin as a medium exchange isnothingso no i don't think i'll pay myemployees in bitcoinbut no it's not because i don't believein bitcoinit's just because i think it's misguidedintellectually to try to use bitcoinlike a youtube streaming video networkor use bitcoinyou know like snapchat i mean like hecki could use bitcoinlike you know i like audible do you wantto do your podcasting on bitcointhere's a million things people do withsoftware just because you can do it inswith softwaredoesn't mean you should do it and ithink that you know when we went downthat forkyou know and roger he went that you knowsatoshi vision and bitcoin cashit was just a fork in the road and theymade thisawful strategic mistakebecause you had a choice store of valuemedium of exchangemedium of exchange is worth nothingto seven billion people it's a commodityit's given away by apple andgoogle and by the wayand they can do it better because youonly need aboutone to two percent of your monetaryenergy to be in a high speed mediumexchange at any given timestore of value is impossibleto be delivered a company can't deliverit a government can't deliver ita centralized network can't deliver itso one of these thingswas the most important value the mostimportant inventionin the history of the world and theother of these thingswas there's probably 1 000 paymentnetworks betterthan a crypto payment than the bestcrypto payment networkand the first one or the you canprobably name the firstfive or fouri i can't name the next 995and so at the end of the day the realthe key here iscompanies desperately need bitcoin as atreasuryreserve asset they don't need to rip outtheir accounting systemsthey don't need to rip out their theirpayment system they don't need torip out their payroll systems they'renotbut by the way it's not that i don'tget that it's valuable to do thesettlement transactionit's there's a difference between sayingi'm not likely to use it versus sayingwe shouldn't have itwe we need we need the work that goes inthe lightning networkwe need the btc pay server we need theability to dotransactions peer-to-peer on thesettlement networkbecause it's the deterrent value it'sthe ability to movethe money from one bank to another bankor one counter party to anothercounterparty the fact that you knowi could do it if i needed to do it whichis what keeps you honestthe the freedom to transact butthe freedom to transact is extremelyvaluablebut the transactionspeed and utility of doing it a billiontimes as frequently is not so valuableso back to stoicism just because you cando a thingdoesn't mean you should do a thing it'sabsolutely essential that bitcoinshould be able to transactand if you know if you're my bankand if you're my counterparty if you'remy government and if you know i cantransactthat's going to protect my asset abilliontimes a month it's going to protect myassetbillions and billions and billions andbillions of times becauseevery possible conceivable attack rightmight be thwarted by the fact that ihave a back doorso it's important capability butthere's a difference between knowing youit's like the gunin your house you have a gun in yourhousemaybe you want people that would do harmto you to know you have a gun in thehousebut you don't fire off the gun 19 timesa dayyou're just gonna hit yourself in thefoot with the gunso it's a deterrent it's a it's anuclear deterrent right just like thethe nuclear deterrent that maybe stops awarmaybe i that's the way i see transactionuh capabilities on the blockchain it's avery important deterrentbut but to then decide that i got to useit just because i could use itit takes me to another place and thatthat doesn't make any sense nor is itnecessaryi love it man really do and i just gotone last fun question for youand you you can be as short with thisanswer as you like okayum obviously you you've tweeted aboutrunning the noteuh have you have you consideredasking your employees to to always spinup a notehow many do you have employees2 000 employeeslook i mean the amount of bitcoin thatwe doi announced we ran one node but that'sjust what i put out in the public i'mnot going to tell everybody everythingthat we dojust because it's inappropriate forsecurity purposes and also forcompetitive purposes and the like uh butyou could expect that we will actuallyengage in a lot morebitcoin activity as time comes byright it's i can't do everythingimmediately everywhere and if iand even if i could i'm not tellingeverybody rightfor obvious reasons but you can probablyinferuh that i'm enthusiastic and thecompany's enthusiasticand we see lots of opportunity here andwe expect to investacross the ecosystem in a variety ofwaysexcellent michael thank you so much foryour time really appreciate it anduh everything that you bring into thespace it's uhit's amazing to have you know awhale on our side and a whale that's notgoing to be looking to dumpwhich uh you know has happened manytimes in the pastyou've lifted the price floor and you'veum and a personal thanksfrom uh the guys at tahini's i don'tknow if you follow them on twitterthe canadian yeah they're great yeah bigfani interviewed ali the other day and hesaid uh please say thanks because uh itwas your news that that pushed them overthe edgeto to get into a bitcoin standard fortheir own their own family businessand it's definitely making a huge dentman it's it's youyou're affecting people's lives andthinking and it's uh yeah it's great tohave you along for the ride it's uh it'sbrillianti'm inspired by tahini and and i thinkthat they're inspirational for a lot ofother businessesand uh i think that this is a veryformative stage for bitcoin i thinkpeople still they there's a there's afirst generationwho are speculators and traders and idon't think they really appreciated whatthey hadand there's another generation they'regoing to see thisas the world's first perfected digitalmonetary networkand it's it's an engineering featand you have an opportunity to plug yourtreasury your monetary system intoa digital monetary system the bestdigital monetary systemit's not a speculation right it's it'snot a financial instrumentit's not a cool investment idea it's notait's not some kind of like summerromanceright it's the romans invented aqueductsyou have the ability of an aqueduct inyour town are you gonna like turn it onfor the summer and turn it off and tradeit andyou know and sell it it's an aqua dockrightthat's what bitcoin is it's an aqueductit's electricityyou can have electricity to your townright we needonce you get that idea it's electricitydudelike well i thought i'd trade it andthen i'll like sell it at the end of thesummer and wait for it to like becheaper it's like it's electricityyou want to shake the people you knowand i think that uh tahiniyou know helps with that when peopleadopt a bitcoin standardit helps with that as we start toexplainthis is a it's a feat of engineeringwonderwhen we engineered steel plants and wewere able to create steelit's like it's steel like we thoughtwe'd build a town with steeland then we'd stop and for the next 30years we're built with woodno yeah steel weinvented steel we invented electricitywe invented aqueducts it's awe i give you a bridge it's a bridgewe're gonna have it this summer but youknow when are you gonna tear down thebridgei'm not tearing down the bridge it's adamright like the challenge is tocommunicate to peopleit's a fundamental engineeringadvancementthat underpins the progress of the humanracewhen for the first time in the historyof the human racewe're able to store and channel monetaryenergywithout power losslike a nuclear reactor like somethingbigit's a bit we're flying airplanes forthe first time in history we can fly ina plane and not crash and burnyou know like were you going to use thatthis summer and you're going to sell theairplane so you can buyyou know a sailboat no i am not going tosell the airplane it's an airplane it'ssomethingimpressive people that trade itthey don't understand it they justseriously
