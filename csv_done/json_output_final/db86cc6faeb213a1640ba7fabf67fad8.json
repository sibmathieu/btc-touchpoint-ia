We discuss the intersections between the campaigns to demonize meat-eating, the corporatization of the food system, the proliferation of chronic disease, biased nutritional science, global deficiencies and malnutrition, and animal-rights groups. We also touch on the biological indicators which prove meat-eating is natural, and we talk about how animal have been systematically obscured from perception and cordoned to industrial methods, and how that separation has been integral to animal rights abuses. We discuss the connection between The Great Reset, the World Economic Forum, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the UN, and the transformation to factory produced foods, as well as the expansion of “protected areas” under plans like 30x30 or “Half-Earth.” We talk about what models of scientific analysis should be implemented in the future to understand the complexity of human nutrition science with more rigor, as well as the need for certain regulations to end animal cruelty and regenerate land.Check out the ALEPH2020 website for more information, and refer to this image when we start discussing “pre-domestic, domestic, and post domestic” livestock relationships.Come and join us at the Ancestral Health Symposium in Los Angeles at UCLA, August 18-20!
