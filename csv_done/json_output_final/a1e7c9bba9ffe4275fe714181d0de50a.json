out start9.com and withthat let's dive into the tutorialso let's chat prerequisites what are yougoing to need to know in order to startusing Phoenix wallet and luckily to behonest not a lot the setup itself isvery simple andum for some it may be your very firstBitcoin wallet actually now the onething that you'll need to know is whereto get your hands on bitcoin and there'sa lot of different places you can do sodepending in which part of the world youreside of course I mentioned Hollowhuddle off the top and that's a greatoption for a peer-to-peer non-kyc ifyou're in Canada bull Bitcoin is a greatoption if you're in the USstrike cash app Swan Bitcoin if you'rein the UK coin corner but there's a lotof different places where you canpurchase Bitcoin and a number of themwill also allow for lightning Networkwithdrawals and you're going to see moreand more of that but even if they don'tdo lightning yet which is effectivelyjust a network that makes Bitcointransactions faster and cheaper you canstill send regular Bitcoin transactionsto Phoenix wallet so because of that youdon't really need to know a lot aboutthe difference between on-chain andlightning Network Bitcoin so with thatif you do have some prerequisiteknowledge about how to send Bitcointransactions or lightning transactionsfantastic but more or less you just gotto figure out where you can get Bitcoinand you'll be able to send it and dealwith it within Phoenix wallet withoutdoing any extra major steps to getyourself using lightning so with thatlet's dive in and get started withPhoenix walletso you can grab Phoenix wallet from anyapp store whether it be Google play oriOS and once you get it downloaded andopen it up you're going to be greetedwith a welcome a screen which basicallywalks you through what the app does soyou can just kind of go through these itdoes advise you that payment channelsare automatically created when needed soif you're new to bitcoin you don'tunderstand what a payment channel isbasically think of it as just aconnection to this app so that you areconnected to the lightning Network andcan send and receive payments it saysthat the fee is one percent to connectso this is a one-time thingthere is a minimum so not less than 3000 SATs at the time recording thisvideo that's about a dollar somewhere inand around there and again one time uhfor example if you see or if you receive250 000 SATs the channel creation feewould be 3 000 cents okay you just hit Iunderstand you move on and then it sayshey you're in control a backup phrase isgenerated storing all the informationneeded to recover your Bitcoin fundskeep it safe and secret and this is muchlike many other Bitcoin wallets wherethey give you 12 or 24 words you writethem down you keep them safe if anythinghappens to the app you can use thosefive or those words to recover so we'rejust going to hit get started and thistakes you to the main screen it says Ihave read and agree with the terms ofservice and you can either restore thatwould be if you have 12 words to recovera wallet or create a new wallet we'regoing to hit create newand that is pretty much it you are nowall set up you know have a functioningwallet but it is important of course toback up your wallet so let's go throughthat process now because we do have thatnotification on the screen and it willstay there until you back up the walletso all I'm going to do is I'm going tohit back up my wallet and it says Heythe backup phrase known as the seed is alist of 12 English words it allows youto fully recover and access your fundsif needed only you alone possess theseed keep it private do not share theseed with anyone beware of fishing thedevelopers of Phoenix will never ask foryour seed and do not lose this seed seesave it somewhere safe not on this phoneif you lose your seed and your phoneyou've lost your funds so you need tohave either the app on your phone or the12 words are ideally both but if youlose one then the other can be used tostill access your funds and recover okayI'm going to hit display seed here andit's going to show me these 12 Wordswhich I will now make note of off thescreen and write down on a piece ofpaper now of course These funds if youguys are seeing these 12 words you'll beable to access these funds afterwardsI'll be sweeping the wallet once it'sdone butnonetheless you don't share these withanywhere anyone you don't keep themdigitally you have a physical copy ofthem all right so we'll be right backwhen I jot these downokay I now have my physical copy so Ican hit I have made a backup of my seedand hit OK at this point I can back outof this screen I'm on the main screeneverything's all clean no morenotifications my wallet is fully set upand ready to goso let's just get an overview of what'sin front of us basically you have yourmain balance up top here you will have alist of transactions down below as youstart sending and receiving if you tapthe balance it will change to USD as adefault but you can toggle back andforth between USD and SATs if you'resuper new to bitcoin just know that asat there are 100 million SATs in awhole Bitcoin but people tend to use theterm SATs now more frequently becausethe lower denominations make more senseto deal with instead of decimals down atthe bottom of the screen you've got thesettings wheel and a receive and Ascenduh button the in the settings you'regoing to have a whole bunch of differentthings but mainlythings like do you want to display setsor do you want to actually deal with thedecimals of a full Bitcoin just kind ofthe theme and the look of everything isis in hereuh you can connect to your own node ifyou don't know what that is you don'tneed to worry about it you can bydefault connect through Toryou can also set incoming payments andfees and all that kind of stuff is inthe details here we'll get into thatlater and then app access settings youcan add screen locks and stuff like thatyou can view your recovery phrase againas we did in the beginning through thesesettings and then finally some of theadvanced stuff you have logs you canclose your channels you can look at yourchannels list and you can actually wipeeverything close and get everything onchain again some advanced stuff here youdon't need to worry about that if you'reunfamiliar the main things you're goingto be dealing with is the receive screenwhich gives you a QR somebody can scanor there's a copy button where you canshare that information and with thatinformation people can send you paymentsyou can also edit this to request aspecific amount and hit create invoiceand uh then finally you can actuallyreceive Bitcoin with a regular Bitcoinaddress and we'll explain that in alittle bit and then finally you canactually scan and receive via Ln URLwe'll demo that in a little bit as wellif you want to expand the QR code tomake it easier to scan you just tap thelittle two arrows there to expand it outand if you want to share it via adifferent app it'll give you lots ofoptions here it'll open up your app menuand that is it for the receive screenthe send screen by default will open upyour camera so you can scan QR codes butdown below you'll also have options formanual input paste from clipboard loadimage so if you had like a QR code savedas an actual file on your phone youcould use that and for the manual inputyou can put in a Bitcoin address alightning invoice an Ln URL a lightningaddress all kinds of different paymentmethods and we'll go through thosemomentarily but you basically goteverything laid out here and there'salso FAQ up in the top if you want tosee some of the frequently askedquestions and that's the layout forPhoenix so let's actually get using thiswalletso the first thing that you're going towant to do obviously is receive someBitcoin into your wallet so we're justgoing to hit the receive screen we'regoing to do it in the simplest way justdirectly hitting receive and gettingsomebody to scan the QR code that ispresent without having to input anythingit does give us some notification herethat your wallet is empty the firstpayment you receive must be at least 10000 SATs soum yeah the first incoming transactionhas to be above a certain threshold sojust keep that in mind but I've gotPhoenix here on another wallet on myother phone and so I'm just gonna fromthis other phone I'm going to hit thesend button and I'm going to scan the QRcodeon the screen and so this could be thesame as a demo that you might do foronboarding somebody new but on thesender's phone it's going to prompt themhow much do you want to send okay andthey can do that in SATs or USD or bitsor whatever it may be so I'm going tosend over let's do 300 000 SATs oops notthree million okay that's about ninetydollars okayso I'm just going to hit pay and and wewill see kind of uh how quickly thepayment shows up so I'll hit pay on theOne phoneoff it goes and it's pretty muchinstantaneous okay so let's take a lookat what happened on the receiver end Isent 300 000 SATs but we see 297000 coming in here and the 3 000 sat feecovers the cost of opening a new paymentChannel effectively what's happening isthis wallet is now connected to theBitcoin lightning Network and the feethat we just incurred will not takeplace if we were to receive anotherpayment so just as another quick demohere I'm going to hit receive I'm goingto do exactly the same thing withanother payment I'm going to hit sendI'll scan and maybe this time I'll sendover I don't know let's say 5 000 SATsand I'll just hit payokay I received that now and the senderhad a fee of about five SATs which is afraction of a penny uh the receiver haszero zero fee associated with that okayso just to show that now receiving Ihave a connectionum a payment Channel and and so I'm notpaying those fees anymore and we can seethat gets added to the balance andnothing is removed from that okay sothere we go we now have a balance we arecapable of receiving Bitcoinfantastic we're gonna do uh sending outthe opposite way just so we can see thatit functions just fineso in this other wallet here say Iwanted to send to somebody exact samemethod they hit receive I hit send in myphone and I'm gonna scan and let's justmanually put in an amount maybe I'll dodollars this time just so we can kind ofsee what that looks like let's send overfive bucks andor watch it happen at the same time fivebucks there we go and it figures out howmany SATs that is at the current time sothere we go and the fee that we paid was14 sets so again fraction of a pennyand there we go so we can see all ofthese transactions here we can actuallyclick on the transactions too and seeany of the details thereum and we can add add notes uh to themwhen I go to send I can add a specialnote there if I want to so anywayseverything here is now in order andfunctioning we've done some basic sendsand receives let's take a look atdifferent ways that we can send andreceive with invoicesso to receive with an invoice it's verymuch the same as before we're going tohit the receive button first but thenwe're going to go down to the bottomright of the QR code and we're going tohit the little pen and paper and thisallows us to designate an amount we'dlike to receive so let's say I want toreceiveum I don't know 2 000 SATs andagain I can give this a note as I'mcreating it if I really want to I'mgoing to hit create invoice and now thisQR code is actually encoded with theamount I'd like to receiveso back on the other wallet I'll justhit send I'm going to scan the QR codeand it automatically fills the amountrequested I can hit payand off it goes perfect the inversewould be true for sending out so I'm notgoing to demo that but that is how youutilize an invoice within Phoenixnow you may not always be right in frontof somebody to be able to scan QR codesso you can actually also copy theinformation as text and send it over toanybody so if I hit receive and let'smake an actual invoice here for sayanother thousand SATs I'm going tocreate that invoice and then I'm goingto copy this string of digits here andI'm going to send it over to this otherphone with a messenger and then I'llcopy it to the clipboard so I'm justgoing to send it over to myself viaemail and I will pick it up over hereand we'll see what it looks like when wepaste it inokay on the second phone I've now goneto my email copied all of the digitsthat uh that was sent over from thisphone I'm going to hit send it's alreadyin my clipboard I'm going to click pastefrom clipboard down at the bottom it'llpaste in the information and we can seeit autofills what needs to be paid and Isend it off and there we goand the last thing I want to show forreceiving with Phoenix wallet is viasomething calledlnurl and this is basically where youcan scan uh or input some informationand it actually allows you to receivevia scanning a QR code so that's whatI'm going to do here I have an Ln URLlink for a dollar here and it will allowme to redeem this dollar if I scan soI'm just going to actually hit thereceive buttonand then it's going to say use Ln URLlink so that will open up my camera andthen I can simply scanthis QR code it says you are redeemingfunds from lightsats.com this is for awebsite you can make tips for people andit says it's3310 sets I'm going to hit redeemand there we go I've now redeemed 3300sets and that will now be reflected inmy wallet and the transaction is thereso just another way to receive funds toyour Phoenix walletnow I wanted to show one other thinghere in the receiving screen and that isif you go to receive and you arereceiving from a mechanism that does nothave lightning enabled you can stillreceive via a regular Bitcoin address soif you go down to show a Bitcoin addressyou can actually scan this and it willallow you to receive funds via lightningnow it's important to note that this QRcode here and the address below it arenot actuallyunder your control this is a swapaddress and it explains down below itsays this is a swab address it is notcontrolled by your wallet on chaindeposit sent to this address will beconverted to lightning channels depositsmust be at least 10 000 SATs and the feeis one percent or a three thousand setminimum just like when we initiallyconnected ourselves to the lightningNetwork and so any withdrawal from anexchange any send from any other Bitcoinwallet whether it be a hot wallet or ahardware wallet whatever you may haveyou can send to this and Phoenixautomatically in the background willreceive that Bitcoin and then create alightning channel to you and bump all ofthose funds to your side of thelightning channel so that you are fullyfunded and you have control of yourfunds but it is now on Lightning sothere's a degree of trust here obviouslyin the process of sending to thisaddress but it very quickly becomes alightning channel to youumso we're going to demo this we're goingto send over a transaction to thisaddress and we'll see what it looks likewithin Phoenix okay so I'm here on mycomputer and I have Sparrow wallet openif you're unfamiliar with this wallet donot worry uh I link down below to atutorial on it if you want to dive inbut not necessary if you're just uh ifyou're just using Phoenix and you'rejust getting started no worriesnonetheless I basically set up and Isaid said I want to send 300 000 SATsand all I need to do is scan in theaddress on my phone to my computer soI'm just going to open up the camera andscan it really quickokay perfect and that scans all theinformation always good to double checkthe first and last few digits of anaddress to make sure they look the sameit looks good to me and then I'm justgoing to adjust my my fee so that itcomes through relatively quickly and I'mgoing to create and send thistransaction so I'm just sending aregular Bitcoin transaction to my phoneand in a moment we should have it showup as a transaction on the main screenhereso when receiving an on-chainTransaction what you will see is yourbalance will not move initially but downbelow they'll have a little couple ofchain links and next to it it will say xamount is incoming so here it says 300000 sats are incoming and so what that'sgoing to wait for is basically anon-chain confirmation which typicallyhappens roughly every 10 minutes or soand so once that happens that balancewill be in a lightning Channelallocated to my balance and accessiblein this wallet so we'll come back assoon as this goes away and our balanceis officially updatedso I actually now got a received screenhere on my Phoenix wallet and if I backout we can see an updated balance hereso again because it was an on-chainBitcoin transaction it created a newchannel to me in order to swap fromon-chain Bitcoin to lightning andupdated my balance and with that camethe uh the 3000 sat fee to set up thechannel but other than that I'm now allfully set up so if you are withdrawingfrom an exchange or just sending overfrom a regular on-chain wallet that youalready have or somebody else alreadyhas it's entirely possible with Phoenixand now all these funds are accessiblevia the lightning Networknow we've already had plenty of examplesof sending just from the other phonethat I was utilizing but there's oneother way that you can actually sendhere within Phoenix wallet as well if Ihit the send screen of course it bringsup the QR code scanner that you can useyou can of course paste from clipboardif you have a lightning invoice but youcan also do manual input and manualinput again allows you to paste in aBitcoin address if you prefer but italso allows you to utilize lightningaddresses so a lightning address issomething that looks like a a regularemail address so here's an example thisis my geyser fund page so where peoplecan leave lightning tips for me andthere obviously there's QRS that you canscan and everything but I also have alightning address and so that lightningaddress is BTC sessions at geyser dotfund so I can actually type that in hereBTC sessions so BTC sessions atgeyser.fund if I hit OKit bumps me to the payment page and Ican put in whatever amount I like so 100SATs but I can hit payif I want to add a comment uh uh I'lljust put test I'll hit OK and it shouldsend off no problemand there we go it now says sentand I can see on my geyser fund page itjust popped up here 100 SATs went tothis page so basically an email addressis all that needs to be typed in not anactual email address it has to be alightning address but you can getlightning addresses from geyser or fromAlby or wallet of Satoshi orvoltage there's a lot of different orblink there's there's a whole bunch ofdifferent wallets that allow you toutilize lightning addresses Phoenix doesnot have it implemented because there issome networking stuff that has to gowith that it has to be hosted somewherein order to point towards your lightningwallet but nonetheless you can send tolightning addresses from Phoenix quiteeasilyand just a side note if you are curiousabout lighting addresses you can go tolightningaddress.com and it has a wholebunch of information about how to get alightning address as well as a list ofservices that offer easy setups to getyourself oneum and how to set it up in a variety ofdifferent wayslet's take a look at what the recoveryprocess looks like if you were to loseyour phone and needed to use your 12words well this is an entirely differentphone than I'm dealing with now I'vejust installed Phoenix wallet opening upfor the first time and we're going totreat it as if won't we need to getaccess to our funds once again I'm goingto hit nextI understand get started and then I'mgoing to hit I have a read and agreewith the terms of service and I'm goingto choose restore my walletI'm going to hit I understand and I'mgoing to hit next and I'm basicallygoing to type in all 12 words into thisbox here so my first word was fog so I'mjust going to type f o g and it beginsto auto fill possible words and I'mgoing to tap on them as they pop upthen I'm going toagain type in the next word gown g o wand it begins to fill and I can tap assoon as I see my word and I'm going togo all the way through until I have all12. once all 12 words are input I'm justgoing to hit the import button downbelowit says restoring my wallet and it'lltake a second to kind of load everythingupall right so I can now see that I havean updated balance everything isaccessible here andyeah I have full access to everything itdoes give me that warning again pleaseback up your wallet because it knowswell you just imported it so maybe youneed to make sure that you have a backupit would just take me to that samescreen where I display my seed I hit Ihave already done thatand there we go everything now itdoesn't have my previous transactionslisted as they were just specific to thephone I was using those records butother than that everything else is stillfully accessible I can still send andreceive payments no problem withinPhoenixall right so I am back on my main phonehere let's take a look atum a couple of the guts of the back endand and see what's actually going onunder the hood here with Phoenix walletso if I go down to the bottom left andhit the settings wheel uh down hereunder Advanced we can actually click onchannels list and this will actuallyshow us all of the lightning channelscurrently connected to this particularPhoenix wallet and so your Phoenixwallet is indeed running a lightningnode on your phone and every time youwant to receive a payment it bouncesthrough async who async is the uh thepeople behind Phoenix wallet bouncesthrough their node and they establish achannel to you from their node and soyou have now multiple depending on thesize and frequency of transactionsyou're actually receiving you may havemore than a single channel so wereceived 300 000 SATs and just kind ofuse that channel to and from and then Isent over an on-chain transaction alsofor 300 000 SATs and that established asecond Channel if I were to receive andactually you can kind of see here splitupthe balance and capacity of each channelso this channel the top one has abalance of 296 000 SATs but a capacityof 325 000 sets the bottom one has abalance of 291 000 and a capacity of 325000. so effectively what's happening iswhen I was opened my each time when Iopened a 300 000 sat channel fromreceiving paymentsuh async opened a channel that was abovethat threshold by about 25 000 SATs andthis will vary depending on the size ofthe channel being opened with you andthe size of the payment you're receivingnow in this instance if I were toreceive a payment that wasabove say 70 000 SATs that were wouldrequire a new channel being open to mebecause I only have X amount of inboundin each of these channels so I wouldthen experience again there would be afee to open that channel to me but thenthat capacity would be able to be usedand similarly if I'm just if I send outfrom this wallet let's say I send out afew hundred thousand SATs that means Ihave inbound capacity so I don't needadditional channels utilized uh in orderto receive the same amount back in againso nonetheless you can see all of yourchannel details here within the channelslist furthermore down below there's alsothe option to close all channels andwhat this will do it says hey youcurrently have two lightning channelsfor an aggregated balance of around 588000 SATs These funds can be sent to aBitcoin wallet just make sure that theaddress is correct before sending andyou can paste in a Bitcoin address fromany Bitcoin wallet that you may havemaybe it's Hardware maybe it's asoftware wallet whatever it is you pastein a Bitcoin address once that is pastedin this empty my wallet button willlight up and you'll be able to tap itand it will close the channels and sendthe funds over to you nowkind of a nuclear option if somethingfunky happens and you're having troubleand you need access to your funds youcan go into the danger zone here and itsays that you can force close yourchannels so force close allows you tounilaterally close your Channel'smeaning without the permission of thenodes that they're connected to sowithout the permission of async you'reclosing a channel forcefully now it saysthis is not a fix everything magicbutton it is here as a safety measureand should only be used in extremescenarios for example if your peer asyncdisappears permanently preventing youfrom spending your money in all othercases If you experience issues withPhoenix you should probably contactsupportforce closing channels will cost youmoney to cover the on-chain fee and willcause your funds to be locked for daysdo not uninstall the app until yourchannels are fully closed or you willlose money do not use this feature ifyou don't fully understand what it doesand basically what happens is if I wereto hit force close all channels both ofthose two channels would be closedforcefully withoutbalancing that information off of asyncwhen that happensit ends upum effectively closing those channelsthere'll be a lockup period of of asthey said could be around five days ormore but then the money will be sent tothis Bitcoin address and that Bitcoinaddress is actually governed by my 12seed words that we wrote down when weset up the wallet I can then take those12 seed words and I can import them toany existing on-chain Bitcoin walletthat I may have so I could go to Sparrowwallet that I used on my desktop and Icould import I could import those 12words and have access to those funds Iwould just need to make sure that I usea native segwit derivation path so thatI'm looking at the correct addresses itstarts with bc1 there so just keep thatin mind but you're probably not evergoing to use this feature except for inextreme circumstances so just know thatit's there and if anything happens youcan force close and then use your 12words in a regular Bitcoin wallet andrecover everything on chainthe last thing I want to touch on hereis privacywhat is visible in regards to yourselfand your payments when utilizing Phoenixout of the boxwhile Phoenix in the back end theyutilize something called trampolinenodes so your phone itself is indeedrunning a lightning node and you cansend and receive payments and at anytime you can close those channels andand have full on chain access toeverything and everything is isnon-custodial you own your funds howeverthe routing of payments is done throughthe trampoline node you connect to orasync so asyncum in this mechanism they areeffectively taking the heavy lifting offiguring out the quickest and easiestway to route your payment to itsrecipient and that makes things veryquick and easy to transact and and it'sfantastic however the Privacy trade-offthey're in is one if you're usingPhoenix out of the box without changingthe settings then there will be an IPaddress associated with you the senderfurthermore Phoenix then does the heavylifting of routing the payment andfiguring out the quickest and cheapestway to get it to its recipient so itknows the destination node of therecipient and that might be anindividual running a note or it might bea service running a node for multiplerecipients which kind of obfuscates uhwho is getting whatnonetheless there are some privacytrade-offs there now if you would liketo obfuscate yourself as the sender youcan go into the settings wheel inPhoenix and under the tour section youtap on that and toggle on tour and thatwill hide your IP addressdo note that tour connections are slowerso you're going to notice a deprecationin the speed of the transactions andthey can be unreliable at times so youmight be waiting a little bit from timeto time you might need to restart to geta new Tor connection so keep that inmindyou make your decision based on the thetrade-offs that you see another thingthat you can do regarding on chainum and so this would relate to uh thevisible channels and everything likethatum just querying kind of any anyon-chain stuff that you have to do withPhoenixum you can actually go in and set yourown electrum server so if you're runningsay like a a start nine server or youknow whatever other node inflammationimplementation that you are runningum you can go in if you're runningelectrum and copy that information andpaste it into uh paste it into Phoenixas well and that will query that nodeinstead of asyncs or whatever defaultone they are utilizing so those are kindof your options thereum you know if you're worried about itturn on tour if you really want to gocopy or node information and paste it inthere those options are there for youbut just know that Phoenix or async inthis case knows the destination that youare trying to route toum if you're not super keen on that thenof course you need to be running yourown infrastructure so keep that in mindsome people won't mind but when in doubtturn on touroverall I think that Phoenix is a greatoption to onboard people to bitcoin andlightningum dare I say it is at the time ofrecording this video going to be mydefault go to onboarding mechanism forpeople that want to dive into Bitcoin itgets them directly into self-custody itobfuscates most complicated bits to thebackground and everything else is moreor less automatic you don't need to doany thinking and it gets them to back uptheir own seed and in that case they'regoing to be able to recover as wellI kind of don't think it can be beatthere there are other options out therebutum the trade-offs that I've seen fromoptions I I think I'm going to defaultto this one from now on but I'd love tohear from you guys what you think aboutPhoenix the way that it functions and umyou know what what is your default uhrecommended lightning wallet that you'resending people to do you think Phoenixis up to Snuff are
