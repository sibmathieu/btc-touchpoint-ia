onzoomsuh with other people so it's my first inperson and it's my first solo podcastand you've been in bitcoin since whenuh 2012 2012 17 12. 11 12. 10 years in adecade yes was that too far away yeah weweren't worried in a decade you've donethree and you've got to sit back thefunny thing is because i pestered you alittle bit about this becausea handful of people recently have saidi've got to get you onei appreciate listen yeah i don't iwouldn't call pestering i wanted to comeon but people are likedon't you gotta get darren he's got he'sgot got stories mannormally when we uh uh danny might chipin occasionally as well uh normally whenwe do a podcast we i have a sheet ofnotes all the things they're going totalk aboutand when danny was like how are we goingto prep for this last time this is wedon't need to prepthis isn't one where we sit and we gotell us about your businesslikethis is one where we have no prep we'rejust gonnaget you to unload stories on us i loveit i love my because now we're part of apublicly traded company we have acompliance department and before i dosomething like this which i haven't donemany of we have to get approval so theysaid we need to see the talking pointsand and i said i haven't been providedand so like even today as i was cominghere they were like are you going toprovide us any of thetopics that you're going to be on i saidapparently we're not going tothey're going to have to listen to itbefore it goes out no no we'll be okaywe'll be good all right okayso we'll just stay away from non-publicinformation non-public information okaywell like so i think we should we shouldjust go back to 2011 because most peoplenow in bitcoin they weren't around 2011.i'm uhfirst heard about 2012 bought a littlebit 2012-13 just to use this uh websiteyeah great great story i appreciate it iread about a wired uh but then i didn'tspend any time looking at bitcoin ididn't yeah i purely did a fewtransactions on local bitcoins and sendthem to this website properly got inaround 17 start 17 and that's me andmost people i know there's a class of 1713 there's a class of 17.there's a class now of the last coupleyears but there's very few class of 201112.uh soit's quite interesting to go back withyou tell us your introhow you got inyeah absolutely soso just a little bit of of backgroundbefore that is i was an accountant i wasat at afirm called kenneth leventhal which wasconsumed later on by ernst youngi lasteda very short while as an accountant butthat's my background and i look ateverything as as a finance basedtransaction in terms of what's going onon the numbers so i was an accountantand then i was a lawyer i went to lawschool i became a lawyer i was in-housecouncil investment banking company andwe did a lot of deals mostly distressedso i i was in these distressed marketsand the companies that i thengot involved with when i started my ownboutique investment banking firmi don't know 20 plus years ago we wouldget involved in companies that weredistressed they had litigationreceivership foreclosures some kind ofproblems within the corporation thenwe'd get involved in these messysituations and clean them upuh i ended upwith different assets and a variety ofdifferent businesses uh some deals weregood some deals were bad we you kind ofjust go through that it's a numbers gameyou know sometimes sometimes you'reinvesting in things that are wild andwork out and sometimes you're investingin things that are wild and they don'twork out uh it becomes a binarystatisticinaround 2011 i had a large entertainmentcompany in las vegas where we produceshows i bought that out of a bankruptcyso that was one of the businesses thatmy company ranand that companycontrolled theaters box office andproduction at casinos in las vegassome of the shows that we were doingthat i've done historically over theyears we put up money for instance withcaesars for j.lo and lionel richie inthe backstreet boys we put up money withuh mgm for lady gaga on aerosmith i'vebeen to the lionel show okay iappreciate it thank youyeah i was a financial producer thatwhat a great show he's such a he's anamazing recording artist he does a storythe whole time so so people really getinto it uh and then we do smaller showsso i own some tribute shows in las vegasuh that i've had for over a decade alsothere's a michael jackson tribute showthat i own uh right now to the tropicanaand at the tropicana we do all theticketing box office and production forthe casino uh all the shows we're eitherin or they're my tenant like the laughfactory in in las vegas at the tropicanathey pay us rent and use my ticketingand platform in 2011there were message boards that popped upacross the world that that were uhturn this overtheir message boards popped up that toldpeople how to get out of charges if theywere on their credit card to see showsso we saw the the number of chargebackson the show side skyrocket and so istarted looking into alternative paymentmethods in 11andone of the one of thetechnologies we looked at was bitcoinandi think my reaction in 2011 as anaccountant and as a lawyermirrorsthe reaction of most people that havefinanced or legal backgrounds orrepresentatives for very variety ofgovernments across the world when yougoogled it in 2011 the first thing yousaw was that people used it to buy drugson the internet and the second thing yousawreally made it sound like digital videogame money to me and soinitially my initial reaction was thissounds silly and i should probably stayaway from this i have privilegedlicenses i have uh gaming licenses andliquor licenses and banking licenses andthe variety of businesses that i had andit's it wasn't worthwhile to put that atriskover the next few months because i wascognizant of this new technology i sawan article that piqued my interest whichis the genesis for why i'm i'm here inthis industry and made this industry uhall i do all i work onand the genesis of that was an articlethat said thatthis new technology is an immutableledgerand so that really doesn't mean a lot tomost people but that's the mostimportant thingalmost in humanity for record keepingand as an accountant i geek out on theuh getting to the granular level of ofthe accountinguhfinancial records that were provided allthe time especially as my investmentbanking company most everything we seeis [ __ ] they give usthey give us numbers that that don'tcorrelate toto reality and so an immutable ledgerjust it soundeduhsomething made up but i i startedresearching it and what i realizedwas that it was immutableand it was immutable for us a variety ofreasonsthatthati spent months digesting and sowhat i realized wasand i'm gonna give you a little i'mgonna give you a little bit of myaccounting talk because i do do anaccounting talk to small groups i'veonly done it you know three or fourtimes and sniffed you know smalluh in small increments to to othergroups but what i what i realized wasthatthe history of accounting okay andaccounting runs the world you don't knowwhat you own without a ledger you don'tknow where you are you don't knowanything that your government's doingany business that you're associated whatyou have in the bank you need a ledgerto tell you that so ledgers run theworld and the history of accountingwhich are these ledgersis really really simple the history ofaccounting has two innovations beforebitcoin10 000 years ago the first innovationhappened humans in mesopotamia or somecountry you know way back across theworldthey went to a market and they boughtfive sheep so they bought five sheep atthis market they took a clay tablet theywrote down i have five sheep they bakedit in the sun so other humans couldn'tchange the books and recordsand that was it that's the birth ofsingle entry accounting and over aperiod of time you could look at thatledger and you could know how many sheepyou have in six months and 12 months and18 months and so you always know howmany sheep you havethat was accounted until the 1400sin the 1400s they invented double entryaccounting i bought five sheep i paidfive dollars okaythatthat transaction okay the the bot fivesheet paid five dollars is a debit and acredit and when you add that upyou get every single financial statementevery balance sheet every revenuestatement you see on the planet earthtodayevery single bank every government everycorporation they all use this antiquatedsystem from the 1400s called doubleentry accounting which is an analogsystem it's terrible it's terriblebecause the people that control thebooks and recordsthey can change the books and recordsthey're not immutable and so whathappens when people that control themoney can change their own books andrecords well we see what happens youhave devastating fraud for700 years in every industry and everygovernment and every corporation on theplanet earth and it's really difficultto unwind or even realize the fraudsgoing onbecause the books and records areprivate they're privately held and so inorder to figure out that there's a fraudgoing on on these private records youneed other humansto conducta physical human auditof other human records that are not keptwell but we know those people arecorruptable yes right so right there yougo down the line if there's a humanelement involved you have a trust factorrisk right and so and that's why you'veseen large accounting firms imploderight during the enronevent the accounting firm that wasrunning enron approved all of theirbooks and records and thenand then later on after billions ofdollars went missing the accounting firmimploded you saw the same thing withbernie madoff he had financials thatwere audited every year for decades uhyou end up with human trust elements inan analog system right so you haveaccounting that was created in the 1400srunning the world running everythingand the question is if it's such a badsystemhow come it was never innovated rightwhy why did nobody ever innovate thisdouble entry accounting system well it'sreally easy no one's incentivizedto fix it because a government gets tocontrol all their books and records theyget the money from the public and theydon't have to disclose what they spendany money on because the books andrecords for your government well they'reheld privately and you don't get to seethem same thing with corporations samething with institutions and individualsit's all private and sonobody's been incentivized to changethat at all and so we've seen that lastuntil today until 2009 really when thebitcoin network was was createdand what the bitcoin network did was ittook this antiquated double entry systemyou have debits and creditsand they came up with this geniusmethodology which became the consensusmechanism for approving the transactionsbetween two partiesi'm not gonna go too deep into thebyzantine general problem but i knowthat you know what that is and and i ibreak it down like thisin the history of humanity foreverthere's no wayassume me and you don't know each otherand we don't trust each otherand we're over geographic space there'sno way for peter and darren to conduct atransactionwithout a third party and what thatmeans isif you're in asia and i'm in europe andwe make a deal for you to send me somevalue okayyou send me the value but i didn't getiti don't believe that you sent it right idon't know you you told me you sent it ididn't get it i think you're a bad actori think you're not telling me the truthand you didn't send itand now if i say i didn't receive it andyou sent it you don't believe that ididn't receive it you think i got it andnow i'm saying i didn't get it right soover time and space over geographicspace and over timetwo parties cannot conduct a transactionit's impossible and so what happenedbecause we know transactions have beenoccurring for tens of thousands of yearshow did people do transactions wella third-party confirmation system poppedup so me and peter doing a transaction athird-party confirmation system pops upto verify the transaction you send yourvalue to this third party i send myvalue to the third party they say yep weconfirm peter sent his value darren senthis value transaction culminated okaythat's how all transactions have to bepartaken over the lastthousands of years up until 2009 therewas no way to conduct a peer-to-peertransaction over geographic space orover the internet you still need a thirdparty verification system to approve thetransaction with two food parties wellthousands of years ago this third partyconfirmation system what did that turnintoa bank a bank so the very firstuhbusiness line of banks were confirmationof transactions between two parties andthey took a feeright and so now you have this thirdparty verification system it conductsthe approvals of the transaction andtakes a fee well what's the next thingthat a bank does it custodians money soif i sent a million dollars to thecustodian to this verification systemyou don't want them to send that to yourhouse so you say you custodian thatmoney and that's what banks do theyconfirmparties between two trans between twoparties transactions they verify thetransactions and then they custodianshipmoney so they custodian your moneyeverything else that a bank doesin the world today islegislatively fabricated they just comeup with other business lines thatthey're able to do and so the banks nowhave your million dollars well inamerica they can borrow from the fed andthen lend that money out to createanother product line within what intheir purview and you know in their toolshed of products in the bank and so nowthis bank's lending out all this moneyfrom the depositsthatbusinessof lending money out is now the majorityof money that banks made and it's allpredicated on two thingsbanks having your money in there tocustodian and the other one isconfirming a transaction between twoparties and so we've never had thisability to conduct a peer-to-peertransaction ever because the ledgersystem didn't work didn't work it wasanalog so you had to physically do itand you didn't trust the partiesinvolved and so what the bitcoin networkdid was you took two parties partyingparty b conducting a transaction overgeographic time and space digitally andthe consensus mechanism is theinnovation of bitcoin and this thisentire innovation talkgets lost sometimes because this is socomplicated you really have tounderstand accounting and ledgers in thehistory of transactions between twoparties and what's happened globallywell i've had people explain to me thatbitcoin is triple entryuh recordkeeping you mentioned it to mewhen we hung out a couple of months agoa few months back and i was like youknow what i still actually don't knowwhat did you know what if you heard itor did you know what it means onlybecause i've got a friend who's anaccountant she's explained it to me yeahbut i've never actually had it explainedto me in that way and now i'm like huhokay that's great i mean i get it nowand alsowhat you've done in that you'veidentified all the risksaroundthe double entry accounting system witha third party yeah so right so becauseyou have this digital node server systemthat confirms every transaction to itsinceptionand this is the most important part itself audits every transaction to theinception of the bitcoinand then after it's self-audited itwrites it to the triple entry to thisthird entry the word blockchain isreally a stupid word it's a silly wordstechnical jargon for an accountingledger it's just an accounting ledgerblockchain is a digital accountingledger and digital accounting ledgershave existed forever because if you haveit if you have a computer and you'rekeeping records that's a blockchainwhat's the innovation here is notblockchain it's not this true it's notan accounting ledger the innovation hereis the methodology to auditthe transaction to its inception theaudit factor is what changes this younow have no human risk between twoparties and you can't rescind thetransaction so you have this immutabletransaction that can never be undone andonce it's audited it gets written to theblockchain to the to the bitcoinblockchain and sothis new technologyeliminatesand this is why there's so much upheavalglobally it eliminates all the legacysystems that have been put in place forthousands of years to confirm a partytrent a two-party transaction rightfor thousands of yearslegacy banking systems have allpredicated on the fact that we can't dobusiness with each other because there'sa trust risk this network eliminatesthat and soon an accounting sideuh you have the most importantaccounting innovation in human historyright it's the first time you've everhad an immutable ledger it's the firsttime you have a self-audited system andsowhen i looked at this and i went downthe rabbit hole obviously very deep in2011 and then bled into 12 a little biti was shockedat the value of this network and ithought and i was wrong i thought thatand i realized the bitcoin networkcapital b the bitcoin network is is theaccounting innovation what i justexplained it says consensus mechanism uhfully audited every 10-minutetransaction written to a blockchain thisparty aid a party b transaction uhthrough this new accounting innovationthat is the bitcoin networkbitcoin lowercase bis different bitcoin lowercase b is thedigital asset that lives on those railsand bitcoin the digital asset whichtrades as a commodityis the best monetary technology on theplanet earthonly because it lives on the bestaccounting technology that's ever beencreated and so you can't reallyunderstand what bitcoin is withoutunderstanding the rails that it runs onand the rails that it runs on are the isthe most important accounting innovationthat changeshumanity how they conduct businessforever and i thought wrongly thatthis accounting technology would takeoff i said everybody's going to demandthat the companies they invest in andthe governments that run their moneyutilize something to this effect thatcan has to be immutable i didn't eventhink you could it was possible to dothat and so on accounting leveluh i was i was massively intrigued irealized also and i hate the word minorthe miners i you know i realized and andi don't know who picked this word theminers just computer servers that arethe accountants of the network so theminers are the accountants that make themoneygetting in the middle of thesetransactions between two parties and sobecause i was so intrigued by this isaid you know as a hobbyi'm gonna partake in this network i wantto help protect this network and be apart of theof the confirmation of transactions andso i starteduh in 2012uh maybe closer to the end of 2012 ithink it took a year trying to reallygrasp this and one other thing before istarted i think when you getdeep enough into it you realize it'sreal this technology is real it'simportant it's an innovation for theworld and it changesit changes the world so you know it hasvalue and so everybody in 2012 that itold i wasabout to participate in this networkthey instantly thought that i wasparticipating in the drug trade or somekind of illicit activity and i'm like nothis is just an accounting innovationand so i spentyearstalking to people thati was in different business deals aboutbitcoin listening to all of thequestions that they would ask me and soi've had almost every question you couldpossibly have from very smart verysophisticated financial people andand i've just beenuhunwillingly practicing uh advocating forthis system for a decade now andin 2012 13 now probablyi started mining uh back then i think wewere uh gpus first generation a6 ibought everything you could buy most ofit didn't work some of it didn't show upwe had every problem you can probablyimagine that we would have that earlyandi did it as a hobby until about 2015and in 2016 i i looked at the way theworld was goingand i decided that i wanted to only dothis i only wanted to buildinfrastructure and andreally defend and and tried to build theinfrastructure network in americaand at that time i probably hadby myself equipment in four or fivedifferent locationsand i had massive problems the equipmentwould disappear they wouldn't work itwould go on it would go off the peoplerunning it you know would be veryinefficient with how they kept theequipment onand i realizedthat there was nocommercial enterprise grade levelfacilities in americato host blockchain equipmentand so i looked around the world and in2016 maybe early 17i started a new company i stopped theother ones uh and that company lookedfora location in america where i couldbuild outon an enterprise grade level in a in auhin a high volumeuha commercial settinguh an infrastructure project that wouldbesomewhat to the extent of what the datacenter business is now to servers so wei tried tobuild a betterinfrastructure facility better mount ihate saying better mousetrap but i hadto stop myself but there you goi wanted to build a betterinfrastructure facility and soi looked at hundreds of sitesand eventually we settled on a locationin north carolinaso at the time i was living in las vegasi found a location north carolina in theappalachian mountains in a small towncalled marblemarble north carolina the reason ipickedthe appalachian mountains in this smalltown the united states government in the40s they built critical infrastructureto power the manhattan project so themanhattan project was up there in the inthe appalachian mountains needed amassive amount of energy so they dammedup the appalachian mountains and theycreated a massive amount ofhydroelectric power right 100 renewableuhvery plentiful hydroelectric power up inthe appalachian mountains after theafter that manhattan project uh was overin the 50s and 60s america manufacturingindustries moved up into those mountainsbecause there's a massive amount ofrenewable energy that's stranded rightit you can only transport renewableenergy a certain number of miles beforeit degrades or dissipates into nothingand sothese manufacturing facilities populatedthe area including levi strauss americanthreadand one of the buildings i looked at wasuh an american thread facility i believethat provideduhthe thestitching to levi strauss and it was a230 000 square foot building on 70 acresin marble north carolinaduring the time of the heyday of themanufacturing up in the appalachianmountains there were probably 50 100 200000 peopleliving in thosein that region that were working atthese manufacturing facilitiesin 2000the united states enacted naftanorth america free trade agreement whichencouraged manufacturing facilities inamerica unfortunately to close down andmoved to mexico and so allof the surrounding factories includingthe one that i eventually purchased wereshutteredand the towns dwindled to nothing andyou saw legislation during the obamaadministration that labeled themopportunity zones to encouragedevelopment of theseblighted communities that that were uhgutted during nafta and when i got tomarvel north carolina whichwas this hotbed of manufacturinguh facility it had a population of 500people so there were 500 people livingthere when i got there and so i foundthis amazing facility in avery remote location with very littlepopulationand i said this is this is where we'regonna go and we talked to the powercompany obviously we had two substationson site we had duke and tva so we had uhplentiful power and we're in the middleof these hydroelectric plants that couldonly send their power so far so it wasit was an excellent uh spot for us andso the next step for me was to meet withthe mayor of this small town to tell himwhat i was going to do to make sure thatthey wanted us there because i didn't wehad i hadhosting facilities in upstate washingtonbefore this and the town turned on thoseuhdevelopments the mining developments inupstate washington and the people thatwe had sent our equipment to failed uhwe had to pull our equipment out ofthere so i already had known that weneeded to make sure it was a friendlyjurisdiction that wanted us in there whydid they turn on itin washington stateit was really early i think a lot of thepeople that were popping up doinguh that were involved in thisuh community early onwere not well funded or had otherproblems and so i think what happened inwashington state was that people madepromisesto the electrical gridproviders that they would be utilizing xamount of power and theninfrastructure had to be built towardsthose buildings and then as theydidn't fulfill their promises i thinkthey realized that this is a dangerousindustry for us to be spending taxpayermoney on and so that that was reallyprobably one of several items thathappened but i think a lot of the earlyprojects failed i think they failed theyalso failed not just because enoughmoney or from the people running it thetechnology was new and so putting thesebuildings together to dissipate the heatwas difficult you needed to have uhsophisticated air you know you had tounderstand thermodynamics this thisair-cooleduh you need to air cool these rooms andthat mathto air cool these rooms did not existbecause the footprint for the asicequipment the heat that goes in so ittakes electricity and then and then hotair comes out so you have to dissipatethat hot air you can eitherchill it in the room or you have to getit out of the building if you don'tit could all burn down right and so thethermodynamics on this airflowdissipationdid not exist for this equipment and soa lot of people hiredengineers that were good at airflowdynamics from mit that had phds uh thatworked at nasa and googleand then when you put them inside of abitcoin mining facility with alldifferent equipment with differentshapesuh what i found happened wasevery time i would talk to theseengineers they would say no when i bringthem to my building for instance inmarvel north carolina i said i need tobuild this out uh the first three ofthemthat i interviewed said the same thingthey said we can't do anything thisfacilitythis needs to look more like a googlebox because that's what we learned atmit how to dissipate air in a google boxand sowhatwe learned really quickly was you neededto find engineers that that could dothison their own they could be more creativeso anyway so i'm jumping forward i endedup uh going to meet with the mayor inmarvel north carolina to see if he wasfriendlyuh to our industry and that he wouldwant us to be there and create jobs andand and bring uhmore you know people up there uh when imet with the mayoruhit was it was a it was a comicalsituation because we met at thesteakhouse up there in population 400 sothere's there's not a there's noteverybody knew i was up there and i satdown with the mayor and i saidi'm going to open a bitcoin miningfacility up here and and he looked at meand he saidhow do you know that bitcoin are here inthe groundhow did you realize that they were up inmarvel north carolina and souh and i think by the way that's not athat's not auh outrageousum response when you talk about miningand and so i think we we run into thatproblem all the time because mining isjust a really silly word and and whoeverpicked thatuh should not be a marketing personwhat would you call ityou know we back it we've gone back andforth between mining minting producingit's such a hot topic because people areso passionate about it yeah i think theword mining was on a bitcoin forum in2010 and like mining and minting andthey just that just stuckuhi don't i you know i i think so far i'mpartial of producing but i don't know imean i'm not i'm not the marketing guy ijust know thatuh the word mining isis a it has a bad connotation it soundsdirty it uh it doesn't designate thatthese are just computer servers in abuilding which is a data center and sopeople are like oh you're mining it'slike no i have a computer server that'splugged into the electrical grid thatthat is an accountant of this newnetwork yeah that's all we areand so itit doesfeed into the narrative thatuh and and i talk about that for hoursuh the energy narrative which we dealwith all the time but of coursebut so nowthethe mayor tells us that he's happy withus coming up here they're they'relooking to attract business and anythinghe could do to help us get open greatand i sat down with thelocaluhthe local people that were involved intva and and the duke substations that uhfortunately were on site for us andin 2017 i i rented a cabin and i havekids and and and my wife and we moved toto the appalachian mountains i moved upinto the mountains there and i hired andstaffed this place outum we we had obviously some staffturnoverand i had to learn all of thismy on my own right so i'm i'm i'mrunning this company and i'm i have tolearn thermodynamics so we have thesethis classroom that was in the in themanufacturing facility then we would dowe would bring up engineers and we'd gothrough the thermodynamics and and howit works in inside these facilities andwe had to really come up with our ownway to do it theinitial people that we would hire uh ifthey were working for a third party sothere's third party engineeringcompanies that you can hire third-partyconstruction companies that you can hirewhat we realized is if we hired anythird parties it was a disaster so wehad to bring all these people in-houseand so we needed construction peoplein-house we needed the electrical peoplein-house we needed the engineersin-house and so i found myselfpopulatingthis small-town marble north with nohotelsthere was one hotel like 10 miles awayand so we had to rent keep renting thesecabins and it was it was i had peopleliving and you know people that wereemployees andin you know in the basement of my playwas it was wildand uh and and we did it we built outthe first enterprise grade levelinfrastructure facility uh we werebefore the that run up bitcoin was atlike four or three or four hundreddollars uh it shot up to a thousandand uhin i think late 16 early 17 and then itit went to three or four thousanddollars and and it was it was wildwatching everybody jump into thisindustryand at the end of 17 when it hit youknow went up to ten thousand and youknow eighteen thousand or whatever ithiteverybodyshowed up and said you know we're gonnabuilda competitor to you we're gonna build aan infrastructure facility like whatcore is buildingand souh as these new companies startedsprouting up all across the u.s i iwould get their decks and we would seethe names of the engineers that didn'twork out for usat these other companies and and we'd belike ah that's too badwe know it's not gonna workum and so in 17 wewe uh started that we hit the cryptowinter right in 18 and 19. uh the onething thatwe pride ourselves on is that we neverstopped building uhthe chairman of my company uh of ourcompany really uh my co-founder mikelevitt who was the chairman in 2017 uhwhen i started the company and moved upthere he was the ceo of a publiclytraded company at the time and was veryhelpful on the capital market sideraising uh forin a different style and fashion that idid and really was ingratiated into thisbusiness overover you know the last five years and uhin 2018 and 19 we even though it wascrypto winter we just kept building wewe expanded fromnorth carolina to georgiawhere we have facilities currently we'realso we we're also in kentucky we have aameristeel plant that that was shutteredthere that we have mining activity atwe're in north dakotauh we're in texasand i think we didn't announce it but ithink the people in oklahoma announcedit so it's public uh we're also inoklahoma so i think we've announced sixstates uh that we operate in currentlyum and uhwe'rewe're just you know keep going so that'sthat's kind ofthis genesis story of where we are uhjust just to clarifymy roleuh you know obviously co-founder of thiscompany with mike levitt and uh and andvery big advocate of the company in thespace uh i am no longer involved inoperations uh my my job titleis uh chief vision officer and if youcan tell me what that means i'dappreciate it uh but uh i go aroundreally and i try toadvocate and educate the people thatdon't really understand what thisinnovation is or why it's important orwhy it's different than proof of stakeor what's what's the big deal why can'twe just do some some other way and ithink people really don't understandthat if you get rid of the innovationwhich is the proof-of-work consensusaccounting technology you get rid of theentire innovation right so you go backto the old way where the people thatcontrol the books and records if youhave all the coins if you control thenetwork you can change the network andso that the innovation is thisnew server system which has thisdistributed consensus mechanism andreally the self-audit ability of thenetwork and itself audits every 10minutes so that's that's kind of myaccountinguhyou know uh probably a good chunk of itbut that's that's really what it was sowe're we're all really involved in thisindustryand you know you speak all the time onit you guys do an amazing job but at theend of the day what we're protecting andwhat we're developing and what we'reencouraging is our people to attachthemselvesto a new method to conduct all civilizedactivity which is a new immutableaccounting ledger which changeseverything in the entire world yeahright a lot to unpack there umyou're right i speak to a lot of peoplei have a lot of conversations whetherit's on the podcast or on twitteralmost never do people come from thepoint of tripleuhuh accounted triple bookkeeping theredid you call it triple trip it's tripleentry account yeah so you have singleentry double entry and triple entry theonly other time i've heard someonereally talk about this is uh i had acoffee with john pfeffer in londonand i was like he told me his genesis hesaid uhi met at uh winters and said wences saidto memoney is a ledger and the bitcoin ledgeris the best ledger that's ever existeda lot of people come to bitcoin forfreedom or they come to bitcoinuh because they likethey'll think the tech is cool the theability to send money instantly aroundthe world without any third partyumbut we were with jeff booth recently andhe was spending a lot of time talkingabout misinformation and money and whatthe impact of misinformation on money isand i think he's saying the same thingas you is that this gets rid of themisinformation of money but not manypeople come from this angle and talkabout this end quote we don't reallyhear it no i think it was i used to heara bit more but it seems to have droppedoff that a little bit it's not in someways it's not the sexiest way ofexplaining bitcoinand also whilst it's a great innovationand it's greatuhit's a great way of improving accountingremoving this misinformation of money itis a threatto many people is why the banks hate itwhy maybe governments are against itbut this innovation is a threat well theinnovationis a threat to bad people yeah if youwant to hide your books and recordsforever and conduct businessin secrecy then you don't like thisnetwork ifyou are prodisclosure right and pro information inprouhanti-misinformation because any of uscould look at the ledger of bitcoin 24hours a day and see what took place wecan't do that with any other system andknow that it's 100 accurate and so ithink you bring up a good point aboutwhy people get into it it's like a uhit would be like a big heavy car so likea hummer or something that's what thisis and you might like the hummer and youmight like to drive around in the hummerbut you don't know how the engine worksand so what i kind of explained is howthis engine works and why the hummer isa better carthan than whatever the predecessor carwas inside the engine now once you're inonce you're in this carit does do a lot of amazing things and ithink you bring up the most importantone which is it provides freedomand the way and the only reason that itprovides freedomis because of the consensus distributedmechanism that is the self-auditingaccounting technology which is theinnovation and it provides freedombecause of thisbecause you have hundreds of thousandsor more nodes located distributed aroundthe globe so if you picture the globeright and that triple entry accountingand you get the you kind of have atriangle of accounting and then you havethe globe around the globe are nodes andservers right those are the minors andthe nodesthose keep a complete record of everytransaction that's ever taken place onthe bitcoin network right so you haveevery single transaction in the notesand the notes talk to each other andwhen a transaction comes through theyaudit it to its inception if it's a badtransaction it's it's discarded by thesystem in order to hack this systemyou have to hack all the nodessimultaneously so what they've createdwas the first unhackable network inhuman history right so we have the firstimmutable network in human history for aledger technology but we also have thefirst unhackable decentralized networkin human history and what that meansthat it's unhackable is nobody can hackit the hackers can't hack it and thegovernment can't hack it and so if youhave a bitcoin on your wallet nobody cantake it from younobody can take it from you what doesthat mean wellin america not much right in parts ofeurope too we have private propertyprotection sort of until they don't likeyour viewpoint and then they seize yourstuff now which hopefully goes away butgenerally in the history ofof america uh they protect your privateproperty we have private property rightsthat are pretty ingrained in ourinstitutions ina judicial branch thethe rest of the world and i love thatalex gladstein stat is 87 of thepopulation on the planet earth they livein autocratic or authoritarian regimesis it 87 87 and double or triple digitinflation it's like a combination ofthose four things so they go to sleep atnight worry did you hear a difference ithought it was like i i haven't heardthe number but i thought it's like halfthe world live under authoritarianismsookay plus double or triple digitinvestment so one of the two it's allyeah it's not yeah any of those so it'sit's authoritarian or dictators doubleor triple digit inflation and so if youat and and i'm assuming uh gladsteinand i'm reciting it right because maybei have it off but let's let's say it'sright 87 percent of the population livesin autocratic or authoritarian regimeswith double or triple digit inflation orhalf the population live inauthoritarian regimes right those peoplehave no private property rights thegovernment can seize and confiscateeverything from those people at any timethey want because they have noprotection under whatever constitutionthey're living undersofive four billion to seven billionpeople on the planet earth have noprivate property rightsif they download a digital walletand they have a bitcoin or any number ofsatoshi's on their budget on theirdigital walletthey havedespite what the government wants orwhatever the decrees are they haveprivate property because nobody couldtake it from them sothe bitcoin networkprovides private property rights to alleight billion humans on the planet earthas a network that's insanenothing else has ever done that beforeso now you have private property rightsand so you see this freedomuh and whymy foundations like the oslo foundationand alex classing and other really goodpeople are out there uh trying toeducate people that you could haveprivate property the other big problemand and this stat is about half theworld most half the world you know maybeslightly over uh they're unbanked theyhave no banking they're outside oftraditional financial uh they're theydon't qualify to be banked uh in americawe consider ourselves pretty financiallyfortunate i think the number isalmost 10 bill 10 million people areunbanked and something like 50 to 60million people they call it underbankedso they're under serviced on the bankingsector so you have thisfour billion plus person problem ofbanking wellif you have a bitcoinand you have a digital asset that isunconfiscatable sitting in your walletuh you can store value what else does abank do bank does store or value remitof payments payment processing so if youhave a bitcoin you can store valuei can payment process i can send thebitcoin somewhere else and i can remitmoney somewhere else so this newnetwork that was just createdsolves an accounting technology problemthat's existed for 700 years it solvesthe ledger problem it solvesprivate property problem and it alsosolves the banking problem now you canbank 8 billion people so you can provideprivate property to 8 billion people youcan provide banking to 8 billion peopleall because of the distributed networkconsensus level network that auditsevery transaction is and because it'sdistributed decentralized it can't behacked and so that's that's kind of thenext level once you understand theaccounting technology you understand theproof of work technology then you canstart layering on all the applicationsthat work on top of it and so you'll seepeople promotingall of thebenefits you get from this newaccounting technology which takes awayliterally all of the fraud there is nomore human fraudthere issome fraud by tricking people butthere's no direct hacking fraud yeahyou're not gonna have th well you don'thave to worry that the transactionrecords are fraudulent yes you stillalways have to well listenin humanity there will always beunfortunate human fraud but you don'tthat's not that's not a risk within thenetwork yeah within the network thenumbers that you seeare the numbers that they arethat's unique there's no fraud in thatyou know that the final outcome ledgeris is immutable and unchangeable andthat's what it is if you take yourdigital asset and send it toyou know some country and some guy thatyou know sent you an email you're gonnahave a problem if you open an email upthat's asking for your personalinformation and they hack you you'llhave a problem there'sdangerous people out there uh but nowthey're outside of the direct books andrecords and ledgers of this of thissystem yeah thanks for clarifying and uhin 2008 we saw howsome of the bad people got away withessentially forms of fraud and nobodyfaced jailwell i don't know about nobody but oneone personyou can danny will look it up there onepersonwent to jail for that but what what'ssuper interesting about this is you'veyou've outlined all the differentbenefits and use casesbut it also makes you realize like howvery very early we still are with thisbecause it takes time foruh people to adopt the system fordifferent parts of what it benefits sowhere's the demand for triple entryaccounting there isn't a huge amount ofactual direct demand right now but youcan think of examplesuh exchanges there's been a push toprove that they havethe bitcoin they say they have you knowis ais is every bitcoin exchange solventnicard has done some work to try andhelp exchanges prove that by justexposing an address or addresses whichshow they have the bitcoin that isclaimed so that when we've had ascenario many scenarios where exchangeshave gone into administration orexchanges have gone bust whether it'squadriga whether it's mount gox assistby using the triple entry accounting youcanyou can seewhether it's el salvador where we havepreviously i think it was 70 unbankedmaybe moreeveryone within that country now with amobile phone and access to the internetcan now be banked they're even beinggiven a small amount of bitcoin sothey're being onboarded to the networkwhen we talk about censorship resistanceyou know we can look at whether it'swhat happened in belarus or nigeria oreven now in ukraine we have the abilityto be able to send money and nobody canstop so what we're seeing is thesepockets of all these use cases thatyou're talking abouti'm fully on board danny's fully onboard you're fully on board we've justgot a lot more people to kind of educateabout thisand this is why this in conversation issuper interesting becausei don't think i think too much of theconversation's gone towards freedomwhich i'm not saying is important butnot enough has gone into thiswhich is explaining to people why thistechnology is so important and why itworks i think we've started to leapfrogthatyeah this is step one i mean you have toyou have to understand this you have toand the regulators have to understandthis and washington has to understand itthat the innovationis the consensus network if you get ridof this proof-of-work consensus networkthe innovation's gone all of the stuffwe just talked about doesn't existanymoremaybe that suits them thoughwell the the established legacy peoplebut not the not the people that are upand coming in any of the environmentsand and right now in americauh 45 to 50 million people own bitcointhat's a lot of voters and so you'restarting to see and i'm starting to seein ground swells uh take placeespecially after this infrastructurebill uh people realize that they need tobe talking to their legislators andrepresentatives and i think the questioni've all i get asked a lot iswhy not just why not just get rid ofproof of work and do proof of stake whynot why do you need this energy use andso which they're voting on in europeright now the eu this eu thing is is atravesty really thethey they use so little energy towardsproof-of-work networks that it it's aninconsequential number in the u i thinkit's it's something a fraction butfractured percentage somewhere about ifyou look at all the energy that europegenerates and then you look at the proofof work networks within europe it'ssomething like point zero zero zero oneeight of the energy uhutilized in within the borders of thatcountry so it's if you turn it all offit means nothing china used the sameexcuse right china china said we'returning this network off because of thecarbon footprint uh the the actuality ischina uses somewhere in the lines of 25terawatt 25 000 terawatt hours a year ofcoal energy and they turned off let'ssay they haduh a hundred half of the bitcoin networkat the time it would be a hundredterawatt hours of energy so they'reburning twenty five thousand terawatthours of coal and and they turned off ahundredit's an inconsequential number and sothey didn't just turn it off they movedit to another part of the worldwell they forced the people that werethe early adopters that built thesefacilities out there to relocate andthe overall effect china is a majorauthoritarian you know powerhouse in theworld uh couldn't affect the networkright if they could have hacked it theywould have if they could have turned theentire network off they would havethey're not a fan of people havingprivate property or banking outside ofuh their ability to disrupt it and sowhen they passedban they passed bitcoin bans a numbersince i've been in the space 13 17 uhand 21 was the mining ban the theinfrastructure just moved right toregions around the world with greatergeographic freedom and the networkamazinglybecause it's so robust had no downtimeright there were no protests no lawsuitspeople just move their infrastructureand the and the bitcoin blocks just keephitting every 10 minutes so you've neverseensomewhere between 50 or 60of the infrastructure turn off of anetwork and have no problems no hiccupsat all and by the way when they turnedthe network off the hash rate fell intothe 60sand now we're up to over 220 230 sowe'vethe network's grown three or four timesstrongerthan when that turned off and so i thinkthat's a gooduhit's a goodcase book example of what you don't wantto do if you're a government around theworld and you have the newest mostimportant accounting and financialuhtechnology that's ever been invented forhumanity is to turn it off within yourborders because guess what it just goessomewhere else right and then thoseother countries they get all thetechnologists they get the smartestpeople in the world building out thenetwork there which is going to bringthe value there and what's differentabout this network of with any otherfinancial system is that your marketisn't the 350 million people in americait's eight billion people you can dobusiness with everybody and so to shutthat network off is it and and we'll seethis uh play out is a massive uh bad baddecision a bad governance decision andit really was a uh a trillion dollarpresent to the united states because itall came here mostly uh you saw some ofit go different parts of the world andand i think the people that moved someof their equipment unfortunately uhthey have they have prior they haveproblems because not every nationrespects the private property ofindividuals or corporations within theirborders and so what you don't want to dois send 100 million dollars worth ofequipment infrastructure to a to aregion that doesn't have those sameprotections and you and and one day yourstuff goes offline and you call up andthey're likewhat stuff you know what servers wedon't have any servers here uh and thathappens that does happen and so we saw alot of it come to america fortunatelyand now we have to embrace thatyeah we have to embrace it you broughtit up thatuh we really have to make sure that the50 million people that own bitcoin arevery active and vocal uh we need to makesure our representatives understand whatthe technology is and the benefits thatit brings and also how it helps americakeepitsuhinstitutions strong and it's itstechnological advantage that it has overthe world in certain industries and alot of these big companies that are thatwere birthed in america are the industryleaders and so our representatives needto know that this makes us stronger itmakes us stronger having this technologygrow within our borders and if weexpel it or if we over regulate it andshow the technology within our borderswhat happensto the technology is nothing it doesn'tcareit will just move to other regions thathave greater freedoms and and you see elsalvador is a great example that youbrought up i i believein the last 40 yearsin el salvador with their traditionalbanking system they banked 2 millionpeople 2 million out of i think it'sseven or eight million people in elsalvador but i'm not sure what the totalnumber is but i do know the number wastwo million banked uh in the first 90daysthree million wallets were downloadedso theythey increased the banked individuals intheir country by 50 percent 50 morepeople were banked in 90 days than theirtraditional legacy systems took40 years to bank yeah wow umit's it's such an interesting time withthe regulatory environment becausecertainly going back a couple of yearstwo three years i was always like ohwhen's the us gonna ban thiswhen are they gonna ban it they're gonnaban it at some point this thisfeels both a very american idea and avery un american federal idea uh and soi kind of always expect it but what westarted to see this is this growth of uhpeople in congress and senate who'vetaken an interest it's people like tedcruz who waxes lyrical about bitcoin ina super intelligent way i don't know whoorange built him we have people likesenator lombards but we've also got thenew people coming through and we do havethe risk of someone like eric adams whocame out as a bitcoin and thensaid some stupid [ __ ] about uh proof ofwork but but generally speaking it isand i think what it is is there's peoplelike coin central the bitcoin policyinstitute who are actually getting thator texas blockchain council with leebradshaw these people are getting outthey're educating people and they'reactually realizing like this is a greattechnology for americait's a great defense against chineseauthoritarianism especially at a timewhere the dollar is under threatselfself imposed by uh removing therisk-free status of treasury billsrecently buti think this is actually just a hugeopportunity for the usthat it i think we're getting way beyondthat idea of it being i certainly don'tsee it being banned there might be somebonus regulations which are painfulbut this isit for you i danny anybody else this iswe just see this is primarily allopportunity 100 i mean and you broughtup a lot of really good people and and alot of good industries and and uhcenters and think tanks and uh lobbyiststhat have really jumped into the fray uhlee bratcher and and that texas uhblockchain umcouncil yeah they do it they do amazingjob i i work with lee um coin center andyou know guys like jerry britto and allthese guys do an amazing job ofeducating everybody on everything it youknow there'speople get into uhare people one-sided or the other side ifind thatthey're not it's not a black and whiteuh it's not it's not binary there'sthere's going to be people thatget in front of people that reallyteach them that the value exists on bothsides so i i've watched and i've talkedto these guys for a long time and ladiesthat are involved in 2012 and 13 i think50of the questions that i had to deal withwerethis is going to be banned right and soyou kind of see the fud haschanged over the years the ban questionsi never get asked anymore the chinesecontrol the network and this is a psyopuh and you're sucker and china you knowyou're just chinese stooge i don't hearthat anymore so we we're the narrativeschanging in terms of you know what wehave to answer all the time but thewhat you just brought up the banninguh there wasthat was so many questions that we wouldget asked all the time and then we sawthis executive order even though theremay be some onerous uh regulationsregulations are temporary right they'readministrative uh people get voted inand out of office regulations change uhthis network's not going anywhere andwe've all lasted through multipleadministrations so it's bitcoin's gonnaoutlast every government and everyadministration decision and souh an outright ban would be terriblebecause people would have to leavethe country to go work on thistechnology somewhere else so to work inthe regulatory environment i don't seeregulation is all bad i think you knowwe can work that outbut really the eo the executive orderjust came outuhtalked about protecting this technologyit's an innovationthey want it to grow in america andthere's enough legislature regulatorsceos of companies think tanks lobbyiststhat are in front of people every dayand i do think there's a war there'sthere's almost a tsunami of activity inthe space that it didn't exist at allbefore there was none of thisum and soit's really been it's been a it's beenamazing to watch it and and and watch itflourish some of the timing of howeverything's worked out is also kind ofunbelievable becausethe network now well let's think aboutback to 2013 when we had something likethe silk roadif that happened now that would consumea much more considerable threat to thenetwork but it happened at a time wherebitcoin just seems so small you couldyou could almost ignore itum and it seems like when bitcoin growsthe growth ratehappens at a rate whereby it creates allthese other protections around it theyou know it's not justuh a few nerds and a few people want tobuy some weed we've got a bit of bitcointhere are now politicians who are inbitcoin there are companies that ownbitcoin tesla's invested in bitcoinsome of thesome of the timings of the way thenetwork has grownand thewhat's happening around it almost seemslike perfect by design and i know someof it's just luckit's it's a very robust network you knowit's it's a hummer it's going to gothrough everything it's not alamborghini it's not going to you knowderail off the side of the road and sowhatever is thrown at it i think it justbarrels through it it will outlast it ithink the you know the silk roaduh if that happened today i think theycatch that they catch these guysimmediately they don't last as long asthey last because you'reputtinguhyou're putting digital assets on and offthe highway right you're off rampingthemevery day to different locations aroundthe globe and the way they caught thesethe the people that were involved didn'tseem to be overly sophisticated uh so ithink the only time you could have had amulti-year operation was early they justweren't paying attention they didn't seetheit take you know it takes years forfor washington and the regulators tocatch up to to people doing bad thingson in a new way and so i thinkyou know i i almost sayuh they didn't get lucky but they theylasted longer than they would now silkroads have probably popped up a lot wedon't hear about them anymore becausethey they nabbed these guys right awayit's it is the worstnetwork since we're talking aboutillicit activity this was for committingillicit activity it you have animmutable ledger that that audits itselfevery 10 minutes and you can track andtrace every single digital asset on itforeverthat's the absolute worst way to commita crime you don't want an asset that'strack and traceable for the rest of yourexistenceand if it's ever off-ramp they knowwhere to go and they can track thesethings forever so the historical waypeople committed crime is with cash ifyou hand somebody fiat cash currencythere's no way to track it and so ithink the unuh estimates there's two trilliondollars of money laundered every yearusing cash and the traditional bankingsystem if you look at the fines over thelast 10 years of all cryptocurrenciesit's a few billion dollars so we're noteven the same hemisphere it's magnitudesworse on the traditional financialsystem and yet all the headlines youknow look towards bitcoin is providingthisavenue for illicit activity it's by farand away the worst possible way you cancommit a crime and you see people commitcrimes with them and then they getarrested like the pipeline ransomwaredeal where these guys ask for bitcoinwhich was a big mistake and then theytook their bitcoin and sent it to acentralized exchange right and then thefbi subpoenas in you know secondsbecause they know where it's goingthere'sreally smart xuhtechnicians at companies like chainanalysis and and they're tracking theentire network every minute and theyknow it's there and then they go seizethe they go seize the thethe stolen bitcoin soyou don't you don't want to utilize thisnetwork to commit a crimeit would be a big mistake if i'm anintelligence agency i prefer criminalsto use this network i wouldn't iwouldn't tell them it was bad like gocommit crime on bitcoin that's fine andthen we'll come and get yousoi mean i i you know there's a lot of oohthis this enables illicit activity itreally doesn't you don't want to commitan illegal act on an immutableuh ledger that's gonna track you foreverthat's really a bad idea and uh and andso you you really end up with you knowone of the biggest fuds you know thebiggest being energy use uh the energyused in this network is the largest uhdisinformation campaign uh so far butsecond right now would be the illicitactivity let's uh let's talk about theenergy fund because you're but excusethe term you're at the coal face of thisbut you are you know you're you'reyou'reare you the largest american uh minor inlaw so this is where it gets what i'mallowed to say and what i'm not allowedto say uh in february we've reported ourresults and we mined somewhere around 35bitcoin per day uh core scientific wealso have a large hosting facility thatand i don't remember the numbers but wehost a lot of other third-partyequipment also so we'rewe're a large miner i think in the secin february we reported uh mining morecoins than any other publicly tradedcompany uh they just don't like me tosay the word largest okay but that'sabout just over three percent ofthe bitcoin every dayyeah so the every daythere's 900 yeah plus some transactionalones right so let's call it a thousandso yeah a little over three percentright yeah so it's it's uh but it'spretty [ __ ] big so look i rememberwhen i was happy when we would get likepoint zero zero one yeah i don't knowi've spent uh most of this year miningwith my five s19s and i'm not i'mgetting closer to our bitcointhat's yeah so um but you're pretty[ __ ] big uh you've built up datacenters you have to source powerum we are at a time where there arepeople who are concerned about what'shappening with the climate and energyusagebitcoin as a totaluh contributor to carbon in theatmosphereit's not huge but it does have a lens onit at a time when people are consideringthisuhwhat what is the the main thud andbut but also now i'll come back to thenext question what is the main thoughtfor yousoi i'll talk about this let me give yousome perspective because i looked a lotin terms of the history of analogsystems becoming digital systemsand the the very first thing that youseefrom an analog system becoming a digitalsystem are thethe legacy players are they getdisrupted and they get pretty angryhistorically right if you look way backtoi mean i think my favorite example isis ptolemy said that thethe solar system was all revolved aroundthe planet earth and all religious dogmaat the time said we were the center ofthe universeuhcopernicusrealized that the earth revolved aroundthe sun right andwhat did he do with that informationnothing because he knew what was goingto happen to him if he did on hisdeathbed he released a paper that saidyou guys are wrong the the sun's thecenter of this universe and we're we'rerevolvingwe're revolving around the sun uhgalileo found his piece that found hispaper andand said wow this guy's right and hewrotenon-stopabout how the earth was not the centerof the universe and we revolved aroundthe sun well guess what they did thegalileothey stuck them in a mental institutionand beat him to death and then theydissected his body parts and droppedthem all over the countryside and after200 yearsthey realized that he was right and thenthey tried to go find him and give him aproper burial and so that's what happensto youwhen you disrupt the legacy system whathappened to what happened to galileo thesame thing happened coincidentally tothis guy and i always say his name wrongbut it's ignaz semmelweisyou know what his crime was he said allof theseuhthese these women that are having babiesthey started in certain hospitals theywere they were dying at a averyuh this it was uhit was a pace that was just that wasthat was justvery unusually badand sothis guy looks into it and he says youknow there's germs on your hand they'renot using anycloth they're not washing their handsthey're not using gloveshe says there's germs on your hands youneed to wash your hands before youperform an operationokayand guess what they did to this guysame thing they did to galileo theystuck him in an institution and theykilled him because he said doctorsaren't clean and soyou see this happening non-stop ifyou're going to disrupt the legacyindustry you better be prepared for thelegacy industry people to come after youand so those two guys and that's justtwo of a hundred stories of people thatface the consequences of disrupting bigtime uh institutions and could we sayjulian assange is a perfect example ofthati you know i can yeah without gettingpolitical i think that uh you're seeingthis play out over and over againduring humanity there are legacy systempeople that do not want to go away yousaw the email which is the funniest oneemail came out and guess what the unitedstates government the postmaster generalsaidthe most efficient the most secure wayliterally like quotes the most secureway to deliver information between twoparties is the us mail not email andemail guess whatneeds servers and use a lot of energyand it's going to destroy the planet andwe need to stopemails and so the us postmaster generalwent to congress the united states andsaid we need to stop these emails fromproliferating because if you send 10emails you're burning a pound of coal orwhatever the narrative they used andthey actually voted onimplementing an email stamp tax inamericaimagine that and they lost fortunatelybut you still had lots of peopleon both sides right arguing to stop theemail you saw the same thing with withthe internet okay the people that hadmonopolies basically on on informationthey didn't like to see peoplehave access to information so they triedto stop the internet and guess how theytry to stop the internetit uses too much energy you need serversto run the internet and guess what theysaid they said everyit was it was every five megabytes ofinformation burned a pound of coal orwhatever it was it equals about ahundred tweets today what they saidburned a pound of coal and so they theytried to shut offthey tried to shut off the internetbecause of the energy argument theytried to stop email because of theenergy argument this is not a newargumentanytime you see an analog system go to adigital system you see anon-quantifiableamount of energy running an analogsystem to a very quantifiable amount ofenergy running a digital system and it'sreally easy to say oh you need serversthat's terrible wellhow much energy did you need to sendpostto send an actual letter from one placeto another right you need trucks youneed security you need buildings youneed ceos and airplanes airplanes i meanlook at traditional analog money youneedto make coins you need to mine the metalwhich is terrible for the environment itreleases chemicals you need to transportthe metal to a factory you need to turnthe metal into a coin right then youneed to trucks and security to transportit to the bank you need to hand it outyou need tellers you need bankers youneed ceos you need regulatory bodies youneed government then you need to use themoney then the money goes back to thebank you need security again and thenguess what they they they destroy itevery 10 years and mine more uh if it'spaper they have to they have to cut downmore trees or use whatever chemicalsthey are to to make it so you get theseterriblyuh invasive technologies that have beendecimating the planet for all theseyears and they're like no that uses aserverthat uses a server we need to shut itoff and so we see that with bitcointhese the first thing to say is this isnot a new way to argue against thedigital technology this is always thefirst argument the legacy people usebecause you can sayoh there's a server over there this isterribleand and uh so that's that's the firstoneuh the the second one isin 2017 coincidentally when i wasbuilding the firstuh core scientific facility up in theappalachian mountains two articles cameout okayuhone from newsweek and and one from ourbuddies at the world economic forum uhagain coincidentally they said the samething they said the same thing and itwas remarkable what they said they saidthatthe bitcoin network is so energyintensiveit's so bad for humanity so bad for theworld economic or ecological conditionthat we need to turn it off right nowand if we don't if we don't by 2020 soit's 2017. by 2020it will consume allall of the world's energy not a lotliterally says the word all worldeconomic forum newsweek 2017. welli'm dealing with investors i'm buildingthe first large-scaleuh facility and the mayor theall my investors my board everybody'scalling me up every day sayingwhat are you doing like what are youwhat are we doing we can't do this youneed to stopand sothousands ofyou know thousands of hoursof dealing with the energy fund early onuh and and here we are today by the wayit's 2022 righttwo years after this prediction from theworld economic forum two years after theprediction from newsweek andand theyand the prediction was all the world'senergy right so we know already that'swrong because our lights are on andwe're in the middle of a podcast we'renot using all the energy but you wouldassumethose two organizations would be prettycloseto accurate on the amount of energythat's used by the bitcoin network sothat's the first thing you have thesepredictions ofhuman annihilation associated with thisand when you tell people they're goingto die they generally listen to youright so they're stoking fear in peoplestroking fear of people and that and thepeople are getting scared and they'relike they want to know what's going onand what you're doing wellthe that answerof how much energy we're using we knowbecause they're serversin a data center so you can measure itguess what else we knowwe also know how much energy isgenerated globally on an annualizedbasis all of the energy producersprovide that information britishpetroleum exxon all the people thatprovide lots of energy they acknowledgehow much energy theyproduce or generate every year and soyou havewe have the number we have the answer weknow how much energy is generated nowbefore i tell you the number the nextstat and i know you see this all thetime too is they say the bitcoin networkis so bad it uses more energy than smallcountries like new zealandnorway new zealand the netherlands namea country the bitcoin network'sdestroying the planet because it usesmore energy than that that's the samearticle that's the same idea that's thesame ridiculousness that the newsweek inthe world economic forum is they'retaking the global bitcoin networkthat servers and they're comparing it tosmall countries which is a global it's aglobal comparison so you can'tunderstand this comparison that thesepeople are making without understandingwhat the numbers are globally so we haveto understand the significance of theenergy used by this network versus theglobal energy that's generated so howmuch is how much energy is generatedglobally and how much does this networkuse that's it and we know the answersthe answer isapproximately the world every yeargenerates a hundred and sixty thousandkilowatt hours of energy that's thethat's the number that's generatedif you listen to newsweek the worldeconomic forum or these other peoplelet's say the network uses more energyand they small countries you would thinkthe bitcoin network uses a lot of that160 000 terawatt hours of energy well itdoesn't it does not because it does itnot consider what's wasted as wellthat's a different i'll get into wastedenergy but but we know that terawatthours of energy of the network so of thenetworkwe use the bitcoin mining network uses200 approximately terawatt hours ofenergy of 160 000. daddy's trick quicklyworking out the percentage i'm not i waslooking at climbing zero zero zeroapproximately two uh sometimes you getanywhere from point zero zero zero onefour so a quarter point fourteen percentto point two percent depending on whatuhit's inconsequential if you shut thewhole network off nothing happens mostlarge industriesthey round off the amount of energy theyuse globally by one or two percentthat makes the bitcoin mining networkless than a rounding error surroundingerror of any other major industry it'san inconsequential amount so a globalbasis any of these people that scaremonger on a global energy basisare are committingtheir they're being intellectuallydishonest rightthey're committed do you think it'sscaremongering though because we hadtroy crosston recently and he's uhhe's been in bitcoin since like 2011 andhe said he basically fell for the samething didn't he he did some somecalculations that end up obviously beingwrong but do you think they'rescaremongering god do you think they'rejustnot aware of the calculation youactually need to dooh it's they know they know what they'resaying that's why you say a countrybecause it feels if you say thepercentage these people are good atmarketing you could you could say thepercentage and put it next tohow much bp uses or how much you cancompare to christmas lights i mean youcould pull up these you know analogiesthat thatso what what you have is you have allthese legacy systems rightand and they're joined together to stopthis network and they've been doingmarketing they're very well funded theysee what's happening and and they theyhave internal departments coming up withthis isn't like accidental and so theythis is a marketing plan against thisnew technology that's very well thoughtout and they do a very good job andthat's why you'll go to the guardian andthe guardian will say this technologythat's got a few small people rich whichis used by terrorists and drug dealersis also using more energy than norway ornew zealand so when you start stackingthe fud right on top of the farm on topof the fudthey get people you get people ratherthan sayingwell here are the facts yeah here's thebest accounting system in the worldwhich removes money misinformation whichstops corruption which hopefullyprevents banking collapses which reducesinflation because government can't printmoney which also enables people underauthoritarian regimes to have propertyrights which you know so you we canstack our own stackbut we don't have to lie with our stackno listen to the truth no no by the wayyou bring up a perfect point the truthis actually our friend here all all thatmatters is what's the truth what what isthe actual truth because all of thosestats are in our favor it's themisinformation we're the we're we're thewe're getting hit with misinformation inevery angle and we have been since theinceptionist network and i think one ofthe problems that we faced as asas people that are involved in thebitcoin network is thatwe found value in a decentralized rightand distributed networkand so what do we do wellwe all do our own thing to stopthis decentralized or decentralized useof misinformation because what are wewhat are we railing against wellcentralized monetary technologies thathave corrupted centralized accountingtechnologies that have corrupted and sowe're all trying to stay decentralizedyou can't do that in a marketing war orin a marketing war and we're losingright and so what you had wasdifferent people in the industryincluding me i would talk to a fewpeople and never talk to anybody elsebecause i don't want to bein the middle of all of this uhpersonally you know in front of all themaniacs coming after me every day and solike you which i don't know how you doit butbut uh but so i think we saw the we sawthe kickback the most that i've seen uhwhen uh michael saylor and i agreed toto set up this bitcoin mining councilwith a few other folks in the beginningand theand theyou know i'm i've been protecting thisnetwork for a decade um very vested inin its well-being uh they came after usright you're bad guys you think you're acouncil of miners and you're gonna telleverybody what to think which and ifthey would have listened to us the onlypurpose of what that is and you can seewe haven't done anything except for putout educational materials and and andtell you how much energy is used by thebitcoin network the purpose of that wasthis they're united against us they'rereally really good at putting out badinformation that's false right ormisleadingand how do we how do we combat that wellifone company puts out information andanother company puts out information andanother company and they're all a littlebit different no one listens but ifeverybody puts it out togetherthey listen so we needed to coordinatethe effort in terms of the messagingcoming outi think michael saylor i'll give himcredit for this quote he said it thebest in one of our firstearly talks he said we could bedecentralized which is what we all arebut we don't need to be disorganized andwhich is what we were and so we've in anorganized manner collected informationon energy statistics so we can counterthis fud that goes on on a regular on aon a legislativelevel and and it helps everybody becauseif america bans this technology that'snot good it's not good for americans uhbitcoin doesn't careright you can't disrupt the code thebitcoin network will move but it makesit easier for europe to ban it australiait makes it justit listen it takes the win if we couldstop it why not stop it and and by theway if we could stop it by justproviding the truthwell why not do that and so that's whatwe do we just we just put out the actualnumbers we don't need to we don't needto spin it we don't need to market ithere are the numbers the numbers showthat what you're being told is a lieit's it's intellectually dishonest whatyou've been told anybody who comparesthis network to a small country isframing this on a global problem we justtalked about what the numbers are thisis not a global problem not even closeand by the way the carbon footprint isthe same percentage because we're usingenergyless the percent of energysustainable energy used by this industryover other industries and so the use ofour energyfor this network you it releases lesscarbon then this energy would have beenused in other industries because we usea majority of additional sustainable uhenergy sources so you you end up withthisand here's the waste i'll give you agood example you brought up waste iwanted to address that and i'll let youask whatever you want yeah sorry to cutyou off again the uh thewasted energy and this is this is theexample i like to useelectricity okay electricity and energypeople confuse them they're differentenergy is used to create electricityokay so you electricity is after it'screated and then they push the heatthrough the lines and then you use itokay if it goes too far it degrades intonothing you can only send and i i say500 miles and then people like you can'tsay 500 miles you could you could sendenergy a certain amount of of milesbefore it's it you you lose too much ofit in transmission lines and heat lossthe united states the united stateswe take ten thousand six hundredterawatt hours of energyevery year to create all of theelectricity on our electrical grid allof the everything that we're pluggedinto in the united states is the resultof ten thousand eight hundred terawatthours of energy creating thatelectricity okayof that ten thousand eight hundredterawatt hoursof energy6800 terawatt hours of that over 60is wastedpoof gonewhat that means is the bitcoin networkwhich uses 200 terawatt hours a yearright is a fraction of a fraction of apercent of the wasted energy in americain america right so it's it's you knowit's one or two percent of the wastedenergy uh it's it's a little more than afraction of a fraction but it's it's oneor two percent of the wasted energy inamerica so you're seeing you're seeingthese campaignsthat pop up to confuse the populationthat this energy uses destroying theplanet now who are whothere's a lot i mean we all agree i'massuming there's a lot of environmentaluhreal environmental horrific crimescommitted every day all around the globemassively terrible things they releasepoisons into the groundwater they'reusing pesticides that run off into theinto the streams and the lakes they'redoing terrible things to our oceanthere's terrible terrible things onenvironmental front going on every dayall over the world anddisproportionately you know who's harmedby thatpoor people the poor people that theylive in the incentralized conditional uh areas wherethere's lots and lots of environmentaldamagethe environmental damage that occurs ona yearly basis right it's horrificit's not caused by bitcoin it's notcaused by the small inconsequentialamount of energy that's used by bitcoinyet what's on the front cover of everyarticle right now in every mainstreammedia outlet bitcoin energy usehe's talking about all of this horrificstuff that's going on across the worldand so itwe're really living in this dystopianenvironment where there's massiveenvironmentalcrime being committed and they'refocused onpoint zero zero zeroone eight of the world's energywhich people like me and were buildingin sustainable environments the majorityof the large companies and so it's it'sa it's a nonsensical article uh it's anonsensical argument the articles werenonsensical too and it and it's reallyunfortunate to watch it play out overand over again and i've had i've hadhour-long talks with lots of people andthey're like well the new york timessaid this uses more energy than thiscountry and i'm like in new yorknon-stopuh so that's kind of that's kind ofthat's the end that's part of the energytalk and obviously i could talk a lotabout it well i just wanted to putsomething in there because your answerthere and the work the um bitcoin mineaccounts have done is essentially kindof defensive work it's this is whatyou've been told here's the truthbut i'm also really interested in theoffensive work we had margot pious onthe show recently from the bitcoinpolicy institute and we're helping herget funded to run a project now she isan environmentalistum and she uh she wants to do a projectshe wants to write a paper study onwhat's happening here with urcothow uh i think was it two years ago imean you've spent probably more timehere than me but it's two years ago thatthethe grid collapsed because of thesomething to do with the weather and theinfrastructure but also there's like aneed for a balanced loadnot only on a policy level educationallevel can you go and defend the floodwith regards how much energy usesis used you actually come back and saynot only is the energy use negligiblebut if we place mining infrastructurehere we actually stabilize the grid soyou have both offensive and defensiveargumentsvery good point 100 percent right uh thebitcoin mining council is more of adefensive educational uh platform andthen on the offensive uhpeople what was the name mark margotmargoti'd love to see what she's puttingtogether because that sounds superinteresting yeah but what you bring upis exactly right and and it here's thedifference between the energy used bybitcoin miners versus the energy used bylet's say aws a big data center companyif if there wereemer like you said an emergency weatherevent okay and and part of the gridenergy generation facilities collapse orget turned off or p too many people turnon their power during you know non-peakhours where they didn't have enoughelectricity to send aroundif there's an emergency event or acontrolled load event where there's aload problemcompanies like core scientific havecontractually agreed to shut off inseconds all of the minersnow why can we do that and why can'tother industries do that right well ifwe turn off our bitcoin mining serversnothing happens they just stop doingcalculationsnothing happens at all if aws turns offtheir data centers and then stopsrunning well ethereum stops runningyes yes no one's going to die he'sgetting cocky now he's got a micyou know you'll see you'll seeconsequences that that affect uh stakenetworks that are on that are on uhservers over there but you'll also seemuch more dire consequences in thatthey're running the traffic lights inaustin right in every other city in theplan every other city in america you'rethey're running the air air trafficcontrol towers right that their theirservers are off-site at aws so whathappens if you turn off aws people aregoing to dieright it's going to be terrible theramifications are going to be massiveand so you cannot turn offtraditional legacy industrysystems you just can't and they havefail safes for that they have powerredundancies built in they havegenerators they have all types of stuffthat make sure that they never gooffline bitcoin miners we don't care ifwe go offline so what we're called isflexible load if there's an emergencyyou can shut us off firstwe'll give the power back that we weregoing to take we just won't take itanymore and so we're the first line ofdefense in an emergency situation andwhat does that mean for an electricalgrid on a region or local level thatmeans if you have a bitcoin miningfacility on your gridyour grid is stronger than any othergrid that does not because the firstpower to turn off is ours and corescientific weissue a press release the last fewmonths on the total number of times weturn off we when we when we shut offpowerwe we tell how many times we down powera month and how many how many megawattsof power we send back to the grid and ithappens often i go over 10 times lastmonth a number of times in january andso we're curtail power we'll turn it offright away and send it back to the gridsois that something that's like you yousign the contract with the energyprovider yeah so there's different typeswe are right now contractually obligateduh most big energy utility companiesthey're required and so for the largeminers and i'm assuming all otherlanguage miners have contractualobligations to curtail power duringemergency events or controlled loadevents there's also economic events likesometimes power prices shoot upwe have the rights to shut off then sothere's economic there's three there'sreally three reasons to curtail powereconomic there's some kind of economicevent which is not an emergencyemergency the storm something terriblehappened in the community or acontrolled load event where the loadsget disrupted so you those are the threedifferent types and is there a powerdown process like how long does it takeyou to seconds eight seconds you canliterally just turn them off no damageto equipment i think turn them back on15 minutes later six hours later it'samazing doesn't matter and so thatability to down power an industry likethat doesn't existexcept for this and so we provide thatflexible load now what's why is flexibleload so important well what arerenewablesrenewables are intermittent they're notalways on right the wind doesn't alwaysblow the sun doesn't always shine thewaves get lower so you have thisintermittent renewable energy sourcewhich people want and the world wants tomove more towards renewable energieswell in order to get more renewableenergies on your gridwhich are intermittent so they come andgo you need flexible loadso you can down power themas the intermittency hits in certaintimes on renewable energy so thisindustry is not only making the gridstrongerwe're really subsidizing the growth ofrenewable energyglobally right we're the only privateindustry today that's subsidizing thegrowth of renewable energies on a globalbasis do you know this troy cross and doyou know his thesis no so troy cross isaguy who came on the podcast he's been ontwice now once with nick carter um hehas a whole thesis about howhe's identified exactly what you saidbut actually this can be used toactually incentivize the uh furtherinvestment in renewables and i know noteveryone agrees with this but what andwhat he's saying is there'sbillions if not i don't know what thenumber is but say billions of dollars ofesg budgets out there that could bedirected towards investment inrenewables to support mining to supportthese 100 right yeah if you had a mallwith nick carter he's a smart guybecause he's a genius well nick knowsway more of this than i do so nickpointed into us we did the show massiveamount of interest in it from that we'vegot the two together and from thatthat's where we had margot so margo'sgoing to do the pro we basically saidwe'll help get her funded she wants togo and run the project i'd love to talkto her well i'll help fund her well if ican if the if i get allowed to thepublic she needs like thirty thousanddollars we need six people to give herfive put me in touchshe's gonna speak to amanda fabiani aswell but she's going to go and produce apaper that explains exactly what'shappened here in with urcotand that's going to be something thatwill not only be evidence forthe market for the fud but actually youcan then take to other parts of the gridand say by the way you should beconsidering this layered in what whattroy said is that you can go out to imean his example was the winklevoss whatthey did is they offset they made itpublic they offset their energy usagebut what he said is you could offsetby mining bitcoin with renewablesbecause that drives investment inrenewables so you've now got esg budgetswhich was being used esg's been used toattack bitcoin which you can turn it 180and say actually you can point your esgbudget at infrastructure that builds outgreen mining and you get a bitcoinreturnyeah no listen this will all it it hasto come full circle because the truth ofall of this is this is the most esgfriendly technology that's ever existedit's not just on an energy point butalso on a government's and social pointit doesn't careanything about your demographics rightdoesn't have anything to do with thatand it provides all humans on the planetwith banking right and private propertyso not just on an energy basis does thistake esg you know notches it takes themon every part of the esg not just the eit's the s and the g and so at somepoint in the future as people learn whatthis technology does this will be amassive investment for these big esgfunds and and i i i like that you guysare going down that path i'm going totell you something's going to blow yourmind all right for ercot uh and margotcould could could look this up so we hada a big call with with the aircon peopleabout this problem and this this problemis going to blow your mindbecause there's so manynew renewable energy projects going upin texasguess what they're worried abouttoo much power the price of power goingto zerothat's what they're worried about andguess what happens if the price of powergoes to zerothe legacy systems that run the baselineenergy that you needso people don't die they'll go out ofbusinessso we're providing too much renewableenergy which is going to endangerthe legacy energy systemsthose are the new problems and soall of those are complicated too likehow do you how do younot lose your base load energy becauseyou have so much renewable energy andyou don't have the battery technology toto contain it during x amount of cyclesso you so is that a is that a bad riskbecause you need that reliable baselineyou need a base load of energy all thetime yeahi mean we're not at some point maybe in100 years you know they'll know how tohave you know energystored storing energy is verycomplicateduh but right now you need baseloadenergyyeah you can't rely if you're solelyrelying on intermittent energy you're ina lot of trouble so you need a base loadenergy and so because we're going tohave so much renewable energy availablemost of the dayyou still need to make sure that thebase load energy is available for thetimes when you don't need it and that'snot for bitcoin mining that's forcivilizationeverywhere in the world okayuh talk to me um about chips because uhwe're perfectly aware that during timesof growth with bitcoin getting hold ofasics is can be challenging depend onwho you are obviously you'll have yourrelationships butuh if there was a mass massive increasein the bitcoin price that will drive amassive increase inthe demand for more mining facilitiesbut the asics can only be produced at acertain time i know that intel arelooking at producing chips informationis coming out about that also uhjack dorsey made an announcementthat they're going to be looking intochips as well uh there is a risk withthe primary foundry i forget is it tsmcis that the name of it uh in taiwan anduh that's a geopolitical risk you'reprobably much closer to all of this andi am probably looking years ahead in theconsideration of the asics that you wantto purchase where are we at with allthis because uh one of the we hadmatthew pines here and he was talkingaboutthe second order effects of bitcoinmining on the end of the industry isincredible he said it's going to haveexactly the same impact on the chipon the market for chip production inthat there's a requirement for foundriesto be built here to protect the miningindustry 100 chips chips are a bigproblem globally to make sure you have asteady amount of ready available chipsotherwise none of your electronics worki think one of the most interestingthings is do you know what chips aremade ofno idea well silicone silicon they'remade of silicon right and there's alwaysa shortage of chips all over the worldright but they're made of silicon youknow what silicon isit's sand sand it's the most abundantmineral on the planet earththere's sand everywherehow come we're always running out ofchipshmm right the process of taking thesound the silicon and perfecting it intoa chip is very expensive and very uh youneed what i'm told because i this madeno sense to me when i went down therabbit hole on the silicon like you saidlike i looked at this for a while i wastrying to figure out why we're runningalways running out of chips when they'remade of silicon which is everywhereand soi started looking up chip companies icouldn't find anything there's themanufacturing silicon companies thatmake the chipsit's almost like they're invisibleand and this is i didn't understand howthey made the chipsand and i was trying to understand thisbecause originally when we'd buyequipment and i bought a lot ofequipment from the different variousuhuh manufacturersin like 15 and 16 i was all i went tochina and i visitedall of the different manufacturers ofequipment trying to figure out who youknow i kept getting [ __ ] up buyingmachines and they wouldn't show upbeforei started a bigger company uh i went touhthere there were several reputablebrands back then one of them was in asiliconand in a silicon offices you know wherethey were in luan they were in wuhanchina so i was in china meeting with theinner silicon people and they in 2015and this this blew my mind they had ablockchain museumbig one beautifulthis huge blockchain museum with all ofthe stuff on the triple entry accountingand all the everything that had happenedup until then so they really understoodthe importance of this technology beforeit traveled around it was it was it wascreated here but the the chinese reallyadopted it quicklyum i think if you live in authoritarianregime that's what you want to do butanyway i was we would buy chips we wouldbuy machines and we would orderback then it was like 10 tera hashmachines or14 tera hash machines whatever thenumber wasand themachines would come and they'd be 12 orthey'd be 16 or they'd be nine they'renever the sameand so i was curious why the chipswhy why is it the chips is it thesoftware is the front like why are theywhy are they all differentanduh this this uh one of the one of theguys that worked at one of thehe worked at canaan uh he explainedhow you make chips to meuh that i never forget and i think it'sinteresting umyou get the siliconyou don't just make a chiphe says it's like a pizzaand so all the chips are different whenthey come out of the other side you putall the toppings on this chip andthey're really really small and thenthey bake and then they come out andthen you have to test each chipindividually to see how fast it goes andthen they have grade a grade b grade cchips and the better ones go faster thanthe other ones and so that's why whensome of the manufacturers release amodelthey say some of them are 110 terahashes yeah some of them are 100 andsome of them are 90. that's because thechipsarebetterfrom one of the runs and that's also whyyou can have these companies that startupto create manufacturing uh chips and tobuild their own equipment they'll do atape out which is the runand so that their it's if it's theirearly tape outs they could do a 50million or 20 million dollar i don'tknow how many you know tens of millionsof dollars it cut costs now to do a tapeout but they could failso all the chips can come out and notworkand so that's use that's why thesecompanies failed because their tape outsdidn't work and the chips didn't workand so the chip stuff's fascinating tome i mean probably not to anybody elsebut the the silicon that goes into it'swidely available the tape outs are alldistinct the the processes and certainlya company like intel they don't need anyhelp on this stuff like they know how todo this stuffreally really wellum but that so so you have that theinteresting part on the chipsreally on an efficiency scale for forbitcoin mining is that the first chipsthat came out for asics right so a6 iguess 2013 so eight years ago uhyou look at the efficiency of theequipment in joules per tera hash whichis how much energy will create a terrahash right like or one joule of energycreates how many tera hashesum and sothe chips that were made from the firstrunso the first asics that came out i thinkthey were around one tara ash to theto the chips that are coming out now andhow fast they are the the new chips are40 000more efficientthan the first run of chips eight yearsago so we have a and this goes to one ofthe points you said we have a 400 timeincrease in efficiency in the chips thatare now running much faster with lessenergy and so that second order where itgoes to the rest of the world in termsof other usability of these of thisgreat efficiencies of these asicsthat'll play outin in other industries as well sothey're creating new technologythat is then going to power ai i mean aiis just running computers very much likemuch much like a bitcoin server veryvery fast right the the morecomputations you can make the fastertheoretically the machines learn and soyou have a you have thisuh this very closerelationship between bitcoin miningmachines and the facilities that they'rein the blockchain infrastructurefacilities and how fast these machineshave to goto what's gonna happen with ai becausethey have to have similar types ofequipmentright they have to go really fast andand uh calculate as many differentyou know you know algorithmically howmany different consequences there arefor each action butthey're all interrelated and you'll seei am if i had to guess you'll see thesethings correlate into you know secondworld effects or whatever thetechnological term is for thatum your your history in this isfascinating because you've you've seenthe industry mature um and quitesignificantly you you've mentioned todayuh starting out essentially with therewas gpu mining back in 2011 and thenthey had the first eight i missed thecpu sorry the cpu cpu gpu yeah but imissed that one but then the first a6and then wanted to build outprofessional facilities and then movingtowards uhtheintegration with the gridsand now we have intel wanting to produceasics and a large number of publiclytraded bitcoin minersuh uh now in existence like thattransition from a nerdy tool using cpusand gpus to these intel andlike how do you take that all in becauseit's it's some growth and someuh uhevolution of the industryyeah listen it's the great questionsurreal i mean i i was telling peoplethat this is the best accountingtechnology and they're like you're anidiot for a decade right and so now wehave executive order we have intel inthe space we have publicly tradedcompanies we have huge funds jumping inand so it's it really is it's surreal towatch this growth um and we are supersuper early uh i think the best exampleis the internet itself i think theinternet was invented in i mean utilizedby by civil by non you know by civiliansin the 80s early 80sthere's an article that came out and i iwant to say the guardian but i don'tremember who it was in 9915 yearsafter the the internet was utilized byciviliansand the article said thisthe internetis a passing fadit's going to go away wasn't by paulkirkland was that i don't know but ifyou look it up you'll see who wrote thearticle calling the internet a passingfad and it wasn't just one it wasmultiple and so we're talking 15 yearsinto the internet and it was a passingfad we're 13 years into the biggest mostrevolutionary technological innovationnot just for accounting but foreverything that touches accounting likemonetary technology it's going to take along timeit's just not going to happen overnightdanny do you remember the time whenthere was no internet not really no yesso i first used the internet in 1992always remember i was 14 years oldand we got it at school and we were allgiven there was one computer we're allgiven 10 minutes to just go and like goon the internet go on to yahoothat's amazing i'm going to date myselfwhen i was an accountanti the only job i ever last it was myfirst job and then i quit uh i had wastasked there was a fire i was in lathere was a fire at the la publiclibraryandtwo quarter three quarters i don't knowit was like half or three quarters ofthe books in the library burnedas a young associate of the accountingfirm i got touh we we were tasked with recordingwhich books did not burn on a ledgerwithout a computer and so we didn't havecomputers so we were doing it by handall the serial numbers of the books andand that was my only ever auditassignment as account but yeah i meanit's hard to remember time when rememberaol of course i remember the distanceyou had to download it and then you hadto plug it into the wall and it was likeand it would go really slow and it wasshitty and you're like no one's evergoing to use this i can't do anythingand the image would load live logothat's where we are now this is like theaol of uh we're still so we're thatearly juncture before it works great andthings have been built on it well so iremember my dad my dad was an aircraftengineer 35 years and whenever he had toprepare for an exam he would have hismanuals and he'd have a book and he'd bewriting things out he always wroteeverything uh even to the point where hewould manage the the accounts of thehouse his finances he had a book and heessentially would write how his ledgerof what he spent and what he's got lefthe never went away from that and then istarted get we got our first computerand i started to use it and i wouldnever have done what he did i always usethe computer and and then my my son bitlike danny has never known no internetbut my daughter's one step further she'snever really known no screens becauseessentially from what the time she'scould use one there's been an ipad or aniphone and sothere's things you don't realize likepeople don't realizebecause of mobile phones do you rememberbefore mobile phones when you went tomeet somebody do you remember what youhad to do you always had to be on timebecause if you weren't on timethey wouldn't know where the [ __ ] youwere and you couldn't get hold of themwhereas now you can be late as [ __ ]because your phone can say i'm gonna beten minutes later i'm gonna be 20minutes late oh let's meet hereyou agreed a place i'm in my first datei went to the cinema with this girl wentto see the i'm not going to tell youactually but uhwe agreed a time and we met therebecause you couldn't do anything aboutthat but we nowthis people are going to be born nowin 10 years time and they're not goingto have known a time where you couldn'tsend money instantly around the world toanyone permissionlessly like these arethe steps we're taking this is where weare nowit's always i think it's always funny tolook back at that yeah no it's that'sthat's those are really accuratedepictions of what's about to happen andwhythe people in washington need to startthinking like that that this is notgoing awayever it's like saying the internet'sgoing to go away it's not internet helpsyou move information around this helpsyou move everything else around all theledgers anything in the world that needsa ledger like money this this will moveon that and soas you said the very present at thatthatas the children grow into thistechnology and learn it as they grow upthat's what their baseline is right andso they're going to expectsome degree ofaccess and cooperation with the peoplethat are running the countries and ithink the people that see that early andandand capitalize on that especially inamerica you're seeing a lot of of uhcandidates that are that are now outtalkinguhtoto different parts of these communitiesis is i mean the whole this whole stepoperation as you just said from thebeginning you know it's in you know gpusand then and then moving throughall of the different fun articles to youknow it's going to be banned andsilly to be involved in it to you knowthe chinese control it to you know thatyou know to what it is now and it willjust
