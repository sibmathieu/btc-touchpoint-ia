uh i'll be safe with this steeloption so check them out again billfodle over at privacypros.iowith that let's dive into the shownow just a little disclaimer here as imentioned in the preamble that this isindeed a custodial lightning wallet sowhat that means is that you do not havedirect on-chain control of your funds ifsomething were to happen to wallet ofsatoshitechnically speaking you could lose somesats in using it that said if you'reusing it for smaller amounts and for theconvenience of itnot too much of a big deal just don'tadd anything into wallet of satoshi thatyou would not be okay withlosing i use it as a demo wallet oftenjust to show lightning transactions andso you knowbasically uh whatever your tolerance forrisk is apply it to wallet of satoshithat said it is very very convenientvery easy to use umof course there are non-custodialoptions out there which i've done plentyof videos on but that's not the point ofthis video we're going to take a look atwall of stoshie what it can doi have done an old video on walletsatoshi but a lot has changed since thenso i wanted to uh kind of showcase someof the new features that incorporatehere uh also a side note we will betransacting between wallets of satoshiandthe zebedee wallet which i've also donea video on so i'll link that down belowas welland any other thing that we come acrossi may reference some other uhprerequisite videos that may be usefulto you and i'll list them in these shownotes as well uh with thatlet's uh jump in to actually settingthis thing upso i just wanted to quickly refer to thesetup in that there really is nonewhen it comes to downloading wallet ofsatoshi basically you download on the onthe app store when you open it up it'sgoing to be functional already you canuse it right out the gate however thereis a simple backup process whereif you delete the app you can recoveryour funds and the way that works iswhen you first open up the app you'regoing to seethree little dots in the top right handcorner with a little red exclamationpoint when you tap on that it's going toopen up this side menu and down at thebottom it's going to say log in to backup and if you tap on that you will thensay you may lose your phone or deletethis app um you may lose your walletbalance to guarantee your bitcoin or touse your account on multiple devicesplease log in and all you do is youenter an email address and hit login andit will send credentials uhbasically to recover or then associateuh yourwallet of satoshi with that particularemail address and then you just need toprovide that next time you log in itwill send you a confirmation code orsomething to that effect uh butbasically it's it's simply enter anemail if you want the ability to recoverin case of deleting the app they willknow who you are and how many sats youactually haveand that's pretty much that but i wantedto show that quickly before we dive intoactually uh using the wallet itselfso here we are in wallet of satoshi onmy phone this has obviously previouslybeen usedand you can see if i tap on the righthere i have an email address associatedwith this particular walletwhat we're going to do is just do aquick overview of what's in front of usso on the main screen you're going tosee a balance in sats and on down belowit will be done denominated in thecurrency of your choice and down belowsimply you've got receive and sendoptions if i tap on the right hand sidehere there is a third party option tobuy bitcoin through thereyou can paste an address you can setyour local currency which is currentlyset to usdset your language there are advancedsettings there's options to findmerchants and atms online retailersinviting a friend contacting support allof that in terms of advanced settingsyou can change your denomination tobitcoin so if you prefer seeing decimalswhichyou know i'm not a big fan of when it'sespecially in using lightning wallets iprefer sats but i digress security youcan turn on biometric and pin check forpayingyou can hide account balances you canchange the theme god forbid you want touse the light theme but you know to eachtheir own uh there is nfc optionsalthough uh this is not something thati'm going to be demoing right now andagain you can create a csv file for anyuhanyprevious transactions that you've doneif you need tofirst thing you'll probably be doinghere is receiving bitcoin into thiswalletso if i hit the receive screen you havethree options we're going to use themall you can receivelightning you can receive on chain oryou can receive via a lightning in alightning address which we'll touch onthat in a little bitso here is your main screen and dependdepending on the lightning wallet you'reusing you may be able tosimply allow somebody to scan this as itis and they can thendecide the amount to send you howeversome wallets do not support that and youmust add a custom amountsoi'm just going to show you how to do itvia custom amount withoutdoing the the blank invoice way of doingit if you ever encounter the fact thatsomebody can't scan this invoice as isthen that simply means that you need toadd a custom amount or receive in one ofthese other two ways okay so i'm goingto add in a custom amount here i'm goingto add and by the way when you hit addamount it will start in your localcurrency and you can swap that for yourbitcoin denomination i'm going to askfor 100 satsi'm going to hit done that will changethe invoice here this could then bescanned by anybody using a lightningwallet with you or you can tap to copythe invoice to your clipboard which ihave doneso i'm now going to open up uh moonwallet which is another uh this is anon-custodial lightning wallet that ican useand we will send from moon to wallet ofsatoshi i do have a full tutorial onmoon wallet so you can check that out ifyou see fit so all i'm going to do inmoon is i'm going to hit send i'm goingto paste the invoice that we just copiedit's going to load the payment detailsit says 100 sats is going to well walletof satoshi you can see that and uh nonetwork fee for this or anything so i'mjust going to go ahead and hit sendout it goesand i got a notification that says heyyou just received 100 sats so i'll jumpover i can see that it was paid and ican see that mybalance just went up by 100 sats and ican also see the transaction listed downbeloweasy peasyall right so what if we uhweren't transacting with somebody whohad the lightning networkon their wallet well you can alsoreceive on chain so let's look at how todo that we're gonna hit receivewe're going to hit the tab that says onchain and this has a bitcoin address soonce again somebody could scan this andsend any amount they want you don't haveto create an invoice for that uh andthen otherwise we can share the actualbitcoin address now please note there isa 0.3 percent fee so if somebody sendsyou uma hundred dollars you're going to beuhbasically it's going to cost you 30cents and the reason for that is they'remanaging uh lightning and swapping intoand out of lightning in the back endit's a little bit of leg work there andyou know they're they are earning a feeon doing that so just keep that in mindif you're using wallet to satoshinonetheless i'm going tocopy this invoice we'll jump back anduse moon wallet one more timei'm going to hit sendi'm going to paste the address that ijust copied and then i'm going to put ina specific amount i'm going to send20 us dollars here okayand i'll just call it wos for wallet ofsatoshi confirm no nowit does uhnote that there's going to be a networkfee and i can change that based on howmuch of a rush that i'm in uh given i'mdoing a tutorial and i want this to gothrough quickly i'll leave it up highhere i'm gonna go ahead and hit sendso that has gone off from moon walletsand if i swipe over to wallet of satoshiumbecause it's on chain it does take awhile to confirm every on-chain bitcointransaction on average takes about 10minutes to confirmif i go backi can alwayskind of swipe down to to refresh but itmay take some timefor this to show upgiven that it's on chain so we will jumpback into this wallet as soon as thattransaction is confirmed on the bitcoinblockchain now i just wanted to showthis it literally the moment i stoppedhitting record uh it showed force 46 898sats on the way okay now i can tap tapthat and it will detail it for me heythe size of the bitcoin miner fee chosenuh determines on how soon thetransaction will confirmblah blah the sender may have options toexpire the transaction basically it'sjust saying like hey a payment was sentit's not lightning and it once it'sconfirmed then it will be available inyour wallet to spend okay so that willchangeonce it's officially confirmed so againwe'll be back when that happens okay wecan now see that the on-chaintransaction has confirmed and we have anupdated balance with the incomingtransaction therelastly we want to try receivingthrough our final method which isa lightning address now i just want totalk a little bit about exactly whatthis is basically this is a publiclyshareableaddress that will allow youto receivelightning payments without having tocreate an invoicenow not every wallet currently supportsthis but wallet of satoshi does andwe're going to use another onecalled zebedee wallet it's alsocustodial however there arenon-custodial wallets that supportsending to lightning addresses as wellall right sobasically somebody could scan this qrcode hereorif you see fit you can share yourlightning address by copying and sendingit to whoever you like so we're going tojump over to zebedee and we're going totry sending to this particular lightningaddress now i will say that wallet issatoshi provides you with one it's arandomgenerated one at the moment this one isdrained bobcat 75 at wallet ofsatoshi.comhowever it appears that in the futurethey'll have a way of allowing you toclaim a particular lightning address atwallopssatoshi.com much like this otherwallet that we're going to seeso this is the zebedee wallet and reallyquickly all we're going to do is we'regoing to pay and we're going to pay ahundred satoshis we'll hit the paybutton and then it says to who are yousending it to they do have contacts andstuff like that that you can dobut i cansimplypaste inthataddress it will identify it and i cantap on it that's where i want to send ityepandthat's pretty much it we can add a noteto it if we see fituh i'll just say heyokay and we're just gonna payoff it goes and i already have thenotification hey you received a hundredsets so i'm gonna hit closeand we'll jump back over to wallet ofsatoshi hey 100 stats received we cansee an incoming right thereand added into our balance so again allyou really need to do is provide alightningaddress to an individual who has accessto be able to send to one and they cansimply send you sats without the needfor an invoice or anything like thatand that's a great feature to haveso let's take a look at the variety ofways in which you can send bitcoin fromwallet of satoshiso first off we're going to do a regularlightning invoice and we're going to dothis from moon wallet simply put i'mgoing to hit receive i'm going to chooselightning andwe're going to do an actual invoiceforohnot us dollars let's do it forsats and we'll do100 sets this creates an invoice for uswhich i can then copy if i were usingwallet of satoshi in front of somebodywith this invoice i could scan itand we'll see how in a momentso from wallet of satoshi it autodetects something on the clipboard allright i can use that and hit the buttonthere or i can hit send again this iswhere you would scan from here ifthere's a qr code in front of youotherwise i can paste from clipboardwhich i'll do here and again samefunction would have beenbrought to the front here had i justaccepted that notification hey there'ssomething in your clipboard you want touse iteither way we end up here 100 sats goingto thislightning invoice i'm going to pay itoff it goes and i see a notificationpopping up from moon wallet that it'sbeen acceptedsimilarly back in moon wallet i canreceive to a regular bitcoin address ifi see fit so just here i can copy thisaddress jump back to wallet of satoshiagain it says it's found something on myclipboard i'm going to use it this timesays hey you are sending to an on-chainbitcoin wallet how much would you liketo send now it does say that there is afixed fee sending to an on-chain bitcoinwallet so beware here becauseagain this is part of where wallet ofsatoshi makes some money all right uh sothey say here it's a fixed fee of 9 000sats now that can be i think they adjustthat depending on what the price ofbitcoin is but at the time recordingthis video that's about four dollars somake sure that your transactions thatyou're doinguh if you're sendingto an on-chain address uh are worth itin that context alright so if you'reconverting a large amount out oflightning and into uh or on chain thenperhaps that would be worth it but ifyou're just sending 10 dollars that maynot be worth it okayuh we'll swap it to dollars so it'seasier for me to figure out what i'mdoing here but againwith only twenty dollars in this ad inthis wallet i'm not necessarily going toactually eat that fee right now butlet's just take a look at what it wouldlook likeokayso uh here i type in my amount i hitdoneand then it says it's going to be anon-chain transactionthis ishow much the amount is for plus a fixedfee of 9000 sats so i can see here inthe context of this this transactionthat doesn't make sense i'm sending 10and it's gonna be a four dollar fee soagain maybe if you're sendinga couple hundred bucks or or you know afew hundred bucks that might make sensebut in this context it does not if iwanted to proceed with that i would hitpay i do not right now so i'm just goingto hit cancel therethe last example i want to give ofsending is sending to a lightningaddress much like we received to one sojust in my zevity wallet here i can tapon my profile and uh it shows you whatyour lightning address within zebedee isagain this is an example of a custom oneit's btc sessions at zbd.ggwallet of satoshi will enable somethinglike that in the future and how theyallow people to claim those will be upto them so we will we shall see how thatplays out but i can still tap on thisand copy that to the clipboard and theni can jump back to wallet of satoshinow itsays here that it saw something in myclipboard but regardless i'm going tohit send i'm going to hit the add buttonand this is where you can put in alightning address i can then paste inbtc sessions at zbd.gghit nextand how much would you like to send youcan adjustthat amount for whatever you want i'mgoing to send 100 sets and it also has amax send here depending on what theirchannels are looking like so and soforthyou can see the max right now is 45 000setsagain it just depends on the situationbut i'm gonna hit donethat looks all good to me i'm gonna hitokayoff it goes and i also notice i've got anotification for zebedee that i've got ahundred sats coming in and there'sactually a custom message attached to myzebedee account that will say you rockanytime somebodysends sats to itso there you have it that's how you dothe send out function from wallet ofsatoshiso all in all with wallet of satoshiit's obviously very simple to use interms of you download it and it's readyto goand you can access it on multipledevices with nothing more than an emailaddress however of course the trade-offis in that it is custodial and soyou know if you don't want the risk ofsomebody else holding your funds then itmay or may not be for you um of courseyou don't want to also put anything moreinto wallet of satoshi than you canafford to lose because you're trustingsomebody else with your funds umwhether or not it's worth it forindividuals for small amounts for me idon't mind using it obviously uh thereare also i will say um a few bonuses towallet of satoshi one is you can send toand receive from any bitcoin wallet soyou can receive from a lightning walletyou can receive from a regular bitcoinwallet you can receive um via lightningaddress you can also send to a regularbitcoin wallet a lightning bitcoinwallet invoice or not um or a lightningaddresshowever obviously we saw that if you'resending to an on-chain bitcoin walletthe fees are present and not to beignored in particular if you're usinglightning typically you think of usingthat for small amounts and so a largefee to send to an on-chain addressdoesn't exactly make sense unless you'redealing with larger amounts on lightningand you need to send to an on-chainaddress sotrade-offs obviously and we see in someof the examples there moon walletobviously you can do some of thosethings on chain and off chain are puttogether into a single unified balanceand moon is non-custodialthe main draw for me with things likewallet of satoshi and zebedee and othercustodial lightning wallets is theinclusion of lightning addresses thoseemail-looking addresses that can receivelightning transactionsin non-custodial wallets that isimpossible or i shouldn't say impossiblebut currently technologically very verydifficult to implement without runningsome sort of back end infrastructureyourself and so most people areexperiencing lightning addresses throughcustodial services like wall of satoshiand zebedeei think that's finebut again everybody exercise caution andmakedecisions based on your risk toleranceall in all while it is satoshi verysimple to use very easy onboarding andprobably not bad for small amountsthank you guys so much for watching asalways please do like subscribe shareall those things super
