That's not to say that Carter hasn't been selective with his image, or that the media hasn't been choice with his portrayal, his work often tailored for either a Bitcoin or crypto audience.Whatever the reason for the imbalance between reality and perception, it quickly corrected, Carter earning mockery in memes too scandalous to be reprinted here, a public dredging that only worsened with Carter's dismissive responses, which sometimes evoked his position as a venture capitalist.MORE FROMFORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesByAmy DaniseEditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansByAmy DaniseEditorHis crime? At a time when bitcoin's biggest champions – Jack Dorsey, Nayib Bukele, and Michael Saylor – are investing it all in the protocol, bearing down the might of their brands and nation in support, Carter was outed as against the party line in his equity investments, and his reaction to the protest was swift and emotional.In a missive Thursday, he wrote:\"It’s clear that there’s an awful sickness pervading the Bitcoin space. Most Bitcoiners are normal, good people. For the vast majority of them, there’s no lifestyle associated with owning Bitcoin, as it should be. But there’s a subset of people — a small, flailing, shrinking group — who are mostly new to Bitcoin, made Bitcoin their entire personality, and became completely emotionally invested in it.\"And continued:\"The moral basis of these people is cartoonish; it’s something that might appeal to a toddler. It’s a dreadful binary: every financial asset other than Bitcoin is a scam; every blockchain other than Bitcoin is a scam, and doomed to fail.\"In Carter's view, the problem is clear: \"Bitcoin Maximalism\" is the culprit. His solution? Reject the ideology in its entirety.What is Bitcoin Maximalism? At issue in the drama is, of course, a deeper narrative about the cultural war ongoing in the cryptocurrency industry, one in which a group of its advocates are increasingly convinced that bitcoin, alone among cryptocurrencies, is the invention of the sector.As Carter notes, the view of this group is that the broader cryptocurrency world is fraudulent, corrupt, an elaborate system propelled by greed in which new crypto assets are issued, pumped to insane prices, and sold to retail investors left holding a worthless bag.The so-called \"Bitcoin maximalists,\" in other words, reject the mainstream view that crypto assets are \"the future of investing,\" or that they are a \"new asset class.\"It's an audience Carter has courted with his content, willfully or not, clarifying even in his critical post that bitcoin is \"the only 'base layer asset I like\" as an investment, a stance that has made him a maximalist favorite.But in his quick effort to separate himself from the movement, Carter, unfortunately misses an opportunity to present it with any relevant critique. Most notably, there is the issue that Carter's essay spends its time objecting to behaviors easily related to any fanatic group that takes its aim at elites.Is the problem with Bitcoin Maximalism itself? Or only a fringe group of adherents? Is the problem with the movement’s ideas? Or its expression of them? Unclear.As such, Carter's argument inherently begins on uneven footing, his attempt akin to arguing for instance, that \"the Democratic party needs to reject the woke left.\" Where does one end and the other begin? How does one continue to exist without the other? Why is this argument being made only now?Still, in Carter's defense, there has been a lack of attempts to describe Bitcoin Maximalism, even those who subscribe to its tenets rejecting that it can be described.It's a point on which I disagree.Put simply, Bitcoin maximalists believe the following:Bitcoin, a computer science invention, is the world's first working non-state monetary system. All other crypto assets compete with bitcoin by virtue of their existence, none offer long-term advantages without trade-offs.Investing in other cryptocurrencies is [select one: wrong, stupid, immoral, uninteresting] and should be discouraged and ignored socially for the benefit of others as a form of consumer protection.Bitcoin is only limited by human ingenuity. Anything other cryptocurrencies can do can otherwise be achieved by either bitcoin (or a centralized financial alternative).Of course, you can argue against the above points, and Carter does so in his piece.Most notably, he uses the piece to make clear he thinks the crypto market provides evidence of demand for alternative crypto assets, arguing that to \"deny this is to deny reality.\" Which cryptos does Carter support and why? This again is unclear, as we're left only with the idea he does not think other blockchains are \"useless.\"\"Just look at the data. There’s over $100 billion of stablecoins on other blockchains. They are objectively useful,\" he writes, adding: \"They are used in real world transactions more than Bitcoin is.\"Unaddressed again is that Bitcoin Maximalism, by nature, rejects the entirety of the crypto market and its data, and deems that there is no value in its construction at all, being that it misrepresents, and indeed that it is incapable of adjudicating, issues of computer science.As for stablecoins, faced with the prospect of migrating the old regime (government currencies) to the crypto world, it’s true some Bitcoin Maximalists oppose the scheme, viewing it a new vehicle for what they are trying to replace. Others, however, are attempting to rebuild them on Bitcoin, in line with their ideals. Far from proof the ideology “isn’t fixed,” as Carter claims, it’s an affirmation of it.Still, while fine points on their own, worth debating in full, it's unfortunate they come amid a larger attempt by Carter to portray himself as more rational and data-based in his interpretations of the market.Unfortunately, this view arguably misses the point of modern Bitcoin Maximalism, misconstruing it as a technical or economic argument, when in reality it is a cultural movement almost entirely.Why Does Bitcoin Maximalism Exist? Indeed, the biggest problem with Carter's critique is that in demonizing Bitcoin maximalists he fails to understand what the Bitcoin Maximalism movement has achieved – a defined worldview in which any investor supporting the competition is seen as the villain.To understand why someone would support bitcoin only among cryptocurrencies, you have to understand that this person needs to reject the short-term incentive to do the opposite.It's not exactly a secret – it's very easy to start a cryptocurrency, crypto hedge fund, or crypto startup and make millions overnight, with limited expertise. Virtually no crime in the sector is prosecuted. Virtually no failure is not heaped with massive reward. The recent collapse of Terra’s LunaLUNA stablecoin from “blue chip crypto asset” to worthlessness is but the most prominent example.The mansions of Puerto Rico are filled with legacy \"cryptocurrency builders,\" who built nothing, lost investors money, and provided no valuable knowledge to the space.In this environment, why would you choose to build or support the continued growth of Bitcoin? Develop or extend Bitcoin's technology? Or build a Bitcoin service or company? Especially when it's profitable to externalize failure to retail investors?Moreover, why would you use bitcoin as money, when there are 30,000 other cryptos that may go boom or bust overnight, turning your dollars into millions for nothing?Bitcoin Maximalism has an inherent and valuable answer to all these questions. It asserts that it is immoral to do these things and it exerts a social penalty of ostracism and ridicule on those who would put their own interest and welfare above Bitcoin.As such, Carter is correct, it can and often does seem like Bitcoin maximalists are doing little more than applying an elaborate form of bullying to express their ideology.As Carter puts it eloquently, maximalists assert \"investing your time or effort anywhere other than Bitcoin is misallocation, malinvestment, grifting, or a scam.\"He's also right here, but in failing to understand why the ideology adopts the stance, his text is left searching for boogeymen.Time and again Carter's appeals to the idea that this stance can't be or isn't true, which again misses the point. To admit there is even one worthwhile crypto asset (though there may well be), is to undo the clarity of its moral structure, and the simplicity and accessibility of its message.Bitcoin Maximalism is Scaling Still, perhaps the most unfortunate characterization in the piece is the argument that Bitcoin Maximalism is a fringe, dying, or radical belief. To be clear, I identify as a maximalist and write for a Bitcoin-only company. This was not always the case.I was and am a journalist. I wrote about many cryptocurrencies. Unfortunately, like many Bitcoin Maximalists, I found the crypto market propelled by a system I could not support. Insiders got rich, retail got fleeced and a rogue's gallery of scammers remain at large. Efforts to police or self-regulate the industry have only ended up exacerbating this issue.Bitcoin Maximalism exists as an antithesis to this culture and as a reaction to it, and in failing to take this into account, Carter's attempt to eulogize it only strengthens its case, his piece offering no proposal for assimilating the values of its offering. And, make no mistake, the offering is strong.As evidence, one need only look at the culture's famous converts, most recently Dave Portnoy, who admitted he’s \"learned his lesson\" not to invest in any other crypto asset after telling his audience outright to invest in a prior crypto Ponzi scheme.If Portnoy doesn’t make clear the ideology’s everyman appeal, I’m not sure what will.That's not to say, I don't foresee a future, as Carter does, where there might be alignment between the bitcoin and cryptocurrency sectors, provided there is constructive work to unearth and align the underlying demands on either side.Indeed, many of the specific technical arguments Carter makes, I’ve questioned as well, and can report, they have documented answers and uncertainties worth discussion.But bitcoin users, it's clear, want bitcoin to have a special recognition within the sector – it is the only decentralized cryptocurrency and it is one of few to have monetized from zero in a free and fair market issuance. Bitcoin maximalists may be clamoring for securities regulators to enforce that demand, but it can be enforced in other ways.Bitcoin Maximalism also offers a way to safeguard retail investors from the obvious sham of the vast majority of the crypto market, encouraging them to hold their own money and to hold it in bitcoin, advice serving them well as the industry's stablecoins and institutional lenders collapse spectacularly.Other than applying regulatory protections or advising retail investors to simply ignore the crypto sector in its entirety (which is what Bitcoin Maximalism does), what is Carter's solution to this issue? Again, his only appeal is to the strength of intellect – hardly a scalable solution, laudable as his own intellect is.As I hope is clear, the intent of this essay is not to single out Carter in holding his view. For those sympathetic to the entrepreneurial spirit and who believe there are real problems bitcoin cannot solve, Bitcoin Maximalism can be an unfriendly worldview.Yet, in attempting to overturn or subvert it, one must recognize what Bitcoin Maximalism offers, and that is, above all, an easy message of clarity and affirmation – that a monetary system that rewards savers is materially different from the Wall Street casinos, a culture that the crypto sector has only succeeded in co-opting.In sum, Bitcoin Maximalism remains a strong and coherent cultural worldview, despite Carter's antagonism of it, and it will remain an accessible one – supported by simplified storytelling and high-profile converts.Unhappy with the powers that be? Withdraw your money from the financial system. Hold bitcoin. Want to right the inequities of the world? Build on the Bitcoin network, expand its access and offer a fair alternative that benefits all. Want to build a valuable business or company? Do it on Bitcoin and all users gain equally.Sorry, in the face of a fly-by-night crypto industry whose only goal, it seems, is to recreate the worst of Wall Street, I'll take my chances with the Bitcoin maximalists upset by the status quo.Follow me on Twitter. Pete RizzoEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions",
