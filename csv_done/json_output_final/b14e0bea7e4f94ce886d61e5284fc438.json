mysterious metal boxright here[Music]Farms Produce a lot of waste and thatbox right here can turn that waste intodigital goldYes you heard it right let's find outmore[Music]the Irish government is targeting a 25decrease in greenhouse gas emissions by2030. that's a pretty tall order but oneof the best ways to lower emissions isto invest in renewable energy sourceshowever Ireland has a unique problemover 35 percent of its greenhouse gasemissions come from the agriculturalsector and a majority of those emissionscome from you guessed itcowsthis is a serious problem because inIreland there are about 1 million MoreCows than there are people there are 7.3million cows in Ireland Unfortunatelythey create a lot of wastecows like the Kerry cattle are one ofthe oldest breeds in Europe Dairyfarming is a pivotal part of Ireland'sculture history and economy but thefuture of Irish farming is not so brightmany farmers say that meeting targetscould drive them into bankruptcy withthe head of the Irish Creamery milksuppliers Association Pat McCormackwarning that farmers could have to Culltheir livestockif Ireland was to bring their greenhousegas emissions to Target right now theywould have to curl 1.3 million cattleluckily a group of young Irishentrepreneurs think they might havefound a rather unusual solution Bitcoinminingnestled on the cusp of Amar County liesa typical Irish Farm tended to by a manwho is perhaps ahead of his timeTom Campbell is the first Irish farmerto mine Bitcoin there might haveelectricity Bitcoin requires as acontentious subject but is coming purelyfrom renewable sources here it doessound like a lot of our largestadvantageous thing to turn grass intoBitcoin but there is a way to do itfarmers are increasingly pressured bythe Irish government to reduce emissionsto reach the country's greenhouse gasemission goals in some cases these goalshave driven Farms to bankruptcythe farmer Tom Campbell Bitcoin miningwas an interesting option to pay offInvestments he was obliged to makeBitcoin option here for consumingelectricity on-site rather than justexporting it it was an exercise intrying to beat the grid price thatyou've been paid for export and it givesus another market for the electricityand it's just a form of world stories Isuppose on the farmhe produces renewable energy on his farmusing a special method called anaerobicdigestionanaerobic digestion is a method wheremicroorganisms break down biodegradablematerial to a point where it createsmethane gas which can be used to produceelectricity it's actually quite similarto a cow digesting grass and farting outinto the world but instead that fart iscaptured and used to create electricityin a purely renewable way on averageTom's Farm produces an electrical outputof 500 kilowatts but can scale up to 700kilowattsthat's the equivalent of powering nearly12 000 households41 of Ireland's Farms installedanaerobic digesters they could produceenough electricity for every single homein Ireland or by using environmentallyfriendly and renewable biogas we collectour crops from the fields during thesummer months put them on our salesclamps in the yard and then every day wefill our feed Hopper here and that seedhover every hour feeds thempredetermined about 24 hours a day andpredetermined the ride to dine into ourdigester the digester takes it and mixesit in this slurry as we feed them in itdigests it and produces biogas which isabout 50 to 53 percent we run that themedian through the engines that rungenerators and we export our electricityto the grid anything we don't export tothe grid we use it for mining Bitcoinyou might be wondering why farmer Tomdoesn't export every kilowatt ofelectricity to the gridthe answer is simple the grid doesn'tactually need all that energybut Tom can't let the excess energy he'screated go to waste and so voila Bitcoinminingwhen grid demand is low miners step into scoop up the excess clean energyso when the price from the grid is verylow it makes more sense to mine Bitcoinwhen it's very very high we sell theelectricity to the grid as you renewablework trustee yep you keep your coffershappy and obviously the grid is happythat they're getting this green energytoo yep absolutely that's it yeah nobrainer I mean yeah switch on when youcan right yeah yeah should we switch itback on now I think so okay thisparticular mine is actually running 247. a constant stream of biogas generatesa constant supply of energy and becausethe digester can be fed all the timethere's no downtime on this energysourceit's always up and farting sorry runningthe brains behind the mining operationare a young team of Irish entrepreneurswho specialize in using stranded oruntapped energy to mine Bitcoinso we looked at a number of energysources you know wind and solar were thefirst ones that appeared to us butinevitably we realized that in order toget a better higher uptime source ofenergy we needed to delve a bit deeperand we ultimately came across anaerobicdigestion and what we came across isthat a lot of instances they have anexport capacity of x amount they canproduce more but previously they had noFinancial incentive to do so as if theycan only export X amounts why would theyproduce more and so I realized that ifwe come up with a containerized solutionwe can basically offer them a constantoffered buyer of electricity so we'remaking use of their stranded energy andthey're getting a buyer for their spareelectricity so it's a match made inheaven for both of usnow some of you may ask why Bitcoin whynot house something else like a datacenter for Amazon web servicesyou know farmers are pretty independentindividuals anyway and they like to bein control of everything that's going onin their own firms and so in thisinstancethis primer in particular has completecustody over his own Bitcoin the Bitcoinis going into whatever wallet he or shewants to use on any given week or amonth and they're completely in controlof that Bitcoin and so also if they wantto shut this thing off and do somemaintenance and do whatever they want todo they're not asking another individuallike sorry AWS or whatever elseequipment servers into the unit likethis they're in control of their own A6their control of their own Bitcoin ittakes approximately two and a halfmonths to mine one Bitcoin on this sitewhich is a lot considering there areonly 35 machines consuming purely excessenergyand Tom Campbell who has a deepunderstanding of how Bitcoin works iswhat's known in the space as a Bitcoinmaximalistwhen we looked at the Bitcoin as opposedto watch other coins to mine we feltBitcoin was the purest crypto rightthere it's not contaminated by outsideinferences it's it's on a network thatneeds a lot of consensus sowe thought that's the one we were up for[Music]yeahobviously this particular project is amatch made in heaven it's a win-win forboth sides of the operationStuart Hosford is an economist and thefounder of Skilling digital mining thecompany that runs the mining operationon Tom's FarmI asked him can other Farms do the samein Ireland and start mining Bitcoin toocan they replicate this conceptuh yeah I hope so you know I hope sothere's 135 000 farms in Ireland youknow people talk about circular economyJoe I you know I hear this term all thetime and I'm a big fan of it right buthere is the circular here's a perfectexample of a circular economyyou grow cattlethey provide food dairy products beefthey create waste the waste getsharnessed it gets turned intoelectricity which provides energy to ourgrid any excess energy can be used tomine Bitcoin which secures a reallyimportant monetary Network and out ofthe anaerobic digester comes a digestatewhich is you knowan awesome fertilizer that can be thenused to spread back on the land this isthe circular economy working the futureof Bitcoin mining in Ireland could bebright bright orange even although it'sset against a backdrop of a Europeanenergy crisis if the idea of usinguntapped and renewable energy sources tomine Bitcoin spreads across the countryand even the globe we all might belooking at a brighter futurenonetheless there's still a huge amountof criticism and a lack of understandingsurrounding Bitcoin mining Regulatorswant to ban Bitcoin mining's mechanismcalled proof of work and this cloud ofuncertainty could remain at least forthe near term in this case you knowBitcoin mining could be the Catalyst forthe rollout of small scale analog withdigestion across Ireland which isobviously a positive contribution sojust focusing on you know x amount thatBitcoin uses and not realizing that alot of that usage could be a net benefitto the environment it's quite a narrowmind of the process to have[Music]you know it's quite bizarre to us that alot of people don't even know what we'redoing in Ireland yes we're kind ofoperating under the radar but people aresolely but surely seeing what we'redoing and becoming quite interestedwhether it be Farmers themselves whetherit be wind and solar guys it's just acase of educating people on Bitcoinmining and showing them that it's hereto stay ultimately it's a reallyInnovative Energy Solution that peoplewill Implement over the course of thenext couple of years we start thinkingabout as an energy source not onlygenerating energy but also generatingeconomic value and and therefore youknow turn it turn it into a positive andthen you know things change right it'sthat perception is that perception rightit's sub-perceptionas the sun sets over this beautifulIrish CountrysideI am hopefulabout the future of Bitcointhese guys are doing somethingpeaceful productive yet boldthey're turning cow Patinto digital goldI mean thisthisrenewable green grassthis could be the future of Bitcoinmining[Music][Music]thank you",
