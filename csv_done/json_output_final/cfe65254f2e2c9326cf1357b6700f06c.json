it workswith all of my favorite wallets a ton ofthem that i'm going to mention heretoday in fact all of them that i'm goingto mention here today it works with it'salso really badass in a multi-sig setuphighly recommend youupgrade to the bitcoin only firmware anduh yeah check it out links are downbelow and finally if you're backing upany important bitcoin wallet includingall the ones we're going to talk abouttoday then you may want to considergetting that into solid steel ratherthan paper paper comes with the usualtrade-offs fire damage water damage i'veheard horror stories of people justdiscarding it accidentally because it'sa slip of paper lying around sogive yourself some peace of mind as ihave and grab yourself a bill followover at privacypros.ioand with that let's dive into the listfirst up on our list is blue wallet nowthis does have a mobile version buttheir desktop version is equally awesomein fact it functions basically the sameyou can have single signature hotwallets you this is the only entry onthe list that allows you to use alightning wallet either via theircustodial easyinstant option or you can connect toyour own node and utilize your ownliquidity that way you can also dohardware wallets they do supportbasically any air gap option cold cardkeystone foundation you can do watchonly wallets stuff like thatthey also have their vault option whereyou can create a multi-sig vault whichis awesome to have on both mobile anddesktop which you can also sync as wellyou can have wallets the same wallets onboth uh they have all the kind of feebumping and manipulation that you maywant to do so replace by fee child paysfor parent transaction cancellation soyou can use rbf to send it back toyourself if there's not been aconfirmation on your transactions yetand then your general fee control theslow medium fast and manual sats perbyte you can dothey also have transaction batching soyou can send to multiple recipients atthe same time they have coin control uhthey have node connectivity you canconnect to your own bitcoin node and ofcourse as are all of the options in thislist it is open sourcei've got to say for simplicity's sakefront facing while packing in all ofthese featuresthis is one of the uh ones that reallystands out in this list and i do use itregularly primarilyon mobile but i do jump on desktop afair amount as well so definitely wortha look if you're not already using it ifyou want to check out the features againif you scroll down here it's just neverending they've got so much stuff packedinto this and they have been workingreally hard to keep on adding morewasabi wallet is a wallet for desktoponly which i've been using for quitesome time now and this is typically theway that i interact with a lot of myhardware but nonetheless you can haveyour own hot wallets on this and i douse thatfairly often as wellthey support basically every hardwarewallet that you would want to useanything with a bitcoin only option youcan basically use here and if you goback and you look at my uh top hardwarewallets of this yearevery single one of them is going to beusable with a wasabi wallet now uh theyobviously have the typicalfee stuff you know replaced by fee allof that great stuff is baked in here aswell you can do your utxo managementyou're labeling all of that which isincredibly useful uh and the big thinghere is that they have a baked incoin join okay so you can uh usecoinjoin to improve the privacy of yourbitcoin stack via wasabi wall which i'vebeen doing for quite some time as welluhi want you to keep an eye out because2.0 version 2.0 of wasabi wallet will becoming down the line right now toutilize coinjoin it's a pretty highthreshold around 0.1 bitcoin to enter around which is you know let's not lieit's it's out of the price point of alot of people however coming down thepipeline wasabi 2.0 will enableall sizes of utxo so that thresholdbasically gets eviscerated there and uhandregular plebs can enjoy coinjoin viawasabi if they so choose they'll alsohave a new user interface so as soon asthat drops i will be doing a a fullvideo on it but even as is wasabi is amainstay of my desktop options forbitcoin walletsspecter wallet is another great entry onthis list it has all of the bells andwhistles that you could want of coursehot wallets cold wallets baked inmultisig for this kind of like you woulddo with blue wallet but uh a little bitmore granular you can add differentsigning devices and put them together indifferent iterations to create differentmulti-sig wallets so they separate outyour devices and or your keys and yourwallets uh they have node connectivityand with spectre wallet it is mandatoryso you must be connected to your ownnode to utilize spectre whether that bejust a copy of bitcoin core on yourcomputer or whether that be connected toright to a remote nodeyou must connectto your own bitcoin node and that doesdrive good habits so i am a fan of thati think that's a good thing to haveof course utxo management feed featuresall that kind of stuff it's all baked inhere and uh yeah great great job fromspectre and i continue to see someawesome improvements and iterations onspectre as it continues to be used by alot of bitcoinersnunchuck is a new entry on this list andi have previously done a video on it uhprobably more than a year ago but irecentlyredid a new video on nunchuck because ofsome of the awesome features they'veadded since then of course they've gotyour standard fare you've got hotwallets cold wallets multi-sig when itcomes to cold wallets oh i shouldmention that by the way this isavailable on both desktop and on yourphone on your mobile phone and you cansync accountscross-platform okay so you can sync youraccounts from device to devicein terms of the desktop option thoughthey basically support every singlehardware wallet except at the time ofthis video foundation passport but ibelieve that's nottoo far out so maybe by the time you'rewatching this it will already besupported but basically anything bitcoinonly you're gonna probably be able touse it with nunchuck now of course youcan add devices add wallets you cancreate multi-sig wallets as with spectrein whatever iteration you see fit umthe interesting thing with multisig hereis they've also added collaborativemultisig meaning that you cancollaborate on a wallet with multipledifferent partiesand you can do it through a baked inencrypted messenger that is native tonunchuck wallet and this we haven'treally seen anywhere else it's a reallyawesome feature and it really helps ifperhaps you're part of a business andyou need multiple people to sign off ontransactions you don't want that powerjust in the hands of one person this isa great way to do itof course they have node connectivityand all the bells and whistles that youwould want elsewhere but nunchuck isdefinitelya welcome addition to this list and ireally look forward to seeing what theyhave in store nextthe last entry on my top five bitcoinwallets for desktop is sparrow walletand i wanted to put this one lastbecause these guys have been absolutelyknocking it out of the park lately theykind of came out of nowhere and they'vejust gotjust everything you can imagine againyou can do hot wallets and generate themin the wallet itself you can do coldwallets you can attachanyany bitcoin hardware wallet that youdesire here super easy veryinteroperable and constantly working tobe compatible as much as possibleumcoin join baked directly in so they havea whirlpool baked into this which meansthat your threshold for coin joints interms of size uh can vary depending onwhat you're trying to do but they haveas low as i believe a hundred thousandsats currently so um accessible clubaccessible with that uh you can alsocoin join directly to cold storage or awatch only address that you've createdin sparrow so you can have a coupledifferent wallets open one being a hotwallet doing coin join and a second onebeing a cold wallet which is notcurrently connected it would just belike a watch only and after a certainnumber of coin join rounds it will mixdirectly into your cold storage deviceso that's a pretty awesome thing to haveof course they have labeling they have avery very detailed transaction viewer soeven on the screen here you can see itshows um what coins you're pulling fromwhat the labels are who knows you havethose coins it shows where those coinsare going and any privacy implicationsthat may be present as you send them soreally awesome uhgreat feature for those that are privacyconsciousagain i can't say enough here uh it justhas everything that uh you love and wantfrom an advanced bitcoin wallet um itmay look a little scary at first just uhon its face buti believe me the some of the featureshere are are much needed and putting inthe time to learn and get familiar withsparrow is well worth it so again hatsoff to sparrow and hats off to everybodyelse on this listso there you have it that was my list ofthe top five bitcoin wallets for desktopthis year now i will say that not everysingle wallet has every feature that iwant and need to use but that's why iuse a variety of them and i will saythatall of these wallets have been workingsuper hard toadd a ton of different features all inone place and i'm getting happier andhappier with the selection of goodquality bitcoin wallets available toeveryone on the market nownow what would my perfect bitcoin walletlook like well um it's kind of a mix ofall the stuff that's available here buti'm gonna justrattle off my wish list right here so ofcourse hot wallets cold walletsmulti-sigcollaborative multi-sig maybe somepeople are looking at nunchuck thinkinghey maybe we'll do that toouh just cross the board hardware supportfor any goodbitcoin only hardware option uh coinjoinbaked inutxo management and labelinglightning in anon-custodial fashionand if i'm getting really ambitiousbecause none of these wallets had thesetwo things i would love to see moreinteroperability and options to playwith a liquidliquid networkfor those confidential transactions andswapping the to and from i would alsoand this could be a ways off i'm gettingpretty ambitious here i'd also love toseesome integrations with options of statechains like mercury walletnow i know this is a pretty new conceptit has to be fleshed out a lotbutanother privacy preserving technique sothat could be awesome to see integratedbut i mean if to haveaccess to both on-chain and lightningbitcoin as well as liquid network andstate chainsand coin joinall in onewould be insanesoi i don't know if that will happen idon't know when it could be quite a waysoff but who knows maybe one day i'll besitting here making a video saying
