This is a very widespread beliefin our society. It's the kind of belief systemof people who say \"I don't believe in God,I believe in science.\" It's a belief systemwhich has now been spread to the entire world.But there's a conflict in the heart of sciencebetween science as a method of inquiry basedon reason, evidence, hypothesis and collectiveinvestigation, and science as a belief systemor a world view. And unfortunately the worldview aspect of science has come to inhibitand constrict the free inquiry which is thevery lifeblood of the scientific endeavour.Since the late nineteenth century, sciencehas been conducted under the aspect of a beliefsystem or a world view which is essentiallythat of materialism; philosophical materialism.And the sciences are now wholly owned subsidiariesof the materialist world view. I think thatas we break out of it, the sciences will beregenerated. What I do in my book The ScienceDelusion, which is called Science Set Freein the United States, is take the ten dogmas,or assumptions of science, and turn them intoquestions. Seeing how well they stand up ifyou look at them scientifically. None of themstand up very well.What I'm going to do is first run throughwhat these ten dogmas are. And then I'll onlyhave time to discuss one or two of them ina bit more detail. But essentially the tendogmas, which are the world view of most educatedpeople all over the world are:First, that nature's mechanical or machine-like.The universe is like a machine, animals andplants are like machines, we're like machines.In fact, we are machines. We are lumberingrobots, in Richard Dawkins' vivid phrase.With brains that are genetically programmedcomputers.Second, matter is unconscious. The whole universeis made up of unconscious matter. There'sno consciousness in stars, in galaxies, inplanets, in animals, in plants, and thereought not in any of us either, if this theory'strue. So a lot of the philosophy of mind overthe last hundred years has been trying toprove that we're not really conscious at all.So the matter's unconscious, then the lawsof nature are fixed.This is dogma three. The laws of nature arethe same now as they were at the time of thebig bang and they'll be the same forever.Not just the laws; but the constants of natureare fixed, which is why they are called constants.Dogma four: The total amount of matter andenergy is always the same. It never changesin total quantity, except at the moment ofthe big bang when it all sprang into existencefrom nowhere in a single instant.The fifth dogma is that nature's purposeless.There are no purposes in all nature and theevolutionary process has no purpose or direction.Dogma six, the biological hereditary is material.Everything you inheret is in your genes, orin epigenetic modifications of the genes,or in cytoplasmic inheritance. It's material.Dogma seven, memories are stored inside yourbrain as material traces. Somehow everythingyou remember is in your brain in modifiednerve endings, phosphorylated proteins, no-oneknows how it works. But nevertheless almosteveryone in the scientific world believesit must be in the brain.Dogma eight, your mind is inside your head.All your consciousness is the activity ofyour brain, nothing more.Dogma nine, which follows from dogma eight,psychic phenomena like telepathy are impossible.Your thoughts and intentions cannot have anyeffect at a distance because your mind's insideyour head. Therefore all the apparent evidencefor telepathy and other psychic phenomenais illusory. People believe these things happen,but it's just because they don't know enoughabout statistics, or they're deceived by coincidences,or it's wishful thinking.And dogma ten, mechanistic medicine is theonly kind that really works. That's why governmentsonly fund research into mechanistic medicineand ignore complementary and alternative therapies.Those can't possibly really work because they'renot mechanistic. They may appear to work becausepeople would have got better anyway, or becauseof the placebo effect. But the only kind thatreally works is mechanistic medicine.Wellthis is the default world view which is heldby almost all educated people all over theworld. It's the basis of the educational system,the national health service, the medical researchcouncil, governments and it's just the defaultworld view of educated people. But I thinkevery one of these dogmas is very, very questionable.And when you look at it, they fall apart.I'mgoing to take first the idea that the lawsof nature are fixed. This is a hangover froman older world view, before the 1960s, whenthe big bang theory came in. People thoughtthat the whole universe was eternal, governedby eternal mathematical laws. When the bigbang came in, then that assumption continued,even though the big bang revealed a universethat's radically evolutionary, about fourteenbillion years old. Growing and developingand evolving, for fourteen billion years.Growing and cooling and more structures andpatterns appear within it. But the idea isall the laws of nature were completely fixedat the moment of the big bang like a cosmicNapoleonic code. As my friend Terrence McKennaused to say, modern science is based uponthe principle \"give us one free miracle, andwe'll explain the rest\". And the one freemiracle is the appearance of all the matterand energy in the universe and all the lawsthat govern it, from nothing, in a singleinstant.Well, in an evolutionary universe, why shouldn'tthe laws themselves evolve? After all, humanlaws do, and the idea of laws of nature isbased a metaphor with human laws. It's a veryanthropocentric metaphor; only humans havelaws. In fact, only civilised societies havelaws. As C.S. Lewis once said, to say thata stone falls to earth because it's obeyinga law makes it a man, and even a citizen.It's a metaphor we've got so used to we forgotit's a metaphor. In an evolving universe,I think a much better idea is the idea ofhabits. I think the habits of nature evolve;the regularities of nature are essentiallyhabitual. This was an idea put forward atthe beginning of the twentieth century bythe American philosopher C.S. Pierce, andit's an idea which various other philosophershave entertained, and it's one which I, myselfhave developed into a scientific hypothesis;the hypothesis of morphic resonance, whichis the basis of these evolving habits. Accordingto this hypothesis, everything in nature hasa kind of collective memory, resonance occurson the basis of similarity.As a young giraffe embryo grows in its mother'swomb, it tunes in to the morphic resonanceof previous giraffes. It draws on that collectivememory, grows like a giraffe, and it behaveslike a giraffe, because it's drawing on thiscollective memory. It has to have the rightgenes to make the right proteins. But genesin my view are grossly overrated. They onlyaccount for the proteins that the organismcan make, not the form or the shape or thebehaviour. Every species has a kind of collectivememory. Even crystals do. This theory predictsthat if you make a new kind of crystal forthe first time, the very first time you makeit, it won't have an existing habit. But onceit crystallises, then the next time you makeit, there'll be an influence from the firstcrystals to the second ones, all over theworld by morphic resonance, it'll crystallisea bit easier. The third time, there'll bean influence from the first and second crystals.There is, in fact, good evidence that newcompounds get easier to crystallise all roundthe world, just as this theory would predict.It also predicts that if you train animalsto learn a new trick, for example rats learna new trick in London, then all round theworld rats of the same breed should learnthe same trick quicker just because the ratshad learned it here. And surprisingly, there'salready evidence that this actually happens.Anyway, that's my own hypothesis in a nutshellof morphic resonance. Everything depends onevolving habits not on fixed laws.But I want to spend a few moments on the constantsof nature too. Because these are, again, assumedto be constant. Things like the gravitationalconstant of the speed of light are calledthe fundamental constants. Are they reallyconstant? Well, when I got interested in thisquestion, I tried to find out. They're givenin physics handbooks. Handbooks of physicslist the existing fundamental constants, tellyou their value. But I wanted to see if they'dchanged, so I got the old volumes of physicalhandbooks. I went to the patent office libraryhere in London - they're the only place Icould find that kept the old volumes. Normallypeople throw them away when the new values(volumes) come out, they throw away the oldones. When I did this I found that the speedof light dropped between nineteen twenty-eightand nineteen fourty-five by about twenty kilometresper second. It's a huge drop because they'regiven with errors of any fractions of a second/decimalpoints of error. And yet, all over the world,it dropped, and they were all getting verysimilar values to each other with tiny errors.Then in nineteen fourty-eight, it went upagain. And then people started getting verysimilar values again. I was very intriguedby this and I couldn't make sense of it, soI went to see the head of metrology at theNational Physical Laboratory in Teddington.Metrology is the science in which people measureconstants.And I asked him about this, I said \"what doyou make of this drop in the speed of lightbetween nineteen twenty-eight and nineteenfourty-five?\"And he said \"oh dear\", he said \"you've uncoveredthe most embarrassing episode in the historyof our science.\"So I said \"well, could the speed of lighthave actually dropped? And that would haveamazing implications if so.\"He said \"no, no, of course it couldn't haveactually dropped. It's a constant!\"\"Oh, well then how do you explain the factthat everyone was finding it going much slowerduring that period? Is it because they werefudging their results to get what they thoughtother people should be getting and the wholething was just produced in the minds of physicists?\"\"We don't like to use the word 'fudge'.\"I said \"Well, so what do you prefer?\"He said \"well, we prefer to call it 'intellectualphase-locking'.\"So I said \"well if it was going on then, howcan you be so sure it's not going on today?And the present values produced are by intellectualphase-locking?\"And he said \"oh we know that's not the case.\"And I said \"how do we know?\"He said \"well\", he said \"we've solved theproblem.\"And I said \"well how?\"And he said \"well we fixed the speed of lightby definition in nineteen seventy-two.\"So I said \"but it might still change.\"He said \"yes, but we'd never know it, becausewe've defined the metre in terms of the speedof light, so the units would change with it!\"So he looked very pleased about that, they'dfixed that problem.But I said \"well, then what about big G?\"The gravitational constant, known in the tradeas \"big G\", it was written with a capitalG. Newton's universal gravitational constant.\"That's varied by more than 1.3% in recentyears. And it seems to vary from place toplace and from time to time.\"And he said \"oh well, those are just errors.And unfortunately there are quite big errorswith big G.\"So I said \"well, what if it's really changing?I mean, perhaps it is really changing.\"And then I looked at how they do it, whathappens is they measure it in different labs,they get different values on different days,and then they average them. And then otherlabs around the world do the same, they comeout usually with a rather different average.And then the international committee of metrologymeets every ten years or so and average theones from labs all around the world to comeup with the value of big G. But what if Gwere actually fluctuating? What if it changed?There's already evidence actually that itchanges throughout the day and througout theyear. What if the earth, as it moves throughthe galactic environment went through patchesof dark matter or other environmental factorsthat could alter it? Maybe they all changetogether. What if these errors are going uptogether and down together? For more thanten years I've been trying to persuade metrologiststo look at the raw data. In fact I'm now tryingto persuade them to put it up online, on theinternet. With the dates, and the actual measurements,and see if they're correlated. To see if they'reall up at one time, all down at another. Ifso, they might be fluctuating together. Andwhat would tell us something very, very interesting.But no-one has done this, they haven't doneit because G is a constant. There's no pointlooking for changes. You see, here's a verysimple example of where a dogmatic assumptionactually inhibits enquiry. I, myself thinkthat the constants may vary quite considerably.Well, within narrow limits. But they may allbe varying, and I think the day will comewhen scientific journals like Nature havea weekly report on the constants, like stock-marketreports in the newspapers. You know, \"thisweek, big G was slightly up, the charge onthe electron was down, the speed of lightheld steady, and so on.\"So that's one area where I think thinkingthis dogmatically could open things up.One of the biggest areas is the nature ofthe mind. This is the most unsolved problemas Graham just said, that science simply can'tdeal with the fact we're conscious.And it can't deal with the fact that our thoughtsdon't seem to be inside our brains. Our experiencesdon't all seem to be inside our brain. Yourimage of me now doesn't seem to be insideyour brain, yet the official view is thatthere's a little Rupert somewhere inside yourhead. And everything else in this room isinside your head; your experience is insideyour brain. I'm suggesting actually that visioninvolves an outward projection of images,what you're seeing is inside your mind butnot inside your head. Our minds are extendedbeyond our brains in the simplest act of perception.I think that we project out the images we'reseeing, and these images touch what we'relooking at. If I look at you from behind,you don't know I'm there. Could I affect you?Could you feel my gaze? There's a great dealof evidence that people can. The sense ofbeing stared at is an extremely common experience,and recent experimental evidence actuallysuggests it's real.Animals seem to have it too, I think it probablyevolved in the context of predator/prey relationships.Prey animals that could feel the gaze of apredator would survive better than those thatcouldn't. This would lead to a whole new wayof thinking about ecological relationshipsbetween predators and prey.Also about the extent of our minds. If welook at distant stars, I think our minds reachout in a sense to touch those stars, and literallyextend out over astronomical distances. They'renot just inside our heads. Now it may seemastonishing that this is a topic of debatein the twenty-first century. We know so littleabout our own minds that where our imagesare is a hot topic of debate within consciousnessstudies right now.I don't have time to deal with any more ofthese dogmas, but every single one of themis questionable. If one questions it, newforms of research, new possibilities openup. And I think as we question these dogmasthat have held back science so long, sciencewill undergo a reflowering, a renaissance.I'm a total believer in the importance ofscience. I've spent my whole life as a researchscientist, my whole career. But I think bymoving beyond these dogmas, it can be regenerated.Once again, it can become interesting, andI hope, life-affirming.Thank you.",
