How or when will it start?What will be 'the last straw that breaks the camel'sback' for hyperbitcoinization on a global scale?How do you foresee governments responding to it?[ANDREAS] How many people here have heard of,or understand, the term \"hyperbitcoinization\"?Not enough, great. Let me let me start by clarifying.\"Hyperbitcoinization\" is this idea of a tipping point...at which the sustainability of a fiat economy, especiallyin the presence of a vibrant cryptocurrency economy,is no longer there and people abandon traditional fiat [currency] in droves.Where there will be a mass conversion over to Bitcoin.To me, that is a maximalist position that is more or lessa fiction. I do not believe we will have a moment when...Bitcoin will become the dominant replacementfor all fiat, I don't believe that will ever happen.In fact, if it was happening, then we would have a full-on currency war in our hands,and we do not want to engage in thatwith nation states that have armed thugs.That is not [good for] your personal safety.All of you people who are driving around in Lamborghinis with bitcoin license plates...[Laughter] You will be the first ones to go.But then again, I don't think hyperbitcoinizationwill happen, certainly not on a global level.There might be tipping points where certain countriessuffering from irreversible currency crisis and collapse,that cannot establish pegs to [other] currencies like theU.S. dollar or afford to launch a new paper currency...The cost of printing paper currenciesis in the tens of millions of dollars.Very often, the countries having these collapses realizethat they can't even afford to print the new currency.That becomes a gating problem. We have seen thatin Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Brazil, and a few other places.The cost of printing exceeded the resources the government had.It turns out that is the cure for inflation: run out of money to print [more] money. [Laughter]In some countries, as a last resort, you will see peoplechoosing to conduct the majority of their business...in cryptocurrency because it is the best, mostportable and accessible alternative out there.I think we will see that happen on a local basis,not in a massive global tipping point where...everybody is fleeing for the exit.At least, I hope it doesn't. That is an apocalyptic scenariowhich will disrupt the world economy so badly.We don't want that. Nobody should hope that the world economy collapses just so...everybody can see the truth about Bitcoin.That is cutting off your nose to spite your face.\"Oh great, now we all have bitcoin!\" \"Yeah!\"Also, we will belong to marauding bands of Mad Maxpersonalities, fighting for scraps of food. [Laughter]\"But hey, we have Bitcoin! Awesome!\"\"See? I was right!\" you say, as you gun down...a person who is trying to take the pieceof bread out of your mouth. [Laughter]Yeah, let's not do that.I don't believe in hyperbitcoinization.I would hope we see a much more orderly transitionto a pluralistic world where people have many choices,and their freedom has increased,without first hitting rock-bottom.",
