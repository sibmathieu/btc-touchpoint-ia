  "text": "wasabi walletunfairly privatethe liquid network is a side chain ofbitcoin that allows users to capitalizeonfaster block times one minute to bespecificlower transaction fees and confidentialtransactionswhich shield both the amount and theasset that you are dealing withnow this of course comes with trade-offsin terms of trustbut users can weigh and decide what isbest for them today we're going to betaking a look at how touse the liquid network primarily withblockstream's green wallet but also witha handful of other apps to obtainliquid bitcoin and to transactpeer-to-peer and we're going to take alookin general how you might interact withgreen wallet and or liquid networki am ben with the btc sessions and thisis your daily sessionnow i wanted to briefly touch on alittle bit about thosetrade-offs in regards to bitcoin sowith the liquid network being a sidechain of bitcoin effectivelybitcoin is locked up on a one-to-onebasis in a federation and thisfederation consists of a bunch ofdifferent entities a lot of largeexchangesbut it's in a multi-sig and you wouldeffectively needa large majority of these entitiesthat are part of this multi-sig tocollude against youto break that one-to-one peg you can runa liquid nodeto verify and enforce the rule set ofthe liquid networkum and there there's a lot of kind ofgray area in therei would say this puts liquid networksomewhere not nearly as good asself-custody but not nearly as bad asleaving with a single custodian on anexchange it is somewherein between and it's up to users todecideif that trade-off works for them formyselfpersonally i'm treating this currentlyas a way to potentially have a smallamount of bitcoin and be able to utilizecheaper transaction fees to and fromwellalso even though i'm not touching on onit in this videoutilize something like a hardware walletto better securemy funds even though there are thosetrust trade-offs hereso let's dive in we're not going to gettoo much into semanticsby the way i do have an interview i didwith samson mao from blockstreamwhere we did kind of a deep dive on howthe liquid network functions and uh itit's a little bit older i'll probably doa new one soon but if you want to diveinto that i will have that in the shownotes as well but for nowlet's take a look at how this thingworksjust a quick shout out to sponsors ofthe show ledden.io this is where you canuse your bitcoin for a variety ofdifferent servicesof course they have their bitcoin backloans which is kind of the mainthing that i like using here i've usedit on a handful of instanceswhere i needed dollars in my bankaccount but i didn't want to sell mybitcoin becausethat's of course a taxable event and iwas worried about having a buy back inat a higher priceso i was able to deposit here getbitcoin to orget dollars into my account and when ipaid that back i got back the sameamount of bitcoin which is the importantnumber for methey of course also have their bitcoinand usdc savings accounts with interestrates of up to 12 and a half percentannually paid monthlyand they've got their b2x offering whichuses the same loan mechanismto instantly buy more bitcoin if you'refeeling megabullish you can check them out links aredown below if you opt to get a loanwith that link they'll give you 25 bucksfor free into your savingsup next we've got the kobo vault one ofmy favorite hardwarewallets and i love it because it's ahundred percent air gap that means younever plug it into anything internetconnecteduh everything is done via qr code andthat keeps the keys to your money safeand offline i've been playing aroundwith it a lot lately for multi-sigsetups alongside my cold card which ialso really enjoyso be sure to check them out forreference i'm using the pro which hasthe fingerprint scanner and therechargeable batteryand uh yeah you can find them in mylinks in the show notesand finally i do live on bitcoin and oneof the ways that really helps me do thisis bit refill these guys just haveevery imaginable gift card that you canpick upand in various different countries youcan scroll to see just how many thereare it's insaneuh they accept bitcoin via main chain orvia lightning network maybe one dayliquid we'll seebut lightning network for those cheapfast transactions andthe beauty here is that i do earn satsback asi shop so you know anything that i canclaw backi'm all for be sure to check them outthere are links in the show notesdown below for them and with that let'sdive into this tutorialokay so i have block stream greendownloaded onmy phone here i'm going to open it upfor the first timewe're going to be creating a new wallethowever we are not going to be creatinga bitcoin wallet we're going to becreating a liquid walletthe way you do that you can see it saysbitcoin right hereyou're going to tap that for a littledrop down and you're going to tap onliquid i'm going to hit save and thenat this point i'm going to hit createnew walletokay so it says i'm going to need towrite down my mnemonic on paper andstore it somewhere safethis is just like creating a regularbitcoin wallet you're going to bewriting down a series of words and thisis the backup to your wallet it is acopy of the keys to your moneyso store it safe don't share it withanybody andmake sure that you keep it in a securelocationalso don't put it anywhere digital againdevices can be compromised andsomebody might get a hold of that seedyou don't want that and don't take ascreenshothit continue and we start with our uhwords here i'm going towrite these down and i will be backmomentarilyjust a side note as i'm backing thisthing up hereuh if you are backing up any walletwhether it be a bitcoin wallet or aliquidbitcoin wallet make sure that seed issafe andmaybe put it on something a little bitmore robust thanjust a piece of paper because you couldeasily throw that out without realizingwhat it isor you know it is susceptible to fireand water damage andi've heard some horror stories over thepast years for people that didn'tmake a really good backup of theirbitcoin and uhand now in this case liquid bitcoinwallet so be sure to do thatthere is a good option over at privacypros dot iofor the bill funnel and this is what iuse for a lot of my backups so be sureto check them outi'll leave a link down in the show notesif that's something that you might wantto check outupon writing down all of the wordsyou're going to hit nextand you're going to be asked a series ofskill testingquestions about your seed phrase so youcan quicklygo through those and answer the correctword for each one of theseat this point you're going to create apin code to access your walletfor the purposes of this video we'llkeep it simple one two three four fivesixand verify one two three four five sixokay now it's important to note that theblockstream greenwallet is actually a multi-sig it is twoof two that means you haveone key to the vault to your coins andblock streamholds the second key they cannot accessyour funds with the secondary keybut they do this through a two factor sowhat would happenis you have one key to sign atransaction or approve a transactionand then you get them to sign the secondwith the second keyvia a confirmation code whether it beemail smsa call google authenticator whatever youpre whatever you choosei tend to like google authenticator theyrecommend that you set up a couple ofthese different optionsfor now we're going to go with googleauthenticator really simplenow this is a code that we're going touse with google authenticatoryou can tap to copy that codeand then you can jump over to googleauthenticator to add block stream greento get a code i'm going to do that rightnowand jump over now basically what thisuh app does is it has a rotatingsecurity code that changes i think every30 seconds or 60 seconds i'm notpositivebut anyways to add a new one you justhit the plus button and we saw that qrcode beforeif it was in front of us we could scanit or we can enter a setup key which isthe thing we just copiedso we just name it liquidwe will paste in and it's time basedwe'll hit addokay and now down at the bottom we cansee we have a code that will recycleevery 30 or 60 seconds whatever it is ifwe jump backwe just paste in the code fromauthenticator so just hold the copypaste in that code we're setnow for this video i'm not going toenable any of these other ones i'm justgoing to leave it at that but it's goodto have a secondary onejust in case you have an issuewith the first one i'm going to go towallet and here we go we're all set upwe're ready to startusing liquid so let's get a quickoverview of what's in front of us herewe have our main account we have abalance which is denominatedin full bitcoin or liquid bitcoin rightnowand an equivalent us dollar amount belowwe have our send and receive buttonswe also have the assets in this accountwith liquid you can have liquid bitcoinbut you can also haveother uh tokens things that representsomethingother than bitcoin an example is havinga token that allows you to make apurchase on a store soblock stream allows you to purchase hatsusinga b hat token which is just a reallyeasy way of having like aa free hat voucher so you can do lots ofthings like thattickets for events so and so forthanyways besides the point uhwe have our main account here if we hitthis little the squares in the righthand corner you can add multipleaccounts if you want to segregate fundsuhin the top right you can also hit thesettings wheeland this gives you all of your otherimportant informationyou can set up your pins so and so forthyou can change your denomination if youwant to see it in setsyou can do that or any of these otherdenominations which itend not to use other than sats uhoutside of that you have just somegeneral stufflog in timeout i like to have this alittle bit longer for myselffive minutes sometimes it's too shortfor meand yeah if you want to see your backupall that kind of stuff it's all herei am going to change the denomination tosats i like seeing satsmore okay there we go and we're readyto start transacting so the first thingthat we're going to dois we want to get some actual liquidbitcoinand what we're going to be using forthis is a combination of another bitcoinwallet that i've done a video onblue wallet and a website online calledsideshift that allows you to swapbetween variousassets now just a note here blue wallethas regular bitcoin uh regular bitcoinwallets as well as lightning they do notyet have liquidalthough hint nudge nudge would love tosee thisintegrated here as well but we're goingto be using this bitcoin wallet whichhas somemoney in it right now and what i need todo let's take a look at what side shiftlooks like pretty easyall it is is what do you want to sendwhat do you want to receive i've alreadyset this up butif you see something different herebasically you tapand you choose the asset that you wantto switch fori'm not interested in other alt coinsand stuff like thati just want liquid bitcoin for some ofthe features that it offersso what i need to here is i need aliquidaddress and that would come fromour block stream wallet so i'm going tohit receiveand just like with bitcoin you're goingto have a qr code which is scannable andyou're going to have an address downbelowand i just tap to copy that addressand now i can jump back to side shiftand i can just simplypaste that address inonce i've pasted in my address i hit theshift buttonokay and we're presented with hey you uhthere's minimums and maximums of whatyou can send overthe address it needs to be this one herethat they provide to you you need tosend bitcoin to this qr code or thisaddressand whatever you send over will beshifted orswapped for liquid bitcoin now this isthe ratethat you're going to get you're payingabout 1 percent herethis is just one option in terms ofshiftinginto liquid you can alsodo a peg in which does take quite a bitmore time i'm okay with the one percentfor this instance uh so i'm going to goahead and do that so i'm going to copythis addressi'm going to jump back over to myblue wallet i'm gonna hit send i want tosend to the address i copied beforeand this is in canadian dollars soit will show up a little bit differentlywhen i receive it via liquidbut i'm gonna send how abouta hundred dollarsand we'll set the fee toabout 30 sats per byteand i'm gonna hit next notice that againwith the network fees right now i'mpaying abouteight dollars to send this transactionand we'll compare that to dealing withliquidliquid transactions momentarily so i'mgoing to hit sendthat has gone through and let's justjump back to side shift hereokay so it now says that it's receivingthey've detected the incomingtransactionand once we have a confirmation liquidwill be sent to this address you caneven tap here to get notified viatelegrama few moments later all right i can seehere that my transaction has gonethrough it says shift completeso jumping back over to block streamgreen i just back out i can see that ihavemy incoming transaction it's already gota single confirmationand is ready to spend momentarilyliquid blocks are only one minute inlengthso they're spendable much more quicklyso what we're going to do now is we'regoing to practiceascending between block stream greenand another wallet calledside shift and so i'm just going to goahead i'm going toside swap sorry side swap i'm going toopen that upand this is another liquid wallet herewhere you can holdliquid or acids issued on liquid soreally simpleagain they've got send and receivebuttons here i'm not going to get toodeep into this i'll probably do aseparate video on thiswallet but really simply i'm going tohit receivei'm going to grab an address here or hitthe copy button ratherand then let's jump back over to blockstream green thisyou can see we've already got theconfirmation it's fully completed we cansendso i'm going to hit sendi will say yes it does open the cameraby default for scanning but you can alsopasteyour address above i'm going to hit addamountit does ask you to select what assetyou're going to be sending soif you're sending something other thanliquid it would give you that optionhereand then it says how much do you want tosend you can choose a specific amountyou can also tap usd amount just forthis video i'm going to use a usd amountso i'm gonna goahead i'm gonna send i'm gonna send twodollarsand we'll just see what that looks likenowon bitcoin obviously like i spent eightdollarson the fee and i did manually lower thefee a little bitbut it did get through relativelyquickly here we're sending two dollarsand our fees you can your fees areactuallyless than one satoshi per byte so onetenth of a satoshi per byte you can haveuh fractions of a sat within uhexternal networks when it comes tothings like liquidor lightning so again it's it's allacross the board it's basically as lowas it could bei'm gonna just go ahead with that it'sgonna cost me about 15 centsinstead of the eight dollars that i justpaid on bitcointhat all looks good slide to send we nowneed our authenticator codeto approve this i willjump back to liquidslide to send i'll paste in that codeand that is now sent it's unconfirmedbut there's ournotification from this other wallet hereand we can see if ioh there we go we can see that we'vereceivedan unconfirmed transaction fora specific amount of liquid bitcoin okayso that's sitting there it's about3 400 sats at the momentand this will be confirmed within twominutesand then we'll be able to send back butagain we paid 15 centsas opposed to eight dollars and thiswill be confirmedquicker than a bitcoin transaction nowthe interesting thing about thisis if we take a look uh at the actualtransaction in a block exploreryou'll see that there is noinformation on the actual transaction interms of the amountbeing sent or even what asset it isokay it does show my fees it shows theestimated time that it'll be fullyconfirmedbut it does not show the amount or theasset and so this is a feature of alltransactions here they are confidentialin bothamount and asset itself so this shouldbe confirmedshortly here i'll just close this outand yeah there we go there's alreadyalready a single confirmation after twoit is spendable now i wanted to touchon the idea of assets on liquid as wellso it's important to differentiatebetween liquid bitcoin and assets thatcould beissued on top of liquid there's nocontrolreally over who issues an ash an asseton liquidthey can choose to or not and soyou know you kind of have to look at thetwo things separatelysome could be valid ideas like a simplevoucher to purchase somethingand some could be you know just not agood ideait really depends and it should belooked at as a case-by-casebasis just because i like liquid as ameans of moving money around with lessfees and with a degree ofconfidentialitydoesn't mean that i am vouching for someof these tokens but i willshow you how a simple voucher could beused on thisand in this case i'm actually uhi i tweeted out if i could get a one ofthe bhat tokens so that i can purchase a haton the block streamstore and grubbles here was nice enoughto say hey give me an address so i'mgoing to do that right nowhe just wants an address from my liquidwalletand so with this your liquid address isthe exact same as any address that youwould receiveany sort of a related token on so i'mjust going to hit receivei'm going to copy that address i'll justjump back to twitteri'll paste him that address and replyand hopefully we see that pop up in amoment and when we doalso shout out grubbles i i bet youdidn't know you were going tobe featured in this video but we willgo and see how to use that token see howit shows up in the wallet andhow to make a purchase with it all rightsogribbles was the man he sent me over ahatto my blockstream green wallet thanksfor that manmuch appreciated let's hop over and seewhat that looks likeso you can now see uh an incomingactually completed transaction becauseagainquick confirmations here one b-hatwhich is a block stream hat that i cannow use as voucher to purchase on theirstoreso it's basically a like a gift card toredeem for a hatnow you can see here it says two assetsin this account and if i tap on thatit shows me the two different assets ihave and there's one herethese ones while liquid bitcoin justlike regular bitcoin is divisibleblock stream hat token is not becauseyou can't go and buy half a hatobviously so you know you can thethe dynamics of how tokens work in hereis dependent on what the function is soi also have the block stream storepulled up here and we're just going toscroll down to find thathat so there's the block stream hat butactually it's the the second one herewhere they happenin brackets promo this is the one thatyou can buy withthat token so i'm just going to hit addto cartview cart great that looks awesomeperfect proceed to checkoutokay now i'm going to fill in somepersonal information and then we'll jumpto the next screen where i have to payas i scroll down here you can seepayment with block streamhat token and i can hit proceed to btcpay server to make my paymentthis is going to generate a qr code thatcan be scannedthere's an open in wallet button thatshould detect your block stream greenwallet althoughi've had a couple issues with it intestingi'm informed that they're working onfixing that up nowalternatively i can hit the copy buttonand this gives you an address that youcan just tap to copy and then jump overto block streamgreen in order to make that paymentwhich i'm doing now so i just tappedi'm going to hop over to my block streamgreenwallet got to put in my pin againbecause it timed outokay so i hit send i'm going to pastein that address that i just copiedi'll hit add amount i'm going to choosemy asset i'mchoosing block stream hat tokeni'm going to i could manually manuallytype1 or hit send all now when that openwallet buttonis functioning it will just fill allthis information out for youuh i'm gonna hit review and again the uhone side note here that your transactionfee is stillpaid in liquid bitcoin and again thethe fee is effectively the same as wepaid beforeright now it's looking around point onesats per byteand uh the same dollar valueso that looks good about a fifteen centfee in terms of sending the token i'mgonna slide to sendi need my authenticator codecopy jump overslide descend pasteand off it goes unconfirmed it'll be twoconfirmations to go through but if wejumpback to the block stream storei can see that it's been paid and that ican returnto the store everything's all good and ishould get a fancy new hatin a short
