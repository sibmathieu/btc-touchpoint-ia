  "text": "there's been a lot of talk about miningequipments and the overall Pico hash howmuch does it stand for it's at around3500 Pico harsh right now but there isno talk about how many nodes are thereand what technology they are using canyou please explain a little bit aboutthe role that nodes play in the protocoland everything that's a great questionthank you so much so we've discussedmining and a lot of people focus onbinding it's actually a problem thatpeople focus on binding because miningis an enabling technology in Bitcoin butit is by no means the only technology inBitcoin it is not even the mostinteresting technology in Bitcoin it'spart of a constellation of technologiesthat work together I asked this questionof audiences often I assume you all usethe Internet yes you have used the I'mnot talking about Facebook I'm talkingabout the Internet all right who herehas a working understanding of thepurpose mechanics and applications ofthe border gateway protocol BGP one twothree I'm counting myselfexcellent did you have any idea thatwithout that the internet doesn't workdid you have any idea that in fact thatprotocol bgp is responsible for gettingyour packets from here to thereeverywhere in the world it is the mostessential technology underlying theworld's routing system and you use BGPevery single day it's just that youdidn't know you were using it right it'salmost like turning on your water andbeing oblivious to the process offiltration and chlorination that ensuresthat you don't get typhoid from it andthat is the same with BGP and it's thesame with mining mining is a technologythat miners need to know about there'slike BGP is a technology that serviceproviders and routing experts need toknow about that the average user doesnoton the other hand nodes are importantnodes are like servers on the intranetbut they have an even more importantrole so what is a node a node is simplya computer that is participating in theglobal Bitcoin network by speaking aprotocol that for further confusion iscalled Bitcoin the protocol the Bitcoinpeer-to-peer network protocol to be morespecific is a protocol that allows thesenodes on the network to communicate witheach other and what they do is theypropagate transactions and blogseverywhere you can run one of these infact you should there are about 10,000nodes that we know of that advertisetheir presence by listening on specificports in a way that can be discoveredthere's probably five or six times asmany that do not advertise theirservices that listen or do not listen onopen ports or even that are hiddenbehind various protocols like tor andthings like that and listen on hiddenports in general the know instead ofparticipating in Bitcoin served the mostimportant purpose every one of them actsas an authoritative verifier of everysingle transaction and blog that type ofnode is called more precisely a fullnode or even more precisely a fullyvalidating node right a fully validatingnode may also keep a full copy of theblockchain the entire ledger on its harddrive it doesn't have to it can be afully validating nodes with a reducedcopy of the blockchain it communicatesby random process of connection with aset of peers that it chooses from thenetwork and it doesn't trustSpeirs it monitors these peers and everytime it receives a transaction or ablock from them the other peer sayshere's a transaction that is happeningon the Bitcoin network and your nodegoes so you say let's seeand takes it and independently verifiesevery aspect of that transaction it Thorattentively reconciles it with its owncopy of the ledger to determine whetherthe funds have been double spent and ifyou send that node a transaction that isincorrect it will not only reject thetransaction it will stop talking to youso go no you lied not talking to you for24 hours and I go stand in the corner Iknow the tries to propagate incorrectinformation is very quickly isolatedbecause all of the nodes that itattempts to communicate with will ban itand disconnect from it there are levelsof offense there are some things thatare so egregious that they'll get youpermanently bad and there are somethings that will only get you droppedfor an hour or so and it varies but theimportant thing is the nodes don't trusteach other they are thora tative ly andfully validate every transaction whywould you run one of these thingsbecause you want to be in control ofyour money because the whole purpose ofBitcoin is that you don't trust anyoneelse to tell you what the truth is youtrust only in the execution of theconsensus rules and the independentverification that they do I run a fullyvalidating node in fact I run several ofthem and I first check them everyservice provider every exchange everywallet company every company thatinteracts with Bitcoin every individualthat wants this same level of authorityand autonomy runs a fully validatingnode nodes decide what the rulesare not miners miners get thetransactions that nodes decided werevalid and they give back blocks at thepleasure of the nodes that will decideif they are worthy of being propagatedbecause they are valid the validity ofthe consensus rules is not determined byminers they sequence transactions into ablock the validity of the consensusrules is determined by nodes becausethey will not propagate lies that's theimportance of a node if you can run 120gig of disk space a couple of gigs ofmonthly bandwidth four gigs of ram dualor four core CPU plug it into your DSLturn it on be part of the revolution andmoney and more importantly at that pointin time you no longer need to ask anyonedid a transaction happen is it confirmedis it valid you now have anauthoritative record of your own thatanswers that question without appeal toany authority that is really runningBitcoin so thank you for asking thatquestion that was a great question[Music]you",
