result from engaging withlearning about bitcoini think it's probably one of the mostfascinating aspects of this wholephenomenonand i have bang bitcoin with me heretoday who's going to remain anonymousto share some of his thoughts and someof his story but firsti do want to thank uh the sponsor of theshow the bitbox o2bang right there um bitcoin only editionfor myself of course and um yeah this isa great hardware walletum i'm advising a lot of people to buybitcoin now and have been for the lastseveral yearsuh and the more complicated step isalways telling them how to secure it andtake custody for themselves because thatis acrucial aspect of uh buying and owningbitcoinand uh i've been really enjoying playingaround with the bitbox o2um it's a super smooth easy easy to usehardware wallet i've even gone fullpsychopathand cut out tiny littleseed words so i can randomly select myown seed phrase becausethe wallet allows you to do that you canof course roll it and it of coursegenerates it for you as well if youprefer thatthat approach with a random numbergeneratorit connects to your own node it has coinselection a lot of great featuresand i found it's good for someone withmore experience that wants to domulti-sig stuffas well as someone who's just dippingtheir toes into this whole world sothank you to the bitbox02 for thesupport and if you guys want to check itout go to shift crypto dot ch forwardslashrapid fire for five percent off bangbitcoinwhat's up baby hey johnhow you doing i'm good i'm good manit's uh it's good to uh it's good totalk to you i'vebeen listening to you for a while and soit's pretty cool to uhi get to beat you and uh and have thischatyeah man i'm looking forward to this toowe've been uhyou know going back and forth on dms foron twitter for a whileyeah and you've always got uh you knowyou knowenthusiasm and things that you want todiscuss and uhi thought you know now that i'm i'mtrying to do a more of a dedicatedyou know series or approach to speakingto peopleuh that you know have a particular storyto share with regards to bitcoin andand how it's changed them i thought nowis the time to uh to put this thingtogether soi know you're obviously maintaining acertain degree of privacy sohow do you want to kick this thing offwhat's top of your mindum well i meanfirst i mean first i want to say uh umit's just cool what you're doingyou know i mean that's kind of like thefirst thing you know it's a it's a weirdthing to to reach out on twitter tosomebody you don't knowi mean it's even weirder to to um tolisten to peopleyou know discuss things and then get thesense thatoh like i i would get along with thatguy you know like i want to meet thatguy i love whati love your show and i love what you'redoing and so i just sort of had thissense of likeyou know i i want to reach out to youand it's weird to reach out withsomebody you don't know butum you know i don't know i guess i i tryto live likeinstinctually and uh and uh just trusttrust my instincts so yeah that's why ikept badgering you basicallywell i appreciate that man and that'sthat's the cool part aboutbeing in bitcoin you know like i don'twant to suggest that we're all the samebut we are operating on a similarwavelength you know soit makes it that much more easy likei've i've done a bunch of these thingsnow whereyou know we haven't talked before andhere we are you know striking up a livestreamand just the fact that i can have theconfidence to do thatuh and think that you know theconversations are you knowa best case scenario going to beinteresting but you know evenjust not a a complete train wreck is iskind of a miracle in itself but it justit just speaks to like how uhi guess how aligned or how uh you knowthe shelling point of bitcoin that'sthat's bringing a lot of similar peopletogether andchanging people in a lot of similar waysso that i think we can we canjive so easily and so uh you know soseemingly randomlyyeah there's definitely somethingthere's definitely something going onyou knowit's uh it's pretty undeniableand uh yeah i mean you canyou can see it i mean you can see it nowseeping everywhere into the mainstreamand whatnotum and i mean i just i just jumped ontotwitterin the last what six months for thefirst time it's really my firstforay into any social media whatsoeveris uh being on bitcoin twitterand uh i just gotten so much out of italreadyum it's just really cool yeah well thisisyou know we were talking about this verybriefly before we started andyou know it's in my opinion it's agenuine culture that's emerging you knowand it'svery early stages and the i the ideasand the ethics and theyou know uh all that the all thedifferent elements of the culture arestillswashing around and being sorted out butlike it's i think it's pretty clear ifyoustep back from it for a second that itit's you know certainly a countercultureandyou know i think many bitcoiners wouldargue on its way to becomingdominant culture at some point in thefuture and and here we are allcontributing to it and figuring it allout and experiencing changes withinourselves and throwing them out into themix andyou know on this fairly rapid i wouldsayprocess of refining our understanding ofwhat this all isand and also contributing toit becoming something that you know wehave a vague idea of what it's becomingbutreally not not a super clear one yeah imeani mean you know my beginning into thisuh was like early 217 andi mean the the reason why it's like ii'm not i'm not technicallysavvy although i'm getting better youknow and uh and i'm prettyyou know stoked about how intimidatingit is to like dive in there but you knowget in there so now i'm running my ownnode and uhand you know got my own uh multi-stakething going and it's justawesome um you know i guess confrontingthe fear the technicalfor me um but when i startedum the thing that drew me in so muchwas the people like ii i guess i i won't say i pride myselfbuti think one of the things i've alwaysrelied on in my life was myintuition about people and and i kind ofyou know just kind of used it toi guess make my way in in some ways andum when i first when the seed was sortof first plantedi mean the questions came from were inmy life for a long timeabout money and they were just kind ofwhispers you knowthey were just whispers and and and thenthey just got louder and louder andwhen i f then dove inand and this thing i mean i can tell youwhen i first when i first heard aboutbitcoinlike the the moment i heard about itlike something went binglike i and it's weird i was watchingthose umyou know they're a little bitoverproduced but those uh mike maloneyvideos on uh thehidden secrets of money or whatever andtowards the end ofone of the episodes he sort of says youknow he's sort of asking the questionswhat will it be it could be this itcould be thatit could be this new thing of bitcoinand as soon as i heard it i was likethere's something there's somethingthere like immediatelyand uh and so i dove in and just startedtoresearch as much as i could you know imean in 217 there wasn't nearly as muchas there is now four years later butum it was out there you know there werepeople still doing stuffand um yeah and like i said the thingthatthat drew me in was um when i listenedto people talklike from the bitcoin space people thathad conviction about bitcoini was struck by how how many people werehighly intelligentbut also like not umlike it's like the difference betweenlike umlike intelligence and um overanalyzing do you know what i mean likethere's there's a highly intelligentcomponent to the people in the space butthey're also very humanand and grounded and the intelligencehas a wisdom to it it's not just aknowledgedoes that make sense it makes totalsense you know and i i think there's somany examplesof you know new so many people cominginto the space now of course and i thinkthere's a lot of examples where that'snot present or that's not the case rightthere's a verynarrow knowledge and and perhaps anextreme intelligencebut which lacks the broader wisdom toassess what's going on properlyyeah and i you know i totally agree youknow oneit's such i mean it's such a phenomenonthat you you come into a space where andii usually term it you know i don't usethe term wisdom although it's perfectlyreasonable in you know that you thatyou're using iti usually just use the term clarityright like i you know i thinkintelligence is one thing but havinglike a broaderclarity of perspective about all how allthe pieces ofthe reality puzzle fit together and youknow of course nobodynone of us have a full picture of thatbut i do think bitcoinershave both like you know highly specificumlike domain expertise on the one handbut it's it's it coincides witha you know a broader clarity ofperspective that allows them tokind of understand how their expertisefits into the whole and howand how to juggle the two almost mostoptimally or certainlymore optimally than it seems like a lotof people in in the broader society youknow in normal in norman world seem toto do yeah and i mean to this day i'mstill struck by itlike i'm just struck by the number ofpeople and the newinflux of people that are just brightyou know like bright people andum and they're inspired andand they're working their asses off forbitcoin uhyou know it i i laugh to myselfsometimes because i think i'm just soso damn lucky because i'm like i thinkmyself like every time i buy bitcoinit's like all these peoplelike there's an army of people makingbitcoin betterand every time i buy a little bit it'slike i benefit fromyou know this just yeah it's an armyand and it and it's um the kind ofpeople that i just diglike you know people that are ballsyintelligent but stillhuman about the whole thing and like yousaid yeah broaderyou know broader context the thephilosophy ijust all of it is just soit's very it's very unique you know andand one of the things that i love aboutit toois you know bitcoin is ais a is a proposition ofprinciples right like it says like herei am thisopen decentralized immutablecensorship-resistantyou know honest fair you knowmeritocratic systemright do you accept mesort of thing and and if you're someonethat says yes i iaccept you i accept these these rules iaccept these principlesi think they then you know almostnecessarily uh impact peoplewith similar or almost imbuepeople with similar principles if theydecide to accept them and soyou know that's one of the things that ii love so much about this space andobviously there's exceptions but um itis a is a principledbehavior right it is principles ofhonestyand integrity umand and truthfulness right and andforthrightness like andand uh yeah yeah and and many more andthose those are those are wonderfulthings that you don't see in many placestodayyeah it's it's it's incredible and it'sincredible that it that it'soriginating with a protocol like like tome it justit's mind-boggling you know that a pieceof softwareis you know an open source piece ofsoftware is out there workingdoing this thing and yeah like to yourpoint it's likei mean sometimes when i when i sit backand think about it it's like thismachinethat just you know the block after blockafter block and it's just thisum assertion or this likeit's like a yes and a no you know kindof reminds me even of the computer theon off the ones and the zeros it's likeit's a yes yep this transaction it'slegitit's like it's a it's a constant sort oflikeheartbeat of like this is the truth thisis the truththis is the truth and and as you keepbouncing up against ityeah it's just wild what happens like ii don't knowi don't know exactly how it happens butthere's something about it that theheartbeat of thatof the bitcoin blockchain it's just likethe truth of it just starts to likeyou know i don't know i'm moving my handhere just kind of likelike a heartbeat and and and it just itis a frequencyyou know and it does uh it just startsto impact youthe more you bounce up against it it'snot it's not changing you know it it'sdoing the same thingagain and again and again and and themore you bounce up against it it startsto affect youum it's really cool yeah i think it ithas an interesting propensity also toyou know we say this a lot in the spaceand a lot of peoplenot in the space probably don'tunderstand what we mean but that it kindof reveals the truth about people and ithinkjust an aspect of that is that itsproposition is so bold and bare righteverything i justarticulated about the openness and thefairness like that's whatit's proposing and if you agree withthat and youintegrate it then that says somethingabout you right if you resist itand you you criticize it and you decryit well that says something about youtooright it's like it's like it's like thejudgment that can't be escaped right ifyou even come withinyou know uh if it enters your awarenessor if you come within itsit's uh you know domain let's sayit's almost like you're necessarilyjudged by how you how youinteract or don't interact how youengage or don't how youhow you criticize or or praise you knowlike because itis you know those unchanging principlesso the only thing that can really beuh you know assessed for reaction is youand uh it's it's you know and we seethis playing out all the time right wesee we see new people come in andum and the culture that's grown uparoundthat fundamental proposition isobviously an extension of thatand so that's the cyber hornets rightthat's that's peoplethat um kind of are the active principleof that judgmentof those principles inherent in thatsystem and you knowmaybe sometimes they go in the you knowa little bit overboard but i actuallydon'tthink that's the case i i thinkmy observation of a lot of you knowpeople say toxicity right which i iactuallyentirely reject i i think it's uma playful test of character because iknow a lot of thesepeople and obviously have interactedwith them a lot and you knowthey are happy playfuluh loving supportive people a lot oftime imperfect of course butum when they when people come inand it's it becomes evident that umthere's a conflict between them andlet's say the system is as odd as i knowthat soundsum i think you know the hornets theimmune system just kind of poke and prodto try to reveal more of the characterof these people andyou may not like that that's the casebut again i do think we'rea culture is emerging here and it onlymakes sense thatthe culture at large and theparticipants within that culturewould want to to understand deeplywho's coming into it right because umthere is an ethic and there areprinciples that permeate that cultureand i think that response isis perfectly natural apply a littlepressure and see what's revealedabout the character of people that arepresuming to enter itand and we know how that plays out ifyou come inwith humility and uh adesire to understand the truth umand you know uhyou know not taking yourself tooseriously in a playfulness then you'regonna be welcome with open arms andyou're gonna besubsumed into the culture you knowalmost immediately but if you resist orif you havearrogance or you lack humility or youpresume to knowyou know fill in the blank then you'regoing to probablyuh continue to get uh pressed andprodded and pokedand how you respond to that is is verytelling and you knowthere's been some funny instances ofthat recently with lax oror eric or whomever but um yeahyeah it reminds me of uh reminds me abit ofthe great uh stand-up comedians wherethey uh it's like the you knowthey push and um they poke and they pushand they they do it to see likehow will you respond you know like howwill you respond to whatwhat i'm throwing at you and like yousaid it it reveals right it's it's a bitof a mirrorum and it's very cool to see yeah i meanyou knowi love it i do too i mean you know i'mwith you the hornets it's likethere's sometimes where i'm like oh mandid we did we just do that you know andi'm saying we because i feel such a youknowi don't know i just feel a union withwith this you know did we just go therei'm like okay let's see let's see whathappenswe'll see it's so you know it's soridiculous sometimes but that's thebeauty likethat's the beauty of you rightthat's that's saying like it it's almosta test to see if you can really you knowsee the truth behindthe action right yeah like and and torealize that these are people whodon't care about your opinion but whoare willing to engage with you andinteract and and even develop strongrelationships with you if you acceptthatthat premise you know that that they cando what they want to do and you can dowhat you want to doand the system treats everyone the sameregardless and umit's very it's very it's very human youknow and i think it'si actually think it's really importantbecause especially nowyou know in in in the world that we'reliving in right nowit's so important for people to bechallenged on what they hold to besacredit's so important because there is anelevatedsort of level of quote-unquotesacrednessyou know to to so much of like oursociety right nowand it's and it's so important thatthere are these gatekeepers that arealways bashing it downlike like breaking it and uhbecause i i if if we get tooif we get too um obsessedwith these ideas like with ideas aboutthingsand identifying with things it'sdangerousyou know and it's so it's so importantfor people toit's so important to have this immunesystem that kind of attacks in a wayyou know if you can attack if you cankeep attacking thingsum to kind of reveal their essenceyou know like really reveal theiressence because you know we'recomplicatedwe're complicated things you know wehave all these ideas about thingsbut really and that's why i love bitcoinso much it's like first principles canyou go backand see what's underneath it and thenwhat's underneath that and what'sunderneath that until you can distill itdown you knowbut you know all too often in the worldi thinkespecially you know whatever i don'twant tobe negative about anything but i'm not afan of like you know a lot of academiaand stuff like that where it's likethere's there's anobsession with kind of like umoverthinkingover analysis identification with ideasas thoughyou know there's some ideas that are themost important andyeah i just like wheni like when people can find a deepertruthlike yeah and if and if you find adeeper truth or feel a deeper truththen you don't get shaken out right likepeople can come at you with stuffthe hornets can attack you but if you'reif you'reif you feel strong about what you knowand who you areit's not going to bother you that muchyeah you know you know what i meantotally and i think that's part of thereason why bitcoininstills such confidence in people it'sit's because likeyou know for all the benefits and newnovel behaviors that it permitsyou know the protection of your yourmoney your your savings your sacrificehowever you want to characterize itum it doesn't likeit doesn't matter what anybody says toyou about itright and i think you know that givesyou a confidence to go into the frayyou know go into the the melee and justyou know try stuff test stuff proposestuffsmash ideas together assert yourselfwithdraw from it because you know likenone of none of those barbs none ofthose attacks if they even areyou know truly attacks and not playfulsparringuh none of it matters you're still goodyeah right soto have that confidence i think that youknow that'sthat's what's required to pursue youknow pursue truth almost right like youhave to havelike some kind of an anchor and i thinkthat bitcoin is providing that forpeopleto allow themselves you know the wholeidea of becoming uncancible and ofcourseyou know most people aren't are yet tobecompletely uncancible but the fact thatyou're sovereign over your moneyis like the the major step right andonce you have that establishedi think people are finding that elementsof theirpersonality or even you know justit's giving them an opportunity to askdeeper questions about themselves andthen havethe confidence and freedom to actuallybegin expressingthose things whether it be in theirpersonal life for their career oror wherever and trying to you knowcontinuing and perhaps even acceleratingthat journeyof understanding themselves and becomingthat person thatmaybe that previously they thought theythey wanted to or could bebut were inhibited in some way ordiscovering thatyou know there's a whole new person thatthey didn't know they could be that thisisgiving them you know this is empoweringthem to be able tostrive for in a more confident or moreeffectiveway and uh it's aand i think it's all because that thatkind of one little seed of ofof confidence and sovereignty isbleeding out into all these other areas100 percent and and of course it's donewith suchyou know uh incredible irony and humoryou know like thisthe meme lords right i mean it's justincredibleand and you know the meme of likeyou money like you said fu moneyit's like i mean the word that comes tomind is when you distill it down pastthe humor and theyou know the meme of it it's like theword that comes to mind is like agencyand it's just such a powerful force youknowbecause it's at the heart of everythingthat gets builtlike everything that gets built byhumans is about you know a human beingsensing oh i got something i want to putit out there i want to make somethingyou know and yeah there's somethingaboutum there's something that happens whenyousense that um the value that you haveum that you create is yoursif something happens and like you saidthe theyou know for me it's like agency emergesand thena person starts to feel more confidentmore able tosort of plumb themselves for like youknow who am iwhat is this what am i doing here whatyou know what am i gonna what am i gonnadois there something that i really want todo versusyou know this other thing which is likethere's a systemthat i got a game and i got to play somekind of ayou know game to win this game thatdoesn't feel right to me to play anywaysbut uh i guess i'm supposed to do it youknowversus this other thing that that startsto emerge from within that's organicthat's likeoh this is this is what i i want to dothis isyou know where i feel drawn uminspired it's just a completelydifferentum way to approachyou know your the way you operate in theworld and uhit's just awesome i think i think that'sa great point and i i think that's whyyou know if you look at the culture orthe community insofar as it'srepresented on twitter which obviouslyislimited um that's why there's such ajoyful playfulness right like there'sthere'sjoy and happiness in the community and ithink part of that is for the veryreason you just articulated it's likepeople's prior life is you're born intothe systemyou're kind of forced down a funnel ofdoing things that you don't really findthat meaningful but it'sthe way to game the system that you findyourself inand then you grow up and you kind offind yourself i don't really like theway this system operates as the more youlearn andlearn about it and then you feel badabout yourself because you're you'reforced to conform to a system you don'tyou don't believe in right that youdon't you don't think is right andalmost nothing could be moresoul-destroying than that and i know youknowboth myself and i've talked to a lot ofpeople in previous careers or inprevious jobs that they've hadthat's the very way they characterizethem is soul destroying it's like ii hated getting up in themorning and going and doing that but you knowwhat was i supposed to do you know i'dspent this many years in school to dothatand i'd been you know my family had kindof put me down this pathor my obligations or you know all thatkind of stuffand then to find this new system and tounderstand the principles on which it'spredicatedand to see the culture emerging arounditand uh to be able to engage it and thenalso to be able to use itto extricate yourself from the old oneand make that transition to the new andi'm not talking about like getting a jobin bitcoin i just mean likeusing bitcoin as a savings technology toyou knowsiphon off what you were able to buildin that up that old system and bring itinto this new oneand then empower you to continue kind ofunpackingyourself so that you can get back to aplace where you actuallyyou know both believe in the system andfind meaning in the things you're doingand therefore believe in yourself andtherefore feel happier and thenand therefore feel more joy and that'swhyi think there's so much of that in thisspace because like it's likerejoicewe've got you know we've we've gotsomething uh we've got a better thinghere now we've got somethingthat's principle that's right that'sgood that canlead to the expression of you know uhwhat we think is right and who we reallyare and anda fairer way of organizing all thatstuff likere-fucking joyce right yeah when you heywhen you're free like truly when you ifyou if you've ever experiencedlike you know the feeling of freedom inyour life if you're notif you're not you know rejoicing andhappy and having you knowfun with it then you haven't felt it yetyou know becausebecause feeling free is that thing youyou rejoiceand uh yeah it's it's yeah it's so sweeti meanand you know what you're saying that'swhy i take an issue with with peoplethatdecry the toxicity because i'm just likeman you could not be further from the truth youyou are just blanking on this one hardjust because there's something in youthat's resisting itwell that and you know it's not easy todeal with the gestureright i mean right it's not the gestureisuh you know the gesture is poignantand and uh and and pushes in a way thatmakes people uncomfortableum but and and it's always there'salways a bit of tongue in cheek you knowbut it's razor sharp intelligence at thesame time you know the gesture is sowise soi mean i love it i love it it's almostit's almost like you know i've neverthought of it in this way butfamiliar with the character of thegesture but it's almost like the jesteris likea tool for development right becauselike yeah the jesteror the cyber hornets right if they ifwhat they do offends youthat should be a signal to you it's likewhat about itin me is it is it triggering that i'mbeing offended by it right becausethat'sthat's probably an indication that ineed to unpack somethingright they're they're almost providing aservice you know like they're they'rehelping you mine yourself for the placeswhereyou know you haven't uh exploredsomething maybe adequatelyadequately and i you know i i guess youknow the analogy of the gesture is ais a apt one there yeah there's a reasonwhy the gesture was always so close tothe king rightright and the king always kept thejester closethe only one who could like reallycriticize him sort of thingyeah criticize him and uh make him laughat the same time and teach himyou know i gotta get more into thati haven't looked at injustice very muchbut yeah well the jester the joker righti mean it's it's it's it's uh it's init's it's a universal somehow you knowthis theme of the joker is the jester umyeah it's a really and one of the greatcharacters written of all time too thejoker the jesterbut speaking about like what you weresaying earlier this thing of likeyou know the matrix is you know thematrix gets thrown around obviously inthe in the zeitgeist and uhand uh and bitcoin reminds me ofum you know it reminds me of umthe humanness involved in like you knowlike what we're talking about before thethe idea of the system and and youyou know if you um sort of get involvedin a system thatyou think you got to be on the you knowthe treadmill the wheeland then suddenly you discover thatmaybe you don't you know and like i liketo seeor i think of like a human's life aslikeum it you know it's very simple and verycomplicated you know because we comeinto the worldand i have a three-year-old now you knowa daughterand and she's teaching us so muchobviously umbut but you see that that um you knowbarring anyunfortunate kind of you know traumaticevent or anything theyou know we come into the world and andwe've justwe've got genius on tap they're just soable toto to take everything in and they're soaware of everything andand uh but they're also so extremelydependentand it's it's really a unique uhit's just a really unique thing becausewe come into the world and we're kind ofhardwiredfor um survival but in order to do so wekind of have to look outwardyou know like we have to look at ourparents or our caregivers or whateverand we've got to adapt to them in ordertosurvive and so we're always lookingoutward lookingupward you know towards the the biggerhumanyou know the authority the caregiver tosurviveand so it's kind of in us you know it'sit's kind of programmed into us in orderto surviveyou got to be able to adapt to what'soutside of youum and and then as you get olderi mean this is my experience and that'swhy i'm sharing it butas you get older and you start to sortof uh get your feet under you moreyou know you might start to ask morequestions you know it depends on ifyou're if you're lucky enough to havepeople around you that care about youand support you and whatnotand don't make it too hard for you imean sometimes when peopleyou know face really adverse stuff theyyou know they mutateand they and they still make it you knowto the other side butit's more difficult i think but yeah ifyou get if you get some support and youstart to sort ofhave the space to ask your own questionsyou start to sort of see that oh wait asecond i don'ti don't need to calibrate off what'sgoing on outside of meyou know i i don't i actually don't needtoum look at the system and game thesystem i mean it doesn't happen foreverybodyum but something like bitcoin i thinkactually is thatthat truth wall that you can kind ofbump intoand it can like you said uh well it canaffect youand maybe wake you to this thing that islikeum i no longer have to look outside ofmyselffor what's what's what i must do andmaybe i could find it within myself youknow and that was my journey you knowwhen i was in my twentiesi had so many questions about everythingand i had no answerslike i just couldn't get any answersabout any of the questions andit was difficult because you know if youreallydo have questions about how things areand you really don't feel like there'sanswers out therethen you kind of got to find them foryourself in some ways likeand maybe not in some ways you really doyou know umand or kind of give up which a lot ofpeople do also which is a tragedyexactly that that's the other optionright you abdicate and you just sort offall in lineyou fall into the system you you sort ofsayyou know what the my well whatever idon't know if people do it consciouslyor not but likemy programming of like other people knowbetteryou know other people will guide me youknow authority willso much easier yeah it's it's easier andit's in us right so it's almost likeif it's almost like you gotta you gottayou know you gotta have a rebirthof some sort you know i mean it soundskind of cliche butit and and when you do or if you doit's it it's intimidating and and it'skind of scary i thinkto go to say to oneself like ahno one has the answers like i gotta findthemyou know i gotta find them for myself ithink that's an excellent pointand i think it's something that you knowsadlyuh has not up till this pointprevailed in that many people i think alot of people takethe comfortable route the one that'sthat's known right because it's so muchharder to determine things for yourselfwhenyou know a nice nicely packagednarrative is lotis is laid out for you when you enterinto the world andall you got to do is adopt it and thingsbecome a lot more certain and whodoesn't like certainty and who doesn'tlike comfortum and as you say you know umthis idea yeah i've been reading a lotof jordan peterson stuff recently andthis idea of sacrifice and it's not justlike the grand sacrifice it'sa sacrifice on a daily basis ofwho you currently are and all thedifferent associations and identitiesand perceptions that lead to youbecoming that personsacrificing that daily for who you mightbecome with greaterclarity with a different perception withmore wisdom with more knowledge etcand so to and that's kind of the that'sthebehavior of the hero is the one who'sall like whoshows up every time with the courage tosacrifice themselves for who they mightberight for for that who's willing to putthemplace themselves in that uncomfortableposition of uncertainty once againjust because they know that there'sthere's something better that liesbeyondthat will be more truthful be more clearand be a more ultimately beneficialperspectivefor them in constructing a you know ajoyfulhappy truthful uh you know righteouslife and i know that last word is fairlyum carries a lot of religious baggagebutyou know that that is the idea of thehero and and ii think we could all relate to the thecourage that it takes and this iswe've been discussing this themethroughout this conversation so far toto show up and and say i don't knowand you know whether and again thishappens on all scales constantlybut say i'm you know i'm i'm willing toto be the fool in order to uhyou know gain wisdom and gain uhknowledge as i move forward and the thethe the courage to consistently be thefool isis is a is a genuine form of of courageand what i think about bitcoinis that you know i think it has theeffect of being like aa great deconditioning machinealmost you know like we come in as yousaid to the world andthrough our family and through ourculture and stuff we getinculcated with a great many thingsright and this is our conditioning andthis is why wethink and speak and act in various waysdifferent fromculture to culture and it almost seemslike in a way bitcoin is this thing thathas its own first principles right theseprinciples ofyou know fairness and meritocracy andopenness andand uh incorruptibility and these sortsof thingsuh upon you know that that when peoplereally start tounderstand it and go down that rabbithole almost serves toto decondition a lot of things they werethey wereinculcated with and built back up fromthose principles from that place ofmaybe a more solid maybe a moreum valid groundum and i i you know again i think thisis part of the reasonwhy we see these dramatic personalchanges because their their perspectivehas beenyou know they've been deconditioned to acertain degree and then theirperspective has beenyou know fairly dramatically reorientedaround these things and i think theproof is inin the pudding that it's that's probablya beneficial thingyeah yeah absolutely yeah i meanagain if i share a bit of my personalside it's likei went up until my you know mid-20s andmy whole my whole world was about likewhat do other people think is goodyou know what what are others value whatdo others umesteem and i followed that you know andyou know i i happen to be you knowpretty good at certain thingsso i got really good at the things thati thought other people valuedand uh and i think i was probablyperceived you know i meani can't say for sure but i think i wasprobably perceived like oh very you knowsuccessful personyou know very good at this very good atthat and i thought you know this isthis is the way but i was alwayswonderinglike i you know i always found myselfkind of going like there's got to besomething elseyou know i was always thinking there'sgot to be something else umand i built this you know i built this iyou knownot to be critical of myself but yeah ididn't know any better but i built thiskind of like facadeyou know of like who i was um and ithink a lot of peopleadmired me for it in some waysand uh and i was lucky enough you knowi was lucky enough in my uhin my mid-20s to have a relationship endand feel like a ton of you know just aton of pain aroundthe loss for a relationship and it justcracked me like you kind ofyou know everything that i thought thati had kind of perfectedand built up suddenly was just shaken upcompletelyand um yeah and then i started toyou know slowly get begin my journey oflike discovering it for myselfum and it was painful it was painful tokind of build up build something thatyou know from the outside in essentiallyand then have it all fall apartand then have to like start againyou know with just questions umbut yeah and so i guess when i bumpedinto bitcoin i was like oh thisis like you know this is i don't know itjustresonated with me umand i think it's just something aboutthe truth of it you know the simpletruth of itum yeah and i mean i can't stop now ican't stop i'm so i'm so obsessedlike you know i'm one of those peoplejohn that's likeyou know uh like i i want to talk aboutit all the time you knowand it's like my family and friends it'slike you know and they can see mesitting there being quiet and they'relike i know you just want to talk aboutbitcoinbut we do it all the time so you knowlet's talk about something else butyou know everything else kind of likepales you know it just starts to palei used to i used to read a bunch i usedto i used toyou know watch a bunch of movies youknow i used to love storiesum and now it's like it's likei i don't want to occupy my psychicspaceyou know i don't want anybody elsetelling me the stories anymoreyou know it's like i just value my ivalue my timeso much now um more than ever and i justdon't want ityou know i just don't want i want to bein charge of my time and my psychicspaceand yeah and bitcoin just you knowjust keeps scratching me where i itch soi'm great i thinki think we all suffer from thataffliction you know like we'rewe find ourselves in a socialenvironment and we're sitting aroundwith you know five or sixfriends and they're talking about godknows what you know currentpop culture item or politics or whateverand we're all just there like sitting onour hands shaking likesomebody asked me about bitcoin rightnowyou know and then of course when we getto connect with bitcoiners then we getto let it all flow outwhich you know is a primary reason why ido this pod butyou know it's it's such a it's such agreat point that bears repeatingum that you mentioned just before thatumabout how you know you came out of arelationship and your world kind of camecrashing down and likebecause the big question here is likewhy theis this thing having that kind oflike the effect that we've beenarticulating on people right and i thinkpart of it you knowwhen we talk about conditioning when wetalk about cultureand we talk about identity and we talkabout a belief beliefs you know and arelationship is probably a good littlemicrocosm of that becauseyou you know you you think something ofthis person youyou see a future with this person youbelieve something about themand then when it falls apart like allthat is taken awayand you do it requires a fairly dramaticreorientationof at least a part of your reality whichwaswho you know who you spent most yourtime with and why you did that and whatyou saw in terms of thefuture so like and i think that it makesyou feelnaked or at least vulnerable for aperiod of time right because likelike a big chunk of your identity and ofcourse we construct our identities tofeel comfortable about moving throughthe world right to feelenough certainty and confidence to haveenough of a grasp on who we areand what this world is so that we canactually try to manipulate it in someway to our benefitum that gets taken away and we're likeoh oh like i'mi'm i'm vulnerable right now i gotta igotta fill up that chunk that's justbeen removed with something else that'sgoing to deliver to methe requisite stability to keep you knowperforming that magic function ofof manipulating my world of engagingreality in a way that ends up beingbeneficial to meand uh you know i think on a in abroader context likeyou you follow this all the way down andyou you end up at you knowreligious or deeply philosophicalprinciples you know and andagain to refer to peterson as and most ithink a lot of religious scholars wouldsay the same it's like you know it'sfinethat we have the world seems to bepredominantly or the growing contingentof atheismatheism today umbut the the principles that are foundin the religious stories are still verymuch a partof how they construct their worldviewwhether theylike it or not or whether they know itor not umbut you know we don't need to to openthat can of worms we can just simply saythat likethere are fundamental principles andthen upon those aremore principles and more um beliefsand perspectives and things that youassociate your identity with in order tobecomethat functional person that's able toengage with the worldfor whatever ends right and in mostcases it'll be you knowa motivation of something in the futureright like you want something you wantyour life to be a certain wayyou want something in your life and umyeah when you know when that gets r rugpulledit that's i think that's why it's souncomfortable because like it'sliterally the stuff that youare relying on to be a person in thischaotic crazy uncertain worldand it seems like bitcoin is speaking to[Music]those elements at the very you knowfoundational layerof those things right so like forexamplewe may our sports team may be part ofour identity likemaybe you support the toronto mapleleafs and that you know you cheer forthem and you get hang out with yourbuddiesand drink beers and when they when theteam wins you're happy and when theylose you're sad like that's aa part of your identity albeit maybe notan important one butnot an unimportant one either butcertainly not as important as the morefoundational ones about you knowkind of how your perception of realityis constructedand construed and it seems like bitcoinis like knocking at that dooron that level of things because howcould you know how could you make a casethat it's not when it'sinspiring these types of changes in howpeople see things and how people feelthings and the meaning people ascribe tothingsyou know and and look i knowwe're having this conversation becausewe want to dig into this stuff i know alot of people might listen and thinklike you know it's way overboardbut you know we we gotta focus in on onthe ailment we're trying to exploreand then expand it in order to do itjustice and soi know this doesn't apply to everybodybut uhyou know it seems to be a veryfundamentalthing that's being changed hereright like on a very deep level yeahyeah yeah and umyou know i mean not to crack open thecan of worms that is you know adiscussion about religion but likei uh i thinkum yeah i think thei mean crack it open if you want yeahsure i'll crack it open a little i'llcrack it open a little which is likei i i'm obviously we're all speakingfrom our own subjective place right andand my my experience you know thus farin my life andi'm always open to be humbled andchanged you knowum butso far it's like i uhi've had to discover it for myselfbasically andagain it ties back to bitcoin this thingof self-sovereignty you knowbut but like um you know whateverwhatever things that i that i feel thatare you know quote unquote divine youknowit's like i've had to discover them formyself i can't take anybody's word foriti just you know i just couldn't do thatand it never felt right to meto take any one sort of thought or evensomeone else's experienceyou know i had to find for myself likethis feeling of like something othersomething biggersomething divine you know and uhand uh yeah and i guess i i i value itbecauseit it kind of is the you know one of thesort of i guessbedrocks for me you know about how ioperate andhow i feel about life um but it's mineit's not anybody else's and uh and ithink that's why it feels so good to meyou know and so strong to meum you know i'm i'm talking a littleesoterically here butbut it is kind of esoteric you know it'syeah individualum before you go on are youmoving back and forth away from your micbecause i don't mean you're kind oflike coming in now you're coming in andout a little bitget too philosophical i gotta tweak myhead left and right hereum no but i mean look this this is whatthese these sorts of conversations arefor and and likeit's it's uncertain territory right soall we can do is really fumble aroundand try toyou know try to dig within ourselves andpull out some words that make any senseof all this stuff becauselike even allowing yourself to believethat things are operating onon that level with this thing is like astretch rightyou know you kind of you're kind ofsheepish about it like am i really goingto allow myself toto go there you know to to and certainlygo there in public to suggest that likewhat we're dealing with here is like aagain word with a lot of baggage butlike a religious instrument you knowsomething with thatlevel you know that order of influenceonwho we are and how we act and and how weascribe and convey meaningright and like that's a bold assertionobviouslyum but it justagain i mean again that's why i i wantto put together this series because likei wannaopen that door about like why this iscausing peopleto change in such fundamental ways but iwould like to ask you you know you'resaying like you wantyou've always been kind of searching foryour owntruth and you didn't want to you knowaccept or swallowone that was handed down to you whetherit be religious or cultural orphilosophical orspiritual or whatever like do you haveanysense of why that is like why it was youyou wanted to discover it for yourselfwell because i think because uhbecause of that sort of transformativeexperience i had in my 20s whereit's like everything that i built sortof from the outside incrumbled and then i had no choice insome wayslike in some ways i had no choice todiscover for myself becausei felt so umyou know i don't know like the thingthat i built was gone and so then whatwas leftand and all really that you know thatwas left for me was likelike i said questions and then just thissort of painful feeling of like losslike that i'd lost you know that i'dlost something and and i just it wasjust very painfuland and and and you know not totoot my own horn or whatever butwhat i maybe one of the things i'm mostproud of is that at that timein my life when i was going when i wasfeeling so much painum that uh for what i think i thinkbecause you know i had supportive familyand whatnot butbut i uh i i managed not to likeyou know hit the booze and or or hitdrugs oryou know um sleep around a tonum not at all actually and i forwhatever reason some part of me knewthat the pain that i was going throughwaswas essential you know i don't know howi don't know how whatever ijust somehow i knew and i knew i didn'twant to hide from it becauseum yeah i don't know we're going downdifferent kind of rabbit hole here butbut somehow it's connected and yeah i uhhey man i'm i'm i'mgood with it if you are yeah yeah idon't know i don't know why you goanywhere you're not no no i'm good i'mgood i justwhatever i'm good no it's good let'slet's hit it but it was it was justuh you know it was just the thing wheresomehow inside of me i knew that if ididn't deal with thispain now it was gonna be with me nomatter whatand so you know uh yeah i justyou know those years of just dealingwith this i don't know it's weirdit's hard to describe butjust this uncomfortable painful kind ofa feelingand uh and i had an unwillingness tokind of hide from itand i think it shaped you know again idon't know knock on wood but ithink it shapedmy my years to come you know after thatwhen iwas able to emerge finally andum it just happenedit took quite a bit of time but but yeahi just remember going like i can't boozeiti just can't do it and i can't you knowchase these girls becauseum i just can't this pain is somehowimportant and it's going to teach mesomethingand i got to stick with it you know eventhough it was brutaland i don't know i mean there's peoplego through way more painful thanyou know and so i don't pretendthat it's some kind of noble thing orwhatever but umit was mine and it was for me it wasreal and andand poetry so it's it's definitely nobleat least in my opinionnot to seek the most expedient way outof a situation like thatright so girls drugs boozewhatever something else to occupy yourtime and you and your mindlike to to know that there's a reasonwhy the circumstance is making you feelso uncomfortableright and so fill in the blank emotionsandthe way to solve that you know optimallyif not for good but the way to solve itlet's say the correct wayis not just to cover it over right it'slike it's an it's an indication thatsomething needs to be addressedand um later on of course yeah yeah andi think it's likeagain back to the courage notion like ithink that's acourageous act is you know for people tosay likefor people to accept pain right forpeople to say likeyeah i'm going to you know i'm going toput up with this painbecause i know on the other side of itthere is something better there issomething right and it's kind of youknow that idea of thethe immolation right the burning off ofyou know all the the detritus or the ofof who you are of your identity of of ofyour perspectivethat's not serving you or that's foundedin delusion or fear or insecurity orwhat have youand leaving remaining that which isis true right and you know likei don't know if we can ever existin pure truth with absolute clarity witha clear perspective all that kind ofstuff you know theenlightened as it were but it does seemthat you can at leastidentify um ways tocreep toward that right by bysacrificing those elements of yourselfthat aren't serving youum and hanging out in that uncomfortableareaof of pain and discomfort andvulnerability while you search forthe things that are most truthful ofyour about yourself to then integrateand move forward withright that i mean that's thethat's the hero's journey and so manypeopleswerve on that and again like i can'thelp but think that bitcoin being whatit is as a certain form of truth andalsosomething that permits certain behaviorsis is not only kind ofdelivering a certain sense of of ofclarity to people's perspectives andallowing them to maybe construct a newperspective on on better principlesbut again that idea of confidence islike giving them thesomething like almost like somethingthat stands behind them to say likeyou know this is a sense of securityright likeno matter like if you you can kind ofrely on it to move forward with moreconfidence becauseit's a sense of security that perhapsyou've never had before and it likebecause we're always in in normally landlike a lot of people are in a situationwherelet's say their paycheck to paycheck oreven if they're not their obligationsyou know theirhouse and their car and their familyobligations all that stuff arepretty much equivalent to what's comingin right so as you say they're always onthathamster wheel and you know they too manyresponsibilities toshirk on and it just ends up making themfeellike they're a bit trapped right andthey they they can'tuh sacrifice those elements of theirself that they might or they can'tum explore themselves in the ways thatthey might because of thatand and bitcoin seems to be uhbestowing a certain sense of securitythat pushes into the futurethat is that you know giving people agreater sense that likeyeah maybe i can dig into those things alittle bit more and it's not going to bedisastrous to meor my situation or my family because ofthe security that bitcoin providesyeah and it's it's it's again sort ofwhat we touched on earlier it's likeagency and empowermentright when when and that's why the deepdive into money is so importantyou know money gets such a bad rap in somany narratives butif you deep dive into money you realizethat it's just valueyou know it's the value that you createandstore basically and this thing you knowthis bitcoin thing it's aboutit it instills kind of like agency andempowerment becausewhatever you do becomes yours yeah youknowand that's yours right importantly it'sso powerfulit's so powerful you can't underestimatethe power ofwhen you do something it's yoursyou know and not only that but that'salso very intimidating john becausethen you kind of like and i get whypeople in some ways likeuh you know they push off of bitcoinbecauseyou gotta then face like okay then it'sme it's my responsibilityit's mine it's mine there's no excusesthere's nosomebody else's it's ownership you knowand and that's uncomfortable it can bevery uncomfortable to goto not have an uh an idea as towhy not when it's just it's yours nowwhat are you gonna doyou know that's that's a difficult thingto embrace in some ways taking thatresponsibilityabsolutely and you know it kind ofthere's there's so manyinteresting parallels of bitcoin toesoteric topics and religion and stufflike that but that you knowwhat you just said makes me think of theuh the idea of the philosopher's stonein alchemyright and and which was that thethe seeking of the philosopher's stonewas the process of the individualpurification right of the person who wasseeking it and attempting toyou know construct it and and there's avery obvious parallel with bitcoin islike the more you understand it and themore you engage it the more youintegrate it and leverage the thepotential and possibilities that itrepresentsthe more it seems torequire your transformationit if not require certainlythe propensity to inspire it seems toexist and uhyou know chalk another one up for likejust a bizarre sort ofelement of of this thing butyeah i mean it seems unavoidable it doesand andyou know absolute cement i'm never i'mnever umi'm never too keen on likeyou know throwing out absolutes but manthis thingthis thing's got like yeah this thing'sgot legsit's uh let me ask you a question umand i don't think this is going tohappen but of course it's possible andwhen there's so much hope uh andreliance on somethingyou know it's it's a necessary thoughtexercise i thinkwhat happens if it goes away right itfails bug in the codestate attack like you know we don't haveto go into the validity of the foot ijust meanphilosophically speaking like if it goesawayhow does that affect you would you thinkthat's a great questioni mean i don't know for sure uh you knowhopefully we don't find out butyeah if i was to hazard aguess umi don't know something i mean you knowit had such an incredible beginningi mean you're stumping me here um i iwant to say it's not going away but umuh for me i don't know what would happeni don't know i mean i don't know whatthe results would be i i i don't thinkthe process would change much thoughyou know like the thing in me that hasit has and continues to embrace thatlike i gottai gotta create something that i'mcreating my world that i'm creating mylifei don't think that's going away i don'tcare there's ijust don't see a bug going into thatcode you knowso um that's gonna stayand uh it would be greatyou know if the tools were out therethat sort of aligned and supported thatbut that in me is not going awayum so i don't know if that answers yourquestion butyeah i mean there's there's no rightanswer obviously i mean somethingyou know i'm just as wrapped up in thisas anyone andso i asked myself that question and youknow it would obviously be devastatinguh and i think it wouldremove the element of hope that bitcoinrepresents isincredibly powerful uh and i think morepowerful thanmaybe a lot of people appreciate and ifthat's removedum you know that that would be difficultbutone of the things that i think i wouldtake some solace in is thati've already connected with so manygreat people that were brought togetherbythis thing and you know if if the toolwent awaythat would be devastating and and thosepeople wouldbe far less capable of offor you know advancing the cause thatthey were a part of andbuilding what they wanted to buildbecause you knowwe we derive a lot of obviously powerand benefit from having this tool andit's sucking all of us in and when thatgoes awaymaybe there'd be some dispersion anddespondence anduh you know and obviouslyless effective means of of pursuing whatwhat seems to be a coalescence ofof certain principles and goals in thein the quote-unquote communitybut still having you know havingidentified a lot ofhaving leveraged that tool to identify alot of people thatline up on on similar things and arepursuinguh certain ideas you know maybe chiefamong them truthuh is you know would still be a blessingand hopefullyyou know something would come out of ofthat nevertheless but um definitely imean i ii i i'm an eternal optimist i don't knowi get i guess maybe in some ways ialways have beenand i know that that bitcoin is justchanneling what's already thereyou know what i mean like well it's justbehavior at the end of the dayright i mean it's still just us i meanif it's a really funny thing rightbecausewe could actin many ways like we we could act wecould have always actedas though bitcoin existed right but thejust the thing is like at scale we don'tright we don't trust each other enoughwe don't the the constraints on ourbehavior are such thatpeople br people bend and break them andthe more people that burn and break themthe you know the more people that bendand break them furtherum but you're right i mean all this isjust behaviorand it's just that this thing is kind ofestablishing new parameters for thatbehavior andi guess we're agreeing that those aregood parameters and they're usefulparameters and we want to try tooptimize themyeah this stuff's uh it's it's it's youknow it'slike i said it's it's behaviorthat's already there it's mojo that'salready there and and for whateverreason you know this bitcoin isit's channeling it and and you know likelike to answer your question again if itwent downyou know if it went down it would suckbut umi think that um i think thatsomething else would you know anothertool would emerge at some pointum and again my eternal optimism is thatyou know um thatthings just think when things get badthey get bad becauseum they're gonna get good again you knowand it's a bit of the fourth turningthingum where uhyeah you um you know i just have thisthis sort of profound sense thatthat um and i guess that's what keeps mepretty happy and pretty optimistic abouteverything and pretty hopeful abouteverything is thati think that every every time thingswhen things turn downand turn dark you know the old darkestbefore the dawn it's likeit's it's necessary you know it'snecessary to emergeand um yeah so things for me are alwaysgonna they're always gonna end up withyou know a rebirth and a new thing andyou knowsomething brighter so i i say that withthis sort of likeominous dark voice but um no it's it's averyyou know it's a beautiful thing you knowthatwhatever it's weird i mean you know ifeel lucky as soit's kind of easy for me to say but yeahialways had that i always had that sortof sense that when things get bad it'sjust becausethey got to get bad in order to get goodyou know something like yeahwell hopefully we can avoid the extentto which things get badas a result of bitcoin being in the mixnow because uhyou know we certainly have a lot ofinstances where things got pretty bad soif we can uh if we can mitigate how deepdown we go that would be a good thingbut um dude i know you're uhyou're on a schedule but i did want toask you know this has all been pretty 10000 feet at this point but you knowsince getting involvedin bitcoin like are there are therematerial or concrete or identifiablethings that have changed in like yourday-to-day lifeuh you know as a result of let's saythis this reorientation of perspectivethat we've been exploringsell everything baby just sell it[Music]sell it all you don't need any of this look around you you don't needwhat do you mean you just distilleverything into sass is that what you'resayingyeah that's what i'm saying uh no youknow it's like distill's a great wordyou know likeit's just an another another sort ofpiece of my life we're like oh yeahlike it's just it's just another mirrorsaying like asking me likewhat's important to me you know like isthisimportant to me and and and most of thetimeyou know it just helped me distill downlike what i value basicallyyou know it puts put put me in tune withlike value itselfand then made me go what do i value likewhat's really important to meand the stuff that you know may havepreoccupied my time and my attentionbefore just slowly starts to just erodeyou know um it's hard to describe why orhow it happens buti just started to sort of say likewhat's important to me you know what'smorewhat's important to me i'm a dad now youknow i'm a husband nowi'm got this partnership i got thislittle one that i'm raisingyou know i've got my family and myfriendsum i got my health you know i want tobe happy healthy and full of energy foras long as i canit's like what are the things that aremost important to me i love being innatureuh i love time i love just having timeum so anything that didn't fit with thisyou know and this you know it'scontinually evolving picture of likeyou know what makes my life feel good tome whathow is my life valuable to meum and you know that and that's not tosay it's a totally selfish thing rightbecauseum helping other people um being withother peopleyou know um you know iti mean again it sounds a little tritebut like helping otherslike i like it like when i can you knowoffer something to someone else like ibenefityou know so um you know i'm big into umfor lack of a better way of describingi'm big into selfishnesslike and and maybe we you know in thecommunity or whateverpeople call it more like sovereignsovereignty or whatever but likethere's something important about like adegree of selfishness like what'swhat do i want you know what's importantto melike what do i want my life to be likeyou knowum and so you know bitcoins just reallyhelped meyou know helped me distill those thingsdown even furtherum and man when i you know busted my ownnodeand you know you know got my cold cargoing and um got my multi-staging andit's just a weird feeling to be likethis ismine like i'm doing this you know i'mholding this valueno one's gonna get to it umno one's no one's diluting it you knowliterally figuratively it's likeit feels good like it just feels good tobei i'm saying the same thing over andover again but it's something about thisfeeling of empowerment and agency youknowand uh yeah and i and i feel it more andmore every dayand it helps me distill down more andmore every dayand again i just feel so grateful for ityou know it's just another thing and youknow i'm looking forward to what's aheadbecause you know there's so much thatstill don't know what's coming but um itfeels good to sitand be you know sit and listenlisten to this thing listen to what'scoming you knowum make intuitive choices like you knowmoremore specifically like we made some youknowkind of big choices you know we kind ofwe sold where we were living we sold outof therewe left the the city umum even like like i got a bit of acareer change going now that's sort ofbeginning again and um just trying toembrace likegoing with what feels right now you knowthrowing away thethrowing away the blueprint and justkind of feeling intuitivelylike you know creatively like what'swhat am i gonna do nowum yeah and i don't know i mean it's allcoincided with bitcoin somehow soum i'm digging itsell everything baby just sell it thatthat sounds like aphenomenal place to put a pin on thisthing so umyeah unless unless you have any uh finalcomments man i've really enjoyed thisconversation and of course i appreciateyou being soopen and sharing your thoughts and yourexperiences and you know howhow this has impacted you yeah man imean ditto for meyou know i i've listened to you uh for along time now and uhi'm grateful to be uh just having thecombo with you you know you're doinggreat stuff and uh it's uhyou know it's a it's important you knowhow we communicate with one another youknow and how we areto one another like this you know ourconversationand and and many others that i've hadand you know hopefully we'llwe'll keep having but yeah it's justit's uhi don't know it's hard to describe itbut yeah it's it's justhow you communicate is almostmore important than what's beingcommunicated but that'sthat's kind of how i've beencharacterizing it 100yeah 100 and that john we could go downa whole new rabbit hole with thatlike and it's it's stuff maybe we'll doit again at some point but thistheme that you just brought up how youcommunicate versus what you communicateepic it's just epic um so yeah maybewe'll do it again at some point butuh let's do it man yeah i appreciate itman i love youbut um i'll i'll hit you up again andwe'll we'll dive back insounds great all right brother take careof yourself all right brother see youcheersand we're liveum today is going to be one of thosebitcoinand behavior episodes uh as many of youknowi've been really enjoying uh observingand digging deeper into the personalchanges that result from engaging withlearning about bitcoini think it's probably one of the mostfascinating aspects of this wholephenomenonand i have bang bitcoin with me heretoday who's going to remain anonymousto share some of his thoughts and someof his story but firsti do want to thank uh the sponsor of theshow the bitbox o2bang right there um bitcoin only editionfor myself of course and um yeah this isa great hardware walletum i'm advising a lot of people to buybitcoin now and have been for the lastseveral yearsuh and the more complicated step isalways telling them how to secure it andtake custody for themselves because thatis acrucial aspect of uh buying and owningbitcoinand uh i've been really enjoying playingaround with the bitbox o2um it's a super smooth easy easy to usehardware wallet i've even gone fullpsychopathand cut out tiny littleseed words so i can randomly select myown seed phrase becausethe wallet allows you to do that you canof course roll it and it of coursegenerates it for you as well if youprefer thatthat approach with a random numbergeneratorit connects to your own node it has coinselection a lot of great featuresand i found it's good for someone withmore experience that wants to domulti-sig stuffas

five percent off bangbitcoinwhat's up baby hey johnhow you doing i'm good i'm good manit's uh it's good to uh it's good totalk to you i'vebeen listening to you for a while and soit's pretty cool to uhi get to beat you and uh and have thischatyeah man i'm looking forward to this toowe've been uhyou know going back and forth on dms foron twitter for a whileyeah and you've always got uh you knowyou knowenthusiasm and things that you want todiscuss and uhi thought you know now that i'm i'mtrying to do a more of a dedicatedyou know series or approach to speakingto peopleuh that you know have a particular storyto share with regards to bitcoin andand how it's changed them i thought nowis the time to uh to put this thingtogether soi know you're obviously maintaining acertain degree of privacy sohow do you want to kick this thing offwhat's top of your mindum well i meanfirst i mean first i want to say uh umit's just cool what you're doingyou know i mean that's kind of like thefirst thing you know it's a it's a weirdthing to to reach out on twitter tosomebody you don't knowi mean it's even weirder to to um tolisten to peopleyou know discuss things and then get thesense thatoh like i i would get along with thatguy you know like i want to meet thatguy i love whati love your show and i love what you'redoing and so i just sort of had thissense of likeyou know i i want to reach out to youand it's weird to reach out withsomebody you don't know butum you know i don't know i guess i i tryto live likeinstinctually and uh and uh just trusttrust my instincts so yeah that's why ikept badgering you basicallywell i appreciate that man and that'sthat's the cool part aboutbeing in bitcoin you know like i don'twant to suggest that we're all the samebut we are operating on a similarwavelength you know soit makes it that much more easy likei've i've done a bunch of these thingsnow whereyou know we haven't talked before andhere we are you know striking up a livestreamand just the fact that i can have theconfidence to do thatuh and think that you know theconversations are you knowa best case scenario going to beinteresting but you know evenjust not a a complete train wreck is iskind of a miracle in itself but it justit just speaks to like how uhi guess how aligned or how uh you knowthe shelling point of bitcoin that'sthat's bringing a lot of similar peopletogether andchanging people in a lot of similar waysso that i think we can we canjive so easily and so uh you know soseemingly randomlyyeah there's definitely somethingthere's definitely something going onyou knowit's uh it's pretty undeniableand uh yeah i mean you canyou can see it i mean you can see it nowseeping everywhere into the mainstreamand whatnotum and i mean i just i just jumped ontotwitterin the last what six months for thefirst time it's really my firstforay into any social media whatsoeveris uh being on bitcoin twitterand uh i just gotten so much out of italreadyum it's just really cool yeah well thisisyou know we were talking about this verybriefly before we started andyou know it's in my opinion it's agenuine culture that's emerging you knowand it'svery early stages and the i the ideasand the ethics and theyou know uh all that the all thedifferent elements of the culture arestillswashing around and being sorted out butlike it's i think it's pretty clear ifyoustep back from it for a second that itit's you know certainly a countercultureandyou know i think many bitcoiners wouldargue on its way to becomingdominant culture at some point in thefuture and and here we are allcontributing to it and figuring it allout and experiencing changes withinourselves and throwing them out into themix andyou know on this fairly rapid i wouldsayprocess of refining our understanding ofwhat this all isand and also contributing toit becoming something that you know wehave a vague idea of what it's becomingbutreally not not a super clear one yeah imeani mean you know my beginning into thisuh was like early 217 andi mean the the reason why it's like ii'm not i'm not technicallysavvy although i'm getting better youknow and uh and i'm prettyyou know stoked about how intimidatingit is to like dive in there but you knowget in there so now i'm running my ownnode and uhand you know got my own uh multi-stakething going and it's justawesome um you know i guess confrontingthe fear the technicalfor me um but when i startedum the thing that drew me in so muchwas the people like ii i guess i i won't say i pride myselfbuti think one of the things i've alwaysrelied on in my life was myintuition about people and and i kind ofyou know just kind of used it toi guess make my way in in some ways andum when i first when the seed was sortof first plantedi mean the questions came from were inmy life for a long timeabout money and they were just kind ofwhispers you knowthey were just whispers and and and thenthey just got louder and louder andwhen i f then dove inand and this thing i mean i can tell youwhen i first when i first heard aboutbitcoinlike the the moment i heard about itlike something went binglike i and it's weird i was watchingthose umyou know they're a little bitoverproduced but those uh mike maloneyvideos on uh thehidden secrets of money or whatever andtowards the end ofone of the episodes he sort of says youknow he's sort of asking the questionswhat will it be it could be this itcould be thatit could be this new thing of bitcoinand as soon as i heard it i was likethere's something there's somethingthere like immediatelyand uh and so i dove in and just startedtoresearch as much as i could you know imean in 217 there wasn't nearly as muchas there is now four years later butum it was out there you know there werepeople still doing stuffand um yeah and like i said the thingthatthat drew me in was um when i listenedto people talklike from the bitcoin space people thathad conviction about bitcoini was struck by how how many people werehighly intelligentbut also like not umlike it's like the difference betweenlike umlike intelligence and um overanalyzing do you know what i mean likethere's there's a highly intelligentcomponent to the people in the space butthey're also very humanand and grounded and the intelligencehas a wisdom to it it's not just aknowledgedoes that make sense it makes totalsense you know and i i think there's somany examplesof you know new so many people cominginto the space now of course and i thinkthere's a lot of examples where that'snot present or that's not the case rightthere's a verynarrow knowledge and and perhaps anextreme intelligencebut which lacks the broader wisdom toassess what's going on properlyyeah and i you know i totally agree youknow oneit's such i mean it's such a phenomenonthat you you come into a space where andii usually term it you know i don't usethe term wisdom although it's perfectlyreasonable in you know that you thatyou're using iti usually just use the term clarityright like i you know i thinkintelligence is one thing but havinglike a broaderclarity of perspective about all how allthe pieces ofthe reality puzzle fit together and youknow of course nobodynone of us have a full picture of thatbut i do think bitcoinershave both like you know highly specificumlike domain expertise on the one handbut it's it's it coincides witha you know a broader clarity ofperspective that allows them tokind of understand how their expertisefits into the whole and howand how to juggle the two almost mostoptimally or certainlymore optimally than it seems like a lotof people in in the broader society youknow in normal in norman world seem toto do yeah and i mean to this day i'mstill struck by itlike i'm just struck by the number ofpeople and the newinflux of people that are just brightyou know like bright people andum and they're inspired andand they're working their asses off forbitcoin uhyou know it i i laugh to myselfsometimes because i think i'm just soso damn lucky because i'm like i thinkmyself like every time i buy bitcoinit's like all these peoplelike there's an army of people makingbitcoin betterand every time i buy a little bit it'slike i benefit fromyou know this just yeah it's an armyand and it and it's um the kind ofpeople that i just diglike you know people that are ballsyintelligent but stillhuman about the whole thing and like yousaid yeah broaderyou know broader context the thephilosophy ijust all of it is just soit's very it's very unique you know andand one of the things that i love aboutit toois you know bitcoin is ais a is a proposition ofprinciples right like it says like herei am thisopen decentralized immutablecensorship-resistantyou know honest fair you knowmeritocratic systemright do you accept mesort of thing and and if you're someonethat says yes i iaccept you i accept these these rules iaccept these principlesi think they then you know almostnecessarily uh impact peoplewith similar or almost imbuepeople with similar principles if theydecide to accept them and soyou know that's one of the things that ii love so much about this space andobviously there's exceptions but um itis a is a principledbehavior right it is principles ofhonestyand integrity umand and truthfulness right and andforthrightness like andand uh yeah yeah and and many more andthose those are those are wonderfulthings that you don't see in many placestodayyeah it's it's it's incredible and it'sincredible that it that it'soriginating with a protocol like like tome it justit's mind-boggling you know that a pieceof softwareis you know an open source piece ofsoftware is out there workingdoing this thing and yeah like to yourpoint it's likei mean sometimes when i when i sit backand think about it it's like thismachinethat just you know the block after blockafter block and it's just thisum assertion or this likeit's like a yes and a no you know kindof reminds me even of the computer theon off the ones and the zeros it's likeit's a yes yep this transaction it'slegitit's like it's a it's a constant sort oflikeheartbeat of like this is the truth thisis the truththis is the truth and and as you keepbouncing up against ityeah it's just wild what happens like ii don't knowi don't know exactly how it happens butthere's something about it that theheartbeat of thatof the bitcoin blockchain it's just likethe truth of it just starts to likeyou know i don't know i'm moving my handhere just kind of likelike a heartbeat and and and it just itis a frequencyyou know and it does uh it just startsto impact youthe more you bounce up against it it'snot it's not changing you know it it'sdoing the same thingagain and again and again and and themore you bounce up against it it startsto affect youum it's really cool yeah i think it ithas an interesting propensity also toyou know we say this a lot in the spaceand a lot of peoplenot in the space probably don'tunderstand what we mean but that it kindof reveals the truth about people and ithinkjust an aspect of that is that itsproposition is so bold and bare righteverything i justarticulated about the openness and thefairness like that's whatit's proposing and if you agree withthat and youintegrate it then that says somethingabout you right if you resist itand you you criticize it and you decryit well that says something about youtooright it's like it's like it's like thejudgment that can't be escaped right ifyou even come withinyou know uh if it enters your awarenessor if you come within itsit's uh you know domain let's sayit's almost like you're necessarilyjudged by how you how youinteract or don't interact how youengage or don't how youhow you criticize or or praise you knowlike because itis you know those unchanging principlesso the only thing that can really beuh you know assessed for reaction is youand uh it's it's you know and we seethis playing out all the time right wesee we see new people come in andum and the culture that's grown uparoundthat fundamental proposition isobviously an extension of thatand so that's the cyber hornets rightthat's that's peoplethat um kind of are the active principleof that judgmentof those principles inherent in thatsystem and you knowmaybe sometimes they go in the you knowa little bit overboard but i actuallydon'tthink that's the case i i thinkmy observation of a lot of you knowpeople say toxicity right which i iactuallyentirely reject i i think it's uma playful test of character because iknow a lot of thesepeople and obviously have interactedwith them a lot and you knowthey are happy playfuluh loving supportive people a lot oftime imperfect of course butum when they when people come inand it's it becomes evident that umthere's a conflict between them andlet's say the system is as odd as i knowthat soundsum i think you know the hornets theimmune system just kind of poke and prodto try to reveal more of the characterof these people andyou may not like that that's the casebut again i do think we'rea culture is emerging here and it onlymakes sense thatthe culture at large and theparticipants within that culturewould want to to understand deeplywho's coming into it right because umthere is an ethic and there areprinciples that permeate that cultureand i think that response isis perfectly natural apply a littlepressure and see what's revealedabout the character of people that arepresuming to enter itand and we know how that plays out ifyou come inwith humility and uh adesire to understand the truth umand you know uhyou know not taking yourself tooseriously in a playfulness then you'regonna be welcome with open arms andyou're gonna besubsumed into the culture you knowalmost immediately but if you resist orif you havearrogance or you lack humility or youpresume to knowyou know fill in the blank then you'regoing to probablyuh continue to get uh pressed andprodded and pokedand how you respond to that is is verytelling and you knowthere's been some funny instances ofthat recently with lax oror eric or whomever but um yeahyeah it reminds me of uh reminds me abit ofthe great uh stand-up comedians wherethey uh it's like the you knowthey push and um they poke and they pushand they they do it to see likehow will you respond you know like howwill you respond to whatwhat i'm throwing at you and like yousaid it it reveals right it's it's a bitof a mirrorum and it's very cool to see yeah i meanyou knowi love it i do too i mean you know i'mwith you the hornets it's likethere's sometimes where i'm like oh mandid we did we just do that you know andi'm saying we because i feel such a youknowi don't know i just feel a union withwith this you know did we just go therei'm like okay let's see let's see whathappenswe'll see it's so you know it's soridiculous sometimes but that's thebeauty likethat's the beauty of you rightthat's that's saying like it it's almosta test to see if you can really you knowsee the truth behindthe action right yeah like and and torealize that these are people whodon't care about your opinion but whoare willing to engage with you andinteract and and even develop strongrelationships with you if you acceptthatthat premise you know that that they cando what they want to do and you can dowhat you want to doand the system treats everyone the sameregardless and umit's very it's very it's very human youknow and i think it'si actually think it's really importantbecause especially nowyou know in in in the world that we'reliving in right nowit's so important for people to bechallenged on what they hold to besacredit's so important because there is anelevatedsort of level of quote-unquotesacrednessyou know to to so much of like oursociety right nowand it's and it's so important thatthere are these gatekeepers that arealways bashing it downlike like breaking it and uhbecause i i if if we get tooif we get too um obsessedwith these ideas like with ideas aboutthingsand identifying with things it'sdangerousyou know and it's so it's so importantfor people toit's so important to have this immunesystem that kind of attacks in a wayyou know if you can attack if you cankeep attacking thingsum to kind of reveal their essenceyou know like really reveal theiressence because you know we'recomplicatedwe're complicated things you know wehave all these ideas about thingsbut really and that's why i love bitcoinso much it's like first principles canyou go backand see what's underneath it and thenwhat's underneath that and what'sunderneath that until you can distill itdown you knowbut you know all too often in the worldi thinkespecially you know whatever i don'twant tobe negative about anything but i'm not afan of like you know a lot of academiaand stuff like that where it's likethere's there's anobsession with kind of like umoverthinkingover analysis identification with ideasas thoughyou know there's some ideas that are themost important andyeah i just like wheni like when people can find a deepertruthlike yeah and if and if you find adeeper truth or feel a deeper truththen you don't get shaken out right likepeople can come at you with stuffthe hornets can attack you but if you'reif you'reif you feel strong about what you knowand who you areit's not going to bother you that muchyeah you know you know what i meantotally and i think that's part of thereason why bitcoininstills such confidence in people it'sit's because likeyou know for all the benefits and newnovel behaviors that it permitsyou know the protection of your yourmoney your your savings your sacrificehowever you want to characterize itum it doesn't likeit doesn't matter what anybody says toyou about itright and i think you know that givesyou a confidence to go into the frayyou know go into the the melee and justyou know try stuff test stuff proposestuffsmash ideas together assert yourselfwithdraw from it because you know likenone of none of those barbs none ofthose attacks if they even areyou know truly attacks and not playfulsparringuh none of it matters you're still goodyeah right soto have that confidence i think that youknow that'sthat's what's required to pursue youknow pursue truth almost right like youhave to havelike some kind of an anchor and i thinkthat bitcoin is providing that forpeopleto allow themselves you know the wholeidea of becoming uncancible and ofcourseyou know most people aren't are yet tobecompletely uncancible but the fact thatyou're sovereign over your moneyis like the the major step right andonce you have that establishedi think people are finding that elementsof theirpersonality or even you know justit's giving them an opportunity to askdeeper questions about themselves andthen havethe confidence and freedom to actuallybegin expressingthose things whether it be in theirpersonal life for their career oror wherever and trying to you knowcontinuing and perhaps even acceleratingthat journeyof understanding themselves and becomingthat person thatmaybe that previously they thought theythey wanted to or could bebut were inhibited in some way ordiscovering thatyou know there's a whole new person thatthey didn't know they could be that thisisgiving them you know this is empoweringthem to be able tostrive for in a more confident or moreeffectiveway and uh it's aand i think it's all because that thatkind of one little seed of ofof confidence and sovereignty isbleeding out into all these other areas100 percent and and of course it's donewith suchyou know uh incredible irony and humoryou know like thisthe meme lords right i mean it's justincredibleand and you know the meme of likeyou money like you said fu moneyit's like i mean the word that comes tomind is when you distill it down pastthe humor and theyou know the meme of it it's like theword that comes to mind is like agencyand it's just such a powerful force youknowbecause it's at the heart of everythingthat gets builtlike everything that gets built byhumans is about you know a human beingsensing oh i got something i want to putit out there i want to make somethingyou know and yeah there's somethingaboutum there's something that happens whenyousense that um the value that you haveum that you create is yoursif something happens and like you saidthe theyou know for me it's like agency emergesand thena person starts to feel more confidentmore able tosort of plumb themselves for like youknow who am iwhat is this what am i doing here whatyou know what am i gonna what am i gonnadois there something that i really want todo versusyou know this other thing which is likethere's a systemthat i got a game and i got to play somekind of ayou know game to win this game thatdoesn't feel right to me to play anywaysbut uh i guess i'm supposed to do it youknowversus this other thing that that startsto emerge from within that's organicthat's likeoh this is this is what i i want to dothis isyou know where i feel drawn uminspired it's just a completelydifferentum way to approachyou know your the way you operate in theworld and uhit's just awesome i think i think that'sa great point and i i think that's whyyou know if you look at the culture orthe community insofar as it'srepresented on twitter which obviouslyislimited um that's why there's such ajoyful playfulness right like there'sthere'sjoy and happiness in the community and ithink part of that is for the veryreason you just articulated it's likepeople's prior life is you're born intothe systemyou're kind of forced down a funnel ofdoing things that you don't really findthat meaningful but it'sthe way to game the system that you findyourself inand then you grow up and you kind offind yourself i don't really like theway this system operates as the more youlearn andlearn about it and then you feel badabout yourself because you're you'reforced to conform to a system you don'tyou don't believe in right that youdon't you don't think is right andalmost nothing could be moresoul-destroying than that and i know youknowboth myself and i've talked to a lot ofpeople in previous careers or inprevious jobs that they've hadthat's the very way they characterizethem is soul destroying it's like ii hated getting up in themorning and going and doing that but you knowwhat was i supposed to do you know i'dspent this many years in school to dothatand i'd been you know my family had kindof put me down this pathor my obligations or you know all thatkind of stuffand then to find this new system and tounderstand the principles on which it'spredicatedand to see the culture emerging arounditand uh to be able to engage it and thenalso to be able to use itto extricate yourself from the old oneand make that transition to the new andi'm not talking about like getting a jobin bitcoin i just mean likeusing bitcoin as a savings technology toyou knowsiphon off what you were able to buildin that up that old system and bring itinto this new oneand then empower you to continue kind ofunpackingyourself so that you can get back to aplace where you actuallyyou know both believe in the system andfind meaning in the things you're doingand therefore believe in yourself andtherefore feel happier and thenand therefore feel more joy and that'swhyi think there's so much of that in thisspace because like it's likerejoicewe've got you know we've we've gotsomething uh we've got a better thinghere now we've got somethingthat's principle that's right that'sgood that canlead to the expression of you know uhwhat we think is right and who we reallyare and anda fairer way of organizing all thatstuff likere-fucking joyce right yeah when you heywhen you're free like truly when you ifyou if you've ever experiencedlike you know the feeling of freedom inyour life if you're notif you're not you know rejoicing andhappy and having you knowfun with it then you haven't felt it yetyou know becausebecause feeling free is that thing youyou rejoiceand uh yeah it's it's yeah it's so sweeti meanand you know what you're saying that'swhy i take an issue with with peoplethatdecry the toxicity because i'm just likeman you could not be further from the truth youyou are just blanking on this one hardjust because there's something in youthat's resisting itwell that and you know it's not easy todeal with the gestureright i mean right it's not the gestureisuh you know the gesture is poignantand and uh and and pushes in a way thatmakes people uncomfortableum but and and it's always there'salways a bit of tongue in cheek you knowbut it's razor sharp intelligence at thesame time you know the gesture is sowise soi mean i love it i love it it's almostit's almost like you know i've neverthought of it in this way butfamiliar with the character of thegesture but it's almost like the jesteris likea tool for development right becauselike yeah the jesteror the cyber hornets right if they ifwhat they do offends youthat should be a signal to you it's likewhat about itin me is it is it triggering that i'mbeing offended by it right becausethat'sthat's probably an indication that ineed to unpack somethingright they're they're almost providing aservice you know like they're they'rehelping you mine yourself for the placeswhereyou know you haven't uh exploredsomething maybe adequatelyadequately and i you know i i guess youknow the analogy of the gesture is ais a apt one there yeah there's a reasonwhy the gesture was always so close tothe king rightright and the king always kept thejester closethe only one who could like reallycriticize him sort of thingyeah criticize him and uh make him laughat the same time and teach himyou know i gotta get more into thati haven't looked at injustice very muchbut yeah well the jester the joker righti mean it's it's it's it's uh it's init's it's a universal somehow you knowthis theme of the joker is the jester umyeah it's a really and one of the greatcharacters written of all time too thejoker the jesterbut speaking about like what you weresaying earlier this thing of likeyou know the matrix is you know thematrix gets thrown around obviously inthe in the zeitgeist and uhand uh and bitcoin reminds me ofum you know it reminds me of umthe humanness involved in like you knowlike what we're talking about before thethe idea of the system and and youyou know if you um sort of get involvedin a system thatyou think you got to be on the you knowthe treadmill the wheeland then suddenly you discover thatmaybe you don't you know and like i liketo seeor i think of like a human's life aslikeum it you know it's very simple and verycomplicated you know because we comeinto the worldand i have a three-year-old now you knowa daughterand and she's teaching us so muchobviously umbut but you see that that um you knowbarring anyunfortunate kind of you know traumaticevent or anything theyou know we come into the world and andwe've justwe've got genius on tap they're just soable toto to take everything in and they're soaware of everything andand uh but they're also so extremelydependentand it's it's really a unique uhit's just a really unique thing becausewe come into the world and we're kind ofhardwiredfor um survival but in order to do so wekind of have to look outwardyou know like we have to look at ourparents or our caregivers or whateverand we've got to adapt to them in ordertosurvive and so we're always lookingoutward lookingupward you know towards the the biggerhumanyou know the authority the caregiver tosurviveand so it's kind of in us you know it'sit's kind of programmed into us in orderto surviveyou got to be able to adapt to what'soutside of youum and and then as you get olderi mean this is my experience and that'swhy i'm sharing it butas you get older and you start to sortof uh get your feet under you moreyou know you might start to ask morequestions you know it depends on ifyou're if you're lucky enough to havepeople around you that care about youand support you and whatnotand don't make it too hard for you imean sometimes when peopleyou know face really adverse stuff theyyou know they mutateand they and they still make it you knowto the other side butit's more difficult i think but yeah ifyou get if you get some support and youstart to sort ofhave the space to ask your own questionsyou start to sort of see that oh wait asecond i don'ti don't need to calibrate off what'sgoing on outside of meyou know i i don't i actually don't needtoum look at the system and game thesystem i mean it doesn't happen foreverybodyum but something like bitcoin i thinkactually is thatthat truth wall that you can kind ofbump intoand it can like you said uh well it canaffect youand maybe wake you to this thing that islikeum i no longer have to look outside ofmyselffor what's what's what i must do andmaybe i could find it within myself youknow and that was my journey you knowwhen i was in my twentiesi had so many questions about everythingand i had no answerslike i just couldn't get any answersabout any of the questions andit was difficult because you know if youreallydo have questions about how things areand you really don't feel like there'sanswers out therethen you kind of got to find them foryourself in some ways likeand maybe not in some ways you really doyou know umand or kind of give up which a lot ofpeople do also which is a tragedyexactly that that's the other optionright you abdicate and you just sort offall in lineyou fall into the system you you sort ofsayyou know what the my well whatever idon't know if people do it consciouslyor not but likemy programming of like other people knowbetteryou know other people will guide me youknow authority willso much easier yeah it's it's easier andit's in us right so it's almost likeif it's almost like you gotta you gottayou know you gotta have a rebirthof some sort you know i mean it soundskind of cliche butit and and when you do or if you doit's it it's intimidating and and it'skind of scary i thinkto go to say to oneself like ahno one has the answers like i gotta findthemyou know i gotta find them for myself ithink that's an excellent pointand i think it's something that you knowsadlyuh has not up till this pointprevailed in that many people i think alot of people takethe comfortable route the one that'sthat's known right because it's so muchharder to determine things for yourselfwhenyou know a nice nicely packagednarrative is lotis is laid out for you when you enterinto the world andall you got to do is adopt it and thingsbecome a lot more certain and whodoesn't like certainty and who doesn'tlike comfortum and as you say you know umthis idea yeah i've been reading a lotof jordan peterson stuff recently andthis idea of sacrifice and it's not justlike the grand sacrifice it'sa sacrifice on a daily basis ofwho you currently are and all thedifferent associations and identitiesand perceptions that lead to youbecoming that personsacrificing that daily for who you mightbecome with greaterclarity with a different perception withmore wisdom with more knowledge etcand so to and that's kind of the that'sthebehavior of the hero is the one who'sall like whoshows up every time with the courage tosacrifice themselves for who they mightberight for for that who's willing to putthemplace themselves in that uncomfortableposition of uncertainty once againjust because they know that there'sthere's something better that liesbeyondthat will be more truthful be more clearand be a more ultimately beneficialperspectivefor them in constructing a you know ajoyfulhappy truthful uh you know righteouslife and i know that last word is fairlyum carries a lot of religious baggagebutyou know that that is the idea of thehero and and ii think we could all relate to the thecourage that it takes and this iswe've been discussing this themethroughout this conversation so far toto show up and and say i don't knowand you know whether and again thishappens on all scales constantlybut say i'm you know i'm i'm willing toto be the fool in order to uhyou know gain wisdom and gain uhknowledge as i move forward and the thethe the courage to consistently be thefool isis is a is a genuine form of of courageand what i think about bitcoinis that you know i think it has theeffect of being like aa great deconditioning machinealmost you know like we come in as yousaid to the world andthrough our family and through ourculture and stuff we getinculcated with a great many thingsright and this is our conditioning andthis is why wethink and speak and act in various waysdifferent fromculture to culture and it almost seemslike in a way bitcoin is this thing thathas its own first principles right theseprinciples ofyou know fairness and meritocracy andopenness andand uh incorruptibility and these sortsof thingsuh upon you know that that when peoplereally start tounderstand it and go down that rabbithole almost serves toto decondition a lot of things they werethey wereinculcated with and built back up fromthose principles from that place ofmaybe a more solid maybe a moreum valid groundum and i i you know again i think thisis part of the reasonwhy we see these dramatic personalchanges because their their perspectivehas beenyou know they've been deconditioned to acertain degree and then theirperspective has beenyou know fairly dramatically reorientedaround these things and i think theproof is inin the pudding that it's that's probablya beneficial thingyeah yeah absolutely yeah i meanagain if i share a bit of my personalside it's likei went up until my you know mid-20s andmy whole my whole world was about likewhat do other people think is goodyou know what what are others value whatdo others umesteem and i followed that you know andyou know i i happen to be you knowpretty good at certain thingsso i got really good at the things thati thought other people valuedand uh and i think i was probablyperceived you know i meani can't say for sure but i think i wasprobably perceived like oh very you knowsuccessful personyou know very good at this very good atthat and i thought you know this isthis is the way but i was alwayswonderinglike i you know i always found myselfkind of going like there's got to besomething elseyou know i was always thinking there'sgot to be something else umand i built this you know i built this iyou knownot to be critical of myself but yeah ididn't know any better but i built thiskind of like facadeyou know of like who i was um and ithink a lot of peopleadmired me for it in some waysand uh and i was lucky enough you knowi was lucky enough in my uhin my mid-20s to have a relationship endand feel like a ton of you know just aton of pain aroundthe loss for a relationship and it justcracked me like you kind ofyou know everything that i thought thati had kind of perfectedand built up suddenly was just shaken upcompletelyand um yeah and then i started toyou know slowly get begin my journey oflike discovering it for myselfum and it was painful it was painful tokind of build up build something thatyou know from the outside in essentiallyand then have it all fall apartand then have to like start againyou know with just questions umbut yeah and so i guess when i bumpedinto bitcoin i was like oh thisis like you know this is i don't know itjustresonated with me umand i think it's just something aboutthe truth of it you know the simpletruth of itum yeah and i mean i can't stop now ican't stop i'm so i'm so obsessedlike you know i'm one of those peoplejohn that's likeyou know uh like i i want to talk aboutit all the time you knowand it's like my family and friends it'slike you know and they can see mesitting there being quiet and they'relike i know you just want to talk aboutbitcoinbut we do it all the time so you knowlet's talk about something else butyou know everything else kind of likepales you know it just starts to palei used to i used to read a bunch i usedto i used toyou know watch a bunch of movies youknow i used to love storiesum and now it's like it's likei i don't want to occupy my psychicspaceyou know i don't want anybody elsetelling me the stories anymoreyou know it's like i just value my ivalue my timeso much now um more than ever and i justdon't want ityou know i just don't want i want to bein charge of my time and my psychicspaceand yeah and bitcoin just you knowjust keeps scratching me where i itch soi'm great i thinki think we all suffer from thataffliction you know like we'rewe find ourselves in a socialenvironment and we're sitting aroundwith you know five or sixfriends and they're talking about godknows what you know currentpop culture item or politics or whateverand we're all just there like sitting onour hands shaking likesomebody asked me about bitcoin rightnowyou know and then of course when we getto connect with bitcoiners then we getto let it all flow outwhich you know is a primary reason why ido this pod butyou know it's it's such a it's such agreat point that bears repeatingum that you mentioned just before thatumabout how you know you came out of arelationship and your world kind of camecrashing down and likebecause the big question here is likewhy theis this thing having that kind oflike the effect that we've beenarticulating on people right and i thinkpart of it you knowwhen we talk about conditioning when wetalk about cultureand we talk about identity and we talkabout a belief beliefs you know and arelationship is probably a good littlemicrocosm of that becauseyou you know you you think something ofthis person youyou see a future with this person youbelieve something about themand then when it falls apart like allthat is taken awayand you do it requires a fairly dramaticreorientationof at least a part of your reality whichwaswho you know who you spent most yourtime with and why you did that and whatyou saw in terms of thefuture so like and i think that it makesyou feelnaked or at least vulnerable for aperiod of time right because likelike a big chunk of your identity and ofcourse we construct our identities tofeel comfortable about moving throughthe world right to feelenough certainty and confidence to haveenough of a grasp on who we areand what this world is so that we canactually try to manipulate it in someway to our benefitum that gets taken away and we're likeoh oh like i'mi'm i'm vulnerable right now i gotta igotta fill up that chunk that's justbeen removed with something else that'sgoing to deliver to methe requisite stability to keep you knowperforming that magic function ofof manipulating my world of engagingreality in a way that ends up beingbeneficial to meand uh you know i think on a in abroader context likeyou you follow this all the way down andyou you end up at you knowreligious or deeply philosophicalprinciples you know and andagain to refer to peterson as and most ithink a lot of religious scholars wouldsay the same it's like you know it'sfinethat we have the world seems to bepredominantly or the growing contingentof atheismatheism today umbut the the principles that are foundin the religious stories are still verymuch a partof how they construct their worldviewwhether theylike it or not or whether they know itor not umbut you know we don't need to to openthat can of worms we can just simply saythat likethere are fundamental principles andthen upon those aremore principles and more um beliefsand perspectives and things that youassociate your identity with in order tobecomethat functional person that's able toengage with the worldfor whatever ends right and in mostcases it'll be you knowa motivation of something in the futureright like you want something you wantyour life to be a certain wayyou want something in your life and umyeah when you know when that gets r rugpulledit that's i think that's why it's souncomfortable because like it'sliterally the stuff that youare relying on to be a person in thischaotic crazy uncertain worldand it seems like bitcoin is speaking to[Music]those elements at the very you knowfoundational layerof those things right so like forexamplewe may our sports team may be part ofour identity likemaybe you support the toronto mapleleafs and that you know you cheer forthem and you get hang out with yourbuddiesand drink beers and when they when theteam wins you're happy and when theylose you're sad like that's aa part of your identity albeit maybe notan important one butnot an unimportant one either butcertainly not as important as the morefoundational ones about you knowkind of how your perception of realityis constructedand construed and it seems like bitcoinis like knocking at that dooron that level of things because howcould you know how could you make a casethat it's not when it'sinspiring these types of changes in howpeople see things and how people feelthings and the meaning people ascribe tothingsyou know and and look i knowwe're having this conversation becausewe want to dig into this stuff i know alot of people might listen and thinklike you know it's way overboardbut you know we we gotta focus in on onthe ailment we're trying to exploreand then expand it in order to do itjustice and soi know this doesn't apply to everybodybut uhyou know it seems to be a veryfundamentalthing that's being changed hereright like on a very deep level yeahyeah yeah and umyou know i mean not to crack open thecan of worms that is you know adiscussion about religion but likei uh i thinkum yeah i think thei mean crack it open if you want yeahsure i'll crack it open a little i'llcrack it open a little which is likei i i'm obviously we're all speakingfrom our own subjective place right andand my my experience you know thus farin my life andi'm always open to be humbled andchanged you knowum butso far it's like i uhi've had to discover it for myselfbasically andagain it ties back to bitcoin this thingof self-sovereignty you knowbut but like um you know whateverwhatever things that i that i feel thatare you know quote unquote divine youknowit's like i've had to discover them formyself i can't take anybody's word foriti just you know i just couldn't do thatand it never felt right to meto take any one sort of thought or evensomeone else's experienceyou know i had to find for myself likethis feeling of like something othersomething biggersomething divine you know and uhand uh yeah and i guess i i i value itbecauseit it kind of is the you know one of thesort of i guessbedrocks for me you know about how ioperate andhow i feel about life um but it's mineit's not anybody else's and uh and ithink that's why it feels so good to meyou know and so strong to meum you know i'm i'm talking a littleesoterically here butbut it is kind of esoteric you know it'syeah individualum before you go on are youmoving back and forth away from your micbecause i don't mean you're kind oflike coming in now you're coming in andout a little bitget too philosophical i gotta tweak myhead left and right hereum no but i mean look this this is whatthese these sorts of conversations arefor and and likeit's it's uncertain territory right soall we can do is really fumble aroundand try toyou know try to dig within ourselves andpull out some words that make any senseof all this stuff becauselike even allowing yourself to believethat things are operating onon that level with this thing is like astretch rightyou know you kind of you're kind ofsheepish about it like am i really goingto allow myself toto go there you know to to and certainlygo there in public to suggest that likewhat we're dealing with here is like aagain word with a lot of baggage butlike a religious instrument you knowsomething with thatlevel you know that order of influenceonwho we are and how we act and and how weascribe and convey meaningright and like that's a bold assertionobviouslyum but it justagain i mean again that's why i i wantto put together this series because likei wannaopen that door about like why this iscausing peopleto change in such fundamental ways but iwould like to ask you you know you'resaying like you wantyou've always been kind of searching foryour owntruth and you didn't want to you knowaccept or swallowone that was handed down to you whetherit be religious or cultural orphilosophical orspiritual or whatever like do you haveanysense of why that is like why it was youyou wanted to discover it for yourselfwell because i think because uhbecause of that sort of transformativeexperience i had in my 20s whereit's like everything that i built sortof from the outside incrumbled and then i had no choice insome wayslike in some ways i had no choice todiscover for myself becausei felt so umyou know i don't know like the thingthat i built was gone and so then whatwas leftand and all really that you know thatwas left for me was likelike i said questions and then just thissort of painful feeling of like losslike that i'd lost you know that i'dlost something and and i just it wasjust very painfuland and and and you know not totoot my own horn or whatever butwhat i maybe one of the things i'm mostproud of is that at that timein my life when i was going when i wasfeeling so much painum that uh for what i think i thinkbecause you know i had supportive familyand whatnot butbut i uh i i managed not to likeyou know hit the booze and or or hitdrugs oryou know um sleep around a tonum not at all actually and i forwhatever reason some part of me knewthat the pain that i was going throughwaswas essential you know i don't know howi don't know how whatever ijust somehow i knew and i knew i didn'twant to hide from it becauseum yeah i don't know we're going downdifferent kind of rabbit hole here butbut somehow it's connected and yeah i uhhey man i'm i'm i'mgood with it if you are yeah yeah idon't know i don't know why you goanywhere you're not no no i'm good i'mgood i justwhatever i'm good no it's good let'slet's hit it but it was it was justuh you know it was just the thing wheresomehow inside of me i knew that if ididn't deal with thispain now it was gonna be with me nomatter whatand so you know uh yeah i justyou know those years of just dealingwith this i don't know it's weirdit's hard to describe butjust this uncomfortable painful kind ofa feelingand uh and i had an unwillingness tokind of hide from itand i think it shaped you know again idon't know knock on wood but ithink it shapedmy my years to come you know after thatwhen iwas able to emerge finally andum it just happenedit took quite a bit of time but but yeahi just remember going like i can't boozeiti just can't do it and i can't you knowchase these girls becauseum i just can't this pain is somehowimportant and it's going to teach mesomethingand i got to stick with it you know eventhough it was brutaland i don't know i mean there's peoplego through way more painful thanyou know and so i don't pretendthat it's some kind of noble thing orwhatever but umit was mine and it was for me it wasreal and andand poetry so it's it's definitely nobleat least in my opinionnot to seek the most expedient way outof a situation like thatright so girls drugs boozewhatever something else to occupy yourtime and you and your mindlike to to know that there's a reasonwhy the circumstance is making you feelso uncomfortableright and so fill in the blank emotionsandthe way to solve that you know optimallyif not for good but the way to solve itlet's say the correct wayis not just to cover it over right it'slike it's an it's an indication thatsomething needs to be addressedand um later on of course yeah yeah andi think it's likeagain back to the courage notion like ithink that's acourageous act is you know for people tosay likefor people to accept pain right forpeople to say likeyeah i'm going to you know i'm going toput up with this painbecause i know on the other side of itthere is something better there issomething right and it's kind of youknow that idea of thethe immolation right the burning off ofyou know all the the detritus or the ofof who you are of your identity of of ofyour perspectivethat's not serving you or that's foundedin delusion or fear or insecurity orwhat have youand leaving remaining that which isis true right and you know likei don't know if we can ever existin pure truth with absolute clarity witha clear perspective all that kind ofstuff you know theenlightened as it were but it does seemthat you can at leastidentify um ways tocreep toward that right by bysacrificing those elements of yourselfthat aren't serving youum and hanging out in that uncomfortableareaof of pain and discomfort andvulnerability while you search forthe things that are most truthful ofyour about yourself to then integrateand move forward withright that i mean that's thethat's the hero's journey and so manypeopleswerve on that and again like i can'thelp but think that bitcoin being whatit is as a certain form of truth andalsosomething that permits certain behaviorsis is not only kind ofdelivering a certain sense of of ofclarity to people's perspectives andallowing them to maybe construct a newperspective on on better principlesbut again that idea of confidence islike giving them thesomething like almost like somethingthat stands behind them to say likeyou know this is a sense of securityright likeno matter like if you you can kind ofrely on it to move forward with moreconfidence becauseit's a sense of security that perhapsyou've never had before and it likebecause we're always in in normally landlike a lot of people are in a situationwherelet's say their paycheck to paycheck oreven if they're not their obligationsyou know theirhouse and their car and their familyobligations all that stuff arepretty much equivalent to what's comingin right so as you say they're always onthathamster wheel and you know they too manyresponsibilities toshirk on and it just ends up making themfeellike they're a bit trapped right andthey they they can'tuh sacrifice those elements of theirself that they might or they can'tum explore themselves in the ways thatthey might because of thatand and bitcoin seems to be uhbestowing a certain sense of securitythat pushes into the futurethat is that you know giving people agreater sense that likeyeah maybe i can dig into those things alittle bit more and it's not going to bedisastrous to meor my situation or my family because ofthe security that bitcoin providesyeah and it's it's it's again sort ofwhat we touched on earlier it's likeagency and empowermentright when when and that's why the deepdive into money is so importantyou know money gets such a bad rap in somany narratives butif you deep dive into money you realizethat it's just valueyou know it's the value that you createandstore basically and this thing you knowthis bitcoin thing it's aboutit it instills kind of like agency andempowerment becausewhatever you do becomes yours yeah youknowand that's yours right importantly it'sso powerfulit's so powerful you can't underestimatethe power ofwhen you do something it's yoursyou know and not only that but that'salso very intimidating john becausethen you kind of like and i get whypeople in some ways likeuh you know they push off of bitcoinbecauseyou gotta then face like okay then it'sme it's my responsibilityit's mine it's mine there's no excusesthere's nosomebody else's it's ownership you knowand and that's uncomfortable it can bevery uncomfortable to goto not have an uh an idea as towhy not when it's just it's yours nowwhat are you gonna doyou know that's that's a difficult thingto embrace in some ways taking thatresponsibilityabsolutely and you know it kind ofthere's there's so manyinteresting parallels of bitcoin toesoteric topics and religion and stufflike that but that you knowwhat you just said makes me think of theuh the idea of the philosopher's stonein alchemyright and and which was that thethe seeking of the philosopher's stonewas the process of the individualpurification right of the person who wasseeking it and attempting toyou know construct it and and there's avery obvious parallel with bitcoin islike the more you understand it and themore you engage it the more youintegrate it and leverage the thepotential and possibilities that itrepresentsthe more it seems torequire your transformationit if not require certainlythe propensity to inspire it seems toexist and uhyou know chalk another one up for likejust a bizarre sort ofelement of of this thing butyeah i mean it seems unavoidable it doesand andyou know absolute cement i'm never i'mnever umi'm never too keen on likeyou know throwing out absolutes but manthis thingthis thing's got like yeah this thing'sgot legsit's uh let me ask you a question umand i don't think this is going tohappen but of course it's possible andwhen there's so much hope uh andreliance on somethingyou know it's it's a necessary thoughtexercise i thinkwhat happens if it goes away right itfails bug in the codestate attack like you know we don't haveto go into the validity of the foot ijust meanphilosophically speaking like if it goesawayhow does that affect you would you thinkthat's a great questioni mean i don't know for sure uh you knowhopefully we don't find out butyeah if i was to hazard aguess umi don't know something i mean you knowit had such an incredible beginningi mean you're stumping me here um i iwant to say it's not going away but umuh for me i don't know what would happeni don't know i mean i don't know whatthe results would be i i i don't thinkthe process would change much thoughyou know like the thing in me that hasit has and continues to embrace thatlike i gottai gotta create something that i'mcreating my world that i'm creating mylifei don't think that's going away i don'tcare there's ijust don't see a bug going into thatcode you knowso um that's gonna stayand uh it would be greatyou know if the tools were out therethat sort of aligned and supported thatbut that in me is not going awayum so i don't know if that answers yourquestion butyeah i mean there's there's no rightanswer obviously i mean somethingyou know i'm just as wrapped up in thisas anyone andso i asked myself that question and youknow it would obviously be devastatinguh and i think it wouldremove the element of hope that bitcoinrepresents isincredibly powerful uh and i think morepowerful thanmaybe a lot of people appreciate and ifthat's removedum you know that that would be difficultbutone of the things that i think i wouldtake some solace in is thati've already connected with so manygreat people that were brought togetherbythis thing and you know if if the toolwent awaythat would be devastating and and thosepeople wouldbe far less capable of offor you know advancing the cause thatthey were a part of andbuilding what they wanted to buildbecause you knowwe we derive a lot of obviously powerand benefit from having this tool andit's sucking all of us in and when thatgoes awaymaybe there'd be some dispersion anddespondence anduh you know and obviouslyless effective means of of pursuing whatwhat seems to be a coalescence ofof certain principles and goals in thein the quote-unquote communitybut still having you know havingidentified a lot ofhaving leveraged that tool to identify alot of people thatline up on on similar things and arepursuinguh certain ideas you know maybe chiefamong them truthuh is you know would still be a blessingand hopefullyyou know something would come out of ofthat nevertheless but um definitely imean i ii i i'm an eternal optimist i don't knowi get i guess maybe in some ways ialways have beenand i know that that bitcoin is justchanneling what's already thereyou know what i mean like well it's justbehavior at the end of the dayright i mean it's still just us i meanif it's a really funny thing rightbecausewe could actin many ways like we we could act wecould have always actedas though bitcoin existed right but thejust the thing is like at scale we don'tright we don't trust each other enoughwe don't the the constraints on ourbehavior are such thatpeople br people bend and break them andthe more people that burn and break themthe you know the more people that bendand break them furtherum but you're right i mean all this isjust behaviorand it's just that this thing is kind ofestablishing new parameters for thatbehavior andi guess we're agreeing that those aregood parameters and they're usefulparameters and we want to try tooptimize themyeah this stuff's uh it's it's it's youknow it'slike i said it's it's behaviorthat's already there it's mojo that'salready there and and for whateverreason you know this bitcoin isit's channeling it and and you know likelike to answer your question again if itwent downyou know if it went down it would suckbut umi think that um i think thatsomething else would you know anothertool would emerge at some pointum and again my eternal optimism is thatyou know um thatthings just think when things get badthey get bad becauseum they're gonna get good again you knowand it's a bit of the fourth turningthingum where uhyeah you um you know i just have thisthis sort of profound sense thatthat um and i guess that's what keeps mepretty happy and pretty optimistic abouteverything and pretty hopeful abouteverything is thati think that every every time thingswhen things turn downand turn dark you know the old darkestbefore the dawn it's likeit's it's necessary you know it'snecessary to emergeand um yeah so things for me are alwaysgonna they're always gonna end up withyou know a rebirth and a new thing andyou knowsomething brighter so i i say that withthis sort of likeominous dark voice but um no it's it's averyyou know it's a beautiful thing you knowthatwhatever it's weird i mean you know ifeel lucky as soit's kind of easy for me to say but yeahialways had that i always had that sortof sense that when things get bad it'sjust becausethey got to get bad in order to get goodyou know something like yeahwell hopefully we can avoid the extentto which things get badas a result of bitcoin being in the mixnow because uhyou know we certainly have a lot ofinstances where things got pretty bad soif we can uh if we can mitigate how deepdown we go that would be a good thingbut um dude i know you're uhyou're on a schedule but i did want toask you know this has all been pretty 10000 feet at this point but you knowsince getting involvedin bitcoin like are there are therematerial or concrete or identifiablethings that have changed in like yourday-to-day lifeuh you know as a result of let's saythis this reorientation of perspectivethat we've been exploringsell everything baby just sell it[Music]sell it all you don't need any of this look around you you don't needwhat do you mean you just distilleverything into sass is that what you'resayingyeah that's what i'm saying uh no youknow it's like distill's a great wordyou know likeit's just an another another sort ofpiece of my life we're like oh yeahlike it's just it's just another mirrorsaying like asking me likewhat's important to me you know like isthisimportant to me and and and most of thetimeyou know it just helped me distill downlike what i value basicallyyou know it puts put put me in tune withlike value itselfand then made me go what do i value likewhat's really important to meand the stuff that you know may havepreoccupied my time and my attentionbefore just slowly starts to just erodeyou know um it's hard to describe why orhow it happens buti just started to sort of say likewhat's important to me you know what'smorewhat's important to me i'm a dad now youknow i'm a husband nowi'm got this partnership i got thislittle one that i'm raisingyou know i've got my family and myfriendsum i got my health you know i want tobe happy healthy and full of energy foras long as i canit's like what are the things that aremost important to me i love being innatureuh i love time i love just having timeum so anything that didn't fit with thisyou know and this you know it'scontinually evolving picture of likeyou know what makes my life feel good tome whathow is my life valuable to meum and you know that and that's not tosay it's a totally selfish thing rightbecauseum helping other people um being withother peopleyou know um you know iti mean again it sounds a little tritebut like helping otherslike i like it like when i can you knowoffer something to someone else like ibenefityou know so um you know i'm big into umfor lack of a better way of describingi'm big into selfishnesslike and and maybe we you know in thecommunity or whateverpeople call it more like sovereignsovereignty or whatever but likethere's something important about like adegree of selfishness like what'swhat do i want you know what's importantto melike what do i want my life to be likeyou knowum and so you know bitcoins just reallyhelped meyou know helped me distill those thingsdown even furtherum and man when i you know busted my ownnodeand you know you know got my cold cargoing and um got my multi-staging andit's just a weird feeling to be likethis ismine like i'm doing this you know i'mholding this valueno one's gonna get to it umno one's no one's diluting it you knowliterally figuratively it's likeit feels good like it just feels good tobei i'm saying the same thing over andover again but it's something about thisfeeling of empowerment and agency youknowand uh yeah and i and i feel it more andmore every dayand it helps me distill down more andmore every dayand again i just feel so grateful for ityou know it's just another thing and youknow i'm looking forward to what's aheadbecause you know there's so much thatstill don't know what's coming but um itfeels good to sitand be you know sit and listenlisten to this thing listen to what'scoming you knowum make intuitive choices like you knowmoremore specifically like we made some youknowkind of big choices you know we kind ofwe sold where we were living we sold outof therewe left the the city umum even like like i got a bit of acareer change going now that's sort ofbeginning again and um just trying toembrace likegoing with what feels right now you knowthrowing away thethrowing away the blueprint and justkind of feeling intuitivelylike you know creatively like what'swhat am i gonna do nowum yeah and i don't know i mean it's allcoincided with bitcoin somehow soum i'm digging itsell everything baby just sell it thatthat sounds like aphenomenal place to put a pin on thisthing so umyeah unless unless you have any uh finalcomments man i've really enjoyed thisconversation and of course i appreciateyou being soopen and sharing your thoughts and yourexperiences and you know howhow this has impacted you yeah man imean ditto for meyou know i i've listened to you uh for along time now and uhi'm grateful to be uh just having thecombo with you you know you're doinggreat stuff and uh it's uhyou know it's a it's important you knowhow we communicate with one another youknow and how we areto one another like this you know ourconversationand and and many others that i've hadand you know hopefully we'llwe'll keep having but yeah it's justit's uhi don't know it's hard to describe itbut yeah it's it's justhow you communicate is almostmore important than what's beingcommunicated but that'sthat's kind of how i've beencharacterizing it 100yeah 100 and that john we could go downa whole new rabbit hole with thatlike and it's it's stuff maybe we'll doit again at some point but thistheme that you just brought up how youcommunicate versus what you communicateepic it's just epic um so yeah maybewe'll do it again at some point butuh let's do it man yeah i appreciate itman i love youbut um i'll i'll hit you up again andwe'll we'll dive back insounds great all right brother take careof yourself all right brother see youcheers",
