the most important companiesin bitcoin todayis nydigknightig's mission is to facilitatefinancial security for allthey accomplished this by bringing ahigh level of professionalizationand sophistication to the bitcoinmarketplaceas a true game changer in the industrynida is safely unlocking the power ofbitcoin for forward-thinking individualsand institutions alikeby using nidaega you will gain access toan end-to-end institutional gradeplatform providing bitcoin otctransactions bitcoin collateralizedborrowing secure custody assetmanagement derivatives financing marketresearch and moreand all of these services meet thehighest regulatory governance and auditstandardsled by robbie guttmann yen zhao and rossstevens naidic is absolutely explodedonto the bitcoin scene recently and isleading the way for ongoinginstitutional adoption in this nascentasset classso please be sure to check out naidig asa single source for all your bitcoinneedsso we we've talked aboutbitcoin and how it's dematerializingthese critical security functionstraditionally provided by banksand or governmentsand is doing this through thisproof-of-work security modelbut you've laid out this framework thati think is very brilliant and it's youknow proof-of-work has many layers to itthat i guess you would say these areprotecting it from disruptionum so maybe you could just introducethat model and we could walk through itsure you know i've called it the sevenlayers of securitybut i think umwe should startexcuse me[Music]start with a fundamental observationwhat we're trying to create with bitcoinis a digitalproperty networksomething that will last for a thousandyears or 10 000 years how do i createdigital property in cyberspace and wecan call it money if we like digitalmonetary network or digital propertynetworkbutwhat i want is i want a decentralizednetwork that will lastpast the average life expectancy of ahuman beingor an institutionor a nation-statesohow do i do thatwell with umthe beauty of proof-of-work is thatthe network derives its integrityfrom the interplayofthe miners and the nodesand the holders or the wallets if youwillbut with a special emphasis on theminerswhat what what do i define as securitywellyou know property needs to be optimizedfor integrity and durability over timeintegrity meaningthe protocolthe protocol can't be corruptedright can't mutate if the if theprotocol mutates we go from 21 millionto 48 millionyou get amonstrosity so you don't want a mutationand then i don't want it to diesoif i said i want to design an immortalcreature something that'll live for amillion yearsuh and i want it to maintain itsintegritytheni've i've got to protect the protocoland then i've also got a feed it energyand resources continuallyand i'm just going to call that and ihave to protect it from a hostile attackin the near termsometimes when we think about securitywe think about justavoiding an attack but really securityisyou can't attack in the near termwe don't want it to dieand and most importantlyif you livebut you go insaneor you or you get a grotesque mutationthen did you really live so how am igoing to achievemy quest for immortalityin a networkright and and the beauty of proof ofworkisit is an open protocolthat is darwinianand and competitivein a way such that it is not justself-correcting on the on the protocollevel to ensure correct moneybut it's also self-healingand uh and it's adaptiveto the environment around itso i went i like to call these the sevenlayers of security so what do you haveyou have an energy layera technology layera political layer a financial layer anetwork layer a spatial layer and atemporal layer of energy those sevenseven various dimensionsso let's start with uh the firstdimension of security energywell ii have a hash ratesay we've got about a hundred extra hashright nowwell i have to feed it energy in orderto create the 100 extra hashbitcoinuh is a big customer of energyso in fact it turns out the bitcoin isthe most valuableuse of of energy or maybe the mostvaluablemost compelling industrial customer ofenergy in the world right nowyou can generate about 40 cents akilowatt hour in revenueuh mining bitcoinsothat makes it uminteresting because that co-ops all theenergy industryso one way that bitcoin spreads andstaysorganically vitalisit forms partnerships with the energyindustryif you have a volcano in the middle ofuh central americathe value of that energy sold within 500miles of you is like one pennya kilowatt hourunless you sell it to bitcoinand it's 40 cents kilohertzso bitcoin is the best customer for yourvolcano it's the bitcoin is a customerof stranded energyintermittent energyuh energy on any frequencyand energy at any scaleand you don't need to be co-located withthe cust with an industrial customer ora consumerumand you don't need bandwidthso for example umwhat's the second best you know use ofenergy maybe like running netflix orgoogle data centerbut if you want to run a google datacenteryou need to be withinyou need to be within a fiber opticdistance of the major switching networksbecause you're streaming video andstreaminga lot ofhigh bandwidth queriesso they're bandwidth intensiveand they need to be triple redundantbecause they need to be uh they can'tfail if you're if you're trying tooperate a car with google mapsyou can't afford to have an outage inthe networksobitcoin minersare are so much better than a typicaldata center becauseyou could monetize the entire volcano oryou could monetize the entire waterfallor the entire nuclear reactor the fullbandwidth of ityou could do it at a north poleyou can do it with a satellite uplinkand you can monetize intermittent energycoming off of wind or wave orsolar and you can also shut it down in aheartbeatwith fairly low economic costs soso that makes bitcointhe most compellingtechnologyfor the energy industry that's comealong this decade maybe in a long timethe last big energy technology wasaluminum when people would usetheir excess aluminum to or sorry theirexcess energy to smelt aluminumwell bitcoin bitcoin rebuilt up and inspadesto do bitcoin mining you don't need aport to ship aluminum in and out ofyou don't need an aluminum factory whichis difficult and you don't need aluminumoreand you also don't need the industrialdemand for aluminumwhich eventually saturates aluminum is aspecialty metalrightsowhat is bitcoin bitcoin is money okay soso half of everything that the humanrace has is bitcoinor will be bitcoin in time so bitcoinmining is is securing and producingsomething which is of enormous valueon a very thin linebased upon any flavor and frequencyof energyand there's really nothing like thatwhy does that make the network securewellbitcoin miners um are continuallylooking for new energy sources andthey're negotiating for cheap energy andwhen they buy it they become a bigcustomersoas they become customers of energyproducers everywhere in the worldthe energy producersuh become political allies of bitcoin[Music]so the energy producers are allregulated entities but they're all verycredible and they're all and they allare wired in the political fabric ofevery societysoif you are if you are the best customerof the utility in the city or the stateor the country then that utility has avested interest in protecting yourinterestsobitcoin co-ops energy companies and alsobitcoin is hopefor a utility if you're avalue stock100 year old utility companyyou're not getting a high multiple in inthe stock marketthere's not a lot of excitement in factyou're regulated and there are limits onhow much money you can makeby selling your energy to consumers orto businesses you know if if the powercompany in new york city just jacked theprice of energy by a factor of threethey would get shut down by theirregulatorson the other handuh if you get in the bitcoin miningbusinessrightyou don't have those those kind ofregulations on you so so bitcoin is is achance forenergy companies to become technologycompaniesand it solves so many of their problemsum i can generate morerevenue check i can generate i cangenerate revenue at much higherprice per kilowatt hour it's a very highpricecustomer the value and use ofelectricity for bitcoin miner is higherthan any other customer they have sothat's good checkit's portableand uh so that means every place i'vegot stranded energy productionfacilities i can move the bitcoin mineto the energy check that's interestingit's a it's an energy shock absorberif i have uma renewable energy networksay with wind and solarwhat i want to do is i want to build itto the level of peak demand but if ibuild at the level of peak demand i willover build it by a factor of two or moreand that means i'll be running a 50utilizationfor my consumer and other industrialcustomersso how am i going to find a customerthat's willing to actually take up halfof my energy productionand then turn offfor 10 hours a year or 20 hours a yearwhen there's a brownout withoutcomplainingright the hospital is not going to dothat yeah yeah yeah homes aren't goingto do thatsoi need some kind of industrial producerthat becomes a shock absorberthey're going to drive up my utilizationin 98and then when i brown out they're goingto turn off and give back energy to thenetworksobitcoin represents aaa driver for the development ofsustainable and renewable energyit also representsa um a technology to provide morereliability and fault tolerance to apower gridrightand umyou know if you think about the role ofcapacitors or batteries or shockabsorbersin in electrical machines or mechanicalmachines yeahthat's what bitcoin is fora power network right right rightlet me ask you soyou describe money asenergy socio-political energy umand so in that framework i guess wecould consider banks historically wherethey were actually providing custody ofgoldthey were kind of likeenergy stores in a way right we'restoring this excess productive economicenergy in gold that banks werecustodying for usand now with bitcoin we have this moredirect path to monetizing energyand so what i think about here isthere's kind of this interestingum thing where you know you've heard ofa power bank like these little devicesthat will charge your phone or whateverit stores energy so it's like banks andpower banks do you seethe energyusersand banks somehow converging because itseems like you kind of on a bitcoinstandard you eliminate the need for acustodial bankthey become kind of synonymous withenergy producers do you see thoseindustries coming together in the futurewell i mean ii think once you understandthat a bankis storing monetary energythen you've got a bank of batteries thestoring electrical energyand then bitcoin is sitting in themiddle it's encrypting the energy fromelectrical energyinto monetary energyand soin one hand it's upgrading the rawthe raw physical energythrough the encryption processand then on the other handit's uh it's digitally transforminganalog fiat energyinto encrypted moneydigital moneyand um[Music]that makes bitcoin a bankan energy bank a monetary bankit makes it the the world's greatestbatteryright i mean you could you could look atit from two angles right banks arebleeding off one percent of your energya month you know due to inflationbatteries are bleeding off one percentof your electrical energy a monthjust due to batteryyou know engineeringyou've got two you've got twoinefficient energy systemsbatteries and power grids don't workthat welland fiat banks and monetary grades don'twork that welland bitcoin plus lightninggives youa battery to store all the world'senergy forever without power lossand the other day i sent a thousand satson the lightning network and in onesecond for one setso you know literally you've got speedof lightnearlyyou know what is the cost of one setright if it's such an infinitesimallysmall number a fraction of a fraction ofa penny yeah if thatso bitcoin's a very efficientenergy systemumi think that the significance here isthat bitcoin is just is disruptivetechnology for the entire energy marketand it's co-opting the energy producersand energy investorsinto bitcoinwhat you see right now is you see a lotof umyou see a lot oftraditional power companies that used tobe in the energy business they'regetting into bitcoin miningpeople with natural gas people in thenuclear inindustry people in the wind and solarindustrythey're getting into bitcoin mining orthey're partnering with bitcoin minesso bitcoin recruitedenergy capitaland bitcoin secures the network withenergy capitalhundreds and hundreds of of producers ofenergy are plugged in the bitcoinnetworkcreating that hash wallso that's the first layer of securityfor bitcoinand if you're going to attack ityou know it's no small featto go and and collect that much energyyou almost can't you can you're notgoing to collect twice as much energy oras much energy as is currently in thebitcoin mining networkpolitically economically practically ijust don't know how you would do itright right right very very problematicso thatand there's no shortcut rightin that regardthere's uh there's an energy walland uh you have to jump over itand uh and it's a lot you know at thepoint where you're talking about 100terawatt hours of energy or somethingit's a lot of energyso that the second layer though istechnology and this i don't think peoplereally understand that well and when italk about technology i'm referring tothe to bitcoin asic minersyou knowbitcoin is a wall of encrypted energy sothe energy is the first part but theencrypting the encryption the crypto isthe second part the crypto wall ofenergy it's not raw energyif it was raw energy you just need ahundred terawatt hours to start to getparitybut when it's encrypted energyi need i need uh 100 exahash of shaw 256mining equipmentand since it's like 10 000minersright to get to an extra hash right nowokay then that's a hun that's a milliona million mining rigsof the latest buildhow do you come up with a million miningrigsyou know it's like it's not no one's gota million mining rigs sitting around imean it's not clear how long it wouldtake to manufacture a million miningrigs rightbitcoins co-opting technology companiesso bit you know bit main is a big playerbut but there are other big players tooand and as bitcoin gets larger i thinkyou'll see the intel's of the world andyou'll see you know you'll see othersemiconductor companiesdesigning bitcoin mining rigs andgetting into spaceand and umthis is another example where this isopen and competitiveyou know who wants it the mostwhoever wants it and what capital youneed this is semiconductor fabricationcapital you have to fabricate these a6the s19 family is five times moreefficient than the s9sso if you wanted to generate an exahon the s9 family it took 150 megawattsof powerthat's a lot of powerif you wanted to do it with s19s it's 30megawatts of powera 5x difference in a generationif you get through two or twogenerations every 10 years or threeright you know you're talking about 20ximprovementi mean we're we're 100x more technicallyefficient today than we were eight yearsago where will we be in 10 more yearswe go back and forth right there's allsorts of people with opinions there'smoore's law some people think that asicbasic technology efficiency will slowdown but then again people beenpredictingthat we would hit a wall in moore's lawfor a while and they're still not quiterightsowhen you when you understand the bitcoinnetwork what you can think is that thebitcoin mining network 10 years agowas very energy intensive and technologypoorthere's a time when you were just usingoff-the-shelf chips and then you wereusing gpusand then you were using asic firstgeneration and then asic next generationso we're like five generations into thisnowin the early time frame you throughthink about it you throw a probably athousand times if not a million times asmuch energy to generate a hashrightand now you're throwing 30 megawatts togenerate an extra hashbut we'll get to the next generationwill be five megawatts and then whathappens when we get to one megawattwell so as you go outenergy is still importantbut it turns out the tech that thenetwork is rotating from energyintensive securityto technology intensive security rightrightlike what it what if you imagine one daythere will be 10 million mining rigs butthey'll be seventh generation asics andthey will be a hundred times moreefficient than anything we have todaywhat that means is that 99 of the hashpower will come from that generation ofmining rigswhich means that all this stuff that wehave todaybecomes one percent of the network rightyepwhich means it gets squeezed out of theecosystem right all those miners thatare obsolete go out of businessand so that technologyintensity has a couple of dynamics oneone is that's what keeps the networkfrom consuming all the energy in theworldright i mean people say silly thingslike oh well the energy usage is goingto increase with the price well no it'snotthe energy usage maybe will increasewith the log of the pricethat is if the price goes up by a factorof 10 energy usage might go up by afactor of twoand if price goes up by a factor of ahundred energy uses might go up by afactor of three or fourbut what you've got is a situation wherethe halvings are cutting the blockreward in half every four yearsso that's a built-inyou know a built-in uh 5x improvement inefficiency every decadeand then if you crank over that another10ximprovement in hardwareyou're talking about a 50 timesimprovement in tech efficiency in adecadeor 50 times 50in 20 yearsright so the price has got to go way upand even so what you've got is arotation the network is rotating fromi burn a lot of energy to generate myhashes do i burn less energy to i burnless energy to generate more hashesit's not hard to see this right it'sit's in your iphone your iphone has moreprocessing power than the space shuttlehad yeah 40 years right right you've gotacooper computer in your pocketsoyou got to assumethat the security chips that generatethe hashes just keep getting betterand because bitcoin is unique in theprotocolall of the other processing power isirrelevant right bitcoin is a darwiniancompetitionto um to generateshaw 256 hashesit's 95dominant in that game right now right imeanthere's a few other crypto networks thatuse that but they're like one or twopercent yeahso that's thatuniqueness with regard to theproof-of-work protocolprotects itfrom an attack from all of the awsnetwork or all the google network or ifif everybody turned their iphones atbitcoin mining it wouldn't help themthat much right yeah[Music]so is the commonthe theme here between the energy layerof security and the technology layer ofsecurityis that bitcoin you said bitcoin'sessentially co-opting these industriesso it's incentivizing[Music]um it's a source of demand for energythat's basically unquenchableand it's a source of demand forsemiconductorsfor specialized mining semiconductorsspecializedmining so much marketsyeah people think well 50 60 of theminers cost is going to energywell actually the miners are spendingmoney on energy and they're spendingmoney onsemiconductor mining rigs yeah and thenthey're spending money on the miningcenters themselves the heat sink theheat engineer and the generators andright likeso there's a competition and thequestion is are you better off havinginefficient miners and more and cheappower are you better off havingefficient miners and expensive powerright and do they coexist that was mynext question is do the so that thenew generation miners go to the moreexpensive energy sources and then theolder generations roll off to cheaperenergy sourcesand they both operate well you've gotlike three generations of miners rightlike people are running old inefficientminers in china on free powerand then there and then in the us andnorth america publicly traded miners arebuyingthe latest generation expensive minersbecausetheir power is more expensive but theyhave more capitalif i have 500 million in capitallike uhspend 60 million dollars by 10 000 s 19smine one exahash on 30 megawatts andmake 120 million dollars a yeargood deal probably good deal rightso in that caseyou would rather you would rather buythe better equipment and i think you'llfind at any given time there's like twoto there's three generations of miningequipmentwhen the price goes high if you look atthe hash rate of the network back in umthe first quarterthere was a point when the hash rate gotto like190 or somethingand i thought the peak was 170 but therewas a surge up by about 10 or 15 exahashand i posit that that surge was becausepeople turned on third generationmining equipment like like the oldestleast efficient stuff and ityou there's a way there's a relationshipan s19 is generating40 cents a kilowatt hour right nowergo it is profitable to buy inelectricity up to 39 cents kilowatt hourand s9was five times more inefficient sos9s were profitable at eight cents akilowatt hourbut if you go back one generation beforethat if you're if you're five times lessefficient than that you're profitable atone and a half centsa kilowatt hour so the break-even pointis a function of the semiconductor yeahor the joules per terahash right rightand that's a technology driver it's notan energy driver yeah and and most ofthe people that model bitcoin miningthey don't really focus upon thetechnical efficiency of the minersand by miner i don't just mean the onemining rig i just mean the miningoperator that has a mixture of firstgeneration second generation thirdgeneration equipment yeahthe price you know and you may turn offlike if the price of bitcoin went to uhfive thousand dollars a coin right nowpeople would probably turn off the oldmining equipmentif they had to unless the energy wasfreerightyou can bootleg bitcoin on free energyif you're steering the energy but if theenergy costs three cents a kilowatt houryou're going to you're going to turn offyour old equipment you're going to keepthe new equipment runningand that's a that's an adaptivecorrecting system itself when the pricegoes up you're going to turn on the oldequipmentyepand over time though these are these aretransient phenomenonbecause the more important phenomena tofocus on is that over a decadethe technical efficiency of the miningnetwork is going to increase by a factorof20 to 100.depending upon the rate at which peopleupgrade the semiconductors andyou know there are a lot of ways you canenter into the network and you candisrupt equilibriumone way is as a nation state you canstart mining off of a volcanothe other way is is you can design atotally new family of asicsso you knowmaybe intel or apple wants to get intospace they could disrupt ita big energy producer could disrupt itright now the limiting factor is thenumber of mining rigs you get your handson that's goodright um that cratesthat creates some um predictability toit yeahand uh that keeps that keeps us fromgoing chaoticsoif you look at these two layers ofsecurity right the energy layer isco-opting energy providers all aroundthe world and the technologydimension is co-opting semiconductormanufacturersand if one of them like bitmain gets toomuch poweryou know jeff bezos uh famous lineyour margin is my opportunityright yeahright so if uh if one company gets toomuch power thenwell this is not terribly complicatedengineering i meanyou know it's well understood how todesign shaw 256 a6 there's a capitalismdifficult to adjustyeah yeah andthere are a lot of companies likequalcomm intelwhen they get squeezed they need a newmarketthis is a new market for them at theprice you knowas the price goes up and and theinteresting thing of course is ifthere's um if there's only one providerof shaw 256 miners bit maindoesn't that create an artificialscarcity to uh hash rateand if it if there is a scarcity to hashrate doesn't the price go you know theprofitability of bitcoin miners goes uprightrightyou know and so if the profitability ofbitcoin miners goes up then don't morepeople want to get in the business andif more people want to get in thebusiness don't they need to buy bitcoinmining rigs and if they need to buy itand there's infinite money don't they goand find someone else tobreak that monopolyrightsoso energy and technology are are a keypart of the equationbut they're not the only part of theequation becauseif i want to generate hashes i have toset up a bitcoin mining facilitythere's physical nexus i have to do itin iceland or el salvadoror canada or texasand i you know youyou could probably runyour stake validator on a secret machinein your basementbut you can't run a you know 150megawatt facility on a secretlicense you need the support of themayor the countythe governoryou know you could look at this as anegative it isn't it's a positivewhat it means is that bitcoin miners areknocking on doorseverywhere in the universe and they'relooking for supported politicaljurisdictionsyou know if new york city doesn't wantto mine bitcoin maybe texas doesmaybe florida does maybe wyoming doesright and so if china doesn't well thenmaybe kazakhstan doesin fact the more irrational one countryis the moreappealing bitcoin mining is to theothers rightwhen china actually cracked down onbitcoin mining the revenues of bitcoinminers doubled the profitsquadrupledand the incentive to get in the miningbusinessjumpedand uh sowhat you have is an interesting dynamicwhere bitcoin miners partner with energycompanies and they partner withtechnology companies but they alsopartner with political jurisdictions andpoliticiansand this is an interesting situation toobecause this is so darwinian um whathappens if you're a bitcoin miner andyou set up a billion dollar bitcoinmining rig in new york city and then hisnew mayor and he outlaws bitcoin moneywhat happens to your capitalyou can't move it rightso bitcoin miners have skin in the gameand because they have skin in the gamethat means that they have to do theirdue diligence and they've got a longtime horizona person that's mining bitcoinis um is looking out five years lookingout to you kind of want to be in ajurisdiction where you think that adecade from now you'll still be able tomine bitcoinand soit forces you uh to be more thoughtfulyou know and the next step is well ijust invested hundreds of millions ofdollars in this county i guess i'dprobably better contribute to the countyelection and get the county the mayorelected rightrightyou put down rootsbecause you have a vested interestbecause you have something to loseso the bitcoin mining network actuallybecomesa political lobbying network for bitcoinuminterestingand then every politician that has abitcoin mine has tax revenuehas you know when new york wanted toban bitcoin miningthat was blocked by a politicianbecause the politician got a letter fromthe unionand the union saidyou know we're going to lose jobsso all the moneyall the money that flows into creatingmining centerscreates jobs creates tax revenuesupports politiciansyou know creates massive revenues forengineering companies for uh for realestate companies for landlords you knowet cetera it's good for the localeconomy bitcoin brings prosperityanywhere on earthyou know you might be a limousineliberal in the upper east side and notlike the use of electricityyou know on the other hand but if you'reliving in the middle of central africaand you have evol if you have a volcanoor you have a waterfall you know and 90of your population is living below thepoverty level and there is no industryand someone shows up and offers to likegive you billions of dollars if they canattach a windmillto your waterfall right or turbine toyour waterfall how do you feel aboutsituation yeahyeah it's it's incentivizingeveryone to interact with itin a way that you know contributes toand i would argue ultimately ensures itssuccess that that's the key that's thething is so hard to get your head aroundhere is like it's not evenit's not something that's being imposedit's really just it's a game theorythat's turned on people so people in away have become a core componentof the bitcoin system it's like we youknow at every level we're incentivizedtohelp it proliferate100 megawatts is worth 300 milliondollars a yearnetflix is not going to show up in elsalvador and offer them 300 milliondollars a year in order to run a datacenter plugged into a volcano rightgoogle is not going to show up in zambiacentral africa and offer them 300million dollars a year to run a googledata centerit's not going to happenso what you have is bitcoin is hope forenergyit is hope for your semiconductorcompany it is hope for your politicaljurisdictionit solves a problemand because it can go anywhereright it can go anywhere on earth with asatellite uplinkit's uh probably a more compellingsolution to someone that has naturalresources in a poor countryeven than in a wealthy countryand what you end up withis aa self-distributing dynamicallydistributing bitcoin mining networkand it is solved for the problemwhere do i find the cheapest energy in apolitically supportive jurisdictionthat's the problem you're solving forthat's not the same as the cheapestenergyit has to be it has to be cheap energyfrom an energy provider you trust in apolitical jurisdiction you trustokay what's the answer well the answeris a dynamic equilibrium right it'schanging every singleweek right yeahyou know it was different three yearsago three years ago there was freeelectricity in provinces that had emptyyou know excess coalelectricity capacity in chinaand so you could geteffectively free energyokay it was free but it wasn'tpolitically stablenow you can go to a politically stableplace like texas and pay three cents ormaybe you can get it for one penny inkazakhstanyou know or maybe you can go some otherrandom place you could go to cuba or youcould get a bootleg thing in the junglefrom some warlord yeah for how longbutwhile the bigthe bitcoin mining network iscontinually distributing itselfand it's organic it's just like askingthe question when we settle around thearound the earth where should we settlethat we will be able to make a livingand we won't suffer from famineor tornadoand the answer is you don't knowi mean until you've lived 100 years youdon't know that place floods yeahwhat's the likelihood of an earthquakein your favorite place wellyou'll find out so what happens well thenetwork distributes itselfsome people make good choices somepeople make unwise choices you know thisis back to anti-fragile or the like youmake really awful choices you'llprobably be put out of business within36 monthsif you make okay choices you might lastthree to ten yearsand then maybe there are other choiceswhere you'll be good for a hundred yearsbut maybe you're better off to go to theplace where you're good for six yearswhere the energy is one penny instead ofthe place where you're good for ahundred years where the energy is fivepenniesand maybe we could debate itand maybe you have an opinion we canargue to the cows come home but whatdoes it matterit's better it's better just to releasethe entire umthe entire creaturelet the entire world work in a darwinianadam smithyou know evolutionary fashion acompetitive way and umoftenyou know the lesson of the markets isthere the market is smarter than anybodyyesyou know you know every time i thinkabout what i knew half the time ithought i knew it and i was wrong andsometimes i was right butthe market generally outsmarts thesmartest personso bitcoin miningis a dynamic market in security and it'sshoppingit's balancing energyversus technology versus uh politicalsupportand that takes us to the fourth layer ofsecurity which is you know go ahead yougot a question yeah let me ask you onequestion about that soit is shopping all of these dimensionsbut it's also stabilizing them and iwonder does that apply to politics aswell because it seems likeyeah this industry is a shock absorberright it is stabilizing it's a politicalshock absorber and it's an energy shockabsorberif you have um if you have a politicalregime and you've got natural resourcesbut you your economy is is tanked yeahbitcoin comes inon one hand the bitcoin miner cangenerate 500 million dollars a year inrevenue okayon the other hand the bitcoin miner cansay we're not coming unless we actuallyfeel this is a stable regime to operatein rightso maybeyou know howthere's that phrase like uh you know ohi got married and my wife made me wantto be a better mani was like okay well if you if you getmarried you can't you have to give upsome of your bachelor waysrightand if you have a childyou have to be even more responsiblerightsothe commitmentto a family is stabilizingbecause you're thinking you know i justi can'tyou know do the crazy things i did wheni had no other responsibilitiesif you actually don't have any industryyou have nothing to loseand so a country that has a bitcoin minehas something to gain and something tolose and if you were to actually thenseize the bitcoin minerightno the bitcoin miners are coming to youright rightit's the same as seizing the bitcoinright if you make bitcoin illegal inyour country and you make mining illegalthen you lose all that but if you makebitcoin legal or welcome and you makemining welcome you gain something andthen if you're rational you mightremember that your prosperity came fromthe new job you haveand that way you don't want to lose thejob rightif you're if you're jobless and homelesswell first of all there's nothing tolose and thenyou know if someone puts a 37 revolverin front of you maybe that's moreappealing to use thatright if i if i have nothing i might bemore akin to violence or more more proneto violenceand if i if i haveyou know why do people why do peopleresent resort to violence maybe becauseit's hopelessif i feel like things are hopeless ieither kill myself or i kill somebodyelsebitcoin is hopeyeahand so yeah it is politicallystabilizingbecause it's it's a way out for someonethat can't find another way outand once you adopt bitcoinyou see something that worked and youhave something to lose and you're partofyou're part of the multinational bitcoinnetwork and that is civilizing yeahin its own special way becauseafter the mining it draws you intobitcoin holding and then bitcoin bankingand then bitcoin commerce and bitcoinphilosophy andand the like right so this i mean thebitcoin miningi guess we could see in a broader scopethat digital technology is alreadychanging the distribution of populationsthanks to remote work and things likethis but bitcoin mining itself soundslike it could have a pretty significantimpact on where people live you knowyou're gonna kind of migrate to thesecheaper energy sources andset up a politically stable environmentand get to workyeah bitcoin mining lets you createan oasis of prosperityaround a standard a stranded energysourceif you have stranded raw materialswhatever the energy is yeahyou can drop the miner on top of it andthen you can createprosperitybecauseit'll monetize any flavor of energy anyfrequency of energy with no bandwidthand andminimal infrastructurearound itall right guys that was episode 14 ofthe sailor seriesandthis episode we start to dive into a newframework that sailors laid outwhich causes seven layers of proof ofwork securityand i think the easiest wayto start this is with a visualizationactually sosailor's describing a monetary networkin bitcointhatselfuh constructs these layers around it andeach layer umis a point of resistance to disruption ithink is the big key key point hereum and this is somewhat akin tonetwork effects i think you know i'vetalked about this before thatthe moreparticipants there are to a particularnetwork which is to say the more sidesthere are to a marketplacethe more resistant it is to disruptionso the classic example of a one-sidedmarketplaceis facebook disrupting myspace right thefacebook provided a superior valueproposition to one cohort of users whichjust are the users of the networkand in doing so was able to disruptmyspacehowever when you look at a marketplacethat has more than one cohort cohort ofusersomething like craigslist or ebay wherethey have buyers and sellersthese two-sided networks tend to be moredifficult to disrupt because you have toyou have toprovide a superior value proposition forboth buyers and sellers simultaneouslyotherwise no one moves so this issomewhat akin to that um but i think thewaysailor puts us together it's almost likethis set of concentric spheres i guesssurrounding bitcoin and each sphereis protecting it in its own unique waykind of uhinsulating the integrity of itsmarketplace based on the incentivesrelated to bitcoin in a specific wayand that the net outcome of this isthese seven interlocking spheres thatreally protect bitcoin from disruptionand nurture the growth of its network sothis might sound a bit abstract rightnow but as we as we go into it i thinkit'll become a little more concretizedumand the other general theme here i'dlike you to think about as we start togo through this is that it is thepersistenceof bitcoin so the actual persistence ofits network up time let's say or it'sits availability to sell energy into thenetwork or to move energyum through the monetary networkand the certainty that it's affordingmarket actors right again hard cap of 21millioncan be confiscated inflated stoppedinterruptedum that is actuallyin my opinion in my viewforcinghumans to reorganize themselves aroundthis network so in a verybroad sense we could say thatall of the variation in human affairsuh and this gets back to something idiscussed earlier ittends to coalesce around the invarianceyou know sailor gave the example ofgravity previouslyuh through the socioeconomic lens wecould say gold was this socio-economicinvariant historically that causedmarket actors to voluntarily adopt itand use itas an apolitical store of valueand bitcoin has just taken thatprinciple of certainty and persistencyin a monetary network to a radically newlevel so that's another way to thinkabout thisis that uh almost like a stone throwninto a pond but the stonerepresenting certainty itself and it'sjust propagating out into this into thefield of human action and changing theway everyone does business right andit's not like something you can ignorenecessarilyumit's something that is soso fundamental that if youchoose to trade which is to say youchoose to participate in the economywhich is to be anything less than purelyself-sufficient which is pretty mucheveryone and you want to optimize forwealth preservation over timewhich is pretty much anyone i don'tthink anyone prefers poverty um torichesthen you have to pay attention tobitcoin like you you getsucked into its networkover timeand i think this model that sailor hasprovidedin seven layers of proof-of-worksecurityreally peels back the layers so to speakon this dynamicand gives them a very specificmechanical description of how they worksothe first layer and we only got intothree layers in this episode and thennext episode we'll get into uh the lastfour so the first layersailor went intois the energy layerand this is very important and profoundthatin bitcoin miningfor the first time in human history wehave thisperpetual energy buyerworldwideright so anywhere there is a stranded orunderutilized energy sourceit can now be alchemized into digitalgold if you will right you can literallybring a bitcoin miner on siteuh they're very lowbandwidth requirements it just needneeds to be able to generateuhhashes to basically participate in theminingalgorithmand it can be used it can turn thisexcess or stranded energy that otherwisecouldn't be porteduh well let's saythat otherwise it was uneconomical toport this energy elsewhere due to itsits geographic locationcan now be usedtodirectly monetize that energy which sayjust turn that energy into moneyand the other big piece here is that ifenergy is intermittentright which is say it's uh theproduction of it is volatile like withwind or solarumbitcoin mining acts as kind of a bufferfor these variable supply energy sourcesso if there's a a huge surge inproduction and some laxity and demand itcould be you could switch that to uhbitcoin miningand you could very quicklyswitch back as grid demand changesum so it's to say thatbitcoin mining works really well withthese interruptableloads uh in high variation loads andremote loads soit's kind of like uh and this is anexample he uses later on that it isproviding this shock absorberquality where it's actually bufferingthe different systems againstuh volatility they would otherwiseexperienceand you know the so the analogexample here is aluminum box siteuh and i think this was being done inhonestly it was greenland or iceland iforget which one but they effectivelyhaduh this surplus of i think it wasgeothermal energy but they had no goodway to export itandwhat they would do instead was uh theywould importaluminum and actually smelt it which isa very energy intensive operationand then they would smelt it with thelocal energy and then export the uhaluminum box site i think was the finalproduct uh two countries that had demandfor aluminum oxide so what thisthis was an analog example of monetizingstranded energy sources like thestranded geothermal energythat forcertain economic reasons couldn't betransported across power lines easily orcheaplycould now be aimed at the production ofa hard commoditythat could then be shipped anywhereworldwide so the aluminum effectivelywas serving as an energy battery andthis is a pretty popular example you'veprobably heard this one beforethe problem of course is thatit was very inefficient overall in thatnot only are you mining the aluminum inone placeshipping it to uh the place withstranded energy with again icelandergreenland and then they're smelting itso they're actually addingthe energy as a value input to thiscommodity and then shipping it elsewhereso it was kind of mired in theselogistical costs and transformationcosts in such a way that it didn'tconvert the energy into moneyat a highwith a high coefficient let's sayso in bitcoinwe have something that requires lesstransformations like every time you'reeither loading something up to put ityou know to ship it logistically or uhincurring a transaction cost you'rebasically mitigating the efficiencyof monetizing this energy so withbitcoin we have something that minimizesthese uh these intermediate steps andallows energy producers anywhere in theworld to essentially directly monetizetheir energy sourcesand this isso it has a historical analog so we cansay some things about ituh but we it is different in that itit's now being monetized into thisabsolutely scarcetoken called bitcoin that can betransported globally 24x7 365you have final settlement within an houryou know in theory you coulduse a stranded energy to create bitcoinin one area beam the bitcoin to anotherarea and use it to buy local energy in acompletelyuhdiscontinuous jurisdiction on the otherside of the planetso it enablesthis very low frictionway oftransmitting energy across space andtime soumand we have to be careful of the analogyhere and i'll push it too farbut many have said i think sailorincluded that bitcoin functions issomewhat like an energy battery or amonetary batteryand it's the first battery that's notthere's no leakage effectively you knowwe have slight impedance when we moveacross the network in terms oftransaction fees but we know withabsolute certainty there's no unexpectedinflation so there's no leakage unlikesomething like fiat currency wherethere's just tremendous amounts ofleakageor even gold where it'sit's lowsay two percent a year but it's stillpersistent and continuous over timeumwhere we have to be careful the analogyis that it's a one-way battery or like aright only battery we can put energywe can allocate energy into theproduction of bitcoinbut you can't shoot the bitcoinsomewhere else in the world wherethere's no energy and turn it back intoenergy in the local environment thereneeds to be a local energy market toturn your bitcoin back into energy ifthat makes senseumso i think that's a very useful analogyand powerful way to look at it umhopefully you know other energyproducers in the worldi think they're slowly awakening to thisbut it's stillat the fringes to such an extent thatpeople haven't really come to see thetrue implications of what this is goingto do to energy markets worldwideumand one of the great points there's alot of implications but one that sailorbrought up i had not thought of beforewas that energy producersbecomingcustomers of bitcoin mining so they'reselling their energy to bitcoin minersthis is now converting theminto political alliesall right uh here in the u.s we have wehave both regulated and unregulatedenergy markets with some of theregulatedutilities i mean these are very largecompanies you know multi-billion dollarcompaniesvery conservative very old schoolum but as they become customers tobitcoin miningi think these industries that have verydeep roots um you know it's verylocalized right depending on the type ofenergy that's being produced buttypically you know oil gas solargeothermal hydro like these are allrelatively fixed assets let's say sothey're very tied into the localpoliticalframework because clearly energy is anindispensable commodity it's like theultimate commodity in a wayand so as they become customers ofbitcoin mining they're going to belearning more about thisuh you know where your money goes yourmind follows so to speakandby virtue of their participation in thismarketplace they will become politicalalliesthat you know lobby on behalf of bitcoincall their local regulator to get rulesin place that are favorable to theirlong-term capital interestet cetera so i thought that wasa really important aspectumthrough which to look at bitcoin andthat this energy layerit's not just aboutthermodynamics and technology and moneythere's also this political element toitwhich is another layer that we actuallyrevisit um here towards the end of thisepisode sothe second layer that sailor brings upis technologyandyou know everyone knowsenergy goes into the bitcoin network tosecure it right this is the the skin inthe game of miners effectively thatunderpins this darwinian or capitalisticcompetitionamong miners toobtain transaction fees block subsidiesand participate in network security sothis is likethis optimal alignment of incentivesthat satoshi created that really makesbitcoin bitcoin you knowumand what sailor brings up a great pointhere thatwe all know energy is very important tothe network but what's less obvious isthat over time as bitcoin growsit's actually the network is rotatingaway from energy intensitysay an energy intensive security modeland towardsa technology intensive security modeland this is something i had not thoughtabout previously either there's thisshift almost occurring so if we thinkvery early days of bitcoinpeople are just mining it on theircomputersuh there's no specializedsemiconductors at this point it was justyou know whatever computational hardwareyou hadwas pretty much competitive in bitcoinmining very early daysso it wasmostly a matter ofelectricity getting low-cost electricitysuch that you could keep your operatingexpenses belowthe market value of the bitcoin produceyour operating revenuesso we could say in the earliest days ofbitcoin it was almost purely energyintensivehowever asthe asics and semiconductors become morespecialized which would say they becomemore narrowly focusedand functionally designed for miningbitcoinat the expense of everything else theseare kind of single purpose units uh thatthataccumulation of hardwareactually starts to representmore of the energy intensity overall ofmining so another way to think aboutthis is thatthere's a shift occurring from kind ofdynamic energy to static energyand we could say that the semiconductorsthemselves are effectively a form offrozen energy right this is capital it'sbeenuh it was an energy process energyintensive process to produce them toship them to get themuhinto position plugged in and uhproducing hashes right so they say iswhich is to say competing in the bitcoinmining network in a way that they areprofitableumbut this has effectivelywe've we're now capitalizing this energycost into these semiconductorsso the technology itself the hardware isbecoming more importantmore of a security layer than the energyexpense itself over time as the bitcoinnetwork proliferatesumand a lot of this has to do with thatratio right whereagain these asics are producing hashesmore efficiently so you're getting morehashesper energy expenditurewhich is in the same way that capitalamplifies the gains on labor rightitthis technology is becomingmore specialized over time and thereforemore of auh overall component of the securitynetwork of bitcoinumand so this is this has a veryinteresting effect too that it's drawinginmore skin in the game for market actorssobecause when you start shifting intotechnology intensive security modelthere's a lot more capitallong-term capital investment necessaryto be competitive so you need to beyou need to have larger and moresophisticated capital operations versusjust kind of plugging in andparticipating in mining when it'sprofitable and unplugging when it's notthis fixed cost of capital now needs tobe amortized across more bitcoin miningand so the networkis actually becomingmore anti-fragile through these hardwarecycles so as each new generation ofhardware comes online that's moreefficient than its predecessors thepredecessor hardware is rolled out intolocations that have cheaper energywhereas the new generation hardware cango to higher cost energy markets andstill be profitable because they'rethey're producing more hashes umper unit of energy expendedand sothat's powerful because you'reit's pushing instead of just pushingolder generation hardware into the scrapyard right it's actually pushing itinto other markets so we're getting moredecentralization from hardware cycle thehardware cycle we're getting more hashpower overall because you just have morepenetration of the bitcoin miningnetwork globallyum and then you're ultimately gettingmore security so this gets back intothatvirtuous cycle of of bitcoin miningwhichis uh you know as bitcoin networkbecomes more secure bitcoin becomes moredesired as a store of valueas it becomes more desired as a storevalue its price goes up as its pricegoes up mining becomes more profitableas mining becomes more profitable morecapex comes into the bitcoin miningnetwork to secure itand so on and so forth and this this isthatuninterruptible virtuous cycle that isbitcoin's network proliferation and noone's figured out how to stop it yet soi thought this was just another anothergood way to look at it and we're kind ofback to thatbitcoin is a microcosm of capitalismright there has there's thisvery competitive game a market calledbitcoin miningandit's it is forcing everyone that'sparticipating in an economy with moneyto kind ofuhre-evaluate their strategy and thatthere's you know on sale went throughcountless examples of this last timefromsquare needing to sell umbitcoin or if a social media platformincorporated it that other social mediaplatforms would have to do it so there'sjust thisvortex or black hole likequality to bitcoin that it's it's kindof radiatingit's pulling all industries and marketactors into itsvortex and forcing them to to basicallybe more capitalistic in their approachif that makes sense soreally interesting stuff umand it you know to that point you can'tignore game theory this is not somethingyou canturn off or wish awayum it's it's an unstoppable force in thesense thatall participants in game theory areoperating in their best interest so it'sgoing to really dictate the direction ofthe marketplace over time umand since bitcoin you know it's kind oflikeas naval said there's two ways toorganize marketsuh either byfreedom or by force so like by prices orby coercion kind of thing and sincebitcoin's so resistant to coercionthat i think we're really just seeingall the free market principles that itrepresentsumbeing reinforced and radiated out intothe the broader economy and sothis gets us into the third layerwhich is politics right so politics isthat apparatus of coercion or forcein most modern marketplacesum but with bitcoinbecause it's so resistantthere's a different dynamic at play hereand sailor makes the point thatevery time a regime is hostile towardsbitcoin miningyou're just creating incentives forothers to be accommodating so you'rebasicallyall of thisunstoppableumfinancial incentive towork with bitcoin and accommodate itssuccess if a if a politician is drawingan artificial box around an area sayingwe don't want that here you're nowpushing out all the best and brightestthe entrepreneurs the tax base thewealth all the things that come withthis wave of innovation get pushed outof that imaginary box and so what you'rebasically doing is creating a windfallopportunity for competing jurisdictionsso this is thatthis kind of gets into that sovereignindividual thesis wherenation states are now forced to competein the in marketplaces basically as aresult of digital technology because thecoercion is just not as effectiveso which is another way to say that youcan't have thiscoordinated collusion among states whichwe could almost say fiat currency isthat right everyone everyone coulddebase their currency because everyoneelse was doing it and nocitizens had no other optionum but with the introduction of anotheroption it's forcing all of these actorsto become more honest in their dealingsand so every time one political regimepushes bitcoin out they're creatingincentives for others to take them inthis leads to a scramble reallyif you just play out if you just game itoutthatpolitical actors will be scrambling toattract bitcoin miners and their taxrevenuesum and this convertsbitcoin miningthe ones like wherever bitcoin mining isfinds a home rightit's now converting all the stakeholdersrelated to that mining uh operation intoa political lobbying mechanism whichsailor makes a brilliant point thereandyou know all of these jurisdictionstoday were mired in dut um you'realready seeing this at the fringes alittle bit you see like mayor of miamiand a few states in the us trying to beuh very accommodating to bitcoin but ithink this is only going to escalateas the trueinsolvency or we could say poor solvencypositions of many of these governmentscomes to the surfaceand that they're just they're out ofmoney right they they can't leave anystone unturned so to speakuh and it appears to me as sailor saidyou know 100 megawatts is worth 300million dollars a yearthese are massive numbersand is a very large incentive forpolitical structures that may be hostileto become accommodating over timeum and the net resultyou know sailor said it's aself-distributing dynamic andincreasingly secure networkso this is where you know i feel likewe're veryin the middle of the unstoppability ofbitcoin at this point when you come tosee the incentives operating in multiplesidesat multiple layers in multiple ways umit becomesvery hard to try anddo a do some mental gymnastics into asituation that that sees it failingalmost because you haveyou have the willpower of everyactor that wishes to preserve wealthaligned with the proliferation of thisnetworkumand so the the other result of thisthat's really interesting is that it's astabilizing force right we're bringingstabilityto energy markets as a buyer of lastresortas a monetizer of stranded energysources you know as sailor said thisthing can bebitcoin mining can be an oasis ofprosperityso anywhere there's cheap energy rightyou don't need any other infrastructurereally in place you just need aninternet connection and bitcoin mininghardware and you can create digital goldget the digital gold businessthis also bringsstability to technology industries as aninsatiable source of demand forsemiconductorsso now all the seasonality andfluctuations and risks thatsemiconductors went through they nowhave effectivelya buyer of last resort as welland the persistence of again back to thepersistence of bitcoin the persistenceof revenue expectations forsemiconductor producers this is going tolead tolarger and deeper capital investmentsright because they justas the lindy effect of bitcoin takesmore whole more and more hold and peopleexpect it to be there over timeyou can make larger capital investmentsbased on the certainty of that revenueand this will lead to again deeper morecomplicated capital structures moreinvestment more roundaboutness ofproduction which is to say thatwe become more efficient in productionwe become more aggregate wealthaggregately wealthy as a result soa lot of impacts hereuh and then finally which is reallyinteresting is itthis same mode bitcoin is bringingstability to political regimes so thosethat offerbitcoin miners the lowest taxframeworks and the most predictablelegal frameworks they're going toout-compete those who do not right allthe wealth which again ishyper-mobile in bitcoin the talent umthe the knowledge the skills theexperience all of thesefactors that make an economy vibrantwillflow into the jurisdictions wherebitcoin is treated bestand it will relegate those that thatignore this or resist this into theeconomic dust bin effectively so it'sthis hyper competitive darwiniandynamic that bitcoin's bringing to thegeopolitical sphere that makes itseemingly unstoppableand you know this could lead to a lot ofthings this could lead toincentives i'm sorrysubsidies for bitcoin mining it wouldmake sense for states to subsidize theseoperations to get them up and runningand attractum you know local entrepreneurialnetworks into the into the folduh this is again increasing politicalstakeholders skin in the gameso if they start subsidizing thesethings clearly they're going to passregulations that are favorable to themthey want to make sure that theypreserve the local industry and the taxbase that comes from thatand ultimatelyi think if you game it out you could seebitcoin as being a driver for morepolitical consensusand thatyou know all of thisgridlock that we see at the federallevel todaywhen they become when governments becomemore accountable to their bottom linethey're much more likely to reachconsensusthatimproves their financial position andmoves them forwardumagain largelyuh that path forward i thinknecessarily goes through bitcoin miningand bitcoin production soyou know i mygreat hope is thatas a result of thiscoercion resistant money emerging and itforcing all market actors to adapt theirstrategiesto be more productive and lessantagonistic because antagonism justdoesn't work as wellthat bitcoinalmostencourages us or incentivizes us to relyon our reasonright this thisobjective distinctively human faculty weall have human reasonover force right it's almost like maybeyou could say it's simpler bitcoin'smaking force unreasonableso in that in that way it is makingcivilization more sustainable over timeuh less prone toyou know booms and busts right and againthe bust typicallyuhthe beginning of the bus is typicallythe breakdown of the monetary standardonce you've compromised the mostimportant protocol in a civilizationwhich is moneythat tends to presagecivilizational collapse as we've seencountless times throughout historysobitcoin acting as the shock absorber inthe energy political and technologydomainsis really exciting frankly andi amexcited to see where it goes soi hope you guys enjoyed that that wasepisode 14 of the sailor series uh i'llsee you back here again soon as we diveinto the last four's last four layersof the seven layers of the proof-of-worksecurity model[Music]",
