  "text": "[Music]um so my name is Olga and I'm a boardmember of the association because behindRGB and we've been doing that since 2019and I'm also a co-founder of FedoraPrime company which I will be talkingabout a bit laterfirst question just to understand whoI'm talking to who knows what Bitcoin is[Music]okay who is coming from blockchain worlddon't be shy it's okay everyone has itsclasses everyone is just fineum who knows what RGB isokay so um I will today give a briefoverview of what RGB is how it works notechnical details if you want to likeI'll just go in the depth of thetechnology you have Roxy morelosi herehe is the person who basically isresponsible for all the architecturalnightmare that people are complainingabout that RGB is too complex it's hardto understand this stuff so if you haveany technical questions he is the personwe can attackI've just been talking about so[Music]um I will start with the disclaimerthat some things might be prettyoffensive here and if this presentationis indeed not like politically correctand it's not for people underage orpregnant hystericalvote related people as well so I'm notresponsible for any reaction that youmight ever have after thisso this is an agenda I will briefly talkabout why we need RGB what it is what isnot which is also very importantand what rgd can do when you can use ituh who does it and how and basically ifyou want to get involved how you can doitso part one why do we need archeryum back in the day when Bitcoin uhhappened basically especially afterethereum happened there becameumthere has been this notion of complexsmart contracts that will help people togain their own sovereignty to help themcreate proper money to help them stayindividuals not to depend on any thirdparties Etcso basically the expectation was nothinglike thispack of wolves having their ownagenda having their own powers havingtheir own money and basically followingwhatever the will they havein reality as we all probably startespecially with the dinner worldwe received thiswhy because there were many compromisesdone in the process of achieving thegoals the goals were learned to Humblebut those were really very good but themethods of achieving the goals and thetechnological infrastructure wasvariable so basically from thisin theory we became this in practice wedon't have censorship resistance incurrentblockchain based Technologies we don'thave we always have some third-partyexchanges or middlemen they could stillmove our cryptocurrencies back and forthetc etc So eventually we didn't reachwe established bothum one of the most important parts ofthe sovereignty is indeed money and yesthere is a notion of fixing money fixthe worldand many people manufacturers have beentrying to do it but again we havedifferent things here we have theexpectation and the goals and the claimsand you have the reality of what we needto deal with right now basically on adaily basis so the expectation was thatactually you have a friend and he toldme that it would be a very good drinkinggame to drink a shot every time they seea word kill on my sideso probably already here everyone wasjust kid wasted so the condition wasthat we as Sovereign people will givebirth to technology and to money thatwill kill the banks that will eliminatecentralized exchanges that will createassets that will not be owned by a thirdparty this is why and thus this thirdparty will never have the ability toscrew you overum will not have tokens that wouldcreate some we will have tokensfrom uh meaningful topics that would bethe best way to put it but again inreality with all the Traders all thecompromises that we as developers asbusiness owners as users eventookwe have a solution we do have solutionstoumthe current broken Financial system butyour Solutions are not secure andespecially back in the day anything upyou can see a lot of hacks happeningeverywhere at any level Hardware won'tsign into OG signing devices basicallyuh software while it's on applicationLevel applications desktop once uhcentralized exchanges Bridges everywhereum if we talk about for exampleblockchains we probably all remember thestory about the crypto keys well just avery fun singing lead project just cameout and it broke the whole financial andother parts of the infrastructure ofethereum which was pretty huge at thatpoint already but still one goodtechnique managed to kill themum of course right now if you talk aboutthe device especially the transactioncosts are very high and basically it'sfocused not on meaningful transactionsbetween people but more on speculationgetting yields and all thatand the question arises here like yesokay but where bitcoiners right so we wehave Bitcoin and that's our core we'renot into this D5 space we're doingsomething better we're doing somethingmore solid why do we even care about D5why do we even care about this chaosthat's happening in the blocks andokayso the issue here is thatDefy is not the right thingif I as a conceptit's not a bad thing so we need to careabout what's happening in ethereal worldwe need to see how they feel we need tosee and learnhow exactly not to build the solutionsand understand why the solutions thatthey have for example they don't workbecause they're also very smart peopleworking there like really they arephotographers they're trying to do zeroknowledge stuff they're trying to doscalable stuff if all of them failand for us because Finance is not justBitcoin you cannot have Financialsystems having only Bitcoin you actuallyneed to expand it there are so many usecases and we need Bitcoin Finance weneed the financial ecosystem in Bitcoinand based on bitcoinum what I mean by Financial systemsI mean all the tools and technologiesthat are required for at leastthese fourum Industriesitinvolves trading it involves lendingnfts and it is not in terms of tokens ofcrypto kitties or something like thatbut nfts NFLs actually are a very validuse case because 10 of these allowartists music creators content creatorsto actually remain retain theirownership over the production over theirintellectual property and still gainmoney out of it distribute but not givethe rights for others to copy paste itwithout even saying thank you so for menft is much more thandoggies kitties and no other animalsand of course the um doll the down usecase is also very important becauseum it allows the legal Arbitrage andbasically you don't defend you you withthe Dell properly structured andproperly implemented now you can createa community of people find you togetherbut still working as separate agents notdepending on each other but cooperatingtogether which is very differentso in Bitcoin and for us as individualswe do need all this the question is justhow to build itso looking at the blockchain ecosystemflaws we we came to the conclusion thatthe solution is neededand the solution should be a smartcontract system which would be veryprivate but still verifiable so thereshould not be a question of trustwhether you must trust the second partybut the question is rather how can youverify whether this party is crew inEurope or notbecause you don't need to trust someoneas long as you are sure that the personor this organization they don't have anymeans to actually commit any fraudagainst you and this is very importantumalso one of the important things is thatthe system needs to be resistant tocensorship but still open for a fairparticipation and it should be scalableand it should be fast so basically allof this especially this one resistanceto censorship is absolutely was itactually was one of the main and fataltrade-offs that ethereum can you donateback in the daysthey they are Technologies on trustingeach other on Collective voting onCollective uh deliberately given up thepower of the individual to send out tosome structure to some organizationand they also didn't have the protocolsand the technologies that would providethe synthetic resistance on thetechnological therenowe approached to say that we do have thesolution the proper solution to all ofthose problems and to all those casesnow that solution is called RGBso first question easy what is RGB soRGB is a very skill level and what iswhat is important to incomplete smartcontract system for Bitcoin which isable to work with Bitcoin and withlightning Network it's zero knowledgebased means that it's extremely privateand it has extremely strong privacyassumptionswhen people ask so how old is RGB it'sumit's very easy I think still to answerthe question and the question isit's actually pretty old because theconcept started in 2016 and then it uhin 2018 where uh when vaccine joined theteam with Jaco muzuka and they and weestablished the electricity Associationuh the concept of RGB was to rethoughtbecause it started as let's do tokensover like maybe then Maxine when he'sBrave says he can do it join the teamand he understood the potential of thetechnology he understood that there ismuch more than money to this there ismuch heat butwhat what the world actually needs it'snot another talking protocol it's afully flesh and private smart contractsystemumso what is RGB RGB is a smart contractsystem he doesn't have any native tokenor whatever it doesn't have any gasanything like that it's a sterlingprivate it's so far the only technologythat actually works with the lightningNetworkuh it's blockchain agnostic meaning thatumas a base layer as the commitment layeryou can use Bitcoin you can use anyblockchain you can use basicallyanything even in newspaperimportant to notice here is thedefinition of a smart contract becauseespecially now from what I see evenordinals claim that they are smartcontracts for alcohol which iskind oftrue and not at the same timeso we defined a smart contract as theway to enforce the Fulfillment of acertain agreement between humans withoutan external centralized agency that willenforce people to actually do what theyagree to do it includes militarygovernment reports whatever and whatnotum RGB is the only system that workswith these paradigms at quarter and corethe first one and one most important oneis the client-side validation meaningthat all the data on the asset is storedon the client side if you own the acidyou know about its existence you canverify the information about it you cantransfer it if you have the propertiesyou can reshapeetc etc but unless the information isdeliberately exposed into the public noone else in the world will ever evenknow that the asset exists and that'sbasically the concept like by that bythat we're really badly pretty oldconcept of their rights so RGB is also abetter ride systemthe second Paradigm that r2b is using isthe single use skills and it's amechanism to prevent the double suit andof course we're using cryptographiccommitments and strict encoding in ordertoum not not vote the underlying levelthe boxing in our case all or lightningchannels and to make the system privateum here's a linkyou can make it photos or see on thevideo afterwardsand uh read upon the paradise after the topso uh briefly and on the very very highlevel this is the client-side data wecall it stash it's basically everythingthat you know about the glasses it's thethicker it's the name it's the amountlike how many of the assets were issuedwho was the issuer etc etc if thatinformation isugly uh if you if it's provided and thisDashuh and the information if you want totransfer the acid from one from yourselfto someone else you can collect theinformation into either live in channelswhich makes RGB layer 3 as people callit technology or you can do thisblockchain as the commitment mediumwhich makes RGB aware too technology[Music]um very important to notice here whatRGB is notRGB is not a token protocol we have beentalking and mentioning this over andover again for many years RGB is notjust about tokens anymore it never itnever has been since 2008.RGB is not a side chain it's not ablockchain it's not a roller and it'snot a network because sometimes RGB getscompared to likely Network and nounfortunately or fortunately if you'retrying to understand RGB through theprison of how lightning network works oreven how Bitcoin worksRGB is a new beast and you actually needto start learning about it from scratchforeign[Music]tells me that like every time I try toexplain what RGB ismost of the people just don't believethat things like this is possible yetmagically or not actually not but it ispossible so coming back to the questionof Bitcoin finance and building TheSovereign Finance for individuals howcan we do that with RGBum in RGB invisible Association we havethree components of how we can achievethat and build it build the BitcoinFinance the first one is the RGB is theSmart contract system the second one isB Frost is basically an extension to thelightning Network because currentlightning Network and its architecturethey it's not as robustas and it's not as private and it'sactually not as agile as needed to befor the Bitcoin Finance because BitcoinFinance is a very complex notion becauseit includes a lot of things like thisand that'sliquidity posts features options allthis is a very complex system this iswhy they need to have something veryrobust someday and last but not least wehave a storm protocolis the data Network and Global Statecarrier and storm uh the name stormcomes from storage and messaging andthis is the protocol that we are usingfor a story that is working Partnersright now but we are still using italreadyumto store the stash and the data on theassets and to transfer them through themessaging channelswhat we have from the perspective ofsoftwarefor Core Concepts because we have muchmore than this so there are four nodesthat allow us to do everything that Idescribed before the first one is theArduino for the smart contracts thesecond one is the VP node it's this thisone is basically Bitcoin level thingeven if you just cross everything elseyou can use this just for your Bitcoinstuff forgetting about energy so vpnoteis the Bitcoin indexing node it's fasterand much more efficient than electricserver we have the lfp node is thelikely node implementation that we haveit's fully in Rust and it supports thatfunctionality to upgrade RGB future B5and everything like that and finally thestorm node for the storage messagingmessaging and searchanswering the question of which level toacknowledge your GP is[Music]any and none I want to say because invaryingspecific situations RGB is actuallyorthogonal evenboth to lightning Network enter Bitcoinand the person responsible for this uheven for this triangle is sitting righthere so if you have any questionsso if you have any questions on howexactly keep them up with thearchitecture like that please come overask questions afterwardsum making a step back is there anythingelse besides Bitcoin Finance if I did itwith RGB yes there are actually manythings that you could do you can doassets of course you can do a lot ofgaming stuff uh Collectibles you canprint digital art and tokenize it andthen sell it still maintaining theartificial priceuh you can do voting systems you can dothose very private very secure veryrobust and very scalable which is alsovery important and things like digitalidentities throwing profiles KeyManagement that's also possible to dowith arterybecause you saw these like hugehistory's life so we have been buildingthis for quite a few yearsis therethe good thing is that Easter so one ofthe firstum most stable I want to say releasesthat we highly was the version 8 0.8 itwas released in June last year soone year ago and basically for those ofyou who already wanted to build stuffwith our GPU play around with it youcould use itfor the past year alreadybut for those of you who want to buildto start start building it nowwe have this release 0.10 which is evenbetter 0.10 has we have been working onit for many months and it does haveconsensus breaking changes whetherpeople compared to the 0.8 versionbutumthe architecture the tooling that weprovide with this release are much morerobust and comprehensive so basicallyright now we can say that we do haveeverything for wallet Developers forbusiness owners for Content creators tostart building on rgd and we hope thatthere will be no consensus breakingchanges after this leading to freezingof rgd development within the followingover the years so the bug fixing will bethere but this is the RGB version thatwill be released and probably this isthe RGB version that people would usefor maintenance stuffso question who built RGB who's behindthe LGBum RGB in 2019uh so in 2019 we established thenon-profit in Switzerland called lpbpstandards Associationum right now it's the largest Bitcointactical non-profit in Susan which we'revery proud of and we have right now Ithink up to 70 contributors which ispretty hugeum if you want to supportyou can use geyser uh this is thelightning addressif you want to support you know someonewho would be interested in supportingand donating you can also go to theOnline PVP standards association websiteand there will be our BTC based serverlinkit's that muchand one more thing we when we startedworking on r2d1 Institute thatmaking a bet fully thaton some on the notion that Communitywill understand and support RGBdevelopment to the extent that we mightbe in it was probably wrong so as crazyas we are we established the for-profitassociation mixing line and innon-profit for-profitwe established[Music]a company that is that has been drivingthe RGB adoption where we're creatingcontent we create user-facing productsand we created something that somethingthat people can use touch and somethingintangible instead of just having theparticle released and then forcing thepeople to just figure out their wayaround it the company is calledendorphan and we call it DB5 companybecause we're the first ones the mostReckless one in front ones probably westarted already using our own productsour own softwarewithout actuallyso this is basically how it works youhave the open source centers librariesand everything at the level of telepvpAssociation and we have Servicesproducts Tools in Pandora companyone of the probably most famous ones uhfrom our products is most citizen it'sthe first r2d wallet that was everreleased were released ittwo years ago first one first versionyeahand right now we have two versions ofthem uh the first is the desktop walletcurrently it's uh Bitcoin only walletbut it already has functionality that isnot even on bitcoin level it's notpresent in any other wall for examplethe dynamic Time Walk 126 which arewhich can create very complex setupswhich are required for companiescorporate asset management for familyasset management or even for yourprivate management when you have forexample 15 signing devices three laptopsand you never understand where to usewhich one that's the problem that's thescope of problems that my city is alwaysactually solvingand of course we are adding right nowthe support for the uh 0.10 release ofRGB and it will be done within thefollowing couple of weeks so we are veryexcited about ituh next uh we understood that there is ahuge demand for a more programmableBitcoin and the other the second productof ours would be the RGB Ram Bitcoinwhich will have decentralized issuancewhich is one of the biggest concerns forevery user out there it will bring a lotof programmability to this point it willit will be extremely private and it willbe the foundation for building furtherV5 products both for our company and formany other companies that have beenworking with uswe are also uh detox about with Partnersto issue the digital Swiss print Swissfranc which can be a killer featureespecially for this region because therehas been a lot of talks about the needof the private first of all they need tobring back the notion of Switzerland asthe most private and secure AssetManagement Network so we're bringingthat motion back homeif you want to read more about r2d thisis the not exhaustive but list ofchannels chats and websites that you canuseright now we have more than 20 websitesthat you can actually go to and learnabout RTD try products Etc but this is agreat place to start that you send toyour friendsthank youthat's it for nowI hope I managed to answer at least somequestionsif you have any questionsyou can throw themthank you could you explain a little bitmore how the species constant.com willworkfrom the technical point of view yeahjust just an idea about how it looks sothe technical pointI think that the question is how it willbe backed and it will be better yeah bythe friendsBank based Swiss Francs with a digitaltoken being present in RGB so it's notit's nothing uh decentralized or nothingin that sort but what it allows is tostart getting an adoption in the realeconomy because what is important isthat the speed of lighting Networkallows retail to retail using the retailwithout high fees and without waiting 10minutes for confirmation and uhyeah and without uh like even you use aSwiss franc with ethereum it will stillhave a high fees here are all thosethings are solved because of the wipingNetwork so that's the idea how to startbuilding adoption around the likingnetwork with some stable coin that canbe used by the merchants so yeah Swissfranc is centralized so the the tag inthis case will be centralized becausethere is no reason to try to do itdecentralized but it would be atemporary solution which can help withthe bootstrapping theuse of the technology and alsoSwitzerland itself is the country thatis probably most open tocrypto space to experiments in the worldright now so and we're based here so itwould be enough wise to not take thisadvantage and not try to leverage it anduse it and prove that the technologythat we built can actually work in thereal life so you you will recognize witha financial institutionwe're working with a council ofviewership of UCL to the medical job andstill a lot of people yeswell there was already a digitalsubscribe thing but Bitcoin is used forinstancethere were some issues with this likethere was a negative interest learningback in their days meaning that it wasimpossible to maintain important nowit's not the casebut I don't understand how I relocatesthe kids in Canton so it's not aclassical institution like just aprivate just a privately held Bankum but given that recently the cinemareduced the limits you can uh convertanonymity I thought without qic thecrypto from a thousand a month a day toa thousand a monthand um BT is going to I think they'regoing to fight this in Imports[Music]umwe have been fighting this over the pastI think two or three years already rightbecause I haven't been trying this topush this into action for many years itisa really pure sort of really um excitedat the possibility that someinstitutions are going to say okay we'rejust going to issue 20 minutes withranks and they're going to be Monerostyle untraceable it's just floatingaroundmoving from here to crypto so it's notabout it would be a question of theissue in this case the bank how theywill improve the source of the funds butbecause they use all their own fundsit's not the problem and when peoplewill be buying uh Swiss franc forBitcoin it's also not a problem there isno limit where the limit is is when thepeople will try to buy digital Swissfranc for a real Swiss franc that's whyI would a narrow thing and that's wherethat limits but one thousand like it'sreally bad that's regulation but itwouldn't prevent the adoption becauseit would be immediate like potentialmillions of people buying that with thislimit so it's not the limitation to theeach cure its limitation for movingbetween crypto and not crypto andactually in this case having digitalSwiss Chinese might change theperception of crypto in FEMA's mightalso because they basically have anoption to embrace this in more moneygain more attraction helps with someonebecoming more fancy and more open to theforeign Capital etc etc so it's theirconfidence basically sothey have a very egoistic intereststhere as well and hopefully it will alsobackfire in a good way for us otherpeopleI hope it works we hope so too I have aquestion about the triumphant validationI'm still striving to understand thethe third thing to do so it's like whenI'm going to issue a token or somethingwith LGB I have to run a server wherethe data will be about this the amounteach the number of tokens or it's justlikeit's the time that we validate the dataget describing the data from theblockchain beacon blockchain or writinguh perhaps to document the server youcan do that without the server and thesecond the easiest way of understandingit is probably taking analogy with apaper certificates like sharescertificates all these very rightinstruments that were back in the daysso if I give you uh shares of some BDIcompany on paper how you verify thatwell you don't need to run the serverthe only thing that you need to do is inthe moment when you would like to acceptthem which would be non-interactive evenyou need to read what's written thereand check the signature and come to themcome to the conclusion I will find withthat or not and it's your decision sothis is validation and that isclient-side validation and the onlyquestion is how you can prove that therewas no double spending that there is noset copy of the paper I gave to somebodyelse so you need a notary as well so Isee that you're of Lottery on that paperyou trusted the doctor here the notaryis Bitcoin blockchain so you put thecommitment into the blockchain andbecause we leverage the mechanism ofBitcoin YouTube so and spending becauseyou bind the paper to utxo when themusics are spent you commit to the newowner and you can't commit just to onenew owner and you prevent doublespending by that so that's another wayfor us before blockchain is the notarythat advanced side validated data isjust digital paper containing all theinformation and that's why informationis not in the blockchainyeah this is what I uh I mentioned thisbriefly before as you know as thedifference between having an obligationto trust the issuer and having theactual power to verify the informationorders on your siteso client side validation actuallyshifts the Paradigm from trusting thedeparting to being able to fullyvalidate and understand what you'reholding whether it's a real asset orit's fake and deny the transaction notat the moment when you already acceptafter you accepted it and after youunderstood that expensive cap but at themoment of acceptance so here before itdecides your problem you already canverify whether it's a scam or notokay how do you attach the the asset tothe Utica utxo you just say it's likethe asset that this you takes off is theeutex so that defines the future historyof this Castle so you don't do anythingon shading I just tell you like I cansay this utxo which I control and Idon't need anyone to prove that Icontrol this feature stock and at themoment this YouTube suspense means thatmy asset has movedand then when I move the asset forinstance to you you need to verify thatYouTube server spend you don't care whoowns that YouTube store but you'll careto check against the promise and when itspent you check that the transactionspending it commits to the fact that youare new owner as Tennessee and SAU owneryou define your only Tech storage Nowcontrols who will the future of theconferenceso the information in the yeah is theinformation it defines the stated datesyes but then it means that in this stageare committed into Bitcoin transactionsyes so my question is how do youretrieve you compute the last day do youhave to rely on the indexing indexingSynergy if you don't compute you get thewhole history yes clients I did attachedfrom me to you so they are not passthrough the blockchain it's likeenlightening Network so you can'tsomehow throw them relay through thelighting Network through the emailthrough the paper the way you want butyeah you have to compute the state inthe time you compute it from the datathat you're investing to you okay so itmeans that the data for the state isgoing to increase yes for sure yesreally like with any other productsunless you will one day we will start upstart using zero knowledge to compressthe history so what is the indexing modeforuh it's not used in RGB it's quite aninteresting note because it makes thingsfaster because you still need to queryblockchain about the beauty exhaustbeing spent and connecting with this inthe presenceokay so you said that it is a stringcomplete right yes okay so one basicattack could be like I send you a stateupdates that does an interviewis not possible because it has ait's a bounded by the number ofexecution steps it can last at mostso you can't do this restriction of the60 million operations okay for Statetransition[Music]and if I want to show everything tosomeonewhat are the resources right now I cansound like is there any playground toissue tokens I know there is a viruswallet made by the company that you canyou can issue and tested okay is thereany resources we can play in it butright now there's an archery.techwebsite which has an installation[Music]and everything yeah so you go to thergb.tech there is a lot of informationwhich is enough for understanding thebasics of RGB and then there is theinstallation page and basically thereyou have a step-by-step guide on how youdownload information the the packagesand everything how you can issue theassets how you can transfer them receivethem Etcusing RGB contracts for developersriding ball drops into creating learningand so on thank youthe first one the uh version 0.10 willbe added to the Wallace my secrets areincluding because there are a couple ofother modes that have been working onRGB support as wellit will become easieryou will have more user friendlyinterfaces to play around with RGB butagainfrom the start it will be basically justplaying around with RGB because forexample you cannot issue any seriousassets from your mobile phone it's kindof stupid if you need to give you anasset you need to sit down have yourlaptop have your lottery maybe yourcontacts so it's a very important thingto do so there will be more playgroundsright now the roster bus one is on theRGB data and there will be more moretime with the support of the versionwith your appointmentsixit is there any exchange that wouldaccept your tokens in order to createsome trades for fillings usually on onbitcoin for another weekend or may I buysome french fried food with Bitcointhrough your this technology isparticular Mouse well between us hasbeen a very good supporter of RGBtechnology so the Phoenix is veryinterested in uh issuing Each Other Wellactually and probably with time theymight be interested in adding otherattribute-based tokens to ituh if you want to check how many howmany tokens there are publicly availablewhich is very important so those peoplewho want their token their RGB tokens tobe issued and to be publicly known uh wewill release the rgbx.io it's the RGBasset Explorer of sorts and you will beable to go there to see if it would besomething like what you wantprobably will take some time to add RGBbecausethere is another project that tries toimplement the exchange at least to whichwe know when they will be ready we willalso there is information about them[Music]so soonI guess the Swiss franc uhyes yesso the work requires paper Corner beforeI related[Music]so you can introspect from the virtualmachine in the state about the contractsbut you need to know about thatcontractsabout its existence to interact withthatthere is an idea we have likeworking one asset from the other comfortand so on that it's not in the currentversion because of the lists of theuh it's a difficult increase of attacksurface so you can until you canformally prove that it's safe we decidednot to go with that whatever but it'snot required because again you canintrospect the state you can make onecontract dependent on the state of theother conferenceand one of the things that is usuallyusually difficult is a utxo base thetoken is thatthat is owned by some key in some way soyou it's very hard to make somethinglike a really constructing interior thatanyone can calllike if you want to fight an IMM youneed anyone to be able to throw it backyeah the research thing it's calledState extensions and balances that whichcan be used by a public but to interactwith the conference so crazy it waspossible to put that into into Excelbased model as well by extending the yesyes[Music]not necessary the main thing that is notis it is more secure but more importantthat it provides the front runningbecause for the client-side holidaysnobody knows what's what's happeningthere is no miners involved there is noblockchain State involved this is thefirst thing and the second it would bemuch cheaper and faster because it willbe operating or liking network not onthe Chain level so this actually resultsin in a higher securityand also another point of the highersecurity is thatenergy this virtual machine which isused in the smartphone versus formallyverifiable so it's not stack based it'sregister based it's very deterministicso you can reason aboutthe contract colleges in a much moreefficient way than in ethereum becausein ethereum you need to make sure thateach method of the contract do notforget to manage to list who is uh whohas the right to call this methodbecause one of the main facts is thatsomebody who don't supposed to call thismethod they call the method and kill thecontinent to break the funds in RGB thisis much easier to analyze because allthe rights under the contract belong tocertain ug exhaust so you can't create acontract method which is which canaffect the state and not being bound toa dude extra even with the stateextensions this thingI do execute the state extension but themoment when it becomes real is themoment when I transfer what I have didto another body and I'm doing thatthrough YouTube so and then the momentyou verify and if I did something wrongyou're just not accepting that andnobody accepting that from me so thestate extension I have created is voidbecause it's like only I know about itand I can't make it a real part of thecontract history so because all therights are bound to YouTube sourceit's really you can't forget to list whohas the right to call this methodbecause it's always bound to eat jigsawand whoever has the right to spend thathe takes so it has the right to callthat effortso it's easier to analyze formally thesafety properties of the contractis it possible[Music]contract to get data from externalthings like apis but in ethereum is likeprotocolyeah you can have oracles but oracles uhyeah well you kind of the samestructures or questions plus DLCs okayokaythe adapter signature replace oracleswhich are possible even on bitcoin laterand invite me okay okay so you don'tneed to learn any complex logic you usethe signature and scriptless scripts toto do the work okayso I'm a bit confused because you saidrgbc some type of lightning and thenlightning yeahso it's like two levels down right likebefore so I mean the ownership of theutxo is I think the cold layerization uhstory is approach is a bit wrong likeit's not working that way so there is uhlayers of Bitcoin consensus we shouldjust do the layer one is blockchain andthe layer two is three channels and thensort of lightning Network it's the stateChannel both or lightning Channeland uh both of them operated withBitcoin transactions so transactions thecurrent transaction exists in both ofthem and how they differ by their layersbecause they differ in the way theystructure the security the consensus isthe layer one the lightning in thechannel State channel is the layer twobecause it's not here at mind but it canbe formally provable to be definableso that's Villiers and there is no RGBthere now when we come to our GP RGB isbased on bitcoin transaction which mayexist on any of those layers but on topof that RGB you have a lightning Networkas a network between State channelswhich we should know about the RGB sothat's why like RGB sticks into thelightning Network splitting it intoState channels and the network acquiredfeatures on top so that's kind of whylayerization is not exactly the thingthat workswe have some issues with uh people beingable to front-end others and IMS andwhat I understand from your stateextensionsin some way a timestamping system toto order them rightyou have to change the way you thinkabout the smart contracts with theclient-side validation program becauseit's not workingwith a strict analogy to ethereum okayso in many cases you actually do notneed a smart contractuh and umto a big extent part of Iron Man is notso much arguably based as Lightningbases because uh if you try to tradewith me so for instance I am a note ofthe decentralized exchange I'm doing thetrade and you're trying to interact withme you just ask me the price and youcreate htlc which for whichforces me to use that priceso the only thing RGB adds here is theasset so now you can do the tradingbecause you have not just a Bitcoin butmore assets so you are not actuallydoing the mm in RGB you're doing I am anenlightening using RGB for hostingassets and there is no smart contractcode which you are calling you arecalling the RPC of the lightning notesor P2PAPI for the other liking notes and youare doing lightning things that's itthat's it and that's why it's very verydifferent but for instance if you wouldlike to do a liquidity tool where youwill have um[Music]oh trustlessrelations with those who bring thatability then you would need additionallyto multi-gear lightning Channel also anRGB contract which will state all therequirements of interaction between thespears as a part of the liquidity poolso it's on the other side of RGB butthere the result front running problembecause it's liquidatable like itoperates as a whole from the point ofview of external world in in case oftrading so with a front finding problemon the deck side the result from runningbecause only you as a node sees thepayment as you're either executed or notand that's itso you will do that like communityseeking likeit's not available[Music]there's nothing on function can work yesit's not scalable okay so this would beexcessive okay thanks ethereum was alsonot working onblockchainsutility right let me know utility wellyou can see there is a utility but it'snot scalable utilitylike uh one of the explanation I had toreview back in the days that you seeabout the world computer where the wholeworld have just a single keyboard[Music]foreignexcept for consensus well I mean doesn'twork for retail cases and real worldusersscale of usage level that way so it doeswork but it doesn't scale to the levelsuch that it would get adopteduh ethereum had more power because it iswhy why what didn't happen on colorphone has happened on ethereum well thisis because of Turing from completenessyesbecause like the result much interestingpoints these days yes people are gettingcrazy about everything like ordinanceand but I don't see anything interestingthere likeyeah so you think uh a lot of someneighbors who cannot solve thiscredibility problem on ethereumuh Roll-Ups potential I guessbut the current state of things is thatthey are even more centralized than thetheory of layer one so of course theywill solve the scalability problem uhwith a trade-off of uh crazy or creatinga decentralization robotand it's very easy to solve scalabilityfrom PayPal soul to to like turn thekids to go like just put a centralserver and there is no scalabilityissuesyeah and your sections because when youstart to have holdups and the shadingthen to interact within charts uh I meanwith Institute shots and then it becomesyeah yeah there are also liketheoretically as they are sold the keyrobots looks like real promising thingbut the important thing is how it wouldwork at the end of the day in practicebecause like ethereum was also saltedoriginal list and moral Computing isdoing everything from what I'm sayingseeing from thewhat we have today in case of the the incase of Road Labs is that they arecentralized and the whole power ofcuring completeness on ethereum with azero knowledge is theoreticallyaccurable there are already cases whereit works but we don't know how it willwork in practice with us whether it willbe scaryand there are concerns that it might notscale so I don't know who to solve theproblem maybe it would I don't know butI have some doubts and skepticism aboutthat well industry regard it's a goodthing that we have RGB because RGB iskind of a charting done right becauseagain as a concept charging is a prettygood conceptimplementation so far sucks in thetheorem world because it's like it canbe done but it probably will it can bedone as well with a lot of trade-offsthat will backfire in a very verypainful way to every single user outthereso and in our studio we basicallycreated the chart into the property soyeah you can have an alternative to moveto in case everything goes down thedrain there YouTube so it's like alreadycharging at the highest level positionbut actually your part is even thatbecause you don't see ever in many mostof the kids you ever don't see a wholehistory of the smartphoneyou see only the part of the historywhich is related to the assets or thestate that you own on your in pixels andthe rest is hidden from you which isactually very useful in real casescenarios as well because for example ifuh if we can say that there are 10people that own some kind of asset acollectible which is worth like millionsand dollars or whatever andthe government pressures one party oneperson or one organization holding thetoken even if this organization exposesthe information they have on the acid itdoesn't compromise everyone else becausethey literally don't have anything togive they don't have the otherinformation they don't have other piecesof the fossilso you're still as a part of assetholdercommunities I want to say you're stillkind of secure from theyesany question yesumwould you say the consensus of theconsensus mechanism properly so this isjust typically blockchain no wow Bitcoinblockchain plus RGB specific consensusrules which exist in outside of Bitcoinreallyso it's kind of two independent concernswell two concerns of swam of whichdepends on the other but it also hasthings which are independent of therobot so it's it's spreading a complexhistorian at the end of the dayforeign",
