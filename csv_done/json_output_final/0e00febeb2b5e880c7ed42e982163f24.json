and finally if you arebacking up any important bitcoin walletbe sure to get in solid steel uh i wouldsay that pieces of paper just don't cutit i want that peace of mind so i'm notworried about fire damage water damageall that stuff uh so this is typicallyhow i back up my wallets here with thebill funnel at privacy pros dot io socheck them out all of them are linkeddown below in the show notes and withthat let's dive into the tutorialso the first thing i want to do is talkprerequisites what are you going to needto know and what are you going to needto download in order to go through thisworkflow with me well uh number onelet'sfirst reestablish what we're going to bedoing we're going to be purchasingbitcoin from a non-kyc source in thiscase something called robosats of whichthere are many different ways to paybecause you're doing it peer-to-peer sowe'll go through those options in alittle bitbut to interact with robosats you'regoing to need to use tor browsertechnically speaking you can use itwithout torque browser that's notespecially advisable given that you canleak things like your ip address whendoing that so you're gonna want to goand download tor browser uh also indealing with robo sats uh you'reyou don't have to have it but i wouldrecommend having telegram for desktopi just find it super useful or if you'redoing this on mobile then for mobilewill work just the same um but yeahtelegram will just give younotifications of the state of your offerthe other thing that you'll want to getis the actual uhonion url or the website for robosatsand you can find that a couple places soyou can go torobosats.com and it will give you awarning hey you're not re using thisprivately this is clearnet you probablywant to use our onion site and it sayshey you're going to need to get torbrowser and here's the link to our onionsite and you would just copy that urland paste it in in tor browser you canalso find the same information fromtheir twitter handleand you'll see robosats.com but moreimportantly down below there's a link totheir tor website and you can just copyand paste that in to tournowin the process of interacting withrobosats you're also going to needa lightning wallet which will lock upfundsfor a little bit this is just to preventspam orders from going into the orderbooksand so one that's really easy to use andseems to work pretty well with theplatform there's tons of other optionsas i'll mention but uh would be walletof satoshi so you can download that fromyour app store if you want to use thatpretty simple umyeah and so you'll have that and alittle bit of bitcoin in it depending onhow much you're looking to buy but itwill be temporarily locked up as youmake your order and then you go fromthere umthere is a full tutorial on that downbelow by the wayup next you're going to want somewherethat you're going to receive yourbitcoin so we're going to be usingsparrow wallet today you can grab thatfrom sparrowwallet.comand just get that for desktop and we'llgo through the setup of setting up youraccounts and everythingand then we're then going to be usingsparrow wallet to coin join and thatcoin join is going to go directly into ahardware wallet which we're also usingwith sparrowand that's going to be the cold cardtoday i'm going to be using the coldcard mark iv this will work the same ifyou have different cold card walletsif you have different types of hardwarebut this is what i'm using becauseobviously i love my cold card inparticular i'm going to be using themark iv i'm also going to be using coldpower which is just a littledongle that allows you to connect to anine volt battery for for power i'mgonna be using one of these sd cards andi'm gonna be using the little powercable that connects to your cold powerso when you see all that stuff on thedesk that's what it is uh and outside ofthat i think that's more or less whatyou need you're going to need torbrowsertelegram messenger if you so choose andthe link to robosats you're going toneed a wallet of satoshi or some othermobile lightning wallet that is simpleto use umsparrow for desktopanda hardware wallet in this case for me acold card mark four and then you shouldbe set by the way as we go through allof this i just wanted to say that i willbe kind of glossing over a few thingsi'm just going through the flow hereexactly what you need to do to purchasemix and then secure your non-kyc sats soif you're going through and followingalong and you're like hey i havequestions about that that seemed tooquick i need some more explanation iwill link down below full tutorials oneverything that we use here so a fulltutorial on robo sats a little bit morein depth than what we do here i can havea full tutorial on wallet of satoshieven though it's pretty simple in itselfa full tutorial on sparrow wallet thebasics of just how to use it in varioussenses a full tutorial on how to do coinjoin via whirlpool within sparrow walletand then finally a full tutorial on thecold card wallet which in that tutorialis also used with sparrow wallet so youcan go through the gamut you can learnit all in depth ifthis tutorial by itself doesn't quitecut the mustard and you need to fill inthe gapswe can even either do this before orafter creating our robo-sats offer ororder um but we're gonna create asparrow wallet specifically for thispurpose now um i'm going to gloss over afew things here but we're just going togo through the flow of creating a newwallet so i'm going to go filenew wallet uh we'll say nonkycand we'll create the walletat this point we just want a regularsingle signature wallet it's going to benative segway we don't need to mess withthat right nowand then we're going to do a new orimported software walletat this point we're going to usefor the simplicity of this video i'mgoing to do 12 words and then we'regoing to choose generate new so we'recreating a new keyfor this wallet so generate newthis now gives us 12 words that we'regonna write down and keep safe for ournon-kyc wallet and this is going to beuh also where we're mixing just so youknow i'm doing something horrible rightnow i'm taking a screenshot just for theease of this uh video but normally i'dbe backing this up in steel or somethinglike thatnonetheless i've now got this we'll justsay this is my piece of paper here thati've written down my backup and i'mgoing to hit confirm backupand i'm just going to enter the wordsthat i had written downonce i have re-typed in my words i'mjust going to hit create key storewe're going to put import keystorei can close this out and then i'm goingto hit applydo we want to add a password thispassword has to do specifically withyour computer um if you don't wantsomebody getting in accessingpotentially spending from this hotwallet here then you can add a passwordi'm not going to do that right now soi'm going to say no passwordand here we go so we now have a walletthat can be receiving our non-kyc setsand we have a receive screen right therewe'll be using a receive address in alittle bit hereso here we are on tor browser and i'vesaved robosats as a bookmark here allrightso i'm just going to go ahead i'm goingto click on that and it's going to takeme to their onion websiteall right and here we are on their onionsite this will automatically generatewhat's known as a nim um a privacy toolthat enables you to receive uh bitcoinand be able to interact with otherindividuals uh without giving up yourinformation and so what you can do hereyou've got a few options you can make anorder which is what we're going to endup doing but you can also view the orderbookso you can look at the sell or the buyorders everything is listed down belowso if we hit view bookit'll showbasically all of the different ordersthat you can look at and there's you canscroll through the pages down on theright hand side you can also specify iwant to buy or i want to sell bitcoin soin this case we'd be looking to buy andthen it would show us the differentorders that are available to uswe'll go back to the main screen hereand we're going to make an ordernow it says how much would you like tobuy i'm going to be buying200 u.s dollarsworth i'd like to buy i'll specify thatokay and then fiat payment method whichwould you like to use and you can scrolldown i'm in canada interac e-transfer isan option um there's lots of differentones but i'm going to look forand i can even search hereamazon gift card okayso i'm going to put that innow what are you willing to pay overmarket pricefor this bitcoin so um when you're goingthrough non-kyc rails you're going toexpect a little bit of a premium here ifyou're holding this for the long termyou probably areyou know it doesn't really matter in therounding error that is the current priceso um i'm just gonna put uh five percentover over current market rate i thinkthatis pretty fair uh so i'll leave thatthere i'm gonna go ahead i'm gonna hitcreate orderand then this saysstore your robot ticket you might needto recover your robot avatar in thefuture store it safely you can simplycopy it to another application so thisis just if you need to get back and youneed to re-access this screen if youaccidentally close down tor or somethinglike thatthis is what you would save and i canjust save that to like a text editand we'll justdo a new documentand we'll paste that in so i'll just uhi'll save that for now i'll minimize itjust in case i need it it's a good ideato have a copy of it okay we'll hit doneall right so this is now making an orderon robosatsanduh we need to doa uh we need to lock up a little bit ofmoney here withinuh within robosats and what this does isit just makes sure you're not spoofingorders you're not spamming orders thingslike that okay so what i'm going to bedoing here is i've gotlet's see it shows compatible wallets bythe way so if you want to take a look atwhat wallets will work with this thiswill basically just lock up somelightning network statshere and it says here are thecompatibility ones here for simplicityi'm going to go with wallet of satoshiand so i can just open that wallet up onmy phone and let's see what do i need toput here i've got about i'm going toneed to lock up about 20 just shy of 25000 sats so i'll show you what's goingon on my phone here for a second so i'vegot wallet of satoshi open here this isjust a really simple it is a custodiallightning wallet app there's no kycinvolved in it or anything you can tryout moon you can try out breeze you cantry out phoenix other optionsbutit seemed like this one will work justfine so for my purposes all good sohere is wallet of satoshi all i'm goingto do is i'm going to hit the yellowsend button and scan the qr code thatwas on the screen there so i'm justhitting sendi'm doing a quick scanand it says it gives me basically all ofthe details about this order robosatspublishing order so on and so forth okayi'm looking for 200 us dollars and yeahit basically says to me it will beautomatically returned to you unless youcheat or cancel unilaterally so i'mgonna go ahead i'm gonna hit the greenpay buttonand it'll say sendingand there we go we can see that uh ithas come through enable and i can nowenable telegram notifications if i wouldlikeso i'm gonna go ahead and i'm gonna dothat i do have telegram on desktopenable i'll jump back here togoogle chromeand just so you knowthis link within tor doesn'tautomatically open up my telegram so ijust pasted the same urlhere in google chrome and now i can openup telegramand i'll pull it over so everybody canseehere'stelegram and hit startthere we goi will send you a message when someonetakes your order with id one one twoninesix perfect okay so i'll getnotifications about that whenever i needitlet's jump back to tor here i don't needthis open anymoreokayso now that we have an order up we'rebasically just going to wait forsomebody to take it um once somebodydoes take it we're gonna go ahead we'regonna buy an amazon gift card and thenwe'll communicate with the seller inorder touh ensure that we're going to receivethe right amount of bitcoin okay so sometime has passed and i've got enoughnotification here in telegram that tellsme that somebody has decided to take myorder for 200 with the bitcoin plus 5over market uh so i have this here itgives me a link to that but i already dohave a tour browser open and i can seeherethat uh i now have the option to receivepayment so first what i need to do isprovide um how i'm going to receivepayment you have both the option now andthis is a new feature that they addedbefore was primarily lightning so youcan accept via lightning network whichhas uhbetter privacy guarantees than justregular on-chain bitcoin um or you cango on chainand so i am going to go ahead and do onchain herebecause i wanted to come into that walland then i want to mix it afterwards sothis is what i'm gonna do um it does saythere's a swap fee because they're gonnabe swapping uh sats out of lightning andon tointo an on-chain transaction there'salso going to be a mining fee and thisis just based on how busy the network iscurrently um i'm okay with that and itsays the total amount that i'll end upreceiving is 786403 sats so what i need right now is ineed a bitcoin addressso i'm gonna grab this from sparrowwallet so we just set up our sparrowwallet priorand all you need to do here is on theleft hand side hit the receive buttonand this will take you to your receivescreen hereand i'll give a label to this i'll justcall it robo setsand i will copy the address we'll jumpback over to torand i will paste in my address and hitand you know it's always good to doublecheck it wkmt the last few digitslooking good there so i'll hit submitall right perfect at this point i'mgoing to beconnected to an individual that hasagreed to take this contractso i can nowinteract with them and kind of set upexactly what we're doing here and uh andand talk through everything so we'll beback once i do a little bit of chattingand we get everything in ordernow i'm going to go ahead and buy theagreed upon payment method which is anamazon gift card so i'm on amazon.combuying a us dollar gift card in theamount of 200and i can specify where it's going to besent basically i'm going to send it tomyself i will get the credentials toredeem it and then i will give thosecredentials to the person i'minteracting with on robosats now sowe'll be back when i do thatokay so i've successfully purchased thecard i've got um the way that amazongift cards were you can redeem them withthe redemption code so i've given thatto the uh seller of bitcoin here they'venow redeemed it everything looks good soi'm gonna go ahead i'm gonna hit confirmhere on robosats and the rest should beon their end to send over some bitcoinso i'm going to hit confirmall right and we can continue to chatuntil everything is resolved here and iwill let you know as that goesnow everything appears to have gonethroughso it says trade finished here's yourtransaction idit gives me the option to start againrenew order and it says that i should bereceivinguh786 403sets so we'll navigate over to sparrowwallet and ensure that is coming in alsoi should have uh the funds that were inuh wallet of satoshi should be unlockedas well so we'll go and we'll checkthose things um and then after we'llcome back and we'll give robostats arating as to how well things have goneover here in sparrow wallet success isee an unconfirmed transaction on itsway in for the exact number 786 403 setsandwe'll wait for that to confirm and thenwe can start our mixing process nextand just for good measureif we take a look at wallet of satoshiit actually showsthe previous transaction waswas held and it basically shows as ifit's in the process of going throughbecause it hasn't been officiallyaccepted on the other endand then it reverts back to my wallet sothere's actually no record of thattransaction having taken place um itdisappeared from uh my entire history oftransactions but i did make note of thebalance after sending that uh escrowtransaction through and it would havebeen around 10 000 sets so um thatreverted back the 23 or 24 000 sats isnow back in wallet of satoshi where itoriginated so we haveall the sats that we purchased and wehave the escrow fund that we hadinitially sent back in our own custodyand we're good to go ready to move onnow another part that we want to set upbefore we start mixing ournewly attained kyc free setsis we want to set up our cold card withsparrow wallet on desktop so i have acold card right here it's already beenset up so i'm making some assumptionshere that you've already kind of set itup you have a seed phrase that you'vewritten downpin is already set up all of that is setwe're just importing it into sparrowwallet if you're unfamiliar with thatagain down belowfull tutorial on cold card and so on andso forth so just on the main screen hereon your cold card you're gonna go downto advanced so we'll find advanceddown the screen and we're going tochoose again it says advanced slashtoolswe choose thatand then the second option there isexport wallet that's where we're goingso we're going to choose thatand then within this menu of what typeof wallet we're exporting to we'relooking for generic json so i'll scrolldown to that show you what it looks likeit is that one right there generic jsoni'm going to hit the check markit tells me it's going to save a file tomy sd cardand i'll just kind of scroll through theinformation here i'll hit the check markand it's going to ask you an accountnumber you can leave that blank uh we'lljust hit check mark thereand then it says generatingand this is creating a file on my cardand it sayshey if you're using nfc which is afunction of the mark ivhit three otherwise you can just hitcheck mark and it will create the fileso i just hit check mark and it saysthere's a file written and it says coldcard dot export so and so forth sothere's a file now on my sd card uhwhich i can now eject from the actualdevice right here and i can put thatinto my computerand that's pretty much all we're goingto need from the cold card itself rightnow so i'm just plugging this sd cardinto my computeri'll transition here so here's sparrowwallet here's the sd card i justbrought overthis isthe file i'm looking for cold cardexportso what i'm going to do here is i'mgoing to do filenew walletwe'll call itummk4we'll hit create walletuh and now this is an air-gappedhardware wallet so we're going to choosethat and then cold card where we lookfor the cold card we're going to hitimport file and we will looktothat sd card right thereandthis is the one we're looking for coldcard export json so hit openthere's all the information about ouraccount here we're going to hit applyi'm not going to add a password for thisoneand just takes a secondand there we go so everything's all doneandwe have our wallet now i've previouslyused this cold cardin other demo tutorials but if this wasa new one for you you would not see anyother transactions nonetheless we'regood to go here we have our cold cardwallet set up we're going to leave thatopen and if you notice now we have twodifferent tabs we have our non-kycwallet the hot wallet on our computerthat we created earlier and we have ourmark iv or thex-pub of our cold card so it can receivetransactions and then in order to sendtransactions out we'll need our coldcard to approve themso now that we have everything all setup we've got our cold and hot wallet wehave our non-kyc coins sitting in thehot wallet we can now start mixingdirectly into our cold card forlong-term storage so how do we go aboutdoing this well first we're going tohead over to our non-kyc wallet thatwe've created the hot one and uh justside note here we kind of skipped aheadi've uh i've bumped the fee here toexpedite this transaction so if you'renoticing a couple extra transactionshere that's just what that is um youknow you're able to bump the fee withinsparrow using a couple different methodsi'm not going to go into that now butagain if you're looking at thiswondering that's what it is nonethelesswe're going to go down to utxos withinour hot wallet hereand this shows youall of the bitcoin that you havereceived into your walletas representedby how you've received it so you canthink of it a little bit like having awallet and like a physical wallet andyou've received say a 10 20 and 50 billthis would be like looking at theindividual bills sitting within yourwallet um so here we've only got onebill right we only received one piece ofbitcoin into this wallet but if therewas more you could select them all hereuh you can basically just select andhighlight whatever you want to deal withuh but we're select selecting this oneutxo i'm going down andclicking on mix selectedand so this is our whirlpoolconfiguration this is where we set ourfees wedo whatever we need to do to prep thesecoins to be mixed to anonymize themforward facingand why are we doing this wellthere may be some sort of linkagebetween you and your coins based on howyou've transacted with the individual toget your non-kyc coins so in theinstance of me i bought an amazon giftcard and i gifted it to somebody well uhthey could possibly find out who giftedthem the amazon gift card and then theycould go ahead and say well these coinsthat i sent to this person i'm going totrack them nownow that i know who has them or if youdealt with a bank account and you'vesent somebody a transfer from your ownbank account or an account associatedwith your namethey may be able to then look at thecoins they sent you and see where theygo from then on and begin to paint apicture of what your own well in thiscase you're breaking that link forwardfacing so they know that you got a smallamount of bitcoin from them but theydon't know what you do next and theycan't tellwhat other coins you own so this is whyyou would mixsohere we go uh basically it says you canenter a code this is acode that gives you lower fees for usingwhirlpool if you get one i don't haveone right nowthere is the priority in terms of feesso you can uhyou know lower and higher the uh thefeed that you're attaching here so i'mgoing to leave it as is right in themiddle and then i'm going to hit nextand then this is going to fetch theavailable pools that i'm eligible forbased on the amount of bitcoin that i'mmixing they have different sizes ofpools uh one of the smallest is ahundred thousand sats there's a millionsats and it kind of goes up from thereandbecause we only have seven hundred andsome odd thousand sats we're going to bekind of sat with the smallest poolavailable which is fine and so thisshould pop up momentarily all right wecan now see what pools were eligible forthere would be a drop down menu if wewere eligible for more say if i had 10million sats here it would give me allof the different sizes of poolsand their associated fee so i can seehere i can only drop into this poolthis will give me five separate utxos ofa hundred thousand set or sorry ratherumit's going to give me seven separateutxos or pieces of bitcoin uh for a feeof five thousand sats total uh and youraim on set would behow sure are people that it's your coinsthere's a one in five chance um thatsomebody would be sure that certaincoins would be yours so it just kind ofbreaks that link and that certainty thatyes this is for sure this person's coinsso um we're gonna hit previewand this shows the flow of the coinswhere are they going what are they doingso you have one utxo here and it's beingsplit into a whirlpool feebad bank change is going to be leftoversfrom the transaction that aren't largeenough to be mixed and those can buildup over time and then you canmix those once there's enough sittingthereit goes into a premix so it's going toseparate them out into pieces and thenit's going to mix from there and thenthere's the regular on chain fee so alli need to do here and this is allsupplemental informationif you want more in depth go and checkout my whirlpool video on sparrownonetheless uheverything here gets left we're justgoing to hit broadcast premixtransactionall rightand so nowwe're gonna seeuh a little change in the way that ourwallet looks so uh we still havetransactions send and receive all thatstuff along the side but we now we'vegot additional tabs we have depositpremix post mix and bad bank and you cansee there's transaction notificationspopping up herebad bank is where that change thatwasn't large enough to mix goes uhpremix is where they're splitting up allyour coins into set amounts before theyget mixed with others and then post mixis everything that's already beenthrough the whirlpool and anonymizedyour coins or broken the links betweenyou and your coins and so these are allindividual wallets uh sowe can kind of see what's going on hereyou can see this is the deposit walletnowit now has zero sats we sent out 779000 satsand that went to a few different placeslet's go to the premix walletthere we go we now seeincoming transaction for750 000 satsand once this confirms then it willbegin to actuallymix everything all into the whirlpoolthe post mix we don't have anything yetbut we will soon see mixes begin to comein hereand then bad bank this is the change asi said from our mixed transaction sowhat we're going to dois we're going to wait forthis to confirm and for mixes to beginto happenand then we'll be able to set things sothat we're going to be mixing directlyintoour cold cardnow we have some mixes happening we arecurrently in the post mix wallet and weare looking at our utxos here andwe can see that we've had one come inand confirm we've got four or so herethat are unconfirmed but we can specifywhere we then want them to mix to sojust to clarify here you'll get aninitial mix coming in to your postmixwallet and then you can designate whereyou'd like them to mix tonext because they get put through thewhirlpool multiple times they get mixedmultiple times until you move themelsewhere and so what i can do here is ican select one orall of my utxos and i can choose thebutton down below mix2i can choose my mix2 wallet where is itgoing to gonext and so it'll only open the walletsthat are currently open within sparrowso we have our mark iv wallet open herethe reason for that is because it needsto pull addresses to send your mixedcoins toso that wall is open i can choose mymark four and then how many mixes do iwantbefore my coins move to my cold card andso you can set this as a thresholdi'd say you know three to five are arepretty decent just for the example i'lluse two at this point i can then clickrestartwhirlpooland this will give it a quick restartand then it will beginmixingtheseutxos directly intomycold card wallet which we'll start tosee pop up here we'll start to seebalances in coming and we'll have somefreshly mixed coins that are now set tobe held in cold storageso let's quickly recap what we've justdonewe went to robosats and we purchasednon-kyc bitcoin using amazon gift cardswe then sent that bitcoin to sparrowwallet within sparrow wallet we usedthis to connect ourcold card wallet as welland then from our hot wallet we mixedour coins to break the links between thecoins that we received and the coinsthat we are using moving forward so thatanybody that happened to sell us bitcoinvia robosats wouldn't be able to trackus from there on inwe then specified within sparrow walletthat we would like to after x number ofmixessend those coins directly to our coldcard wallet which is open and whichwe're able to generate addresses for sothat we can store those non-kyc coinsfor an extended period of time in ourcold storageonce again if you need additionalmaterials to help support your knowledgebase in
