television audienceto propose a controversial solution tothe greatest environmental threat to thesurvival of the planet as we know ittodayhis topic was how to Haltdesertification and reverse climatechangehe was given a standing ovationhis name is Alan savoryhe'd waited a long time for this momenthow are you my girl a Zimbabwean bybirth Wildlife ecologist andinternational consultant Alan Savory isa passionately committed conservationistdriven by an unshakable belief in anideaan idea so radical it has provokedextraordinary hostility in some quartersyet he stubbornly persists in beingheard citing compelling evidence to gethis message across so what people needto understand is some very basic factsfor example we need about half a tonneof food per human every year to forhealthy maintenance of Life Etc but whatwe're doing today is we're producingmore than 75 billion tons of erodingsoil because of Agriculture and that isequal to more than 10 tons of erodingsoil for every human alive todayclearly we're going out of businessSavory is adamant that if we are tosurvive ideas have to changeforemost of which is the long-heldbelief that land degradation is causedby livestockrather it is the way humans managelivestock he arguesput simply it is not too many animals onthe land that are to blame but too fewthat are causing the destructionthank youwell this is typical of what wetragically have here just miles ofcountry like this people on permanentfood Aid and every year is a drought itdoesn't matter what rain we get I'vebeen watching this for years and it'sjust like this it's now virtually desertcountryyou see thisthis is a typical River in the area bonedry almost throughout the occasionallyit'll flash flood after a storm andthat's it and I'm afraid that's typicalheretypical now of a few cattle wanderingpast and we're 10 past 12 in the daythey're not out grazing they're justwandering around the land they're notwith any herder and this is what'sdestroying the land just too few animalswandering aroundbut the problem is not limited to AfricaSavory says two-thirds of the world'sland is in fact desertifyingso what is desertificationdesertification is just a fancy word forland drying up and turning to Desertultimately and there's a good spot toillustrate it it happens because of ourpractices that make the rainfall that wereceive less effective and you see ithere where soil is exposed any rainsoaking into the soil will justevaporate out of it again because thisis hot it's hot even to touch now andwhen high rainfall Falls it runs off andyou can actually see the runoff and thelayer of litter that has swept off thatas water runs and this saying thatpeople have that droughts cause the bareground is nonsense it's the backgroundthat causes the the droughts it's theother way around what we're needing todo worldwide and particularly where thecountry is desertifying is to make theavailable rainfall more effective nowthis is not taught in any University ofthe world and it's well Illustrated inthis picture this was taken while 25millimeters or an inch of rain wasfalling in the Tehama desert and you cansee the water running now in terms ofdrums of water that was equal to 1 250Drums of water on every hectare of landbut the next day that land wascompletely dry and that is thedesertification process[Music]thank youin Zimbabwe it's the tail end of a poorrainy season on this Ranch 30 kilometerssouth of the Victoria Falls calleddimbangombi it's been savory's home formany yearsand while he's seen enough bad wetSeasons to have learned to accept natureon its own terms he no longer believeshe's a helpless victim to vagaries inthe weatherso the really the aim of what we'redoing is trying to make the availablerainfall more effective we're out in therain right now and you can see it wherethe soil is bare this water is flowingand its depositing silt or carrying siltdepositing it down there where thegrassland is where we've got grassplants growing in some litter there'sabsolutely no water flowing this is alljust soaking in and that's what we'vegot to get and then that water shouldonly leave the soil through growingplants or underground flow in the waterto aquifers and in the soil to aquifersand the riverhow he solved the problem or providingthat necessary ground cover we shall seelater in the programfor now he has a problem with thegrasses grown in this Paddockhe doesn't have enough cattle to grazeit and if it is not grazed in the nextfew months the grass must Decaybiologically before the new growingseasonbecause if it doesn't this grassland andits soil will begin to diehere's a good spot to show you why wehave to get more animals and aredesperate to get the money and buy thecattle that we need because here youhave grass that we did not graze lastyear and it just kills itself it'schanged to oxidation you see thedifferent color that is gradual chemicalbreakdown not rapid biological breakdownand the plants just kill themselvesthe traditional response has been to usefirehowever that creates an arguably evengreater problemburning one hectare of grassland givesoff more and more damaging pollutantsthan six thousand carsand we are burning in Africa everysingle yearmore than one billion hectares ofgrasslands and almost nobody is talkingabout itwhat are we going to dothere is only one option I repeat to youonly one option left to climatologistsand scientists and that is to do theunthinkableand to use livestockbunched and moving as a proxy for formerherds and predators and mimic natureSavory calls it holistic management andplanned grazingand it works like thiscattle sheep and goats are masked intolarge herds and because they dung andurinate over their own food source theanimals have to keep moving whichprevents over grazingmore importantly however the impact oftheir Hooves breaks up hard groundallowing air and water to penetrate thesoilthe trampling of old grass providescover from the drying effects of the sunand the wind and the Animals dung andurine enrich the soilbecause they cattle are the main toolusing their Hooves Etc to grow the grassthey graze everywhere on the ranch so asyou look up on these Rocky Hills you'llsee all of that as fresh Cross of theseason and that's because the cattle aregrazed right over the hills andeverywhere there's no area where wedon't use the cattle at some time in theyearbut Savory emphasizes without acarefully structured grazing programholistic management simply will not workthe whole secret of the success hereisn't just using the animals as a toolpeople think that all you have to do isto Bunch the animals and move them butpeople have done that for thousands ofyears and created the deserts thatdoesn't work the secret to this is aplanning process whereby we divide theland up into divisions then the peopledoing the planning follow a set of stepswhere they focus on one at a time andthey bring the information onto a chartand it has to be put on a chart and theyplot them months that they're planningacross the top of the chart they put thepaddocks down here then in another stepthey put the ratings and they fill inyeah all the wildlifecarving periods other factors that haveto be born in mind on the land and whenthe chart is all prepared finally theyplot the movements of the animals andit's plotted where they'll gohere is the main management herd uh forof cattle about 500 plus there are sheepand goats as well and they're Grazing Inthis block of land following the planand right now the herders are movingthem down towards water and they'lldrink itat this midday period lay up for acouple of hours and then the herderswill move them out again and continuethe Grazing In this block that's that'splanned to be raised at the momentokay I love this because the guttle herdhas done everything we want they'veflattened grassed laid litter scallopedthe soil so the water carbon everythingis getting into the soil now this willrebound immediately we've used nothingbut solar energy and we can do this dayafter day after day on different partsof the land creating the wildlifehabitat we need and healing the landthe herd will have covered a lot ofground by Nightfall which begs theobvious question where will it spend thenightdriving 500 cattle sheep and goats topermanent crawls cited at distant pointsaround the 3000 hectare Ranch everyevening is not a viable option anddefeats the basic principle of plannedgrazingSavory solution is to have the herdersDrive the animals into temporaryenclosures called Predator friendlycrawlsdeveloped on dimbangombe they are madefrom plastic sheeting which forms aprotective fence that lions and hyenaswill not challengethese crawls move with the herdwhile the primary purpose of the crawlis to provide secure overnight shelterfor the herd concentrating a largenumber of hooed animals in such aconfined space for a week provides agraphic demonstration of their impact onopen grassland[Music]bonuswhen the herd moves on this site becomesfar more productive than surroundinglandwe've had 500 odd cattle in here for aweek if this is the overnight crawland you can see that that's heavilydunged and trampled and this is wherethe chicken coop was there's a mobileChicken Coop that moves with the cattlewhen the scroll moves and from that youcan see what this soil was like beforewe put that in and that will comethrough to very good grass whereas thiswill remain badthe higher the impact from the cattlethe mole of the donging the tramplingthe more grass tends to grow as long asyou don't repeat it too long as long asit's a short timevisitors to dim bengombi Come Awayconvinced that here is a simple andeconomically viable means of improvingthe livelihoods of rural communitiesthroughout Africa particularly thosereliant on food Aid programswhat I want to show you here is this iswhere we bring the overnight crawl butwe're bringing it more frequently tothis side because we wanted as a cropfield and let me show you this is on aKalahari sand we could selected a verypoor soil area but you can see it'stotally covered with manure and litterand if I dig through thisto try to get to the soilokay now I'm getting to soil and you cansee how dark and and Rich that isall right let me show you the contrastwith this soil now and what it was likenow you guys are going to be amazed atthe comparison here now that's the soilI picked up in there the same soil yousee how totally different they are andthis is just a sand let me feel it youcan smell itsmell the total difference that we'regrowing really good crops in now butit's the same poor soil and we're doingthat entirely by just using theovernight predator-friendly crawlnow we've come into the area that wetreated last year so this is where youhad the cattle last year yes as you cansee you can see the nice stalks Etclaying around from the very good yieldof crop we got so what will the cropyields be out of an area like this whenwe look at the average crop fields inthe community with the traditionalagriculture at the moment over herewe're averaging or at least five toeight times the yield on these fieldsnow this is the field we looked atbefore the rains and now it's got thecrop in it unfortunately the crop issmall because of two things first we gothalf the rainfall we should have had bynow and second baboons got into thefield one day and wrecked everything sowe had to replant after Christmas butthe crops despite that is lookingremarkably good to mebut we're happy with it despite theproblemswhen say report dimbangombi in the 1970sthe ranch was in a bad stateits grasslands virtually destroyed andits landscape ravaged by continual feltfiresit's an entirely different story todayokay now when I bought this Ranch thefellow who I bought it from had kept hiscattle down in this Flair every day ofthe year and this was sobare that you could see a guinea fowl at100 yards almost any time in the earthand now I can't see anything a yard fromme it's so well grown up nowhere was conclusive proof that usedproperly holistic management couldrestore degraded grasslands anywhere inthe worldthis was the Vindication of the years ofmeticulous research Savory had carriedouthe was aware however that like any ideato be truly effective it needed to beput into Universal practiceand this meant worldwidehe began by targeting Africa so this isthe size of Africa which people have noidea of even living in Africa in 1992Savory and his wife Jody Butterfield setup the Africa Center for holisticmanagement as a learning site for peoplefrom all over the continentlocated on dim bengombi the center istasked with empowering rural communitiesto manage their lives and naturalresources effectively by makingdecisions that are economically andenvironmentally sound with the emphasison acquiring the Knowledge and Skills torestore water catchments and River flowincrease forage livestock and Wildlifeproductionraise crop yields through concentratedanimal impactrestore damaged or degraded landand employ low-stress animal handlingachm singled out the nearby huangiercommunal lands as the springboard forits plans to spread the holisticmanagement message throughout Zimbabweand the southern Africa regionhere I'm director of our our program fordeveloping holistic Management incommunities bringing holistic managementto communities so that means I've beenin charge of developing trainingmaterials a training program hiring thestaffand making it happen this programstarted about four years agoand we've got a large Award of almostfive 5.8 millionand we've managed to do it in about fiveyears to really start to where we'reseeing success in communitieswe have been working with communities inthe pastwhere communities were struggling tounderstandwhat decision making using holisticmanagement is all about what you get isyou get a few people in the communitywanting to do itbuttheholistic management concept will requirethe whole Community if it is to worksmoothlywhen we are doing their training we alsomake use of the mobilization tool whichwe call Community Action Cycle and thisis a very powerful tool in bringingcommunities together and we have seen alot of changes in communities in termsof our communities being able to beself-reliant and also in terms ofbringing back their dignity the majorchallenges that we good atugly based mythical I would like to saywhere people dread to mix theirlivestock together because of differentcultural medicines that they believeeach home has and some historicalconflicts that each family or each ClanHas in each Community but we are seeinga lot of improvement and this communityis one of themand my cattle are looking very veryhealthy and fattragedy of all this is that it doesn'thave to be like it is if we could havebegun doing what we're doing for thecommunities now40 years ago we would be a long wayahead of it nowmuch of holistic Management's growingAcceptance in these rural communities isdue to Alan savory's total personalcommitment despite a hectic promotionalschedule it takes him abroad for manymonths of the year he'll try to findtime to drive 50 kilometers to visit alocal community where belief in hismessage is having a profound impact onthe lives of thousands of familiesyeah things are moving on very well goodexactly and the community is very verycommitted to the program okay yeahinnocent monkey should knowas a livestock management specialistemployed by the center to advise thevillagers he's hugely encouraged by thiscommunity's decision to abandon theirtraditional goit alone herding practicesfor the collective holistic managementalternativewell in a sense I see the cattle arelooking better than they were the oneswe saw on the road yeah that's very truethere is a very big difference withKettle which are not in the programhaving demonstrated very clearly on thebranch back at our headquarters what canbe done we're now extending that intothis Greater Community of about 150 000people but starting with some of thesmaller communities and this is one ofthe starting programs where havingprovided water for the cattle it is alsoproviding water for the gardensinnocent here is the Man In Charge whois coaching and training the peoplefirst of all we constructed Elizabethtank and before after that yeah it usedto be a kettle a kettle crawl then afterthat we'll put a garden then the gardenis enabling people to have to improvetheir nutrition as well as their incomethe selling vegetables yes they aresellingPhilip what can you tell me from yourplan now is happening now we we are weare on the on part of number five on thekeguand then from where do they go which isthe plan show they're what did they planthen from Paddock five we'll be going toPaddock six so part of six down hereyeah this part of six and then fromthere then from part of six then we'llbe going to Paddock seven but that isseven this is the area where we'll bethis is where the cattle have beencrawled for about a week or so and upuntil yesterday on this portion of thefield and now they will plant crops allover the field but get three to fivetimes the yield on these areas where weput the crawls overnight the communityis very very excited even personally asthe field officer I'm very very excitedbecause there is a very high adoption ofthe method by the community really thisis this really this is bringing a verybig change with the community when thisprogram intro was introduced in thecommunitythen it was something new to us becausewe could not even understand it to startwith but after exercising what you weretaught to do grazing together weexperienced that there was a very bigchangethe way how they look there's a very bigchange than previous they taught useverythingnow we don't have any cow dyingbecause they taught us how we should dokeep themand I'm sureat the moment when these five cables I'mhaving nowthey will increase and I'll have moneyto buy morewhich is something very good theholistic management what they did wehave quietly learned a lot we are doingeverything on our own[Music]umforeignwe used to struggle with water but nowwe have a water tank that supplies allthe water we need for our livestock andgardening projectokayokay so about two to three years agothese women here could not feed theirfamilies for the whole year they coulddo only do it for three to four monthsin a year but now we have food all yearroundthe present government of Zimbabwe hasseen the results of what we're doing uphere and become very supportive they'veformed a permanent Committee of heads ofMinistries to try and spread theknowledge around the country and what weare going to be doing shortly isrecommending that in all schools webegin with the kids very young andgiving them the basic environmentalliteracy and understanding of whylivestock too few livestock destroy thepeople's lives water Etc and how we canRectify all of this by running many moreanimals but properly managed[Music]herethis crop field here is Regina's fieldwhich she treated using animal impactand if you can just take this a look atthis ones today is the 6th of March thiswas planted on the 14th of January andlook at the crop right on the other sidewhich is much older but still looks veryunhealthyand this is the same lady who fed all ofus todayin 2010 the Africa Center for holisticmanagement won the Buckminster Fullerchallenge for its work in reversingdesertificationin that same year Alan and Jody withother partners pounded the SavoryInstitute in Boulder Colorado to promotelarge-scale restoration of the world'sgrasslandstoday holistic management is practicedby tens of thousands of people incountries across the globeit's reliably estimated that up to 16million hectares or 40 million acres areunder holistic management worldwide withthe largest impact on the ranges andgrasslands of the seasonal rainfallenvironments at about two-thirds of theworld's land surfaceforeignendorsement of the seeds of an idea thatgrew out of the African bush half acentury ago and still has its rootstherewhat we're doing here is a small part ofour Global operations the SavoryInstitute is headquartered in BoulderColorado and they run the global effortfrom there and then part of our strategyto get this to go to scale worldwidebecause of the seriousness of climatechange desertification is to havelocally LED locally managed learninghubs around the world and this was thefirst of the hubs on which we'remodeling others from 10 differentcountries Mexico chile Argentina turkeythe UK IrelandUnited StatesEtc so there are many countries gettinginvolvedthe last time I counted we trainedpeople from 21 countries I think justhereMatt rails and Katrina Fowler areAmericans from Maryland where theygrass-finish beef cattle we're here tosee firsthand the reversal ofdesertification in actionI can't believe it's taken us this longto get hereit succeeded my expectations Beyondimaginationthe grass is even thicker and morediverse than I was ever expectingand at this Hub we can accommodate 30 ormore people and we have continuoustrainings going on big bodies smallparties coming here and we have trainingmaterials the textbook I wrote thehandbook that Jody Butterfield wrote andmany other training materials andincreasingly because of the scale of theproblem globally we're going intointernet training self-help more andmore things and we are aiming toestablish a hundred learning hubs aroundthe world where people are learningteaching each other in their ownlanguage own cultureself-led virtually managed locallyformed locally and so it's a strategicmove we're taking on a global scale nowI'm going to take what I've learned fromhere back to the United States and dothe best I can to get as many animalsmanaged holistically under plan grazingas we can and try to scale wellthis kind of managementas great as we canSally nickel is a South African businessowner from Johannesburgtwo months ago I had no interest inclimate changeand I discovered managing holisticallyand it has completely changed my lifeit's completely changed the way I thinkabout the environment and about what ispossible and about how we are connectedto the land andyesterday I met a woman who had used herlivestock and her neighbor's livestockshe put 15 animals together and impactedher crop fieldshe then got borrowed seed from herneighbors and she has grown with withoutfertilizer the most healthy crop of cornor Millies that I saw in that entirearea I'd never seen anything like itso this is one of the most remarkablewomen in this community she lost herhusband in 2011 left her with eight kidsnow she lost one last year she is sevento take care of is the program hashelped it feed her family it is healthytake care of her cattle it has helpedthey even have enough food for the wholeyearday's end find Savory relaxing back homewith Jody his wife for 32 years who hasplayed an active role in the developmentof holistic managementI was born just south of here and belowand grew up in the countrymy home was a 45 000 acre Raj about 25miles down that way and my kids werebrought up theremy father I buried his remains in theriver and my sister and my eldest sonhere are buried here and my youngest sonso it's very much just home to meand this is the way I like to live hereamongst the game I don't actually likeliving in a house at allwe have another home in New Mexicowhen we're out and lived there and wetend to jokingly say that's Jody's homeand this is mineI love it no I do love it and all mylife I've been a person who likes tolive out of doors I grew up HuntingFishing doing all those things with mydad and and I've just loved this it justumit's Heaven all the dramas seem tohappen when I'm away yeah that's whenthe elephants will be over there and orcoming in at night or wild dogs willchase a bush buck and kill it rightoutside my window and I'm always herealone when that happens one day walkingout of the kitchen Three Lions chased akudu right there in front of the riverit's just this incredible drama I get tosee every daywell those seems we're remote living ina bush camp like this for six months ofthe year as we do thanks to technologywe can keep in touch everything here isjust solar powered operates allbatteries down here but we've got asatellite connection and get someBroadband right now Jody is on a Skypecall to Daniela Howell our CEO inBoulder Colorado and so routinely we'reholding conferences with people aroundthe world I I have to set up onetomorrow morning to speak to people inSwitzerland before I go to London at theweekendbut although it's not all that efficientalways but it Matt we manageforeignof a new day and it's raining againbut it's only a passing shower not heavyenough to raise the level in the riverin front of savory's camphowever something will have happened tothis water on its Journey Downstreamwe've now come up higher in thecatchment of the river that flows pastmy camp now you can see the water in thepool is Muddy you cannot see a half aninch under the water and that's flowingdown here as you look here you can seehow much soil has been washed away fromthis perennial grass and it's cuttingnow by the time this gets to our campnow we are seeing clear crystal clearwater and this is very high rains uphereohwhat's amazing to me here is becausewe've made the rainfall more effectivesoaking into the soil less surface flowso that the soil really absorbs the rainis that this remained clear after we'dhad 50 millimeters or two inches of raintwo days ago only a kilometer above thisnow how do we come here a few years agothat simply would not have been possiblethis would have flowed far more stronglymuddy water and then settled over thenext day or two this time it remainedclear right throughout and hardly Roseat allnow we've joined a river of about thesame size coming off the neighboringland national parks hunting land and youcan see where the flood water hasreached this year and the vehicle infact would be underwater where we areand we are 50 meters from the river andall of these millions and millions ofgallons of water that Rush down hereshould have soaked into the land to keepRivers flowing aquifers Etc it won'tthat River will go dry this yearthis pool on the Diane gombi River hasnever gone dry though it is the driestit has been in 15 yearsit won't rain for another three monthsand as this is the only surface water inthe area Savory is preserving it for thehundreds of elephants in Buffalo thatwater here and making other arrangementsfor the domestic livestockwhile dimban gombi was primarilyconcerned with regenerating the land andWildlifeSavory found that this could not beachieved without using cattle as themain tool of Wildlife and landregenerationtoday this 3000 hectare property is alsohome to a large population of wildlifefully integrated with the livestockthrough the grazing planningwhat I want you to see now iswhere we're preserving bare ground forthe Wildlife otherwise we'll begin tolose some of the wildlife and here yousee itwildlife and this whole project are acritical part of it not just because ofmy passion but because it takes funds torun this sort of operation and we'vebeen completely unable to get anysupport or financial support fromenvironmentalists or environmentalorganizations and the bulk of thefunding that supports us and has doneall this work has come from the huntingso we are safari hunting at the sametime and that literally has been whathas supported most of this workthis is a hide or blind that weconstructed for people to sit in andwatch the game coming to the bare areaand take pictures and so on and we hadan amusing incident where we had someguests in here and when we came backthere were three lines sitting on thetop and very terrified guests in herewhich we thought was very amusing butthey didn'tthere's one large animal however thatvisitors do like to meetokayher name is and we found her as anorphan she's about 15 years old now andshe's very very gentle very sweetwe have people with her all day andwe're close to her at night because shestill exercised with the alarms couldkill her[Music]this must be one of the last unspoiledplaces on planet EarthMilner pool's National Park in theZambezi Valley is so special it's beendeclared a world heritage siteThe Surreal light filtering Through theTrees of the forest creates adistinctive cathedral-like atmospherefor which the park is renownedone of the most prolific of those treesthe fade herbia albeda is in danger ofdying outnobody knows why yet they are growing inAlan savory's maze Garden for all mylife almost they have not beenregenerating at all and people say it'sbecause we've built dams and we're notgetting the flooding well here we arefar from alluvial soils we're on aKalahari soil and this is a federbiaAlberta that has established with thecattle grazing that we're doing and it'snow freely growing showing that it wasnothing to do with flooding or any ofthe things we were saying and again Ithink it's the buildup of the soilstructure that is affecting thisis so convinced that managingholistically applies to all environmentsthat he's embarked on a project to tosee whether he can save the Teak treesin a nearby National Forestso this site that I'm photographing forour record now is we're at the firstsite that we've put the cattle crawlovernight where we hold them on the sandon the Kalahari sand much like we'vedone all over the ranch but this beingthe first on the sand to see whathappens because these Kalahari sandforests are in bad trouble without theTeak trees regenerating and we want tosee if by using the animals we can getthe Teak trees regenerating as we aregetting with some other speciesmany years ago this superficially wouldhave looked um good on the hills in thegrowing season but down in the valleythere was Heavy over grazing a lot ofbare ground and now you can only seebear patches right at the water pointswe've provided for wildlife and we'regetting Buffalo and Sable and elephantsand everything coming here and you cansit from this point and see themevery bit of this has been made possibleby the cattle used as a toolSavory could well argue he's provedconclusively that holistic managementworksyet 50 years after he first expoundedhis theory it is still being dismissedout of hand by established thinkingwhat is very disappointing is althoughthis textbook has been out for over 20years we're writing the Third Editionnow there's a Spanish Edition and it wassent out like all textbooks are forreview to all sorts of organizations andenvironmental organizations universitiesEtc wouldn't even review it and yet thetextbook is in use in more than 20universities and colleges when I lastcounted upI kept going despite all the abuse andridicule rejection and people uhclaiming it doesn't work and it justcomes down to one word I believe andthat is caring if you care enough aboutyour country Wildlife the peopleyou'll do whatever you have to do tokeep going I realize it's not personalit's happened to every single scientistwithout exception that I'm aware of inthe history of the world that oppositionthe research shows does not ever diedown based on facts evidence anything ofthat nature it only dies down andinstitutions change when theviews of society overall begin to acceptit in other words when public opinionchanges and that's why 20 minutes oftalk on the Ted Talk has literally donemore to advance this knowledge inworldwide than 50 years of strugglingagainst an official opposition has doneand that's because the Ted Talk went hasalready gone to well over two millionviewers and it's still going up bythousands a daythank youit's been very rewarding we have a longway to go but at least we can say it canhappen in in a very challengingenvironment politically economically andif it can work here it could work anywayI would say to any detractor of holisticmanagement first and foremost come andsee this here at the Africa center withyour own eyes come and see the reversalof desertification and the recreation ofsurface water the second thing I wouldsay is understand what you're detractinglook into what managing holistically andholistically planning grazing has doneall over the worldis what I've worked over the past 30yearsLatin America Africa many countriesthis is the program that I think is themost sustainable of all of them becauseit really touches to the core ofpeople's people's livelihoods people'ssocial existenceit brings together so many of thosepieces that many other programs don'tit's common knowledge today thatbiodiversity lost climate change loss ofsoil poverty violence Rising all thesethings are threatening civilization aswe know it now while it might have beenargued 30 years ago today I don'tbelieve any scientist would argue thatmanagement needs to be holisticembracing all science all sorts ofknowledge and but if we're to have ahope it has to be done now",
