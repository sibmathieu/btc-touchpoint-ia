wilhelmer stefonson probably isthat his name wrong my apologiesis the Arctic explorer who in the 1950swell he and a team went to the ArcticCircle and lived a carnivore life and hetried to in the 1950s on Americantelevision bring the carnivore diet tothe peoplehe was not terribly successful at thatunfortunately because that was the sametime that we started getting thecholesterol badge saturated fatsaturated fat bad carbs good sugar goodpropaganda coming from on high buthe tried and you may have heardreference or seen reference to thisinterview in the past but this is thefull interview and he only speaks for afew minutes about the about what we callthe carnivore diet now and I'll have atime stamp on the screen here to whereyou'll find thatbutthis the whole interview is fascinatingbecause he really gets into thelifestyle of the indigenous peoples upthere he gets into the exploreconditions and it's an interestinghistorical analysis in general thatreally does put you know this way ofeating we have into a fuller context ofactive Lifestyles and things my favoritecritique of the carnivore diet that justis so silly to me is you will never seeworld-class athletes doing carnivorethey need you need carbs for musclebuilding which we know is nonsensethat's absolute nonsense I've packed onmuscle mass at the gym on this carnivoredietbut here's a real world example ofsomeone doing something a little bitmore hardcore than you know hitting youknow set to 10 on a bench press sowithout further Ado this classicinterview that if you haven't seen thisyou need togood evening Dr Stephensonum will you tell me the correct way topronounce your namethe accents on the first Cinemawilhelmerwell this is as close as I'm going tocome to Williamum you were born wilhelmer stefanson andyou were born in Canadawell I may have been baptized WilliamStevenson uh people who are busy thanamericanizing or anglicizing their namesand my parents were told that anIcelandic name would be difficult topronounce and they were advised to callthemselves Stevenson and I was probablybaptized William Stevenson so that if Ihave difficulty with the name I couldsay Bill Stevens yes met some of myoldest friends say that they do stilland your connection now with Canadabegan with birth and then you moved tothe United States when you were quiteyoung returned laterum I lived in the United States from1881.until I began my polar work in 1906. andthe polar work lasted for how long sirhave spent in the Arctic or north of theArctic Circle about 10 Winters and 13Summersand you've had quite an extensivecontact with Canada over the years inaddition to that oh yes I almost belongto the Canadian clubs any school or citythat I lived in have always been a kindof bi-national I see United States andCanada and uh didn't you recently havestill another contact with the head ofour governmentoh yes yes uh a great Triumph for thecollege that I'm connected withDartmouth College thatum uh our new prime minister CanadianPrime Minister made his first officialvisit to uh Missing he was graciousenough to ask my wife and me to meet himand you had some time with Mr DickenBaker about 40 minutes they drew weexpected about 10 and so we made about30 minute profit and did you talk aboutthe Arctiche we reminisced uh actually uh he saidhe remembered uh seeing me on theplatform in 1913.and that he had apparently kept a goodieleft track of what we've been doing upnorth I seeum you uh he'd heard you speak thenabout your Explorations yes in 1913 waswhen I was organizing my thirdExpedition so he must have heardsomething about that and when was thedate of that uh well of the threeExpeditions there my first explanationis 1906 1907 a year and a half thesecond exhibition was 19 8 to 12 fouryears and a half consecutively and thethird one was 1913 to 18. five and ahalf yearsfive and a half years without a breakyes and that's wrong without breaks Isee and then this this was the end ofyour polar exploring and yes during theWar I did some uh advisory work for theUnited States Air Forces this is WorldWar II World War II and then have beenthe guest my wife and I were guests ofthe Canadian government I mean theDanish government up in Greenland oh soyou have made a couple of reasons returnvisitors but she's been doing bettertonight she flew the North Pole theother day did she which I never did ofcourse did you ever get there sir no Inever triednow why was that well if Perry had foundit long before meand uh have often been asked that and Icoined uh answer that I'm a scientistand not a tourist I seeum you say thatyou finished your polar exploringformally as it were in 1918 1918 yes nowwhy did you never go back doctor well Iam it seemed to me that I had I wantedto try to dispel from the uh world thesame misconceptions which I had of theArctic when I went North and I used tothink that I was well informed on theArctic before I went Northand but I concluded eventually that outof 10 things that I believed about theArctic before I went North about sixwere wrong I was about 60 percent eitherpartly or wholly wrong and during myfirst year in the Arctic I kept acareful diary and I'm now indisagreement with over half of what Iwrote in my own diary is that thingsthat I thought I'd seen and the meaningsthat I deduced so the preconceptionsaffect everyone then well if it mayaffect you how long then does it takehow much experience does one have tohave before you can see things as theyare and they are when it comes graduallyyour eyes are gradually and you seeeverything through the coloredspectacles of your education you'rebringing up and the color of thosespectacles that Fades only gradually Ithink the very last year I was there Iwas still being undefeated you're silverif I had stayed longer I could haveunlearned still more well you're you'retalking to someone now who is repletewith all the standard prejudices howlong would it take me or anyone like meto begin at least to get a reasonablegrasp of of the earth well I shouldthink that you shouldn't publishanything until you've been there morethan one yearThe Impressions you'll get during yourfirst year in their Tech are in myexperiencethey were more often wrong than rightwell this means then that you've tiltedat a good many standardized windmills inthe course of your life yesmy books are full of that and this Itake it too has involved you in a gooddeal of controversyand yesum especially as to the nature of theCanadian noiseat the end of my three Expeditions I wasinvited by the um rotary clubs of Canadaand the Canadian clubs jointly to makeher cross-continent tour and that mytheme was that Canada is nowcolonized or settled Fringe on theNorthern Frontier of the United Statesbut I thought that it Canada'spotentially as deep from south to Northas is wide from east to west and thatCanada would never be I really firstclass Nation until Canadians took thatpoint of view and tried to make use oftheir entire territories and that led meinto a lot of arguments I'm sure itwould how far north is Canada habitableas far north as there is any Canadaright up right up to the north tip ofElsmere Island and ellsmere island isthat's the most Northerly CanadianIsland there's just an uh Greenland isthe only land that's more Northerly andthere's not very much differenceactually that's the difference and thatGreenland was inhabited by Eskimos uhabout the time of Columbus I think thatthere are good many Eskimos in the northtip of Greenland and at that time Ibelieve Northern Ellesmere Islandersalso inhabitedso that there there has been habitationright up and there are some islandswhere no habitation has yet beendiscovered but I think that probablyEskimos were in all the Canadian Islandsformerly at one time or at one timeand is this equally possible then forCanadians North Americans oh yeahnecessary ordinary human beings[Music]uh the uh the adaptation that you needfor enjoying the north is mostly in yourfield there Professor Williams in thefield of psychologyif you're distinguish between physiologyand psychology then the uh physiologicaladaptation which is possible isnegligiblebut there's great room for our mentaladaptation this is dispelling thestereotypes yes um so what you need is asociological and psychological changeand you need inventions you need goodclothing uh especially good clothing andgood housing and fortunately Eskimosinvented the best clothing that man hasever had in the north is Eskimo clothingand the best houses that man has everhad are asking the houses for the Northso that to what we need to do is tolearn from them but we have a weaknessof not learning from the natives butrather teaching them that's one of ourgreat uh weaknesses now this this putsme in mind of one of your verywell-known books the the friendly Arcticfriendly to whom it's friendly to anyonethat's adapted to it so summers are veryfriendly to mosquitoes the ocean is veryfriendly to seals and there's verify topolar bears and it's friendly to a goodHunter a man who willput as much effort into becoming a goodHunter as you need to become a goodsurgeon anybody who'll do that and willthen learn from the eskimos I mean go tothe eskimos with the attitude of alearneranybody who has good eyesight andaverage common sense it can be ascompetent and as comfortable as anyEskimo isn't it the case though DrStephenson that even granted that oneone would have to be a superb Marksmanno you you should be a good Marksman youshould have patience and you shouldlearn the ways of the animals the wayyou learn the ways of the eskimos yesyeah I have I'm not the Sharpshooter atleast I would never win thatchampionshipbut I have been able to secure a hundredpounds saliva weight of food for everycartridge firing during my second andthird expeditionswe averaged more than 100 pounds of foodfor every bullet we're firing and Ican't just weighed 33 to the pound yeahI figure that six pounds of ammunitionwould feed their three men and six dogsfor two yearssecond round six pounds of ammunitionwell now what about 200 cartridges butwhat about all the other supplies youhave to bring with you well you bringrifles and then cameras and pencils andwriting paperand field glasses field glasses are veryuh important and apart from that youdon't need anythinga healthy body and a cheerfuldispositionand it's not difficult to be a cheerfulwhen you once learn how to live up therewell now this raises the whole questionof uh of food thenum surely surely there's there's some uhyou yourself must have longed for agreen vegetable once in a while and thenat first I am my first experience wasthat a ship that was supposed to meet medidn't meet me and I had to become aguest of the eskimos and for four and ahalf months I lived on literally nothingbut fish and water well we had some uhblubber some polar bear lover but apartfrom that and at the end of four and ahalf months I was hooking and I'd neverbeen beforeI'm enjoying every meal and feeling fineand this is on an exclusive meat dietthat was exclusive face in this case Ihave since then spent more than sixaggregated one or six years on red meatthat is a seal meat Caribou meat muscatsmeat polar bear prison bear and so onyou have to have fat with a lien as leanand fat together and make a perfect dietyou have everything you need if you haveboth lean and fat you don't have to eatin the organs that's a peculiar folkloreoh is that we feed the organs mostly tothe dogsoh this is where your earlier commentabout theuh being able to feed the dogs and theman and so on yeahthe organs rich in vitamins that youhear so much talk about yeah it does getmost of those I see people don't carefor them and don't eatwell now accept an emergency oh yes oneof the things that uh you did was todemonstrate this fact I take it for thefirst time is that so well not for thefirst time out of the eskimosa in factStone Age men I think that before theinvention of agriculture which datesback only about 15 000 years before thatthe whole world lived the way Eskimosdid I approximately take the French caveart and the way the artists show theFrench cavemen living 40 000 years agothat's the way we lived yes big gamebig game Huntersand but you were the the first of thethe polar explorers to and I uh thefirst to do it on land was John Ray Raean employee of the Hudson's Bay Companythere were a certain number of men whomade approaches like Thomas Simpsonabout the first man who becamecompletely independent of all Health whodid his own hunting built his own snowhouses and was his own gun it was JohnRay and so that when I didn't know thatI had to learn the way reading becausearray's work had never been adequatelypublicized at least I didn't know aboutit and the only thing that was reallynew that I'd been was to go out on theoceanand to show that at hundreds of milesaway from land they asked more methodand the ray method worked just as wellas this and land in fact I felt safer onthe ocean and living by hunting than itdid in the land now when you say on theocean you mean on the drifting and thedrifting ice they're drifting out thepolicyandwhat about how does one get from IceFlow to ice wellum ice floors may be any size thebiggest ice flow I ever saw was 27 milesin damage but when you get across anyflow you always come to the far side ofit and then if it's touching like thatthen you just step across but if they'renot touching you wait till they closeand when they do close you'll stepacrossand in this in this fashion you traveledhow longthe longest journey we ever made took 97daysand was about 700 miles of walking 500Miles measured on the map this was thethe Beaufort City and we crossed theBeaufort sea if I can find going northfrom Alaska and then the East to BanksIsland and this would be Banks Islandhere and we um 500 Miles 500 Milesmeasured on the map but but the ice wasdrifting against us we uh we once lostmore than 40 miles when we came to aplace where we couldn't cross and I hadto wait to last closed up again we weredelayed seven or eight days and wedrifted backwards uh more than 40 milesI see and in this time you lived offwell I can't say off the land no off theice block yes about 90 of our food wasfail and 10 was polar bears I see we hadwith us food for about 40 days when weleft Alaska and would travel for 57 daysafter we left afterwards were all gonefrom attend the very lastbetter food this evening he'll wake upto Banks Island was 57 additional daysthen of course Bank silent was itselfuninhabited we had them to begin Caribouoh yes well now how many people besidesyourself at this time believed that thiswas possible well on my Expedition therewere about sevenI called for volunteers and there weremore than seven who were willing to gowith me but there were only about sevenwho thought that we might be right I'dlike to mention that sir Hubert Wilkinswas well known now he was one of theseven whothought that it might be a sound ideadid he accompany you on this no hedidn't now uh we got separated byaccident I don't know what would havehappened if that accident hadn'thappened I mean that's too complicatedto explain but he might have gone withme or might not but we got separatedaccidentally I see and you went with thetwo Norwegians we couldn't have anyEskimos to go with us because Eskimosthought that animal life was confined tothe vicinity of land and when they foundout that we're going far away from theland they refused to go along unless wewould carry supplies oh yeah and wecouldn't afford to carry supplies so youjust went ahead yes these two menstalker starkson and Ole andreasen theywere both Norwegians I see and did yourun into uh some pretty difficult timesthere when you were pretty low on no Imade no I think if you read my book's afriendly Arctic you'll find that wedidn't have any great difficultyuh we were a little bit uh at times alittle bit uncertain and our logicseemed to be faultless but the humanlogic has often failed in the past andyes but we weren't really quite sureuntil it's all over but I would say thatthe occupation of being a polar explorerwho lives by hunting and has no otherfood except what he secures himself isnot more dangerous than being a taxidriver or or a weekend demotrist a LaborDay weekend motorist I think that's moredangerous than being a police beforewellI I'm I'm tempted to say then why aren'tthere as many polar explorers as thereare weekend motorists but well and wehad any a bad bird had a 3 000volunteers I had hundreds and we have wepaid no wages The Men Who volunteered togo with me were willing to go withoutwages is that and I think that anyexplorer who has said a good perspectivesort of to offer and can get uh the bestmen with no wages at allthis raises again then the question ofuh of the population populating theCanadian North well the uh the Russianshave done it so umum why couldn't we do it uh well we goas far north as what well the biggestcity I mean the the city that we lookupon is our biggest I mean the biggestnorthern city is Edmonton we don't thinkof any city north of Edmonton as bigand that I can find that here oh that'severybody knows yeahum and north of Edmonton or farthernorth than Edmontonuh in Alaska Canada and Greenlandcombined we have less than one millionpeoplefarther north and Edmonton and theSoviet Union they have over 100 millionpeopleso this would be from about the sameparallel of latitude here yeahum Moscow is actually about 200 milesfarther north in Edmonton and thewinters in Moscow are colder thanEdmonton Winters and they're a littlebit longerand the Soviet Union has as I said ahundred million people farther north inEdmontonI see and if if they can do it whycouldn't we if we wanted to but thisisn't the uhin the United States and Canada both weare a software looking people ourpopulation centers in Canada are movingin the direction of Vancouver Island andin the United States and the directionof California but in the Soviet Unionthey're moving Northand your feeling is we should be doingthe same thing at least we could if wewanted towell now what kind of people uh shouldor could successfully live in this poolanybody anybody who has the PioneerSpirit the same kind of people thatcolonize the Canadian or the UnitedStates Westpeople who want to who want to befrontiersmennow we've talked a fair amount about uhexploration and so on but the uh thequestion that remains in my mind DrStevenson is the oneumwhy did you undertake these arduous andand lengthy explorationsoriginally from the point of view of ananthropologist I was primarilyinterested in the kind of people thatlived there in their language theirculture their religion and so on yeahand then gradually my interest shiftedinto a geographical channels and Ibecame interested in discovering newlands or by the way might mention thethe islands of considerable size whichwe put on the map arranging themalphabeticallythey are a Borden Islandand Brock Islandand the low heat islandand Mackenzie King Islandand Main Islandand now there's one called StephensonIslandthe government recently named an islandafter me those are the fiveIslands comparable to Puerto Rico insize that we added to the map of Canadauh have you any reason to believe thatthere are still further as yetundiscovered items we are more we'recertain now there aren't any and this isdue to what well then just Lord didn'tput him therethat's up to the Lord he didn't put anymore land up there no I I grant you thatbut how is it that we now are so sure ofthis well we're flown all over the ACToh yeahuh something that occurs to me thereyeah that all my islands are the hourislands are the third Expedition havebeen mapped from the air but there arestill three islands on which human foothas never tried since we were there waymore than 1916.on Brock Islandthe cancer King Island and Borden Islandand so far as I know up till nowno human foot has stood on any of the ofthose three islands but me and Islandand Lloyd Island have been visited nowaside from the the obvious satisfactionto you and and to the the governmentwhen they fitted your Expedition infinding these islands uh but what elseis there about them that's that's ofimportance wellif you have if you have the um if youcan suppose that the Pioneer Spiritwould be revived the same kind of peoplemight build mining centers that builtDenverthe same kind of people that builtWinnipeg and and Calgary and Edmontonthey cities like that could be built andthe food produced and people could livecomfortably all over the Northif they wanted to do so yeah and thegreat difficulty here is that we don'twant to in the Soviet Union apparentlythey want to and so they are movingNorth and that's a very serious thing tocontemplate I don't want to adviseanybody to go north but I think it's aninteresting thing is that there arepeople in the world that are movingNorthwhile we are moving south I seenoI take it that under these conditions ofexplorationumone has to abide pretty carefully by theby the rules you have to know what it isyou're about and learn as you saidearlier and if you don't learn the theprices often High isn't that truetragedy can strike yes it said doenrollments that Romans do that's therule to win the Arctic as the eskimos dodid tragedy ever strike any of yourparties sir yesum a tragedy surrounded particularly theisland called rangam wranglion it's anisland uh about the size of Puerto Ricoand north of Eastern Siberiais here and we had to we had six shipson our third Expedition and one of thoseships was crashed and maybe they canpoint it out excuse me here yes uh oneof our ships the car look was crushednear there in 1914.and the three lives were there were umum11 lives lostfour men who asked permission to orseparate themselves from the Expeditionand were never heard of again thecommander was by the way Captain BobBartlett I wasn't there and I didn'tknow about it for yearsand there were four men who were campedin a tent and were apparently killed themonoxide carbon monoxide is one of thegreat dangers of polar expression therewere three men who died of malnutritionbecause they insisted on living on sheepon ship school when some others lived onon the precious honestly tell me DrStephenson have you any regrets aboutyour your work is there anything that ifyou're headed to do again you would dodifferentlywell I hope I would be a little wiserand hope I'd make fewer mistakesand of course I agree for the loss ofthese men but that's how it is in warthat's how it is in many otheroccupations andum[Music]I have here something that perhaps willbe a surprise for you this is the firstcopy of the Reader's Digest volume onenumber one it has in it an article onwilhelmer steffensen thank you very muchsir good night",
