professor atbrigham young university he specializesin the role that insulin and nutrientmetabolism play in regulating obesitydiabetes and dementiahe has he earned his phd inbioenergetics and was a post-doctoralfellow in metabolic disorders at dukenational universityof singapore and he joins us today for adiscussion on the topic of why we getsick which is also the title of hisbest-selling book which has beentranslated towhat is it now 20 i think languages wellno not quite about halfway there yeahbut some relevant ones yesso thank you for joining us benoh my pleasure safety thanks so much toyou and the team for getting me on it'sit's it's great to be chatting to you ithink uh your perspective on um diseasein your book is is a very interestingand very refreshing one and it's um whati like about it is that it gets to theheart of the matter in a very practicalway in a sense of you know how can youactually not get sickrather than getting lost in academicdebates and academic pissing contestswhich canbe too often the case in academia soit's good to keep your eye on the prizeon what matters and i think this is thisis what your book doesso let's get right to it why do we getsickyeah yeah thanks again i actually likethe way you framed this because we bothyou and i i think uh share a commondisdain foracademia and it's ironic a little maybefor me i don't mean for it to soundungrateful because i am a professorat a university currently andi amso mindful of the nonsense that happensat universities and so it was very muchan interest of mine to takethe knowledge that we scientists aregainingand go break through the barrier ofyou know the traditional model for uswould be that we publish a paper in apeer-reviewed journal and no one everreads it except a handful of otherscientists and it and thus is largelyirrelevant to actually improvingsomeone's life i really wanted tocircumvent that futile cycle of academiaand take relevant information right topeople so the question why do we getsick you know i naturally was looking atthisquestion through my lens and i mytraining is in kind of metabolicbiochemistry and physiologyand i couldn't help butsee there wasone common foundationto virtually every non-communicablechronic disease so the chronic diseasesthat you getwith that have nothing to do with youknow infectionand you know this is like cancers andheart disease alzheimer's diseasediabetes kidney disease etcandof course each of these problems haveunique inputsi want i would want everyone to knowthat that each of these problems do haveunique origins but they all haveone common origin and that is insulinresistance it is this disorder thatpeoplei mean the reason i didn't call my bookwhat is insulin resistance is why doesit matter is because i knew no one wouldbuy it they would look at the title andthey would say well i'm not a diabetic idon't need to read that they just seeinsulin and they think diabetes butinsulin is an absolute life-givinghormone it is essential you have to haveit and which and if you don't likeuntreated type 1 diabetes you will diein short order so this is an essentialhormone that literally impactsevery cell of the bodythere's no exception to this i don't usethe term literally too liberally likethe kids do these days there's it is itliterally affects every cell in the bodyand it dictates the theme of whatinsulin does is it tells the cell whatto do with the energy that it hasso whatever the the nutrient or thecaloric energy isthat's in the system that's coming inthe system or it's already storedinsulin will tell the cell what to dowith it and thus it's pretty essentialevery cell needs energy neverthelessinsulin resistance is a disorder todefine it now explicitly it's really acoin with two sides or a disorder withtwo facets that must come together youcannot have one side of the coin withoutthe other the first part of thisdefinition of what insulin resistance isis that insulin as a hormone isn'tworking as well as it used to thatevokes the kind of resistance part of itthat some cells aren't responding verywell but then the second part of it isvery often overlooked but equallyessential to understand why it's sopathogenic why insulin resistance issuch a problem and that is that insulinlevels are chronically elevateda condition called hyperinsulinemia soyou have the two of these togetherinsulin isn't working correctly andblood insulin levels are elevated andboth of those together constitute thethe background for so many of thesechronic disorders or diseases you knowfor exampleand then i can finish the answer becausei'm getting long-winded but let's takethe two most common forms of infertilityin women the most common form ofinfertility is a disorder calledpolycystic ovary syndrome pcosand this is a disorder of too muchinsulin and that is why if a woman haspcosshe absolutely has insulin resistanceand but not because the insulin isn'tworking well but because it's too highand when insulin levels get too high ina woman it actually inhibits the ovariesability to create normal balances of sexhormones she can't make estrogens aswell as she could before and she failsto ovulate and now she has polycysticovary syndrome but in a manthe most common infertility is erectiledysfunctionand that's a problem of the insulin notworking well not the elevated insulinper se but again you still have both ofthose things always happening togetherbut in his case for normal erectilefunction you have to have a significantvasodilation or the blood vessels haveto dilate and alter blood flowaccordingly but when the blood vesselsbecome resistant to insulin effectsinsulin which normally is providing thatdilation effect can'tinduce dilation as well and the bloodvessels stay constricted and theconstricted blood vessels means erectiledysfunction so that's such a it's aninterestingdichotomy looking at the two forms ofinfertility in women and men where eachof them is caused by a different aspectof insulin resistance yeah and it's justsomething that continues to come up withall kinds of medical conditions isastonishing even as a non-doctori would say probably especially as anon-doctorit just keeps coming upyou know you you hear about a certaincondition or you know somebody who getssick in something because with somethingand you read more about it you hear themtalk about itandthis always comes up you know there'salways thismention of sugar blood blood sugarlevels insulin levels insulin resistanceit's implicated in so many things what ifind fascinating and you know i i'd liketo kind of uh switch back and forthbetween the academic topic itselfand the way that academics study itbecause that's another focus of my workwhich i discussed in the fiat standardof um just how academia isessentially massively compromised and agiantattack on your ability to understand theworld and reason properly it's not justthat they're doing um innocuous nonsensethat nobody cares about it's thatthey're actively preventing people fromunderstanding what the problem isbecauseyou knoweven as a non-specialist you see thisthing come up everywhere and then if youdo one day in your life try and say heylet me just take a look at this let mesee if i can bring my blood sugars downfor a while and see what i can do andsee what effect it has on me and thenall these different kinds of healthproblems that you thought were just thenormal part of growing up disappear andyou're back to being healthy andpowerful and strong in many waysand so you would imagine you know theyyou'd imagine doctors would be out thereshouting this from the rooftops tellingeverybody to hey you know focus on thislittle thing called insulin your bloodsugar try and keep that downif you are overweight if you're diabeticif you have all these um problemsdementiayou likely benefit from this and yetinstead what we see isjust like with economics we see thesenerds that parrot out complicated wordsthat obfuscate thingsand then ultimately lead to youcontinuing to eat the garbage confusedand not knowing what's going on and ithink the really sad thing is you knowhow many people will umin academia i mean if you if you look atdebates online you know you have allthesegreat instagram and twitter uh socialmedia fitness influencers who've beenout there training clients for years andknow what works and know what doesn'twork and know that you know if you'reoverweight and you want to get in shapelay off the junk do this do that andthey know what works and they're outthere arguing with these overweightusually uh university professors who areout there telling them noyou guys are not authorities you don'tunderstand you're focusing on bloodsugar that's been debunked here's someobscure paper from pubmedabout how actually it's not blood sugarthat matters it's all these othergenetic slash they'll say it's saturatedfat yeahyeah or some other thing or the otherbut you know just whatever you do justmake sure you don't try to cut down onyour sugar intake and you don't lower itlower your insulin levels butthe evidence for it i mean everybody whotries it basically i don't know anybodywho's tried reducing their blood sugarlevels and their insulin levelsand reducing the level of informationthat they've done and have and anddidn't feel better from it and yetacademia continues toignore thisyeah yeah so why do you think this isthe caseyeah well i think there's there'scompeting interests without a doubtum and i very much appreciate theaudience that i have here which isif i may define this group in such a wayat least one attribute would be a heartyskepticismand that's one that i share indeed allscientists by their very nature shouldshare that skepticism the job of ascientist is to try to prove a theoryfalse and now we have thisthis this flipping of science into areligion where people are proud to justproclaim i believe in science and as ascientist i think that is a terriblyunscientific way to view scienceif you're a scientist everyone shouldthink like a scientist in a way if i maysay it like that without sounding smugwhich is we should all be trying tounderstand truth by challenging what wethink we know and now it is just wellthis person said something i like and soi believe in science oh but you're ascientist who's saying somethingdifferent well you're going to beostracized and removed from politesociety but you you brought up a lot ofrelevant points that i just have toelaborate on brieflypart of the problem with conventionalkind of biomedical care or clinical careis that we havewe have based an enormous amount of ourview of metabolic health purely on bloodglucoseand i'm not saying blood glucose doesn'tmatterbut the problem with that view thisglucocentric view of metabolic health isthat we have overlooked insulincompletely and i've given talks toclinicians you know physicians andnurses and physician assistants and iwill saywe are too obsessed with glucose we needto look at insulin and it becomes almosta circular discussion where they willsay we don't need to look at insulinbecause we're measuring glucose and it'skind of the same and i have to teachthem that they're not the same that youcan have someone who's coming in everyyear for their annual checkup and theglucose levels are staying normalstaying normal but what's happeningbehind the scenes is insulin is goinghigher and higher and higher in order totry to keep the blood sugar in checkand that is this exact paradigm ofnormal glucose levels but elevatedinsulin several times higher than whatit should be is insulin resistance andthen it's only once the body has becomeso resistant to insulinone ofwhose jobs it is is to help lowerglucose that the glucose levels start toclimb and now it gets on the clinicalradar but but the problem doesn't endthere so the first problem is by failingto look at insulin we failed to detectthe problem as soon as we could detectit but the next problem is just as badwhich is our obsession with loweringglucose the moment the glucose doesstart to climba conventional clinician conventionalthinking scientist and clinician will beto say let's just give you insulin andlike in a person who's insulin resistantthey'll say let's just push the insulinup and yeah that will lower the glucosebut the more we knowthis is amply published review data forwhatever that's worth because we all gotto be skeptical even of published datanowadays but we know that the more youpush insulin up in an insulin resistanttype 2 diabetic in order to control theglucose they may have normal or idealglucose levels and yet we're killingthem they're three times more likely todie from heart disease and twice aslikely to die from alzheimer's diseaseand cancer so we are killing when wegive an insulin resistant type 2diabetic more insulin it's like we'regiving an alcoholic another glass ofwine hoping it will solve the problemwhen in reality we're giving them moreof the very thing that's causing theproblem too much insulin is a primarydriver of insulin resistance so why onearth would we give them more insulin totry to correct the glucose we make surein so doing that the person gets fatterand sicker and they die fasterbutso much of the problem is that theclinicianespecially if these are in the u.s likemedicare patients it just extends ithink the nhs and the uk has the samekind of target canada i know does andsafe i very much appreciated yourcriticism on social media of canadianhealthcare i was born and raised incanada and me and all of my nine myeight siblings all nine of us got out ofcanada as quickly as we couldum because of in part the ridiculoushealth care but nevertheless um wethe the the clinical model is based onthe clinician will have targets withtheir patient and it will say you needto lower their glucose by you know onepercent of hemoglobin a1c or lower theirglucose by 20 points to try to get itinto a normal range and if they don't doit the clinician gets punishedthey do get docked on the amount ofmoney they can bill for that patient'svisits and so the clinician has thisperverse incentive to say well i justneed to push up your insulin any way ican and and if it's making you fatterand sicker and putting you on more drugsat least it's lowered your glucose andthat's one of the clinical markers i'mgoing to get graded on but at the end ofit all underlying all of thisin my kind of concluding thought forthis rant is that while we're givingpeople all these clever expensive drugsto try to lower their glucose levels theone little rational person on the sidei'm one of them and i get ostracized forit i've been criticized and i've beenthreatened with my position here whereyou will just say you're giving thepatient all these drugs to lower theirglucose why not just have them eat lessglucoseand oh no no no you can't you can't saythat you're accused of heresytruly i've been accused of teachingprinciples that are against science eventhough i strictly rely on publishedhuman clinical trials to defend my viewsand yet it's just too heretical are yousuggesting that people can live withoutdoritos and pringles every day i meanwhat kind of insaneinsane insane cruel doctor are you iknow do you have no regard for humanneeds like how could people yeah i knowhow could people not eat twinkies everyday like how can you not make that thecenter of your world view and this thisis this is what it really comes down tobecause i mean you you keep as youexplain i mean it's just insane that youwould want to raise their insulin levelsrather than reduce the sugar levels ithink one metaphor that i've come upwith to try and explain this to peopleis that it's the equivalent of you havea dirty apartment and you're trying toget somebody to clean up your apartmentand you keep hiring people to clean upthe apartmentand you're getting you're somehowignoring the fact that every day um yourson say comes into the apartment andtakes a big giant jug of pepsi and justturns it inspills it in the middle of the room andthen the cleaning person has to spendall their time just cleaning that up andthen everything else in the house fallsapart and gets dirty because every daywe have this giant mass ofsludgy sugaronthe everywhere that needs to be cleanedout and soif you think the answer is hiring morecleaning peopleyou're not going to make it becausethere's no limit to how muchyou can spill on umin a house like it takes one second tospill uh an amount of liquid sludgethat's going to take three hours toclean you know yeah it just goeseverywhere that it requires a lot ofcleaning soit's insane that medicine takes the pathof just hire more cleaning staffanddon't worry about the cause of thethe disintegration and that's yeah yeahyeah the paradigm ought to be let's putlet's um bring less garbage inand see what that doesrather than continuing to bring more andmore garbage in and hiring more and morecleaners to try to keep up for it let'sjust start putting less garbage in theapartment this is this is the amazingthing and this is this is the thing thatnone of the this is it's exactly likewith economics like with with theeconomists there there's just nevergoing to be a mainstream economist whohas a phd at an important university andat the fed or any of that stuff who'sgoing to come out and say you know whatmaybe we should just try hard money weshould try not inflating we should trynot doing all of that stuff no here'show my magic formula for managing themoney supply is actually going to umallow us to magically havegovernment spending at no cost here'show i am going to defy the rules ofphysics anduh nature and allow us to eat our seedcorn and still plant the same seed cointhat we eat this is essentially how itworks in politics and economics and it'skind of what works in nutrition it'sjustthe mentality of indulgence no we can'tsacrifice the sugary treats and we mustfind a way tomanage it it's it's like you know how dohow do wefix laptops that um get destroyed byhammers by their ownersi meanthere's just never going to be asuccessful science of fixing laptopsdestroyed by hammers because the hammerscan always destroy a laptop beyondbeing able to fix it the best method isjust not destroy it yeah yeah no it's ait's absolutely i believe there aresufficient competing interests that thatwe we are able to prop up so manyeconomies or that might not be the wordto use in an audience like this we wereable to prop up so many entities bytelling people to eat whatever you wantand then we have drugs and health carethat will help you deal with theconsequences and it's just a way ofspending more money on things that wecould go back to that first principle ofum eat better well all right but thensome okay but then the drug companiesaren't going to be able to sell as muchdrugs well then the hospitals aren'tgoing to be able to have as many sickpatients and so we have these sick basedeconomies that will sufferwell of course we shouldn't care aboutthat we want to be live long and healthybut there are all these competinginterests that i mean you there was justrecently a report published by thenutrition center at harvard university imean and this deserves all of ourdisdain and again it makes me ashamedof academia and my fellowquote unquote scientists where theyrankedmini wheats cereal higher than eggs andsteakon on the scale of nutritionin other words mini wheats was better bya wide margin they said that frostedmini wheats the cereal is better forsomeone than eggs and better for someonethan steak i i don't know on what planetthat could be stated other than theirsufficient competing interest like takefor example the american dieteticsassociation which you knowpromotes a lot of these things look atwho funds themit is not the american ranchersassociation they wish they could fundthem but the american dieteticsassociation is so opposed to animalbased products much to the detriment ofevery human on the planetbut it's it's justwho's paying the bills i mean it's avery cynical view and and it requiresit's not been comfortable for mebecause it has made it difficult for meto stay in good standing with sayexample the american diabetesassociationwherethe the conventional advice even to atype 2 diabetic who has plenty ofinsulin in their body it is literallyeat whatever you want but cover it withyour insulin just give yourself moreinsulin yeah it's a wonderful way tosell insulin it's a wonderful way tomake sure these patients are going tothe hospital very very often becausethey're very very sickwe could just say you know eat a littlebetter by that we mean eat less glucoseif you're insulin resistant that as mostpeople are worldwide this is not anamerican unique to the west this is avery much a problem in southeast asiait's very much a problem in the middleeast the most diabetic countries on theplanet are in the middle east numbersone through nine and this is this is aglobal situation we just have to tellthe peopleeat less processed sugars and processedgrains if that is just the simplest stepum that's number one for me that isfirst principle number one controlcarbohydratesbecause it's refined carbohydrates thatare going to spike insulin the most andkeep it elevated and the sooner we lowerinsulin the sooner all these metabolicissues including alzheimer's diseaseincluding certain cancers start to getbetteryeah and if you've uh you know if youhave an internet connection and you'reeven marginally curious about the topicof you know how not to be fat how not tobe sick how not to be diabeticand you just search the internet with alittle bit of an open mind you won't beable to miss the fact that there areliterally millions of people around theworld who have improved their healthhealth immeasurablyby cutting down on eating processedfoods sugary foodfoods that are high in glucose and youknow there arethousands of different ways you can doit thousands of different diets somepeople call it low carb high fat somepeople do low carb low fat some peopledo keto some people do or paleo but allof these things they have one thing incommon youget far fewer glucose spikes and hencefar fewer insulin spikes and whicheverway you take to do that you know mypersonal way to do that is just i eatonly red meat and i drink only water andit's perfect because oh that's adynamite i mean really safe it's sofunny to me everyone raves these daysabout oh eat this berry it's a superfoodor this this this kale green it's asuperfoodand it's so silly to me it is so sillybecause if you want to talk to me iwould say a superfood is a food thatliterally gives you every nutrient youneed in order to survive well that isany ruminant meat so beef exactly ifsomeone eats beef or really any ruminantanimal they're going to literally getevery nutrient they need to survive andthat is why like you mentioned a humancan literally eat nothing but beefand and survive and thrive and thrivethat's right not just survive they willthrive the strongest leanest healthiestpeople i know are the people who arejust pure carnivoreyeah absolutely and i i've tried itmyself i started doing it i think uh bythe end of this month it'll be sevenyearsand it's really been seven years andthere's no going back like once you'vetried being free man uh yeah once you'vetried being superman you never want toeat kryptonite again that's right wellsaid always want to be supermanand uh but i mean i understand you knownot everybody wants to go this far butstill if you're going to um want to makea difference in your health you have toreduce the amount of incident spikesthat you get and it's such a simple ideaand it's so easy there are so manylow-hanging fruits that you could takeout of your diet i mean i remember wheni first became curious about this i meanit's just simply being aware about noteating the bread before the lunch thatthey put there at the restaurantreducing the amount of bread in thesandwichcutting outthe excess soda that i was drinking justdrinking a little bit of soda i meanjust these low hanging fruits that nowsound completely uh undesirable to mebut just these tiny little changes thatweren't even a big issue immediatelymade a huge difference in my head yeahyeah and everybody i know who's donethis has um has witnessed this now forme i just kept on removing more thingsand just feeling better and better andbetter and i i've continued to go on buti i see it with so many people that it'sit's amazing for me that so many peopledon't notice just this think from thisperspective of just pick the low-hangingfruitand that's a far better use of your timethan arguing with academics oh my goshyeah on twitter i mean this is this isthe thing why i mean i honestlythere is absolutely nothing you willeverthat you could ever show me that iswritten in pubmed that will matter to memore than what i know from what my mybody feels yeah you're in becausei look yeah yeah my n of one which is memy own body i've tried because this isthe thing the scientific thing you knowpeople talk about science science theythink science is you know you just goand read on pubmed what some[Music]um procter gamble sponsored uh scientisthad to write in order to keep his joband you think that that's science nothat's not science that's appealed toauthority as the exact opposite ofscience science is experimentation soactually try and remove this from yourfood see how you feel look at your bloodsugar levels look at your insulin levelslook at all these health problems thatyou have you know you'll be able to tellif they're improving or they're gettingworse that there's no escaping it's yourbody you'll be able to tell and mostpeople just completely ignore that andwon't want to look at it and this isthis is why i you know the term fiatscience is accurate in many ways it'snot just that it's financed by fiat butit's also that it intends to enforcethis fiat scientific reality by fiat youknow that it by rule it's not just byfiat money it's also by government rulelike this no your body can handle a dietconsisting of twinkies and doritos andthere's nothing wrong with it becausehere's a bunch of garbage in pubmed thatproves it because it's fine they wouldthey would go further they would go forthey would literally say you're betterfor it eat these sugary cereals and itis better for you not only you canhandle it they will they will literallyrank it and give it a green goodscorei mean all it does is encourageindulgence promoting sicknesspromoting propping up industries andentities that have no business survivingand truly the truly criminal thing aboutit is not just that you're promotingsomething you're promoting somethingthat's highly addictive that's designedto be highly addictive it's designed byfood scientists have spent decadesfiguring out the exact best combinationsto trigger the reward centers in yourbrain to make you a slaveto that oreo cookie or to that snickersbar whatever it is these people haveknow what they're doing so there's thenotion you know that harvard is popularpopularized this idea that everything isgood in moderationis is is extremely pernicious it'sextremely delicious i agreei i i rail against that view the themoderation in all things is a popular umdietitian's bannering like rallying cryand all it does all that is is ajustification for indulgence and ittotally ignores the fact that mostpeople can't moderatei i i have to moderate highly addictivewell that's my pointand so there was this beautiful quote bysaint augustine who saidabstinence is easier than perfectmoderation and so they would say we'lljust have one small bowl i kind of comeback to cereal like many wheat becausethat's kind of my addiction that i'maware of like they will say just eat onelittle bowl of cerealand and sure if you could only eat onelittle bowl of cereal a half cup orwhatever the serving size is all rightyou know you could get away with thatfor a long time but you don't you neverstop there and so it is easier for theperson to look at that ice cream or thatbread or whatever and just sayi know that once i start eating it iwon't stop until i've eaten half theloaf or i won't stop until i've eatenthat whole pint of ice cream and so i'mjust not going to startso moderation in all things ignoreshuman tendency as most people do toengage in addictive self-destructivebehaviors especially with foods that areliterally as you said designed to beaddictive and they always consist ofrefined starches and sugars safe nobodynobody is sitting around on a fridaynightthe kids are in bed the house is cleanthey turn on a show with their withtheir significant otherand they they say oh man i sure coulduse a plate of scrambled eggsno oneis sitting there craving scrambled eggswhat they crave is something sweet andgooey or salty and crunchy it's going tobe a refined carbohydrate that is why myrule number one control carbs and theeasiest way to do that is if it comes ina bag or a box with a barcodeavoid it don't even open it it's notgoing to work if it's going to be ifyou're going to have a carbohydrate keepit in as unadulterated form as possiblea whole fruit or a whole vegetable butthen don't just thinkwhat i would worry is that in thisconversation so far people are onlyhearing this kind of denial denial avoidthis avoid this avoid this but in orderfor it to be sustaining you need toreplace it so replace it with proteinand fat which have little to no insulineffect those are for me rules number twoand three one control carbs twoprioritize protein from animal sourcesand three don't fear fat everyevery animal protein on the planet whichare the best proteins for humans to eatwell every organism to eat um they canevery animal protein comes with fatthere is literally no exception to thatdon't be afraid of the fat that comeswith that protein you will digest itbetter you will digest the proteinbetter and it will help blunt theinsulin the even modest insulin responseto the protein steak the best protein ithas fat eggs egg whites the best proteinthat has the yolk there's no exceptionso protein and fat come together that'show we should eat it don't try to avoidall that fat it is nutritious it is infact essentialwe need to have it but those are thethree rules of an insulin controllinglife-promoting dietyeah i'll uh my personal uh advice thati give to people who uh do this andagain i'm of course i'm not a doctor besure to check with your obese doctoryeah neither of us are giving a clinicaladvice here but we would give it betterthan[Laughter]yeah but i mean what i tell people isthe best way to avoid carbohydrates isyou don't want to fight a defensive warwhere you're hungry and you're trying torestrict yourself that doesn't workthat's right i mean it can work but itrequires an enormous amount of willpoweryep butyou don't have to do that that's reallypunishing yourself that's that's likeyou know you're you you're playing asoccer game blindfold if you're tryingto do it with the uh with that there'sno reason to do that to yourself thebest way to do it is to fill yourself upwith protein and fatfirst thing in the morning every daythink of that as almost like your jobyou know you wake up and the first thingyou dois youfocus on getting at least a pound offattyred meat in youand thenyou've already won 90 of the battleagainst these carbohydrates because thecravings are going to be very differentif you had a pound of beef and you see apint of ice cream it's very different ifyou've had a pound of beef and youhaven't had a pound of beef it'scompletely different so i sayi personally don't usually havebreakfast i only have two meals a dayyep yeah but i think in the transitionperiod if you're used to eating sugaryfood and you want to cut down on sugar iwould recommend starting the day withfatty meat and justfilling up on it and then that that'sgoing to reduce you know without youeven putting in any effort you're justgoing to end up eating less sugar thanusually i have 100 i i agree with thisperspective completely and indeed save iwould say there is significant humanevidence to to defend this so as much asialso criticize the published body ofliterature the tragedy is there are allof these valid gems that have beenpublished and just completely overlookedbecause it doesn't fit the popular iwould that fiat narrative which is wehave to promote something in order togenerate these this kind of artificialwealth through drug companies and inmedicine but if if a person can followthe adage of breakfast like a king lunchlike a prince and dinner or supper likea popper this idea of this kind ofscaling down throughout the day if youcan so i also don't eat breakfast so iwill eat a big hearty filling lunch ieat lunch and i am and it's it's fat andprotein almost exclusively and then wheni go home several hours later to havedinner with my family which issacrosanct for me i will have dinnerwith i want to have dinner with myfamilyand then i will eat a very modest dinnerand then i'm still because i'm stillkind of full from lunch and then in theevening no snacking no snack once aperson has had dinner stop eatingyou do not want to go to bed on a fullstomach and you do not want to go to bedhaving just spiked your insulin andglucose that is in my view the primaryreason why people sleep poorly if you goto bed with spiked glucose you will havean activation of your heart rateyour heart will be beating faster andharder and your body temperature will behigher and you'll be thinking i can'tsleep because i have such anxiety no youthat that's an artificial anxietyactivated by your nervous system inresponse to what you just didmetabolically but tragically that iswhen most people indulge the most it'sin the evening that's when they eat allof these sugar insulin spiking foodsit's the literally the worst time to beeating it so i agree wholeheartedly eatthe bulk of your calories in the earlierpart of the day so you can taper off asyou go into the afternoon and eveningyeah and generally you knowit's it's a great rule to not snack ithink of it this way if you have thedesire to snack less than 12 hoursafter your last meal your last meal didnot contain enough red meat well saidthat's a good ruleyeah that this is this is how you knowhave i eaten enough red meat likethere's no magic number of pounds ofbeef that you need to eat every day thatapplies for every person it depends onyou your body your size the amount ofeffort that you put in and every daybut a good rule of thumb is you shoulddefinitely not be craving anything inthe in the next 12 hours if you ateenough then the next 12 hours fooddoesn't even cross your mind this thisis the right way to go about it andinitially it's going to be moredifficult because you're still a sugaraddict and there's an adjustment but theeasiest way to handle that adjustment isto justdouse it with fatty beans no no in facti to speak on that point of adjustingthe the body is an energetic hybridum where at any moment the body has twoprimary metabolic fuels that it'srelying on which is blood sugar or orfat those are the two fuels at anymoment the body is primarily sugarburning or it's primarily fat burningand that is entirely 100 percentdictated by insulin when insulin iselevated it shifts the metabolic engineto sugar burning when insulins down themetabolic engine if you will shifts tofat burning the more a person is stuckin sugar burning the harder it's goingto be to fast and not snack because thebody has a very finite amount of sugarstored in it and so if we're alwaysburning that sugar that's an engine thatwe need to be topping up that that's atank a fuel tank that the person wouldneed to feel like they have to top upfrequentlybut if they can kind of get through thisinitial adjustment stage as you notedthen insulin starts to come down thenthe body starts to shift and rely on theother fuel tank namely fats and even alean person has well over a hundredthousand calories stored on them as fatit's like we have all of these energybars and energy drinks strapped onto ourbodies that we just can't use becausewe're constantly filling up that littleum tank so it's almost like let me usethe analogy of a big fuel tanker like abig semi truck with a big tank of fuelthat it's hauling on the backand then every four or five hours thistruck or you know six hours it needs tostop and fill upand it's filling it needs to fill upbecause it's relying on this smalllittle tank under the engine in the cabof the of the truck and yet the irony isso much of its effort is hauling aroundall of this other fuel that's strappedto the back of this big fuel tanker andimagine if thisengine was such that it could take thefuel lines from the engine and starttapping into all of the calories all theenergy that it's hauling around butisn't using well then that trunk thattruck could go for daysthe analogy then comparing it to thehuman body is that we have these two twoenergy stores we have about 2 000calories stored as sugar and maybe 200000 calories stored as fat and we keepusing just that sugar using it upfilling it up using it up filling it upand any excess that we fill into thattank spills into this other tank of fatthat we're never tapping into becausewe're constantly filling that sugar tankso the moment we let thesugar tank run dry and it'll be a littleuncomfortable there is that adjustmentbut give it a couple days insulin willhave come down we've basicallyre-plumbed the fuel lines to have thatengine tapping in the metabolic enginetapping into stored fat and now when wego on a hike you know it's here in themountains of the mountain west in utahmy family we go on hikes all the timeand we i will see very overweight peopleand they will have this little theselittle kind of fanny packs of energybars and you have my family we're alllean and fit and strong and healthy wedon't have nothing but waterit's because we have any enough fuel onour bodies we're all lean but we stillhave enough fuel that we could go run 50miles 100 miles and not run out of fuelif we were so inclined and these peoplecan't even hike five miles they start toget hangry and uncomfortable it'sbecause they're stuck in sugar burningmode and the more you eat sugar the moreyou're dependent on it and so you justhave to break that you have to just sayi'm not going to get mycarbs from bags and boxes with barcodesand i'm just going to focus on fats andproteins it'll be a little bituncomfortable give it a few days andit'll be right as rain and that personwill have shifted to becoming a fatburneryeah this is this is really uh it'salmost likerunningtwo different kinds of uh operatingsystems in the human body you knowthere'sit's like there's windows and mac andlinux there's fat burners and sugarburners and i i've tried being a fatburner and i've tried being a sugarburnerand if you've not tried both i thinki mean you know people like toexperiment with all kinds of thingspeople like to enjoy all kinds ofexperiences like watching tv shows andtraveling to places and consuming allkinds of thingsi think you might want to considerthis kind of experience you know trywhat it would be like to be a fat burnerwell saidjustyou know ever wonder what you would looklike if you could put on a superman suityeah that's kind of what it is well andthere's another perk in addition to umthe ability to not be so dependent oneating every two hours when a person isin a state of fat burning that gets tothe order of about 16 to 20 hours it'sthat acuteif insulin is low the body startsburning so much fat that but with lowinsulin it can't stop and so it's burnedenough fat that it's met its energeticdemand every cell is properly fueled butbecause insulin is low it can't stopburning fatand so you start burning more fat thanyou literally need to meet yourenergetic needs and that excess of fatburning turns into these moleculescalled ketones and everyone's heard ofketones or keto and unfortunately it's afour-letter word it's disparaged it'sreviled it's just because it's somisunderstood but ketones speaking offeeling betterwe have just we just published a paperlast year looking at humans we hadpost-mortem brain samplesof the um of the hippocampus which isthe kind of memory learning centerthat's the part of the brain that getscompromised with alzheimer's disease andin these post-mortem samples we lookedat the metabolic genes related toglucose burning and ketone burningbecause the brainrelies on those two fuels the brain doesnot burn fat it uses fat for structuredoesn't burn fat for fuel unlike therest of the body the burn the brain willburn sugar like glucose or ketonesbut what we found in alzheimer's diseaseis that the sugar burning becomescompromisedit can't burn sugar as well because it'sbecome insulin resistant and but it hasa perfect ability to burn ketones andthis is reflected in human case studiescase reports where you have someone withfull-blown alzheimer's disease eitherput them into a ketogenic diet or givethem a ketone drink to boost up theirketones and in real time you detectimprovements in cognition you've notcured the disease it's not that dramaticunfortunately it is irreversible to adegree but whereas someone was so hadsuch dementia that they couldn't getthemselves dressed now they canthey had such dementia that theycouldn't draw the face of an analogclock and now they can i mean these aretrue improvements that you see all byshifting the fuel but the tragic in thetragedy of the average individual isthat with alzheimer's disease especiallywhich is something we're all afraid ofto some degree or another because it'ssuch a horrifying disorder to be trappedwithin your own brainbut we look at the progression of thisdisease and insulin resistanceis more is has a higher statisticallysignificant correlation to alzheimer'sthan age does even and this is howpowerfully predictive insulin resistanceis but as the brain becomesprogressively insulin resistantyou have two tragedies that occurconcurrently one the insulin resistanceof the brain means that it can't get asmuch glucose and so the brain starts togo hungry ironically the body isswimming in a sea of glucose and yet thebrain just can't get it but then secondbecause the person is insulin resistantthey have high insulin levels and highinsulin levels inhibit any production ofketones because it shuts off fat burningand so the brain is starving for a lackof glucose and it's crying out forketones that the body simply will notgive it because the elevated insulinwon't allow it to happen and so the thebrain literally starts to starveand you start to have dementia and it'snot only that that scenario that i justdescribed is not only relevant toalzheimer's disease but several otherneurological disorders like migraineheadaches we have known since 1928 thereare published reports from 1928 thatpeople who frequently suffer frommigraines if you put them into a ketoticstate through a ketogenic diet orfasting they will have no more migrainesthey will literally stopand be maintained and this was repeatedin studies published in 1930 um withepilepsy we've known with epilepsy fordecades that you put that child into aketotic state they will have no epilepsythe problem with these and otherdisorders is as much as we knew thatketones are probably most therapeutic tothe brain more than any other tissue inthe body they fell out of favor themoment we started developing drugsepilepsy was always treated with aketogenic diet well now we have theseepileptic drugs these anti-epilepticsthat'll help they never work as wellmigraines it was once treated with aketogenic diet well now we have thesegood migraine medications so you shouldjust take these instead it absolutelyand the same thing happened with eventype 1 diabetes type 1 diabetes used tobe treated by like basically carnivoredietand because the lower insulin need lowerblood glucose levels help them surviveand feel better in the absence ofinsulin and then the moment we kind ofmass produced insulin which on one handis life-saving so i can't critique thatit does improve the life of the type 1diabetic there's no arguing that but wesh but but now we started to tell themyou can eat just like everybody else eatall that cake eat all those cookies andbreads just cover it with your insulinthat's the line and all it does is putthe poor type 1 diabetic child on thisglycemic roller coaster all dayof getting too high and getting too lowas opposed to telling even the type 1certainly the type 2 diabetic saycontrol your carbohydrates and now theybasically just have a flat line ofglucose all day and their insulin kneesgo down to a tenth of what it would havebeen otherwiseyeah the truly astonishing thing here isthat absolutely nothing by any stretchof the imagination absolutely nothingcomparestocutting down on eating sugary foodin terms of cost reward i mean it's justinsane when you look at all these otherthings like yeah let's give themanti-epileptic drugs like you thinkdecades later now we start to see allthe side effects of those drugs and allthe problems that they cause and all theumcomplications that then require moredrugs which then cause even moreproblems so you have that as an optionso that you you know you sign up for alifetimedrug addictionessentially that doesn't work as welland it costs a lot of money and it ruinsyour healthor you know you just stop eating garbageand it works much better whether it'sepilepsy whether it's diabetes whetherit's alzheimer's whether it's all ofthese health issues you see the samething like it's it's it's out there asyou said in the literature it's alreadybeen demonstrated it's also out theredemonstrated in the real world ofliterally thousands and thousands ofpeople all over the world who startedtheir own blogs and have their ownbusinesses built around this you knowthe outside i mean thankfully theinternet has allowed people toessentially be doctors outside of themedical establishment that's what a lotof these influencers on social mediareally are and and i thoroughly respectthem because they are doing science youknow they they've worked with actualclients they've trained them they'vetaken uhtheir uh measurements they've looked attheir blood work over time they've seenwhat works they've seen what doesn'twork they've read literature andeverybody comes up with the sameconclusion like this stuff works for allkinds of different things and it's it'sit's an enormous amount of mentalgymnastics you have to do to avoid thatvery obvious very low cost very highreturnin the uminterventionand think of other things and reallythis is this is i think if if you're inthe medical field and if you're in thescientific research field and you'relistening to this um of course there's alittle bit of defensiveness of oh wellhow do you know well you're not a phd inumbiology and how do i talk well neitherof us are md's right yeah neither of usare md's and how do i know and of courseall these people will claim expertisebut really if you if your expertisehas resulted in you beinga not being able to notice that the byfar the most effective intervention thatcould possibly be done is reducereducing the level of insulin resistancein a patient through dietary controlthen i'm sorry but your entire degreeand all of your educate education if itis in any sense related to this andyou've missed this lowest hanging fruitthis absoluteelephant of a fruit that is low hangingright there for you to pick and you'vemanaged to miss that but instead you'vestudied all this extremely sophisticatedarcaneacademic discussion aboutall these cells and genetics and all ofthese uh other arcane things drug drugmechanisms yep drug mechanisms and allof these acronyms and names and you knowall these people that are just are soexpert in all those things really ifyou've managed to miss that hey cut downon doritos first and you're talkingabout all these extremely sophisticatedscientific concepts that you thinkyou're better than normal people becauseyou understand them and normal peopledon't understand them i am sorry butyou've been scammed you've been scammedyour education is a big giant stupidscam and you have been conned intowasting your life into joining a giantcriminal enterprise yeah you've beentravelingyeah you you you're helping a bunch ofcriminals profit from people gettingsick that's what it comes down to yeahyou've been credentialed to become alegal um drug dealer um this part ofthis this dissonance that i developedi i think my first loss of innocencejust to really put a fine point in whatwe're describing in addition to i'll addthat humans are great self-deceivers wewe fool ourselves i would when i duringthe course of my phd in north carolina iwould go from our little home and iwould bike i biked all the time we onlyhad one car and my wife was home withour new baby i would bike to the medicalschool where i took most of my phdcoursesthe biochemistry the bioenergetics thephysiology etc i would have to bikeeven though it was less convenient forme i would bike on the opposite side ofthe road of where the med school wasbecause i had to go to the far side ofthe medical school because the sidewalkof the medical school block was filledwith nurses and doctors who weretechnically off the private the propertyof the hospital to go to the sidewalk inorder to smokethey would go to the sidewalk so theycould smoke and so there were so manythat would be aligned there along thereof all the time that i have to bike onthe other side of the road and i wouldlook at these healthcare professionalsand just wonder at the hypocrisy or theignorance or the self-delusion where youcould imagine a physician who would beout there smoking a cigarette go back infor a clinical appointment with apatient who has lungfailure and heart disease and he wouldlook at the patient's chart and say ahwell looks like you smoke uh half apound or a pack ofcigarettes a day you really gotta stopsmoking and yet the stench of his owncigarette smoke comes into the clinicalappointment with himthis isand another something i see as a parentyou'll see i've literally seen thishappena mom is at a playground with her childthe and the mom has a little bag ofcandies and the baby the little childcomes up to mom hey can i have somecandy and the mom will give the littlekid a small littlehandful here's some little gummy candiesnow don't ask for any more you've hadenough this isn't good for you to havetoo much and then the moment that littlechild ran away i saw them what did themom start doing it's just hand over fistshoving those gummy candies into hersick body her sick overweight body and ithoughtthese moments of hypocrisy one i took itto heart andanalyzed my own behavior thinkingwhere am i hypocritical where i willtell my child okay you've watched tv foran hour that's enough no more and then iwill go and watch it for four hours youknow i mean just as an example it mademe analyze my own behavior more to bemindful of my own hypocrisy but then itjust was such a such an obvious displayof the hypocrisy that just pervadeshuman nature including thosewho well especially because it is suchblatant hypocrisy those who know betterwe knowwe know that if you are insulinresistant you're a type 2diabetic or type 1 literally yourdisease could be defined as you have ahard time metabolizing sugar in yourblood that's why your sugar is climbingwhy on this good green earth would wethen tell the person which entities doamerican dietetics american diabetesamerican heart they will say eat a lowfathighcarbohydrate diet that is literally theclinic the dietary advice that theseentities promote that they will sayit is criminal and yet there must besuch cognitive dissonance because theyknow the blood sugar levels are gettingtoo high well then as i already said ihate that i'm repeating myself just putless sugar in the system and it willlower the sugar it will lower theinsulin than than the insulin resistancewhich is the heart of all metabolicproblems and then all of the issues thatare derivative of that everything startsto get better rather than trimming thissick little tree at the branches bygiving here a medication or theirmedication we just chop the damn thingdown and now we don't have to worryabout pruning it anymoreyeah one of the one absolutely mostheartbreaking things that happened whenyou start learning about how this wholeinsulinmechanism works and you see thedifference in youis you try and tell your family andfriends and uh one of the worst thing iswhen you have a family member who'sclearly suffering from serious healthproblems and clearly could benefitenormously from them and they might evenbe willing to listen except that theirdoctor told them no noyou don't have to worry about any ofthat stuff focus on taking yourmedication and be sure to come to myoffice once every two weeks so that wecan check your whatever it isbut don't listen to your nephew orgrandkid or all these people that arereading weird things on the internet ihave a degreethis is this is you know think aboutthings that make you go really reallyreally angry and this is yeah and youcan't say one of the dirty secretsespecially of medical practice um i sawthis firsthand there i was a group oflike i think there werefour of us phd students taking classesnot to let phds off the hook we knowthat it is plenty corrupted but we weretaking classes with the md medicalstudents like the physiology and thebiochemistry and stuff some of them andthen we had our ownother coursework i was amazed that if wephd students got anything less than a bwe were on academic probation and thenwe had to repeat the class and if we gotless than a b againthankfully never happened with me butthen you get kicked out of the programso our phd program went from four tothree within the first year i knewmultiple mde students who they theydon't have to just get they could get acand they can take that again as manytimes as they need i knew a guy who'shis graduation from his medical degreewas delayed about a year and a half orso because he kept failing a class andyet it's just once you're in the systemtheydo they move heaven and earth all themore now i mean standards just keepgetting lower and lower as we have allthese outcomes that are based more onensuring you knowwell i i need to be careful ensuringjust you knowthat everyone can have a chance andeveryone gets a degree they're justhanding them out and so there's noquestion that the quality is gettingless and less but alsotragically as the quality is decliningit seems like there's a growingresistance to acknowledging when youdon't know something it is the greattragedy of all terminal degrees a phd inan md are obvious examples the more wehave earned letters after our name themore we refuse to acknowledge someonecould know something that we don't knowand that to me it's the death of scienceit is it truly isin in science is just a mature i meantrue science which is the pursuit oftruth that my phd mentor who was awonderful gentleman just a wonderful manhe would always say ben we're seekingtruth we're seeking truth and we thatmeans you have to be prepared to dumpall of your theoriesthe moment you see data that conflictedthat challenges it should make youchallenge what you thought you knew andand readdress it reassessbut no no now like i said at the outsetof the conversation everyone they havelawn signs and they say we believe inscience and all it is is the declarationof faith at that point it is no longer arigorous objective analysis of what wethink we know and and this is al covidwas the death of yeah i mean it was itwas the outside nail yep yepyeah no i i definitely agree with that ithink thethe the really astonishing uhbait and switch here is that you knowthe whole supposed marketing material ofscience was built on the idea that youknow no more priests no more authorityno more uh listen to what the priestssay no you need to read for yourselfeverybodyuses the scientific method you thinkscientifically and it's a it's a i meanit's really just an explicit statementof what all humans do at all times youknow what when you wake up in themorning let's say your bed has a wall onone side and it doesn't have a wall onthe other side you know it's thescientific method one day you wake upyou hit the wall and then you'veexperimented and then for the rest ofyour life you're to wake up on the rightside of the bed that's science that'swhat the scientific method is you knowyou you have a hypothesis that i couldwake up on the left side you test it outyou smash your head in the walland then youyou figure out the conclusion that youshould try the other side sothinking scientifically is what humansnaturally do when they try andunderstand how things work and thescientific process is a great way ofthinking about itformulating it to make it systematic sothat it's not just you know going by ahunch so you formulate a hypothesis youtest it and you you write it down ithelps you structure your thinking in amuch better waybut with that we've successfully beenconned intoall right we're doing experimentsbutactuallywhat we're going to be doing is thatuh you're not doing experiments you'rejust going to trust priests who claim todo experiments but these are better thanthe other priests the two you trustedbecause the other priests told you youknow they spoke to godthese guys don't speak to god they speakto an experiment so you can feel okaytrusting them but really um it's thesame thing it is a religion like at thispoint we just have priests and we trustthem and we excommunicate people whodon't believe it else said well in facti used to take great pride in being whatis commonly called a hard scientist thehard sciences were these areas ofscience where you could literallyconduct an experiment run the analysisand see was this a significant findingor was it not did something happen thatwe predicted or did it not i would takegreat pride that i was not a softscience guy you know where where you addthe word science in your degree and ithelps you believe it's political sciencesocial sciences run a bunch ofobservationary data yeah there's nothingthere's nothing science i mean it's it'salmost a rule where if if uh if a degreehas the word science in it it's probablynot a science you know like i'm i'm i amin cell biology that's my department wedon't say i mean my other colleagues arein molecular biology you know we don'tsay molecular biology science but it'ssocial science political science and i iwould take such pride that i could knowsomething i could say this is truthwhat we saw this happened i treated thecells with this with insulin and this isliterally what happened so now i canstate it with an absolute authoritybecause it is truth it is reality andunlike the social sciences the softersciences which i don't mean to totallydisparage but they could not make thosesame claimsthey could not do it but now even in thehard sciences you have people makingclaims that are not justifiedi've never beenmore ashamedof ofof of my credential than i have been thelast few years where it has been youhave people making the mostunscientific ridiculous statementsacross a whole spectrum of social issuesright now it's not just disease but itis you know human development um for imean all these things are beingcriticized in a way that i i look atwith such wonderand and i'm left thinkingi'm in a clown world now um but but youknow what the only one no no i know butit's it's funny for me to say thisbecause ihappen to be a professor at a privatereligious university and what's amazingto me is to see that it's these privatereligious universities that still allowthe teaching of traditional kind ofliberal education by that i don't meanbut when i say liberal i mean like aclassic liberal education which trainsyou in the arts and the sciences and theletters and i canknow that my institution will defend mewhen i makestatements about reality and truth inscience and i don't teach anythingreligious whatsoever but it's thesestate sponsored schools who are sodependent on money from the nationalinstitutes of health or from the stateor federal agencies unlike myinstitution where they have to say whatthe party they have to follow the partyline they lit i mean that to your pointabout fiat science being based on fiatmoney that is literally the case withtraditional state schoolsand it's only universities that aren'tdependent like my university for examplewhen you when the federal government washanding out covert relief fundsmy university was one of we literallydeclined the money it was offered thesetens of millions of dollars and myuniversity said no we aren't going totake it because we know the moment youstart doing that things it comes withobligations and demandsand so it's a it's a weird thingto to say that it's these privategenerally religious universities andthey're very very few of them thatactually teachthe reality the binary nature of justscience something is real or it isn'tnow that's not to say there's nosilliness college campuses unfortunatelyit's their very nature nowadays to havesomesomewhat crazy ideology in somedisciplinesbutuh it would be it would be increasinglydifficult for me to be in academia if ifelt like i had to statethe you know something that i i believedto be utterly falseyeah i mean umbetter get some bitcoin because i thinkthe uh i know i know i i think theinquisitors are coming and you're goingto be have to you're going to have toyou know recant on all of your heresiesyou're going to have to cancel the beexcommunicated exactlydenounce your previous work and say thatinsulin is not a problem anymore oh iknow i know well but the nice thing forme i've never gotten an nih grant andthat's actually i'm not ashamed of thatthat's kind of a point of pridei have been able to fund my lab throughindividual donors that are sufficientlyenamored or convinced um have asufficient conviction of my va my viewof health and disease that i've not hadto becomei've not had to become an employee ofthe government uh and say what they wantme to saycongratulations that's i mean reallythis is uh for me uhth this is the goal and this was alwaysthe goal write and be readand have a have a method ofcommunicating with a readership withouthaving to be part of the state-runeducational system because ultimatelythe entire fieldsthey're all related to the academicjournals and i discussed this in detailin the fiat standard the way that thisacademic fiat ponzi works is all runthrough the academic journals thebasically the better way to understandis that the university system and theuniversity professors and the universityadministratorshave effectively been conned intouh becoming slave labor for the academicpublication industry there are a fewlarge publishers that controlumthousands literally thousands uponthousands of academic journals and99.999 of everything written in allthose academic journals is unreadablegarbage nobody ever reads it none ofthese papers are read by anybody even ifyou have access to it yeah even if youhad access to it nobody would read it umi mean the only people who read it arepeople who read it because they want torespond to it or build upon it so thatthey can get into the same journals andget promoted but nobody outside of thejournal circle jerk uh feeds these uhpapersno in fact i i joke it's incestuous isay that all the time you go toconventional meetings i go give a talkat a conventionalscience meeting it's the same handful ofscientists listening to the same handfulof scientists everyone's citing eachother's work you know and that's why atthe very beginning of our conversation inoted that i i began more and more torail against this system where i'dpublish a paper like this paper aboutthe post-mortem biopsies we did onstudying the hippocampus from humans imean this was relevant cool stuff and wepaid five thousand dollars to get itpublished in a journal that no one willread except a handful of people andconventional academia would say all thatmatters i mean like at the end of everyyear you get reviewed in part based onhow many people cited your publishedwork that's part of the game of academiaand yet i looked at thislike about six years ago this was thebeginning of me saying i need to one getinvolved in social media and two i needto write a book because i thought if therest of my career is publishing papersthat 20 other scientists read and itnever actually impacts a human's lifethen i will have ended my careereither i was delusional thinking i madea difference or i will acknowledge andbe humbled by the fact that i never madea lick of difference in every discoveryi made as cool as i might have thoughtit waswas totally irrelevant in the real worldand that to mewas was intolerable the idea of justsitting in the ivory tower of academiaspouting ideas and then wondering ifthey had ever influenced someone i saidno i have to circumvent that wholesystem yes i have to play that game i doi i play it but i also know that i'mplaying the game and then i go right tothe people i directly share publicationsthat are relevant to human healththrough social media and it's neverpictures of me doing anything silly it'sliterally just i'm teaching a littlelesson right now about how testosteroneaffects fat cell function you know forexample or i'm writing a book that isdirectly me going around i mean safe ifyou had had to convey all of your ideasin in the two books that i've read ofyours bitcoin standard and fiat standardif you had to only rely on those ideasbeing conveyed in a classroomyou'd you'd never or your own papersbeing published no good luck a fractionof the number of people would know it sothose of us who know ideas and that'snot relegated to those with phds not atallbut those who have valuable ideas itbehooves us to test those ideas in anopen market are these ideas as valid asi think they are and then how can i helpconvey them if they are and the marketwill tell you if they're valuable or notexactly which is what i really loveabout twitter twitter in particular ithink is the most uhis the most vigorous intellectual andscientific debate that you find may italways stay that way may it stay thatway oh obviously you know of course ithas all of its problems with censorshipand so on but yet even in spite of allof that i think it still manages to bethe most effective platform because uhit's extremely powerful as a way ofcommunication where you need to getthings down to 280 characters so thatmeans you can't waffle around and youcan't waste people's time people justimmediately tune you out get straight tothe point so you know you can link topapers you can link to articles you caninclude the video and audio but you needto get to the punch in 280 points whichforces the brain to focus and for andallows you to really expose things andthen that's where academics really thethe tricks you know academics don't likebrevity academics don't like brevitythey like to be superfluous ineverything they describe exactly becausea lot of it is just honestlyperformative art i mean i've been tothose conferences and i know that a lotof it is just you need to sit there andtalk about your paper nobody's read yourpaper nobody wants to read your paperbut they have to attend the conferenceyou have to speak at the conference andso it's just performance you stand thereand you know you feign being wise andyou talk slowly and then you finish yourtime and then you get on with your lifeand like nobody learns anything and mostof it is just really performativeum but yeah that's uhsocial media on the other hand is realworld that people are going to listen toyour ideas they're going to try them andthey're going to come back and tell youhey i tried to do what you said and lookit's worked and here are the picturesandthat that's the validation that you needi remember you know it was it was it wassomething very similar that i feltduring my grad school when i uhstopped believing in the stuff that theyteach us in the grad school and i justdeveloped this alternative perspectivethe biggest horror that i had was thisidea that hang on so we are just writingall of this garbage to continue toumkeep our jobs in this kind of system andthe only purpose of writing this is sothat we develop the expertise so we canget on tv and newspapers and universityclassroom and gas light people intotelling them hey um yep you knowinflation is actually good for you andprices aren't really rising and uh weneed more inflation and the way that wesolve the problems of inflation is withmore inflation that was basically it andjustrealizing that you're sitting there andyou're writing something that nobody'sgoing to be reading it's it it gave methat image ofthat and i mentioned this in the fieldas well there's that movie the stanleykubrick movie the shining where uh theauthor and his wife they go into aresort to an isolated hotel in middle ofnowhere and they spend months writingand then his wife looks at all thehundreds of pages that he wrote andthey're all just the same sentence allover again and this is what it feelslike when you're in academia it's likewould it even matter if i just filledthis with the same sentence over andover the same exact sentences in thatmoviewould anybody even notice i mean yeahthe seven people in the journals and theseven people who read the journal mightuh notice but like if you them and i weall agree on doing this as a pranknobody would notice it couldwell stay in the in the gym in factthat's been done right but there wasthis i can't remember his name there wasthis physical socal alan he had suchdisdainin fact did you cite this in your bookyes alan yeah oh yeah yeah so i but i'veheard it other times where you have thephysicist who writes a report about likehe just made up like one of them i thinkhe might have been the guy who talkedabout how dogsum having sex was a good example of likeuh you know male domination or orwhatever and it would but that was oneof the things he'd made up but justutter nonsense and getting it publishedin these soft sciencejournals you know the peer reviewprocess was just a jokeyeah and like i think um you knowusually it used to be thata natural scientist would laugh atsocial scientists but i think you knowthese are the same universities thatpublish the same thing so oh no i know iknow yeah that's natural i used tothat's right yeah i don't anymore my mysmugness of being a hard naturalscientist is is gone now because we'vewe've also now started compromisingtruth to fit a narrative unfortunatelyyeah and i think you knowas you said the the recent uhrespiratory illness uh shenanigans werereally i mean the way that the allentire world scientific community wentfrom having never heard about socialdistancingand uh to just say yeah well this isobviously what we need to do becausethat's the only option what are youcrazy yeah well and to totally overlookwhat we we knew very very early on notto maybe maybe i need to be very carefulbut but very briefly we knew very earlyon that the most significant singleliterally the single most relevant riskfactor in determining whether this wouldbe serious infection or a very mildinfection was the amount of fat a personhad on their body and that's not just acoincidenceany inhaled or or virus that gets intothe system it comes in as a viralparticle and it needs to hijack a cellit needs to get into a cell infect acell for that cell to start producingmore of those viral particles to go andinfect others with this particular virusinfects fat cells more than any othercell well they're a couple a littlehigher but fat cells are among the mostreadily infected cell with thisparticular viral particle and so andthen the fat cell becomes an unwittingfactory producing more and more and moreof it because it had on the surface ofthe fat cell these other proteins thatallow the viral particle to get intothat cell much more readily so literallyif you had a fat cell in a muscle cellside by side and each were exposed tothis viral particle it's going to have avery hard time getting into the musclecell because it doesn't have the rightreceptors for that virus to kind oftrick fat cells are very welcoming hostsand so a person who has more fat tissuejust had more likely infection sites toprevent this isn't meant to be anincriminating point about anyone who'soverweight noindeed i truly am not but for us topretendthat that wasn't a relevant variable infact arguably the most relevant variablewas it did no one any serviceno it's absolutely insane i think it'sthe most absurd moment of the entire twoyears was when um and i'm from albertai'm from alberta which means i have agreat distain for any of the easternprovincesyeah i could understand and this thisguy you know he'd locked down ottawa hadsomeone i mean ontario had some of themost strict uhlockdowns in the world for a very longtime and they destroyed small businessesdoug ford got on tv and taughthis citizens how to make cheesecake hismom's or his grandmarecipe for cheesecake which is he madedoug ford you know the the enormous unitwhich he is today so you can imagine howmuchsugar it has in it and uh he went andcooked it you know he was wearing agiant t-shirt uh that said we're all inthis together and he was teaching peoplehow to cook cheesecake while he lockedthem at home and prevented them fromopening their businesses it's absolutelyamazing how nobody said anything aboutyou know it was it was for methat was for me seeing everything thathappened over the last few yearswas was a kind of final nail in thecoffin now of coursemy field itself studying the the originsof metabolic disease had made me alreadysomewhat cynical um of of traditionalviews you know like uh i've mentionedbefore that the fat cell is at the heartof metabolic problems that's whereinsulin resistance startsum and and yettraditional view would be well then justsimply lower calories and that's allthere is to it yes calories matter butthe prevailing paradigm with obesity isthis caloric paradigm totally ignores ortotally refutes the fact that insulincould have anything to do with it andyet insulin is essential to determiningfat storage as well the whole debaclethe last three years settled it for mebut anyway here he is here he isyeah look i mean look at that oh my goshyeah and so he he ought to be he oughtto have been worried about thisrespiratory illness because he has themost significant risk factorwell look at him there's he's had therecipe memorizes he was 10 year olds imean this isoh my gosh this is some seriousdedication yeah it is it is uhthere's the cream so that so what he'smixing here the mix of sugar and fat isis a is a dane is a particularlydangerous one there's the cream a littlemore yeah sugar a little more fat andsugar and in nature it's important tonote in nature carbohydrate and fatdon't come together that doesn't happenin in foods that we eat in nature it'seither pure carbohydrate in the form offruit and vegetable generally or it'sprotein and fatbut he's he's mixing oh gosh what aclownyeah he got re-elected as welloh i'm not surprised i'm not surprisedthey re-elected trudeau it's it's myit's so it's so shamefulum to see what's happened and i i lovedgrowing up in canada i loved mychildhood in this little kind of farmtownin albertaand and but but i my dad raised us allto be um very kind of free marketcapitalist and he would always railagainstthe federal the lack of a kind offederalist systemum now i'm not saying the u.s is perfectit's democracy it's federalist system isis built and only can succeed on a moralpeople as the founding fathers noted andthe loss of kind of morality in the usputs it into a difficult spot in factsafe i've heard you defend a monarchybeforeand and which which i i can be verysympathetic to um i think if you knewif a population could know that it wouldalways have a just kingslam dunkbut but you know the usperspective was we can't trust thatwe'll always have a good king we'lltrust the morality of the people but nowif you have if you don't have a moralpeoplethen it does it doesn't work yeah no ithink the the argument is not that youknow if we can get uh just king everysingle time i think the argument isthat thisyou hit the nail right on the head thatyou you need to just people for ademocracy to work so you need thesociety to be 51 percentjust moral and low time preference ithink this is the really key thing youneed a society to be predominantlythinking about the future thinking yeschildren because otherwise they willsacrifice the future for the sake ofthis that's something you've articulatedvery well before i i love you yeah andand and the difficult thing is that ifit's if it's uh a democracy then it'sthe hand it's uh hopper describes it aswe stand altogether where everybody'shand is in everybody's pocket andeverybody is robbing from everybody elseand when you have that system youincentivize people to think short termand so it's very difficult to you knowwin the lottery then and have 51 percentof the populationuhmanage to do it but with a king you justneed one guyto teach their sonthis is what we do we keep thinking ofthe long term and we don't sacrifice thelong term for the present and so then ifyou just have one familywhere you have one father who just needsto teach this to their son and then theymanage to keep it going for a fewgenerationsyou're arguably better off sticking tothem than you are i agree i agreebecause then their their moral viewwould befor lack of a better word imposedin the population it would be better i itotally agree with that i think it's notso much that they would be able toimpose their moral view i think it'sjust that uh without a high timepreferenceperson in charge of government peoplejust naturally do what's best for themand they naturally develop a long-termperspective because what you need todestroy that is an actively destructivegovernment that takes away your propertytakes away that your freedom takes awayyour security then people becomeum essentially animals fighting againsteach other because they don't see acommon future because theythey think the future is compromisedso this this would be it but i wanted toget back to alzheimer's you'd mentionedthis this is of course very interestingi have uh my grandfather unfortunatelywho suffers from this illness and ofcourse as i mentioned it's one of thoseexamples where constantly trying to getthem to change their diet and the doctorjustsays it's not and everybody in thefamily just laughs when i mention itbut it's uh you know recently new uhresearch on alzheimer's has shown usthat uh yeah apparently uh fiat sciencehas been uh uh naughty and up to it'susual in factis the it is the most perfect example ofof fiat science in science at its workscience at its worst or agenda at itsbestwhere the prevailing theory ofalzheimer's disease has been that it isit is a disease of plaques forming inthe brain and these little things calledamyloid beta peptides or what we callplaques are accumulate in thehippocampus and literally disrupt neuronto neuron connection resulting in thecognitive decline that so typifiesalzheimer's disease butthe challenge why my lab challenged thatamong other labs i'm not alone in thisis that there would be drug after drugwould come out that would be shown toreduce the presence of amyloid betapeptides or plaques in the brain and yetthere would be nono subsequent improvement in cognitionin fact this just happened last yearwhere the fda against the the request ofthe special panel that was put togetherto review this anti-alzheimer's drug itwas an anti-plaque drug so there wasthis special panel put together toreview it they directed the fda todecline fda approval of this drugbecause the efficacy was nil there wasnothing to it but the fda approved itanyway and their justification for itwas that they didn't want to discouragefurther drug development in thealzheimer's realm so they explicitlyapproved a drug they knew had no benefitand so doctors would start prescribingthis to patients even though there wasno known benefit butall of this is just the the the cherryon top of the sickfoundation which was that the very ideathat alzheimer's was a plaque-baseddisease was built on faulty data andthat's what you're referring to it'smade the headlines i wouldn't besurprised if many people have seen thisalreadybut this initial scientific findingspublished in these glamorous journals ofcourseit was that when they would block theformation of the plaques in these animalmodels then the alzheimer's would goaway when the plaques were there thedementia the cognitive decline in therodents would follow and yet it was allfabricatedthey had made up these data and that'spart of this perverse incentive that sotypifies this artificial realm of fiatscience where they want they need topublish and they need to keep gettingfundingand so you you're willing to compromiseand and now we know that that ideas hasbeen tossed to the wayside it simplydoesn't havemoreover additional data in postmortemhuman samples found that there you woulddetect and find plaques in people'sbrain who who died with no evidence ofcognitive decline they were perfectlyhealthy as sharp and witty as they everwere and yet their brains had moreplaques hammers and died with like myown grandma did and and they would haveno plaxen or very very little plaques inthe brain so we've known for years thatthere's something wrong with thisparadigm and yet it continued to bepropped upand those of us who've been beating thedrum and again i'm not alone saying thatthis is not a plaque disease it is ametabolic disease with significant datato to um support this never having beenrefuted yet that i'm aware of but nopaper has it found contrary evidencefinding that it is not a disease ofmetabolism of the brain in the brainit's not been refuted yet and so thisshould be the theory that should havebeen continued to be propped up in orderfor it to continually be criticized ishould add it's not that it makes itbulletproof that bigger a theory getsthe moreit should be able to be topped uptoppled overthen every brick that's being thrownover thrown at it if it's not knockingit down well then it strengthens itappropriatelyit's a stronger theory now if the brickwe're throwing doesn't knock the towerdown it is become incorporated into thestructure and it's stronger there havebeen that little tower of theplaque-based theory of alzheimer's hasbeen knocked over so many times it justit fit the narrative that they wantedwhoever they were if it was easier todevelop drugsthat would address plaques than it hasbeen to just tell people help your brainbecome more insulin sensitive and giveit some ketones from time to time andvery likely your brain is going to bejust fine you don't need to invoke someenormous conspiracy of people whoconsciously came up with those thingsand deliberately lied about it like ifyoui'm sure as you know the way that thesethings work it's just you know if youand i both get our phd and get similarjobs and similar research centersstudying this kind of issueif i come at it from the perspective ofwell i thinkthere's this obscured little chemical inthe brain that causes alzheimer we needto spend 18 million dollars to study howthis thingumgrows and that's what causes alzheimer'sand we tend to figure out how to get adrug that inhibits this mechanism sotherefore will fix that issue this is ahighly promising line of researchbecause of the way that the drugpatent systemworks which is essentially a form ofgovernment monopoly it makes a lot ofsense to just find some symptom anywhereand find some chemical that can be shownin a trial to reduce those symptoms andit's just this is what modern medicinebecomes because you set up theincentives in a certain way where youhave to demonstrate to one monopolygovernment agencyone mechanism that they choose you knowyou set that as you set these as thegoal posts and so then you have billionsof dollars of pharmaceutical companiesout there shooting for those goal postshiring people specifically to shoot forthose goal posts you know we need toconduct the trial to find the diseaseand find the symptoms and then find thechemical that we can patent and makesure that it's artificial it has to beartificial because if it's notartificial you can't patent it yes ithas to be an artificial chemical thatcan cause some significant effect onthat symptomso because if we do that and we spendabout a billion dollars in 10 yearsputting it through trials and then weget the approval then that's a moneyprinting ticket forever because then alldoctors are required to prescribe it asa standard of care for this conditionand that's just going to mean endlessyachts and vacation homes for everybodyinvolved with our pharmaceutical companysoinstead of having a free market systemwhere ideas and drugs are tested by freeagencies thatpublish their findings you have atop-down system where the governmentjust dictates all right this is thestandard of care everybody needs to takeit everybody needs to follow itand you know as a doctor you could loseyour license if youdon't follow those things on the one andi'm proposing this kind of theory thatwould fit into this pattern that couldlead to that drug eventually which couldmake billions you on the other handyou've come up with the conclusion thathey maybe i i have this novel theorythat if we get people to start eatinglessgarbage we could improve theiralzheimer'sall right well you know you could make agood instagram health influencer accountout of that you couldrun a small business that holds peopleaccountable and helps them and makesmeal planning there are a few smallbusinesses on thatnothing like the drugs that you could uhrun if you you know with my theory youknow my theory that says it's a bunch ofcamera it's a chemical imbalance in thebrain and we just need that yeah andthat's exactly what they did withpsychiatry that other big scam which uhwhich also incidentally is massivelyaffected by insulin resistance but alsonobody mentions it because again it'smuch more profitable no it's a chemicalthing in your brain and we just add alittle pill and yeah and that was allrefuted recently too i mean you'reperfect to point that one out where forso long we'd said it's a serotoninimbalance and then we now this big metaanalysis comes out and says oh wellactually it's not at all and that'snever been supported in the science andit challenges i mean the most commonpsychiatric medication for these sortsof things is these serotonin regulatingdrugs that do nothing to benefit thepersonthat's very true and and and of coursethe mechanism i discussed in the fiatstandard because of the way thatfinancing works is look mistakes happeneverywhere but fiat money and fiatfinancing of sciencemakes it so that mistakes can never getcorrected because once you identify thiskind of mechanism all right it's theit's the chemical imbalance of the brainor it's the platelets that cause thealzheimer's or it'sa saturated fat that is causing theheart disease once you've set themechanism so thatgetting government funding depends onformulating your hypothesisto be congruent with that starting pointonce that becomes theeverybody knows in the field once thatbecomes the thing that everybodymentions in the first page of thatscientific paper as a sort of startingfoundation then that's it then that'snever questioned never testednever researched and just it is the lensthrough which it's all viewed exactlyand then there'sthe only way that you can get called thescientist is if you use that lens if youdon't use that lens you're a crank yepyep you're a hair tick that's right yeahand i've i've been accused of thatmyself for challenging conventionalviews and obesity and diseaseum it it just sort of it's it becomestoo threatening unfortunately yeahyeah and i think uh you know to go bringeverything back to the bitcoin and thispodcast is one big giant advertisementfor why bitcoin fixes everythingis i think again all of it is because ofthe fact that without a free market badideas don't die they just continue toget money printing you need to wait forthe money printer to die for that to getfixed but bitcoin is our way out bitcoinis a way for people tofind fund research that they want as faras a way for scientists to becomefinancially independent so that theydon't know always need all these newextra research grants because theirmoney is constantly inflating i thinkyou know the future michael saylor talksabout this people willendow uh foundations with bitcoin andthen that will be a much more effectiveway to continue to do their researchindependent of the fiat uh monster wellthat has to happen yeah you know it atsome point for for science to continueto thrive in what has been such abedrock of the united states having somany advantages it was the system thatthat encouraged and rewarded academicfree thinking in these efforts to toexperiment and find the best ideas letthe best ideas rise to the top the morewe prop up the worst ideasbecause we have money that's allowing itto be propped up we don't allow them toget filteredit's it's it'suh i mean it's the death of of sciencewhich is which is a very sobering notnotthat sounds almost self-aggrandizingwhere where umthat's it's scientists you know it'sthese philosopher kings and it should bethese deep thinkers who are the leadersnono but but the more we refuse to allowtruth and realityand even it even in the reality ofletting the marketshow what ideas have valueum then the more we're artificiallypropping up bad ideas that lead just toour detriment and destructionabsolutely and one thing i also wantedto ask you about is statins what areyour thoughts on stuff oh my gosh so infact i would encourage what a wonderfulquestioni literally just published a paper withtwo other scientistsum on this topic of the efficacy ofstatins in in with for its traditionaluseum and anyone could just go to um i hateto promote pubmed or google scholar butif you just type in bikman and look forany papers published in 2022 you'll findit i think we paid the extra fee to makeit open access which is something ialways do but it's like six thousandbucks seven thousand bucks for my lab topublish a paper so it's not behind a paywall that's how convinced i am thatthese ideas need to have free access umthat people need to get them anywayi think statins are probably the mostoverprescribed drug and my justificationso everyone knows statins are the mostcommon um drug used for heart diseaseand we base thatits use entirely on someone's ldlcholesterol levels that a physician willsay a clinician will say okay patientyour ldl levels are too high you need togo on a statin to reduce your ldl levelsand while statins are effective atlowering ldlthey are tremendously ineffective atlowering the risk of heart diseaseespecially if a person i mean there'sdifferent scenarios but if a person hasnever had a heart attack but they have ahigh ldlin their prescribed statinit it shows no benefit at preventingthat heart attack if someone has had aheart attack and they're given a statinit appears to be that there's a slightreduction in risk but only in somepeople you have to give a statin to like20 people in order for one to get abenefitso this is my view on statins based onall of the best data that i've seenldl cholesterol doesn't matter at allit's a totally useless marker of heartdisease indeed ldl cholesterol is is apredictor of longevity if you want tolive long we have the baltimorelongitudinal study the honolulu agingstudy the shanghai aging studymultiple studies across the world havefound that the longest lived peoplewho have the lowest risk of dementia thelowest risk of cancer have the highestldl levelsi mean what a bloodyparadox we've we've created by wagingwar on ldl ldl is such an essentialmolecule of life it's relevant forhormone production moving cholesterolaround it's relevant for immunity itliterally can bind pathogens and removethem from the body through the liver tobe cleansed from the blood and so that'swhythe more we wage war on ldl the sickeroverall a person's going to getbutwhat i would say if anyone listening iscurious about stanton's and of coursei'm not giving any medical advice per sejust insightdon't rely on your ldl level you go andpay 70 bucks or whatever and get what'scalled a coronary artery calcium scan acac scan you lay under a little ctscanner it zips around you and itactually measures the calcification inyour carotid arteries on your hearti have to say this because the evidenceis so convincing if someone has a cacscore of i think above 1 000 i think itwas or something like that then itshowed a mortality difference in intaking a statin regardless of ldl ldllevels had nothing to do with it high orlow it didn't matter but if someone hadreally high ldl but they had a cac scorein the low hundredsum i think it was the stat had nobenefit whatsoever and because statinshave such significant consequences likelowering sex hormone production loweringvitamin d damaging the mitochondriamaking your muscles ache and these arereal consequences that people need tobalance every drug has a consequenceit's just is the consequence you wantworth the consequences you don't wantthat's something we always have to askourselves as we put these unnaturalchemicals in our bodybut if someone has a high cac scorethen it appears that there could be alongevity a mortality benefit to astatin but if your ldl is through theroof but your cac score is zero i wouldi wouldn't touch ityeahi i think the statins were the mostprofitable drug in the history of thepharmaceutical industry they may havebeen overtaken recently by anunmentionable which i will not mentionbecause idon't want to get cancelled from uh onsocial media but uhit has been enormously profitable to umenormous focus and focus the on this onelittle metric and take a pill for itrather thanthe very blatantly obvious alternativehypothesis which is that it is theinsulin that you should oh and i shouldi should just add though lest it soundlike i'm giving a tacit umgreat pass to statins they're also thereare so many different types of statinsthat people's genetics will metabolizethe statins differently so even if thiswere me giving advice to my dad for aloved one i would say don't do anythinguntil you've gotten a cac score okaylet's say he had a very very high cacscore lots of calcificationin the carotid arteries then next thingi would do is say get what's called apharmacogenomics test these aretypically 200 bucks or so someinsurances actually pay for it here inthe usbut it is our genes will dictate how werespond to medications and it's verypossible that the person gets on astatin that theymetabolize too rapidly and it doesn't doanything or it has some adverse effectthe third leading cause of death in theunited states is adverse drug events forgoodness sakesthat is the third leading cause of deathit's heart disease cancer and adversedrug events and part of this is becauseyou're prescribed a drug that doesn'tget metabolized well in your body peoplenaturally have different genes that areinvolved in the processes of clearingmolecules particularly in the liverthat's where most drugs get metabolizedand eliminated from the body oncethey've kind of lived their life butsome people either metabolize them tooquickly so it doesn't do any good orthey metabolize them too slowly and thechemicals sticking around muchlonger than it should so there are a lotof caveats when it comes to statins areyou should you be using it based on thevery limited data available at all andthen secondyou need to make sure you metabolize itwell but safe to your point even ifsomeone has known calcification in theirarteries there was a cardiologist by thename of bill william davis he publisheda book on thisand he quantified reversingcalcification in the carotid arteriesstrictly through diet in his patients sotypically they will say once once anatheros once a plaque in the bloodvessel has calcified then it's like astone and it's not going anywhere thatis the prevailing idea to this day wellthis cardiologist bill davis he'spublished reports finding quantifyingthe reduction in calcification inpatients strictly through adopting thedietary changes that we've been talkingabout yeahall right um daniel's got a question foryoudanielle yeah hey guys uh hey benjaminnice to meet you uh brilliant brotherbrilliant thank you yeah it's just beenum really really interestingi gotta represent the bitcoin plebs andask you a bit of uhyou probably see the bro science thatgets thrownaround in the bitcoin uh twitter realmso but well first of all uhit's brilliant that your lab isself-funded do you accept bitcoin so ifanybody listening to safe's pod can sendyou some donationsthat is so i appreciate that so muchum one of the tragedies of being at aprivate institution is i i can't acceptdirect donations everything i do comesthrough the university on what's calleda sponsored research agreementum but you guys i've gotten enoughrequests for this kind of thing that i'mthinking about creating a non-profitumi just don't know how to do that likesomething that could accept donation andthen just pay for the equipment and payfor the students that are doing my workso at the moment i hate to say this butno i don'twell someone listening will have ananswer for you i'm sure someone willhonest to goodness i would i wouldwelcome it enormously because it hasgotten a littlechallenging in that regardthe the bro science questions uh there'sa lot of um chat on bitcoin twitterabout see the oils oh yeah yeah yeahwell no i'm glad you're bringing that upbecause that that was something wedidn't get around to so i my my theoryon what is the worst thing how our diethas changed is that it is now consistsof fake carbohydrates or processed carbsand processed oilsand the processed carbohydrates safe andi've i think really beat that to deathreally well which is this is what'sspiking your insulin and chronicallyelevated insulin drives a resistance toinsulin but on the other hand theprocessed oils like seed oils um theyare also problematic um particularly atthe fat cell and that's relevant becausethat's where i believe insulinresistance begins it is the first dominoto fall if you will and when when theprimary fat the primary fatty acid inseed oils is a fat called linoleic acidand anyone who's been diving into theseed oils already knows that fatlinoleic acid is problematic because asit accumulates in the fat cellit can become it gets metabolizedthrough a process called peroxidationinto a molecule called 4 hne that's ofcourse the abbreviated form of a muchlonger name but for h e as itaccumulates in fat cells it forces fatcells to grow through a process calledhypertrophywhere the fat cell itself is being is isbeing expanded and getting fatter andfatter and fatter that is not how allpeople get fatsome people can get fat through aprocess called hyperplasia and this wassomething peter and i just were chattingvery briefly about when safe went tohelp with this baby um at the verybeginning but if some if a person'sphysiology allows their fat tissue togrow through hyperplasia which is whenthe fat cells stay small but we multiplythemthat is the person who paradoxically canget fat but stay metabolically healthytheir blood pressure is okay they don'thave infertility they don't have insulinthey don't have diabetes their glucoselevels are normal that is the vastminority of peoplemost people get fat through hypertrophywhere the fat cell gets reallyfat if you will and it becomes insulinresistantto try to prevent further growth and itbecomes pro-inflammatory literallycreating molecules that turn oninflammation throughout the body all inan effort to try to increase blood flowthrough all these swollen fat cellsanyway to answer the question and bringit full circle that's what seed oilscontribute to among other things seedoils do morebut what i focus on as a metabolicscientist is what they do to the fatcell and seed oils will forcehypertrophy of the fat cell whichbecomes a very insulin resistantpro-inflammatory fat cell which startshaving that firstdomino tip into the other and promotingthe insulin resistance throughout thebody so while we didn't beat that topicto death i'm thrilled you brought it upbecause there's no question it'srelevant so i consider seed oils to be asecondary cause of insulin resistancebecause directly they're not going to doit on the body they have an insulinresistant effect as it alters the growthof fat cells in a unique way in auniquely harmful wayright yeah do you think that do youthink there's merit to the idea thatyou look at traditional populations alot of them did eat carbohydrates nowobviously it was nowhere near as muchcarbohydrates as we eat nowand not as refined exactly that's rightwhat we eat right now but some peoplepoint to that as saying that the issueis not the carbohydrates the issue is iknow they do i know they do i justand but yeah but i i don't know how theycan say that because they're justthey're creating they're making up thescenario wherebecause as we just noted these same likethe kitavans they would eat a tuberousvegetable but it was roastedand you know or steamed or somethingthey're eating that whole thing andabsolutely their insulin would have comeup and come down the thing that peopledon't want to note in those samekitavans is that they're fasting insulinwas like two micro units per mil afantastically low insulin and my problemagain the reason i focus on the carbsnot to necessarily overlook the seedoils is that it's the refined starchesconsumed so frequently that result inthis never-ending insulin spike and soleading to a steady increase we knowthis in people that their fastinginsulin levels will get higher evenfasting insulin will get higher andhigher and higher the more they'reeating processed carbohydratesto the level that we are so the peoplewho are saying well these traditionalcultures ate tuberous vegetables andthey didn't have seed oils so it's notthe carbs that are the problem clearlyit's the seed oils i say well you'vecreated this false protection around thecarbohydrates when my idea is that itit's what's spiking the insulin too muchand if we were all just eating a boiledpotato once a daysimilar to the kitavans we would have noproblemso the seed oil advocatesi think in some instances have become ithink they've gone too far now theywould say well screw you ben you'reignoring the the seed oil data i'm notin fact i literally do experiments withlinoleic acid in my labi'm justjust thinking we have to make sure we'retalking about the whole story here andif someone only eliminated seed oils butthey continue to eatsugar all day long in the form of gummybears and things there'sthere's no question too much insulincauses insulin resistance that's beenwell documented i would say there's moreevidence there's this isn't i would ican't frame it that way there'sabsolutely more evidence over the pastdecades showing that elevated insulincauses insulin resistance then there isshowing that seed oils cause insulinresistanceso i have to i just can't ignore thatnow i'm not ignoring the data on seedoils and linoleic acid it is absolutelythere and so i give it i want to give itits proper dobut thosewho espouse that idea have gone i thinkthey've gone too farno i i agree with you i think uh youknow the the examples that are mentionedand sometimes they'll say well you knowirish people uh ate a lot of potatoesand during uhand they weren't overweight and i thinkof coursethere is some truth to that if you'renot getting fatuh if you're not getting uh if you'renot eating a lot of dietary fat thenyeah you can get away with morecarbohydrates but also the carbohydratesbefore the 20th century are just acompletely differentthey are completely different yeahthat's right and but but even still mymy main rule that first principle wascontrol carbohydrates don't get themfrom a bags or a bag or a box with abarcode and so whole fruits andvegetables they generally have such amodest insulin effect especiallyvegetablescompared to the tropical fruits likebananas pineapples mangoes but like yousaid safe we've changed those over thepast hundred years apples for examplearound the world apples used to be smalland bitter little thingsand we've bred them to become these bigsugar bombs and so even i mean this ishappening around the world so it becomesan easycritique of the kind of carbohydrateinsulin based view of insulin resistancei find it somewhatgalling just because these umnow we've just been criticizing sciencebut i literally create insulinresistance in cells in my lab across thehallway and and linoleic acid can can dothisbased on its effects on the fat cellum but but elevated insulin does as welland that happens through chronicconsumption of refined starchesyeah and i think in in the fiat standardi cite this book called brightlineeating by an author called susanthompson she does a very interestingcomparisonlooking at sugar and flour in particularshe says uh if you look at what hashappened with sugar and flour in the20th century thanks to industrializationit's very similar to what has happenedwith cocaine and heroinbasically opium andtheleaves are things that had existed amongthe human society for thousands of yearsand you know in peru andbolivia and many of those places it's acommon uh cultural thing thatis particularly if you have work so likea worker who wants to put in uh a wholeday of work and they want energyyou chew some coca leaves you get alittle bit of energy until you use it sothis is what it was and for hundreds andthousands of years this is what it waslike and then you get to the 20thcentury where you get to moderntechnology modern hydrocarbon energyallows us to process things so much moreefficiently and powerfully and cheaplyand then you start taking these cocaleaves you know essentially you wouldtake what it would take the averageworker maybe a week to chew throughand then you process it and you condenseit into a tiny little refined whitesubstance that people can snort veryquickly so you can consume and the sameis true with heroin and opiumumso you because of modern processingyou're able to get it in a highlyhighly palatable form you know you don'thave to spend time chewing in order toget to the uhthe essence of it you get the essencestraight awayand that's what makes it so enormouslyaddictive and destructive and she saysthat's exactly the same thing that hashappened with sugar and flour it used tobe extremely expensive and difficult toprocess sugar and flour and to be ableto consume them it's difficult to growplants that have sugar because they geteaten by um pests and other plants andeven if you do manage to grow them youknow you grow a little bit and thenthere'sthere's a limit to how much sugar youcan get you know you need to chewthrough a lot of apple and swallow a lotof indigestible matter in order to get atiny little bit of a sugar hitbut then the 20th century comes alongand now we've gotwhite sugar being sold for practicallynothing at a supermarket or we have pureapple juice you know where we've removedall the chewable stuff and now it's justpure fructose and and water it's i meanit's it's toxic i mean and i i be wedidn't talk about juice but as a parenti consider that to be one of the greattravesties of what parents areunwittingly doing to their childrenchildren should be drinking nothing butwhole milk and waterno no juice i mean fruit juice is is isa horrific just sugary it's like you'regiving them soda pop no absolutely it'sit's terrible and it's um and i see thisa lot in in like the health influencesor certain circlesobviously there's a lot i i think youknow you want to coloryou want to have a little bit ofskepticism about one kind offinancial interest that exists in thisindustry obviously nowhere near ascorrupt andbankrupt as the you know scientificestablishment butwithin the with you know within the umwithin the bro science circles it's notall the sunshine and rainbows it's notall perfect there is of course theslight bias whereinyou get to be more popular as aninfluencer if you tell people they canconsume more indulge in knowledgeit's human nature to want to be to wantvalidation in a destructive behavior yesand also you know if you tell peoplethat no you can have this sugar and youcan have that treat and you can havethat and you'll be fine obviously it'sgoing to sell better than the you knowthe the party pooper who's just going totell you no you shouldn't have any ofthat stuff and like i okay fine isympathize with peoplepeople are addicted everybody has theiraddictionsumbut like realisticallyyou see how this colors people'sanalysis so something like that like youeliminate seed oils and then carbs stopbeing a problem and so you see a lot ofthis kind ofumpeople who are you know just sugarjunkies and looking to justify theirsugar drinking saying oh just take outthe seed oils and then you can keepeating all the sugar that you wantnoit doesn't work that way no i meanwell i mean obviously you can i'm notyour mom you could do whatever you wantyeah right yeah but don't expect it toyield these great reward returns it's anand it's obviously much better thaneating garbage butrealistically it's not as good as justnot eating any of the sugar at all yepyeah all right peter has a couplequestions tooso if sorry sorry peter before you movegoingone more bro science question safe andit's entirely up to you you'll leavethis into your uh podcast i think i knowyou already know where i'm going whichisuh ben i heard you talk briefly abouttestosterone earlier in the showyeahthere's a big uh movement in uh thebitcoin space where uh the plebs like tosun their ballsuh what you'll takeare you seriousis this a euphemism are you mean likeactuallyyeah absolutely yeah there's evenspecial poses for it but you know mygosh this is a real thingand the the idea behind the bro scienceis that it stimulates uh you know the uhthe testosterone umin your body soi don't know if you've experimented thisin the lab but you knowyeah that'd be hard to get irb approvalfor[Laughter]yes so that's that's what bitcoinresearch is for let's fund it withbitcointhis is what an off site there's no irbin bitcoin if you get the coins you canspend them as you want oh that's how itused to be you guys that's how it usedto be i look at the work of whatscientists did in the field ofstarvation and feeding about 80 yearsago before the era of ayakus and irbsthat limit what you can do oh my goshthey were able to get away with so muchglorious work so anyway danieli i have never seen any paper publishedon this um now to to truly kind of thinkthrough the systemi i can't help but wonderhow that mechanic so i'm thinkingthrough the mechanism and maybe someonewould sayso cholesterol is honestly i i can't ican't fathom what the mechanism would bethe mechanism is that sunshine isobviously great for your skin i mean tryand hide from the sun for six monthsso so sunlightsometimes scientists can overcomplicatethings then well no no i knowbut but but let me just come backyeah so i mean sunlight does convertcholesterol into vitamin d so like i'mthinking what is the process wherebycholesterol which is the basis of allsex hormones all sex hormones come fromcholesterol which is why when you wagewar on cholesterol like through a statinlibido plummets in in men because you'redestroying their sex hormone productionbecause you're getting rid of thebuilding block so if sunlight convertscholesterol to vitamin di'm unaware of any effect where sunlightconverts cholesterol to sex hormones butso i i challenge that a little bit andi'm very familiar with that biochemicalpathway i teach lectures on this topicbut i also think evolutionarily if weneeded sunlight to have our testespromote more vitamin d they'd be on thetop of our head not literally notliterally tucked in the darkest spot onour body if we were walking around nakednow that sounds silly but i hope we canall kind of see that there's some wisdomto that if if if your point counterpointthen yeah if they didn't need sunshinethey would be inside your bodywell no that's temperature but that's agood counter but that's a temperaturephenomenon where sperm if it getsproduced at a higher body temperatureit's it's enact it's dead basically ithas to be a little cooler but but ithink that if if ifif our creation story were such that weneededsun exposure on our gonads on our testesto get enough vitamin d they would be onour back or on our shoulder theywouldn't be tucked in the darkest partof the body so i don't believe that itmakes any difference all right well justto finish up my question then if you domanage to get that funding i think thisis going to be the thing that peoplewant to fund you to look at you knowwhat though you guysif if there is any truth to this and andhonestly it would be very easy to makethese experiments i would say that willgive birth to a little device that has auv lampand you just simply tuck it between yourdrawersthey doyeah almost well no not portable deviceswell that no yeah exactlyregular tanning devicesyeah well that would be the way to do ityou just have a small little device andyou just crook it in your crotch andthen you're producing testosterone likegangbusters but but you guys in allsincerity are there reports of peoplewho have only done this independent ofany other therapy like they didn't golow carb and go carnivore which canincrease testosterone they didn't startworking out more which can also increasetestosteroneare you guys familiar is there anythingthat has removed all the confoundingvariables and said i literally didnothing butit put my sack in the sun and i hadhigher testosterone levels i believe ibelieve the uh respected bitcoin twitterscientific authority that is fartface2000 has conducted such an experimentand fart face 2000 is one of my uhreally paragons of truth and bitcoinokay you're not jokingi'm not joking i've met him i've met himbefore he's uh been to a couple of mydinners guys what have i got what have iwhat what have i gotten involved withwellandhe's a great guy he works in um i forgethis exact job he's he works inconstruction i think he's got us a areally successful job somewhere in newjersey like you're just a hard-workingvery smart guy who's just gotten intobitcoin at some point and he's likechallenging dogma yeah and he'll just ilike anything and follow it and do itand he and he was posting all of hisstuff he's like in his 50s i think andhe was you guys let me let me just saylamp and i think you get great resultswell i'll look them up um but you guysin all one very relevant variable hereas much as we fellas who want to bevirile and strong and tough focus ontestosterone the levels of testosteronein a man can vary widelyand it has no predictive power with hislean mass or his muscle mass what is amore predictive variable is that is theconcentration of testosterone receptorson muscle and bone so it's not just howmuch testosterone you have but how wellit's working where you want it to workand that is something that isvery affected by exercise you go out andexercise and you will increase androgenreceptor levels on muscleyou know almost immediately and it'llstay up so as much as wefocus on testosterone levels and theymatter to some degreea normal group of men will have levelsthat can vary almost by 10 timesand it will have nothing to do with howmuscled or you know ripped and viralthey are so i just that's kind of alittle bit of a counterum to this idea um but it's certainlycompellingyeah i mean this is i'll just add onesmall thing which is like myintuition is to just umfollow the fart faces of the worldrather than worry aboutthe mechanismbecause you know the way that scienceadvances is that people try things andthen they work and then they discoverthe mechanism so yeah yeah but but evenstill even still let's say he's exposinghimself to the suni can't help but sayum well he's just making more vitamin dand vitamin d is immune boosting it ismuscle it was bone mass yeah i guess soyou so you want to control you want to iwould just say there's a confoundingvariable here that that you just can'teliminatethat i think what you would want to dois get the same amount of sun exposurebut only difference being yeah you wouldcover that area between two groups ofpeople shouldn't be too difficult toorganize this voluntarily on twitterwell it sounds like there's a wholegroup of people who are lining up to bevolunteers i never would have imaginedi know i think we should do uhthe control group and uh yeahall right all right well peter's danielthat's awesome dude thanksi was happy to giveso my question was aboutthe reversibility of insulin resistanceso we've talked a lot about all thethings that can cause it in terms oflifestyle but if someone has alreadyentered say the pre-diabetes stageare they able to reverse throughlifestyle changes could they could theyreverse their insulin levels down to saythe levels that you're talking about inthe catalans or are they kind of beyondthe point ofa point of no return at some point yeahoh absolutely absolutely they can turnit around um in fact the reversal ofinsulin resistance by adopting this hasbeen well documentedin in india there are multiple casestudies published on this so i can speakto it with confidence umuh you have people who are so insulinresistant that they're on multiplemedicationslike like insulin taking insulin takingmetformin and other anti-diabetic drugsall you can do is start having themengage in fastingand low carb diet and within just weeksthey have to get off all of theirmedications because they've correctedthe problem so quicklyand so everyone who is either on theearliest stages where they just noticethey're a little chubby and they havehigh blood pressure or they're full ontype 2 diabetic which is like the mostobvious form of insulin resistance goingdown the roadthat can be turned around literally inweeks and and a person can start tolower their insulin in just the same daythat they decide i'm going to fast forthe next 24 hours and just drink waterand have maybe some saltto help my fast be a little easier theirinsulin levels will come down by byseveral um not orders but you know it'llgo half then third and then a quarter ofit it'll come down very very quickly andlike i said within just monthsweeks to months they're as insulinsensitive as a marathon runnerso yes very reversible it is the goodnews the gospel of metabolic research isthat if you use diet to cure the problemthen you've cured it but the food we eatis the culprit or the cure and when weacknowledge the relevance of food as thecause then we acknowledge that it alsocan be the cureokayso just one follow-up question then soin terms of the damage that insulinresistance doesif you're saying that it can be totallyreversed thenhow is the damage done is the damagedone cumulatively over time and thenwhen you get to a certain point you knowyou can't reverse the alzheimer's youcan't reverse the condition generatoryes that what a great questionunfortunately i can't give a universalanswer to that because it would betissue specificum let's take for example the musclewhen muscle becomes insulin resistantinsulin can't defend muscle protein aswell and you start to have a higher rateof what's called catabolism or just thebreakdown of the muscle protein whichincreases what's a situation calledsarcopenia a person who says musclesthat are getting wasted away that's partof insulin resistance you can correctthat the moment the muscle becomesinsulin sensitive then then muscleprotein gets defended and you'vecorrected the muscle wasting and thesame would go with the liver fatty liverdisease is the most common liver problemin in in the world and it uh is largelya result at least partly of chronicallyelevated insulin stimulating fatproduction in the liver well you startto lower the insulin and the fat startsto clear itself out so those are totallyreversiblethe brain appears to be somewhat uniquewhere it's its pathology towardsdementia is suchthat that i cannot say that insulinresistance is the only relevant variablebecause as you start to correct insulinresistance in the body of someone withalzheimer's yes it does improve thealzheimer's but it does not fullyreverse it so that either means there isa point of no return with the insulinresistance that maybe a part of thebrain has starved enough that it's nowdead and cannot be resurrected or itsuggests that there is another variablethat we just haven't identified yetwe know it's not plaques because thatappears to have nothing to do with itbut it does suggest that there's some itcould be a differenceone of the other theories of alzheimer'sor contributors is iron metabolism andit could in fact safe i know you hadum oh what's his namemangum yeah yeah he's a big iron guy forexample so he's a good one i could referpeople to but we know although he does idon't think he talks about iron inalzheimer's but we know that iron canaccumulate and disrupt um the the thewhat's called a redox balance andoxidative stress in the brain so that'san additional inputthat might not get addressed in somepeople and that's that's somewhat of agenetic component as well as you knoweating supplemented foods with ironwhich which so many we all do if itcomes in a bag or a box with a barcodeit's got some kind of iron supplementedinto it rather than the heme iron thatyou get from say beefum but anyway yeah so some problemswhich aren't entirely a result ofinsulin resistance and alzheimer's mightbe that aren't going to be totallyreversible that's maybe the safest wayof saying it who else has got questionsyeah i just thought that um on thetanning and discussion we had previouslyif it if it could be possible that theskin on your body that has not beenexposed to the sun at allmaybe um it can absorb more vitamin dyeah absolutely the darker thecomplexionyeah the harder it is to have the uvlight convert the cholesterol intovitamin d which is why in general thefairer the complexion you know i'm apasty white guy um i would make a lotmore vitamin d say if you have a darkercomplexion than me kind of middleeastern complexion you would need moresunyou know like the vitamin d that i'dmake in five minutes you would needmaybe 20. you know so so andreabsolutely um but that is again aconfounding variable to this study thatwould make it difficult is it are theyfeeling better just because there's moretestosterone but again testosteronelevel is only part of the variable it'stestosterone receptor concentration butyeah it could be that you're making morevitamin d because that's such a fairlycomplected skin by fair i mean likelighter complected that you can justmake more vitamin d with a given unit uhgiven you the exposure per time hithis was a very great conversationuh so my question is also one broscience about sunscreenshall we use itor is it better to go so naturally yeahyeah so i'm uniquely qualified to answerthat question because i sunburn soreadily you know you ask that questionto someone else and they say i neverneed sunscreen and they don't theyliterally don't get burned i burnum now i know a lot of people say justdon't eat seed oils and you won'tsunburn anymore that is just not true umthat is just not true some skincomplexions just burn so i would ratherget a sunburn than put sunscreen on mybodyno question i don't even have to thinkabout it so what i but i don't like toget sunburnedso i will just kind of dose my sunexposure if i'm out at a beach or at apool or whatever with the kids i willabsolutely strip down to my just my myswim shorts and i will get some sun fora good chunk of time then when i feellike i'm reaching a limit i'll put on ashirt and just put on a hat and continueto enjoy the sun i will not putsunscreen on it is so there are so manychemicals in that that get readilyabsorbed into the bloodstream i wouldrather get a sunburn than have sunscreenon my bodynow if you're putting on like a zincoxide kind of but then you look allpasty white and weird you knowbut even still i want some sun exposureespecially on the trunk of my body iwant to make vitamin d i want to set mycircadian rhythms such that my melatoninknows when to be suppressed and it knowswhen to turn onso it there are so many benefits to sunexposure that the more you're blockingthissun effectthe more you're undoing a really healthboost and unfortunately because we liveunder fake light in in buildings all daylong with uv protection on our windowswe never are getting sunlight um so ithink people ought to make a pointeven if you're justifying the sunexposure bysaying that your testes need somesunlight then whatever sunlight is justa good thing but i'm i'm very opposed tosunscreenuh can i just follow up also about thethe sun because there's a lot of attackon the sunso would you comment that sunlightmakes you olderif you are avoiding sun that you willlook younger in the older ageand also if you sunburn more will youhave a higher risk of canceryeah yeah yeah good question um soeverybody know please i'm answeringthese questions with a little bit ofspeculation you know i'm a metabolicmitochondria guy these are topics thati'm familiar with but i'm not anauthority on them but i have enoughfamiliarity to have an opinionum so so with sunumit does appear that the more someone isgetting blistering sunburns the morethey will develop skin canceryeah now getting a little pink no idon't see that there's any there's neverbeen correlation but these are allcorrelational studies which i have agreat deal of disdain forand i'm sure this is a group whoappreciates causal studies compared tocorrelational studies all of this iscorrelational where they just happen tosee people who are getting blisteringsunburns will tend to have more skincancer there are a lot of differenttypes of skin cancerand you can have people with very darkcomplexions who don't get any sunburnsever and yet they can still get skincancers because there's just so manydifferent typesand then dorian what was the otherquestion sunburn and cancer and thenwhat was the the first oneyeah sothe people who are attacking thesunlightthey are sayingyeahyeah no i i i don't know i mean i don'tbuy that really um what i do know isthat the higher someone's glucose levelsare allow me to kind of hijack thatquestion and bring it back to somethingi do know whether sun can cause wrinklesi i don't know i've never seen a studyon thatum but i i do know that high levels ofglucose will create what's called a wecall it a my art reaction that canhappen on the skin you guys know a myyard reaction is what happens when youwhen you char something like when welike safe wants some beef he puts it inhis sous vide machine and then no onewants to eat the meat right out of thesous vide you go sear itin that kind of crisp sear that's what'scalled a mayard reaction and a part ofthat is what's happening it happens lesson the meat but it can happen onvegetables from takingglucose molecules and then convertingthem due to the heat or in this case dueto the sun exposure so when someone isgetting a lot of mild reactions that canin fact cause wrinkled skinand soum i would say it's less sun and itwould be more what are your glucoselevelsthank youyeah i mean my personal experience isthat you will burn if you're not uhexposed to sunlight a lot so if you'vespent the winter innorth americaand you fly to mexico in march and thenspend a week in the sun you will burnand it could get ugly couldcould be very bad but if you graduallyum introduce your sun to sunlight if youmake sure that even during the winteryou get exposed as much sun as you canand then you'reif you don't um up the dose of sunlightonceat once then your body will justgrow into it and i'll be able to handlemore and more sun soum i i could spend hours in the sunlightand i don'tbut again who knows i could be wrong itcould be her hiring me in certain wayssowho knowsall right anybody else have any morequestions we'vegone for well it's been two hours and 15minutes almostbut does anyone have any more questionsben oh yeah i've just got a quick oneben on your take um it's back to theinsulin management uh an old supplementbeen around forever called berberineyepyep and so in fact i did a i hate topush anyone to instagram i i found thati initially was on twitter i alsostarted doing more kind of littlelessons on instagram and i did one aboutberberine just because there's so manythere's so much um curiosity about itberberine absolutely works there'sabundant peer-reviewed umplacebo-controlled double-blindedclinical studies which is the best wecan get assuming that everyone's honestwith itthat absolutely show that berberine doesimprove insulin sensitivity and it doesso by activating this little enzymecalled ampk which the moment ambk isactivated which berberine turns on itwill stimulate glycol uh it'll stimulatesugar burning so lowering sugar bloodsugars lowering insulin overallimproving insulin sensitivity so ifsomeone were to go to their physicianand the physician said ah you havepre-diabetes i want to put you on a drugcalled metforminmetformin actually works through a verysimilar mechanism to berberine i wouldsay not that i'm giving anyone clinicaladvice of course i would say you knowwhat maybe try the berberine firstbecause it yes it will have a moremodest effect than metformin will but italso doesn't have the kind of gutwrenchingside effects that metformin hasliterally gone thank you i i gave upsugar about six months ago which waskind of painful but uh opted to uh starttaking 500 milligrams of berberine andnoticed a dramatic i mean it's you knowwhat good for youi was tricky you know as far as you kindof have this lethargic kind of i don'tknow you described it earlier and asyou're trying to get away from thesugars and just uh just burning yourfats if you will um but now it's justlike normalized and you know if you'regoing to go out and do a heavy like woodcutting day which i do a lot of yeahmaybe i don't think that day yeah youknow what also you should try if you'remonitoring your blood sugars at alleveryone could do this it worksremarkably well add a little bit of rawunfiltered apple cider vinegar into yourclub soda or a cup of waterit's it's remarkable these little it'spart of it's part of the lessonsactually doing thatgood for you and it's it's just alltogether just i just was curious on whatyou're really in depth with a lot ofthis stuff and you know i'm just more orless triangulating i've picked up inother places um yeah i think a bigproponent of david sinclair aging guyhas has reallyguided down that lineyeah so david sinclair is more of abiohacker than i'm comfortable with heloves to promote a certain number ofsupplements he's also from harvard sohe's out there to sell a lot ofstuff well the fact he is he is a bit ofa shill yep yep so i've i've reallystarted to lose respect for him anyonelike him who tells people to take thesedrugs like metformin is a drug he tellspeople to takeand and i think what an asinine piece ofadvice to to suppose that thisforeignman-made substance is somehow going tohelp you live longer when and we know inhumansmetformin works by damaging mitochondriaalbeit slightly but this is whyyou show that people who undergo undergoaerobic exercise which i never do i onlydo resistance training for best bang forthe buck but people who undergo aerobicexercise will have bigger strongermitochondriabut when they take metformin it undoesall of the mitochondrial adaptationsthat exercise it puts you back tobaseline and i don't know how someonecould justify taking a drug that wherewe all say everyone would agree exerciseis a key to living a longer healthierlife oh but also take this drug the factthat it will undo the benefits ofexercise well that's just aninconvenient truth i want to be popularand so if i promote all these cleverbiohacking substances people are goingto adore me for iti think he's just gone too far yeah andalso it's it's all the same climatehysteria nonsense and you shouldn't eatmeat then you should eatyou know this magic little grape that ifyou have three grapes in the morningthen yep yep that's right that's what isaid the thing about super foodseveryone says all these super foods justthis molecule and grapes and no i meanit's so silly it's just so silly tothink that humans evolved to need thesekinds of silly little things when ourancestors would have never eaten grapesthey ate yeah and i mean thevast majority of humans have had zeroexposure to the vast majority of plantsfor all their lives like oh the vastmajority of that's right you see in yoursupermarket were only ever available toyour ancestors we yeah we had to breedthem we had to breed them in a way toreduce the toxins and enhance what canbe digestible and and give us energy wehave in our in our clever technologicalerahave created plants from plants thatwould have been inedible in a previousgenerationthank you so much for all of this thishas been absolutely amazing umi really really enjoyed it thank you somuch thank you so much for all your workthank you for really just focusing theflashlight of truth on the thing thatmatters like just stop eating garbageyou get healthy and then you know letthe fiat people argue about their papersforever and their mechanisms and allthese weird acronyms butum the most important thing people needto know is just don't eat garbage yeahwhile they're while they're strugglinggetting papers peer-reviewed i'll be outsharing truthyeah i'll be out eating steak at sharingthe truth that's rightand thriving basically

obesitydiabetes and dementiahe has he earned his phd inbioenergetics and was a post-doctoralfellow in metabolic disorders at dukenational universityof singapore and he joins us today for adiscussion on the topic of why we getsick which is also the title of hisbest-selling book which has beentranslated towhat is it now 20 i think languages wellno not quite about halfway there yeahbut some relevant ones yesso thank you for joining us benoh my pleasure safety thanks so much toyou and the team for getting me on it'sit's it's great to be chatting to you ithink uh your perspective on um diseasein your book is is a very interestingand very refreshing one and it's um whati like about it is that it gets to theheart of the matter in a very practicalway in a sense of you know how can youactually not get sickrather than getting lost in academicdebates and academic pissing contestswhich canbe too often the case in academia soit's good to keep your eye on the prizeon what matters and i think this is thisis what your book doesso let's get right to it why do we getsickyeah yeah thanks again i actually likethe way you framed this because we bothyou and i i think uh share a commondisdain foracademia and it's ironic a little maybefor me i don't mean for it to soundungrateful because i am a professorat a university currently andi amso mindful of the nonsense that happensat universities and so it was very muchan interest of mine to takethe knowledge that we scientists aregainingand go break through the barrier ofyou know the traditional model for uswould be that we publish a paper in apeer-reviewed journal and no one everreads it except a handful of otherscientists and it and thus is largelyirrelevant to actually improvingsomeone's life i really wanted tocircumvent that futile cycle of academiaand take relevant information right topeople so the question why do we getsick you know i naturally was looking atthisquestion through my lens and i mytraining is in kind of metabolicbiochemistry and physiologyand i couldn't help butsee there wasone common foundationto virtually every non-communicablechronic disease so the chronic diseasesthat you getwith that have nothing to do with youknow infectionand you know this is like cancers andheart disease alzheimer's diseasediabetes kidney disease etcandof course each of these problems haveunique inputsi want i would want everyone to knowthat that each of these problems do haveunique origins but they all haveone common origin and that is insulinresistance it is this disorder thatpeoplei mean the reason i didn't call my bookwhat is insulin resistance is why doesit matter is because i knew no one wouldbuy it they would look at the title andthey would say well i'm not a diabetic idon't need to read that they just seeinsulin and they think diabetes butinsulin is an absolute life-givinghormone it is essential you have to haveit and which and if you don't likeuntreated type 1 diabetes you will diein short order so this is an essentialhormone that literally impactsevery cell of the bodythere's no exception to this i don't usethe term literally too liberally likethe kids do these days there's it is itliterally affects every cell in the bodyand it dictates the theme of whatinsulin does is it tells the cell whatto do with the energy that it hasso whatever the the nutrient or thecaloric energy isthat's in the system that's coming inthe system or it's already storedinsulin will tell the cell what to dowith it and thus it's pretty essentialevery cell needs energy neverthelessinsulin resistance is a disorder todefine it now explicitly it's really acoin with two sides or a disorder withtwo facets that must come together youcannot have one side of the coin withoutthe other the first part of thisdefinition of what insulin resistance isis that insulin as a hormone isn'tworking as well as it used to thatevokes the kind of resistance part of itthat some cells aren't responding verywell but then the second part of it isvery often overlooked but equallyessential to understand why it's sopathogenic why insulin resistance issuch a problem and that is that insulinlevels are chronically elevateda condition called hyperinsulinemia soyou have the two of these togetherinsulin isn't working correctly andblood insulin levels are elevated andboth of those together constitute thethe background for so many of thesechronic disorders or diseases you knowfor exampleand then i can finish the answer becausei'm getting long-winded but let's takethe two most common forms of infertilityin women the most common form ofinfertility is a disorder calledpolycystic ovary syndrome pcosand this is a disorder of too muchinsulin and that is why if a woman haspcosshe absolutely has insulin resistanceand but not because the insulin isn'tworking well but because it's too highand when insulin levels get too high ina woman it actually inhibits the ovariesability to create normal balances of sexhormones she can't make estrogens aswell as she could before and she failsto ovulate and now she has polycysticovary syndrome but in a manthe most common infertility is erectiledysfunctionand that's a problem of the insulin notworking well not the elevated insulinper se but again you still have both ofthose things always happening togetherbut in his case for normal erectilefunction you have to have a significantvasodilation or the blood vessels haveto dilate and alter blood flowaccordingly but when the blood vesselsbecome resistant to insulin effectsinsulin which normally is providing thatdilation effect can'tinduce dilation as well and the bloodvessels stay constricted and theconstricted blood vessels means erectiledysfunction so that's such a it's aninterestingdichotomy looking at the two forms ofinfertility in women and men where eachof them is caused by a different aspectof insulin resistance yeah and it's justsomething that continues to come up withall kinds of medical conditions isastonishing even as a non-doctori would say probably especially as anon-doctorit just keeps coming upyou know you you hear about a certaincondition or you know somebody who getssick in something because with somethingand you read more about it you hear themtalk about itandthis always comes up you know there'salways thismention of sugar blood blood sugarlevels insulin levels insulin resistanceit's implicated in so many things what ifind fascinating and you know i i'd liketo kind of uh switch back and forthbetween the academic topic itselfand the way that academics study itbecause that's another focus of my workwhich i discussed in the fiat standardof um just how academia isessentially massively compromised and agiantattack on your ability to understand theworld and reason properly it's not justthat they're doing um innocuous nonsensethat nobody cares about it's thatthey're actively preventing people fromunderstanding what the problem isbecauseyou knoweven as a non-specialist you see thisthing come up everywhere and then if youdo one day in your life try and say heylet me just take a look at this let mesee if i can bring my blood sugars downfor a while and see what i can do andsee what effect it has on me and thenall these different kinds of healthproblems that you thought were just thenormal part of growing up disappear andyou're back to being healthy andpowerful and strong in many waysand so you would imagine you know theyyou'd imagine doctors would be out thereshouting this from the rooftops tellingeverybody to hey you know focus on thislittle thing called insulin your bloodsugar try and keep that downif you are overweight if you're diabeticif you have all these um problemsdementiayou likely benefit from this and yetinstead what we see isjust like with economics we see thesenerds that parrot out complicated wordsthat obfuscate thingsand then ultimately lead to youcontinuing to eat the garbage confusedand not knowing what's going on and ithink the really sad thing is you knowhow many people will umin academia i mean if you if you look atdebates online you know you have allthesegreat instagram and twitter uh socialmedia fitness influencers who've beenout there training clients for years andknow what works and know what doesn'twork and know that you know if you'reoverweight and you want to get in shapelay off the junk do this do that andthey know what works and they're outthere arguing with these overweightusually uh university professors who areout there telling them noyou guys are not authorities you don'tunderstand you're focusing on bloodsugar that's been debunked here's someobscure paper from pubmedabout how actually it's not blood sugarthat matters it's all these othergenetic slash they'll say it's saturatedfat yeahyeah or some other thing or the otherbut you know just whatever you do justmake sure you don't try to cut down onyour sugar intake and you don't lower itlower your insulin levels butthe evidence for it i mean everybody whotries it basically i don't know anybodywho's tried reducing their blood sugarlevels and their insulin levelsand reducing the level of informationthat they've done and have and anddidn't feel better from it and yetacademia continues toignore thisyeah yeah so why do you think this isthe caseyeah well i think there's there'scompeting interests without a doubtum and i very much appreciate theaudience that i have here which isif i may define this group in such a wayat least one attribute would be a heartyskepticismand that's one that i share indeed allscientists by their very nature shouldshare that skepticism the job of ascientist is to try to prove a theoryfalse and now we have thisthis this flipping of science into areligion where people are proud to justproclaim i believe in science and as ascientist i think that is a terriblyunscientific way to view scienceif you're a scientist everyone shouldthink like a scientist in a way if i maysay it like that without sounding smugwhich is we should all be trying tounderstand truth by challenging what wethink we know and now it is just wellthis person said something i like and soi believe in science oh but you're ascientist who's saying somethingdifferent well you're going to beostracized and removed from politesociety but you you brought up a lot ofrelevant points that i just have toelaborate on brieflypart of the problem with conventionalkind of biomedical care or clinical careis that we havewe have based an enormous amount of ourview of metabolic health purely on bloodglucoseand i'm not saying blood glucose doesn'tmatterbut the problem with that view thisglucocentric view of metabolic health isthat we have overlooked insulincompletely and i've given talks toclinicians you know physicians andnurses and physician assistants and iwill saywe are too obsessed with glucose we needto look at insulin and it becomes almosta circular discussion where they willsay we don't need to look at insulinbecause we're measuring glucose and it'skind of the same and i have to teachthem that they're not the same that youcan have someone who's coming in everyyear for their annual checkup and theglucose levels are staying normalstaying normal but what's happeningbehind the scenes is insulin is goinghigher and higher and higher in order totry to keep the blood sugar in checkand that is this exact paradigm ofnormal glucose levels but elevatedinsulin several times higher than whatit should be is insulin resistance andthen it's only once the body has becomeso resistant to insulinone ofwhose jobs it is is to help lowerglucose that the glucose levels start toclimb and now it gets on the clinicalradar but but the problem doesn't endthere so the first problem is by failingto look at insulin we failed to detectthe problem as soon as we could detectit but the next problem is just as badwhich is our obsession with loweringglucose the moment the glucose doesstart to climba conventional clinician conventionalthinking scientist and clinician will beto say let's just give you insulin andlike in a person who's insulin resistantthey'll say let's just push the insulinup and yeah that will lower the glucosebut the more we knowthis is amply published review data forwhatever that's worth because we all gotto be skeptical even of published datanowadays but we know that the more youpush insulin up in an insulin resistanttype 2 diabetic in order to control theglucose they may have normal or idealglucose levels and yet we're killingthem they're three times more likely todie from heart disease and twice aslikely to die from alzheimer's diseaseand cancer so we are killing when wegive an insulin resistant type 2diabetic more insulin it's like we'regiving an alcoholic another glass ofwine hoping it will solve the problemwhen in reality we're giving them moreof the very thing that's causing theproblem too much insulin is a primarydriver of insulin resistance so why onearth would we give them more insulin totry to correct the glucose we make surein so doing that the person gets fatterand sicker and they die fasterbutso much of the problem is that theclinicianespecially if these are in the u.s likemedicare patients it just extends ithink the nhs and the uk has the samekind of target canada i know does andsafe i very much appreciated yourcriticism on social media of canadianhealthcare i was born and raised incanada and me and all of my nine myeight siblings all nine of us got out ofcanada as quickly as we couldum because of in part the ridiculoushealth care but nevertheless um wethe the the clinical model is based onthe clinician will have targets withtheir patient and it will say you needto lower their glucose by you know onepercent of hemoglobin a1c or lower theirglucose by 20 points to try to get itinto a normal range and if they don't doit the clinician gets punishedthey do get docked on the amount ofmoney they can bill for that patient'svisits and so the clinician has thisperverse incentive to say well i justneed to push up your insulin any way ican and and if it's making you fatterand sicker and putting you on more drugsat least it's lowered your glucose andthat's one of the clinical markers i'mgoing to get graded on but at the end ofit all underlying all of thisin my kind of concluding thought forthis rant is that while we're givingpeople all these clever expensive drugsto try to lower their glucose levels theone little rational person on the sidei'm one of them and i get ostracized forit i've been criticized and i've beenthreatened with my position here whereyou will just say you're giving thepatient all these drugs to lower theirglucose why not just have them eat lessglucoseand oh no no no you can't you can't saythat you're accused of heresytruly i've been accused of teachingprinciples that are against science eventhough i strictly rely on publishedhuman clinical trials to defend my viewsand yet it's just too heretical are yousuggesting that people can live withoutdoritos and pringles every day i meanwhat kind of insaneinsane insane cruel doctor are you iknow do you have no regard for humanneeds like how could people yeah i knowhow could people not eat twinkies everyday like how can you not make that thecenter of your world view and this thisis this is what it really comes down tobecause i mean you you keep as youexplain i mean it's just insane that youwould want to raise their insulin levelsrather than reduce the sugar levels ithink one metaphor that i've come upwith to try and explain this to peopleis that it's the equivalent of you havea dirty apartment and you're trying toget somebody to clean up your apartmentand you keep hiring people to clean upthe apartmentand you're getting you're somehowignoring the fact that every day um yourson say comes into the apartment andtakes a big giant jug of pepsi and justturns it inspills it in the middle of the room andthen the cleaning person has to spendall their time just cleaning that up andthen everything else in the house fallsapart and gets dirty because every daywe have this giant mass ofsludgy sugaronthe everywhere that needs to be cleanedout and soif you think the answer is hiring morecleaning peopleyou're not going to make it becausethere's no limit to how muchyou can spill on umin a house like it takes one second tospill uh an amount of liquid sludgethat's going to take three hours toclean you know yeah it just goeseverywhere that it requires a lot ofcleaning soit's insane that medicine takes the pathof just hire more cleaning staffanddon't worry about the cause of thethe disintegration and that's yeah yeahyeah the paradigm ought to be let's putlet's um bring less garbage inand see what that doesrather than continuing to bring more andmore garbage in and hiring more and morecleaners to try to keep up for it let'sjust start putting less garbage in theapartment this is this is the amazingthing and this is this is the thing thatnone of the this is it's exactly likewith economics like with with theeconomists there there's just nevergoing to be a mainstream economist whohas a phd at an important university andat the fed or any of that stuff who'sgoing to come out and say you know whatmaybe we should just try hard money weshould try not inflating we should trynot doing all of that stuff no here'show my magic formula for managing themoney supply is actually going to umallow us to magically havegovernment spending at no cost here'show i am going to defy the rules ofphysics anduh nature and allow us to eat our seedcorn and still plant the same seed cointhat we eat this is essentially how itworks in politics and economics and it'skind of what works in nutrition it'sjustthe mentality of indulgence no we can'tsacrifice the sugary treats and we mustfind a way tomanage it it's it's like you know how dohow do wefix laptops that um get destroyed byhammers by their ownersi meanthere's just never going to be asuccessful science of fixing laptopsdestroyed by hammers because the hammerscan always destroy a laptop beyondbeing able to fix it the best method isjust not destroy it yeah yeah no it's ait's absolutely i believe there aresufficient competing interests that thatwe we are able to prop up so manyeconomies or that might not be the wordto use in an audience like this we wereable to prop up so many entities bytelling people to eat whatever you wantand then we have drugs and health carethat will help you deal with theconsequences and it's just a way ofspending more money on things that wecould go back to that first principle ofum eat better well all right but thensome okay but then the drug companiesaren't going to be able to sell as muchdrugs well then the hospitals aren'tgoing to be able to have as many sickpatients and so we have these sick basedeconomies that will sufferwell of course we shouldn't care aboutthat we want to be live long and healthybut there are all these competinginterests that i mean you there was justrecently a report published by thenutrition center at harvard university imean and this deserves all of ourdisdain and again it makes me ashamedof academia and my fellowquote unquote scientists where theyrankedmini wheats cereal higher than eggs andsteakon on the scale of nutritionin other words mini wheats was better bya wide margin they said that frostedmini wheats the cereal is better forsomeone than eggs and better for someonethan steak i i don't know on what planetthat could be stated other than theirsufficient competing interest like takefor example the american dieteticsassociation which you knowpromotes a lot of these things look atwho funds themit is not the american ranchersassociation they wish they could fundthem but the american dieteticsassociation is so opposed to animalbased products much to the detriment ofevery human on the planetbut it's it's justwho's paying the bills i mean it's avery cynical view and and it requiresit's not been comfortable for mebecause it has made it difficult for meto stay in good standing with sayexample the american diabetesassociationwherethe the conventional advice even to atype 2 diabetic who has plenty ofinsulin in their body it is literallyeat whatever you want but cover it withyour insulin just give yourself moreinsulin yeah it's a wonderful way tosell insulin it's a wonderful way tomake sure these patients are going tothe hospital very very often becausethey're very very sickwe could just say you know eat a littlebetter by that we mean eat less glucoseif you're insulin resistant that as mostpeople are worldwide this is not anamerican unique to the west this is avery much a problem in southeast asiait's very much a problem in the middleeast the most diabetic countries on theplanet are in the middle east numbersone through nine and this is this is aglobal situation we just have to tellthe peopleeat less processed sugars and processedgrains if that is just the simplest stepum that's number one for me that isfirst principle number one controlcarbohydratesbecause it's refined carbohydrates thatare going to spike insulin the most andkeep it elevated and the sooner we lowerinsulin the sooner all these metabolicissues including alzheimer's diseaseincluding certain cancers start to getbetteryeah and if you've uh you know if youhave an internet connection and you'reeven marginally curious about the topicof you know how not to be fat how not tobe sick how not to be diabeticand you just search the internet with alittle bit of an open mind you won't beable to miss the fact that there areliterally millions of people around theworld who have improved their healthhealth immeasurablyby cutting down on eating processedfoods sugary foodfoods that are high in glucose and youknow there arethousands of different ways you can doit thousands of different diets somepeople call it low carb high fat somepeople do low carb low fat some peopledo keto some people do or paleo but allof these things they have one thing incommon youget far fewer glucose spikes and hencefar fewer insulin spikes and whicheverway you take to do that you know mypersonal way to do that is just i eatonly red meat and i drink only water andit's perfect because oh that's adynamite i mean really safe it's sofunny to me everyone raves these daysabout oh eat this berry it's a superfoodor this this this kale green it's asuperfoodand it's so silly to me it is so sillybecause if you want to talk to me iwould say a superfood is a food thatliterally gives you every nutrient youneed in order to survive well that isany ruminant meat so beef exactly ifsomeone eats beef or really any ruminantanimal they're going to literally getevery nutrient they need to survive andthat is why like you mentioned a humancan literally eat nothing but beefand and survive and thrive and thrivethat's right not just survive they willthrive the strongest leanest healthiestpeople i know are the people who arejust pure carnivoreyeah absolutely and i i've tried itmyself i started doing it i think uh bythe end of this month it'll be sevenyearsand it's really been seven years andthere's no going back like once you'vetried being free man uh yeah once you'vetried being superman you never want toeat kryptonite again that's right wellsaid always want to be supermanand uh but i mean i understand you knownot everybody wants to go this far butstill if you're going to um want to makea difference in your health you have toreduce the amount of incident spikesthat you get and it's such a simple ideaand it's so easy there are so manylow-hanging fruits that you could takeout of your diet i mean i remember wheni first became curious about this i meanit's just simply being aware about noteating the bread before the lunch thatthey put there at the restaurantreducing the amount of bread in thesandwichcutting outthe excess soda that i was drinking justdrinking a little bit of soda i meanjust these low hanging fruits that nowsound completely uh undesirable to mebut just these tiny little changes thatweren't even a big issue immediatelymade a huge difference in my head yeahyeah and everybody i know who's donethis has um has witnessed this now forme i just kept on removing more thingsand just feeling better and better andbetter and i i've continued to go on buti i see it with so many people that it'sit's amazing for me that so many peopledon't notice just this think from thisperspective of just pick the low-hangingfruitand that's a far better use of your timethan arguing with academics oh my goshyeah on twitter i mean this is this isthe thing why i mean i honestlythere is absolutely nothing you willeverthat you could ever show me that iswritten in pubmed that will matter to memore than what i know from what my mybody feels yeah you're in becausei look yeah yeah my n of one which is memy own body i've tried because this isthe thing the scientific thing you knowpeople talk about science science theythink science is you know you just goand read on pubmed what some[Music]um procter gamble sponsored uh scientisthad to write in order to keep his joband you think that that's science nothat's not science that's appealed toauthority as the exact opposite ofscience science is experimentation soactually try and remove this from yourfood see how you feel look at your bloodsugar levels look at your insulin levelslook at all these health problems thatyou have you know you'll be able to tellif they're improving or they're gettingworse that there's no escaping it's yourbody you'll be able to tell and mostpeople just completely ignore that andwon't want to look at it and this isthis is why i you know the term fiatscience is accurate in many ways it'snot just that it's financed by fiat butit's also that it intends to enforcethis fiat scientific reality by fiat youknow that it by rule it's not just byfiat money it's also by government rulelike this no your body can handle a dietconsisting of twinkies and doritos andthere's nothing wrong with it becausehere's a bunch of garbage in pubmed thatproves it because it's fine they wouldthey would go further they would go forthey would literally say you're betterfor it eat these sugary cereals and itis better for you not only you canhandle it they will they will literallyrank it and give it a green goodscorei mean all it does is encourageindulgence promoting sicknesspromoting propping up industries andentities that have no business survivingand truly the truly criminal thing aboutit is not just that you're promotingsomething you're promoting somethingthat's highly addictive that's designedto be highly addictive it's designed byfood scientists have spent decadesfiguring out the exact best combinationsto trigger the reward centers in yourbrain to make you a slaveto that oreo cookie or to that snickersbar whatever it is these people haveknow what they're doing so there's thenotion you know that harvard is popularpopularized this idea that everything isgood in moderationis is is extremely pernicious it'sextremely delicious i agreei i i rail against that view the themoderation in all things is a popular umdietitian's bannering like rallying cryand all it does all that is is ajustification for indulgence and ittotally ignores the fact that mostpeople can't moderatei i i have to moderate highly addictivewell that's my pointand so there was this beautiful quote bysaint augustine who saidabstinence is easier than perfectmoderation and so they would say we'lljust have one small bowl i kind of comeback to cereal like many wheat becausethat's kind of my addiction that i'maware of like they will say just eat onelittle bowl of cerealand and sure if you could only eat onelittle bowl of cereal a half cup orwhatever the serving size is all rightyou know you could get away with thatfor a long time but you don't you neverstop there and so it is easier for theperson to look at that ice cream or thatbread or whatever and just sayi know that once i start eating it iwon't stop until i've eaten half theloaf or i won't stop until i've eatenthat whole pint of ice cream and so i'mjust not going to startso moderation in all things ignoreshuman tendency as most people do toengage in addictive self-destructivebehaviors especially with foods that areliterally as you said designed to beaddictive and they always consist ofrefined starches and sugars safe nobodynobody is sitting around on a fridaynightthe kids are in bed the house is cleanthey turn on a show with their withtheir significant otherand they they say oh man i sure coulduse a plate of scrambled eggsno oneis sitting there craving scrambled eggswhat they crave is something sweet andgooey or salty and crunchy it's going tobe a refined carbohydrate that is why myrule number one control carbs and theeasiest way to do that is if it comes ina bag or a box with a barcodeavoid it don't even open it it's notgoing to work if it's going to be ifyou're going to have a carbohydrate keepit in as unadulterated form as possiblea whole fruit or a whole vegetable butthen don't just thinkwhat i would worry is that in thisconversation so far people are onlyhearing this kind of denial denial avoidthis avoid this avoid this but in orderfor it to be sustaining you need toreplace it so replace it with proteinand fat which have little to no insulineffect those are for me rules number twoand three one control carbs twoprioritize protein from animal sourcesand three don't fear fat everyevery animal protein on the planet whichare the best proteins for humans to eatwell every organism to eat um they canevery animal protein comes with fatthere is literally no exception to thatdon't be afraid of the fat that comeswith that protein you will digest itbetter you will digest the proteinbetter and it will help blunt theinsulin the even modest insulin responseto the protein steak the best protein ithas fat eggs egg whites the best proteinthat has the yolk there's no exceptionso protein and fat come together that'show we should eat it don't try to avoidall that fat it is nutritious it is infact essentialwe need to have it but those are thethree rules of an insulin controllinglife-promoting dietyeah i'll uh my personal uh advice thati give to people who uh do this andagain i'm of course i'm not a doctor besure to check with your obese doctoryeah neither of us are giving a clinicaladvice here but we would give it betterthan[Laughter]yeah but i mean what i tell people isthe best way to avoid carbohydrates isyou don't want to fight a defensive warwhere you're hungry and you're trying torestrict yourself that doesn't workthat's right i mean it can work but itrequires an enormous amount of willpoweryep butyou don't have to do that that's reallypunishing yourself that's that's likeyou know you're you you're playing asoccer game blindfold if you're tryingto do it with the uh with that there'sno reason to do that to yourself thebest way to do it is to fill yourself upwith protein and fatfirst thing in the morning every daythink of that as almost like your jobyou know you wake up and the first thingyou dois youfocus on getting at least a pound offattyred meat in youand thenyou've already won 90 of the battleagainst these carbohydrates because thecravings are going to be very differentif you had a pound of beef and you see apint of ice cream it's very different ifyou've had a pound of beef and youhaven't had a pound of beef it'scompletely different so i sayi personally don't usually havebreakfast i only have two meals a dayyep yeah but i think in the transitionperiod if you're used to eating sugaryfood and you want to cut down on sugar iwould recommend starting the day withfatty meat and justfilling up on it and then that that'sgoing to reduce you know without youeven putting in any effort you're justgoing to end up eating less sugar thanusually i have 100 i i agree with thisperspective completely and indeed save iwould say there is significant humanevidence to to defend this so as much asialso criticize the published body ofliterature the tragedy is there are allof these valid gems that have beenpublished and just completely overlookedbecause it doesn't fit the popular iwould that fiat narrative which is wehave to promote something in order togenerate these this kind of artificialwealth through drug companies and inmedicine but if if a person can followthe adage of breakfast like a king lunchlike a prince and dinner or supper likea popper this idea of this kind ofscaling down throughout the day if youcan so i also don't eat breakfast so iwill eat a big hearty filling lunch ieat lunch and i am and it's it's fat andprotein almost exclusively and then wheni go home several hours later to havedinner with my family which issacrosanct for me i will have dinnerwith i want to have dinner with myfamilyand then i will eat a very modest dinnerand then i'm still because i'm stillkind of full from lunch and then in theevening no snacking no snack once aperson has had dinner stop eatingyou do not want to go to bed on a fullstomach and you do not want to go to bedhaving just spiked your insulin andglucose that is in my view the primaryreason why people sleep poorly if you goto bed with spiked glucose you will havean activation of your heart rateyour heart will be beating faster andharder and your body temperature will behigher and you'll be thinking i can'tsleep because i have such anxiety no youthat that's an artificial anxietyactivated by your nervous system inresponse to what you just didmetabolically but tragically that iswhen most people indulge the most it'sin the evening that's when they eat allof these sugar insulin spiking foodsit's the literally the worst time to beeating it so i agree wholeheartedly eatthe bulk of your calories in the earlierpart of the day so you can taper off asyou go into the afternoon and eveningyeah and generally you knowit's it's a great rule to not snack ithink of it this way if you have thedesire to snack less than 12 hoursafter your last meal your last meal didnot contain enough red meat well saidthat's a good ruleyeah that this is this is how you knowhave i eaten enough red meat likethere's no magic number of pounds ofbeef that you need to eat every day thatapplies for every person it depends onyou your body your size the amount ofeffort that you put in and every daybut a good rule of thumb is you shoulddefinitely not be craving anything inthe in the next 12 hours if you ateenough then the next 12 hours fooddoesn't even cross your mind this thisis the right way to go about it andinitially it's going to be moredifficult because you're still a sugaraddict and there's an adjustment but theeasiest way to handle that adjustment isto justdouse it with fatty beans no no in facti to speak on that point of adjustingthe the body is an energetic hybridum where at any moment the body has twoprimary metabolic fuels that it'srelying on which is blood sugar or orfat those are the two fuels at anymoment the body is primarily sugarburning or it's primarily fat burningand that is entirely 100 percentdictated by insulin when insulin iselevated it shifts the metabolic engineto sugar burning when insulins down themetabolic engine if you will shifts tofat burning the more a person is stuckin sugar burning the harder it's goingto be to fast and not snack because thebody has a very finite amount of sugarstored in it and so if we're alwaysburning that sugar that's an engine thatwe need to be topping up that that's atank a fuel tank that the person wouldneed to feel like they have to top upfrequentlybut if they can kind of get through thisinitial adjustment stage as you notedthen insulin starts to come down thenthe body starts to shift and rely on theother fuel tank namely fats and even alean person has well over a hundredthousand calories stored on them as fatit's like we have all of these energybars and energy drinks strapped onto ourbodies that we just can't use becausewe're constantly filling up that littleum tank so it's almost like let me usethe analogy of a big fuel tanker like abig semi truck with a big tank of fuelthat it's hauling on the backand then every four or five hours thistruck or you know six hours it needs tostop and fill upand it's filling it needs to fill upbecause it's relying on this smalllittle tank under the engine in the cabof the of the truck and yet the irony isso much of its effort is hauling aroundall of this other fuel that's strappedto the back of this big fuel tanker andimagine if thisengine was such that it could take thefuel lines from the engine and starttapping into all of the calories all theenergy that it's hauling around butisn't using well then that trunk thattruck could go for daysthe analogy then comparing it to thehuman body is that we have these two twoenergy stores we have about 2 000calories stored as sugar and maybe 200000 calories stored as fat and we keepusing just that sugar using it upfilling it up using it up filling it upand any excess that we fill into thattank spills into this other tank of fatthat we're never tapping into becausewe're constantly filling that sugar tankso the moment we let thesugar tank run dry and it'll be a littleuncomfortable there is that adjustmentbut give it a couple days insulin willhave come down we've basicallyre-plumbed the fuel lines to have thatengine tapping in the metabolic enginetapping into stored fat and now when wego on a hike you know it's here in themountains of the mountain west in utahmy family we go on hikes all the timeand we i will see very overweight peopleand they will have this little theselittle kind of fanny packs of energybars and you have my family we're alllean and fit and strong and healthy wedon't have nothing but waterit's because we have any enough fuel onour bodies we're all lean but we stillhave enough fuel that we could go run 50miles 100 miles and not run out of fuelif we were so inclined and these peoplecan't even hike five miles they start toget hangry and uncomfortable it'sbecause they're stuck in sugar burningmode and the more you eat sugar the moreyou're dependent on it and so you justhave to break that you have to just sayi'm not going to get mycarbs from bags and boxes with barcodesand i'm just going to focus on fats andproteins it'll be a little bituncomfortable give it a few days andit'll be right as rain and that personwill have shifted to becoming a fatburneryeah this is this is really uh it'salmost likerunningtwo different kinds of uh operatingsystems in the human body you knowthere'sit's like there's windows and mac andlinux there's fat burners and sugarburners and i i've tried being a fatburner and i've tried being a sugarburnerand if you've not tried both i thinki mean you know people like toexperiment with all kinds of thingspeople like to enjoy all kinds ofexperiences like watching tv shows andtraveling to places and consuming allkinds of thingsi think you might want to considerthis kind of experience you know trywhat it would be like to be a fat burnerwell saidjustyou know ever wonder what you would looklike if you could put on a superman suityeah that's kind of what it is well andthere's another perk in addition to umthe ability to not be so dependent oneating every two hours when a person isin a state of fat burning that gets tothe order of about 16 to 20 hours it'sthat acuteif insulin is low the body startsburning so much fat that but with lowinsulin it can't stop and so it's burnedenough fat that it's met its energeticdemand every cell is properly fueled butbecause insulin is low it can't stopburning fatand so you start burning more fat thanyou literally need to meet yourenergetic needs and that excess of fatburning turns into these moleculescalled ketones and everyone's heard ofketones or keto and unfortunately it's afour-letter word it's disparaged it'sreviled it's just because it's somisunderstood but ketones speaking offeeling betterwe have just we just published a paperlast year looking at humans we hadpost-mortem brain samplesof the um of the hippocampus which isthe kind of memory learning centerthat's the part of the brain that getscompromised with alzheimer's disease andin these post-mortem samples we lookedat the metabolic genes related toglucose burning and ketone burningbecause the brainrelies on those two fuels the brain doesnot burn fat it uses fat for structuredoesn't burn fat for fuel unlike therest of the body the burn the brain willburn sugar like glucose or ketonesbut what we found in alzheimer's diseaseis that the sugar burning becomescompromisedit can't burn sugar as well because it'sbecome insulin resistant and but it hasa perfect ability to burn ketones andthis is reflected in human case studiescase reports where you have someone withfull-blown alzheimer's disease eitherput them into a ketogenic diet or givethem a ketone drink to boost up theirketones and in real time you detectimprovements in cognition you've notcured the disease it's not that dramaticunfortunately it is irreversible to adegree but whereas someone was so hadsuch dementia that they couldn't getthemselves dressed now they canthey had such dementia that theycouldn't draw the face of an analogclock and now they can i mean these aretrue improvements that you see all byshifting the fuel but the tragic in thetragedy of the average individual isthat with alzheimer's disease especiallywhich is something we're all afraid ofto some degree or another because it'ssuch a horrifying disorder to be trappedwithin your own brainbut we look at the progression of thisdisease and insulin resistanceis more is has a higher statisticallysignificant correlation to alzheimer'sthan age does even and this is howpowerfully predictive insulin resistanceis but as the brain becomesprogressively insulin resistantyou have two tragedies that occurconcurrently one the insulin resistanceof the brain means that it can't get asmuch glucose and so the brain starts togo hungry ironically the body isswimming in a sea of glucose and yet thebrain just can't get it but then secondbecause the person is insulin resistantthey have high insulin levels and highinsulin levels inhibit any production ofketones because it shuts off fat burningand so the brain is starving for a lackof glucose and it's crying out forketones that the body simply will notgive it because the elevated insulinwon't allow it to happen and so the thebrain literally starts to starveand you start to have dementia and it'snot only that that scenario that i justdescribed is not only relevant toalzheimer's disease but several otherneurological disorders like migraineheadaches we have known since 1928 thereare published reports from 1928 thatpeople who frequently suffer frommigraines if you put them into a ketoticstate through a ketogenic diet orfasting they will have no more migrainesthey will literally stopand be maintained and this was repeatedin studies published in 1930 um withepilepsy we've known with epilepsy fordecades that you put that child into aketotic state they will have no epilepsythe problem with these and otherdisorders is as much as we knew thatketones are probably most therapeutic tothe brain more than any other tissue inthe body they fell out of favor themoment we started developing drugsepilepsy was always treated with aketogenic diet well now we have theseepileptic drugs these anti-epilepticsthat'll help they never work as wellmigraines it was once treated with aketogenic diet well now we have thesegood migraine medications so you shouldjust take these instead it absolutelyand the same thing happened with eventype 1 diabetes type 1 diabetes used tobe treated by like basically carnivoredietand because the lower insulin need lowerblood glucose levels help them surviveand feel better in the absence ofinsulin and then the moment we kind ofmass produced insulin which on one handis life-saving so i can't critique thatit does improve the life of the type 1diabetic there's no arguing that but wesh but but now we started to tell themyou can eat just like everybody else eatall that cake eat all those cookies andbreads just cover it with your insulinthat's the line and all it does is putthe poor type 1 diabetic child on thisglycemic roller coaster all dayof getting too high and getting too lowas opposed to telling even the type 1certainly the type 2 diabetic saycontrol your carbohydrates and now theybasically just have a flat line ofglucose all day and their insulin kneesgo down to a tenth of what it would havebeen otherwiseyeah the truly astonishing thing here isthat absolutely nothing by any stretchof the imagination absolutely nothingcomparestocutting down on eating sugary foodin terms of cost reward i mean it's justinsane when you look at all these otherthings like yeah let's give themanti-epileptic drugs like you thinkdecades later now we start to see allthe side effects of those drugs and allthe problems that they cause and all theumcomplications that then require moredrugs which then cause even moreproblems so you have that as an optionso that you you know you sign up for alifetimedrug addictionessentially that doesn't work as welland it costs a lot of money and it ruinsyour healthor you know you just stop eating garbageand it works much better whether it'sepilepsy whether it's diabetes whetherit's alzheimer's whether it's all ofthese health issues you see the samething like it's it's it's out there asyou said in the literature it's alreadybeen demonstrated it's also out theredemonstrated in the real world ofliterally thousands and thousands ofpeople all over the world who startedtheir own blogs and have their ownbusinesses built around this you knowthe outside i mean thankfully theinternet has allowed people toessentially be doctors outside of themedical establishment that's what a lotof these influencers on social mediareally are and and i thoroughly respectthem because they are doing science youknow they they've worked with actualclients they've trained them they'vetaken uhtheir uh measurements they've looked attheir blood work over time they've seenwhat works they've seen what doesn'twork they've read literature andeverybody comes up with the sameconclusion like this stuff works for allkinds of different things and it's it'sit's an enormous amount of mentalgymnastics you have to do to avoid thatvery obvious very low cost very highreturnin the uminterventionand think of other things and reallythis is this is i think if if you're inthe medical field and if you're in thescientific research field and you'relistening to this um of course there's alittle bit of defensiveness of oh wellhow do you know well you're not a phd inumbiology and how do i talk well neitherof us are md's right yeah neither of usare md's and how do i know and of courseall these people will claim expertisebut really if you if your expertisehas resulted in you beinga not being able to notice that the byfar the most effective intervention thatcould possibly be done is reducereducing the level of insulin resistancein a patient through dietary controlthen i'm sorry but your entire degreeand all of your educate education if itis in any sense related to this andyou've missed this lowest hanging fruitthis absoluteelephant of a fruit that is low hangingright there for you to pick and you'vemanaged to miss that but instead you'vestudied all this extremely sophisticatedarcaneacademic discussion aboutall these cells and genetics and all ofthese uh other arcane things drug drugmechanisms yep drug mechanisms and allof these acronyms and names and you knowall these people that are just are soexpert in all those things really ifyou've managed to miss that hey cut downon doritos first and you're talkingabout all these extremely sophisticatedscientific concepts that you thinkyou're better than normal people becauseyou understand them and normal peopledon't understand them i am sorry butyou've been scammed you've been scammedyour education is a big giant stupidscam and you have been conned intowasting your life into joining a giantcriminal enterprise yeah you've beentravelingyeah you you you're helping a bunch ofcriminals profit from people gettingsick that's what it comes down to yeahyou've been credentialed to become alegal um drug dealer um this part ofthis this dissonance that i developedi i think my first loss of innocencejust to really put a fine point in whatwe're describing in addition to i'll addthat humans are great self-deceivers wewe fool ourselves i would when i duringthe course of my phd in north carolina iwould go from our little home and iwould bike i biked all the time we onlyhad one car and my wife was home withour new baby i would bike to the medicalschool where i took most of my phdcoursesthe biochemistry the bioenergetics thephysiology etc i would have to bikeeven though it was less convenient forme i would bike on the opposite side ofthe road of where the med school wasbecause i had to go to the far side ofthe medical school because the sidewalkof the medical school block was filledwith nurses and doctors who weretechnically off the private the propertyof the hospital to go to the sidewalk inorder to smokethey would go to the sidewalk so theycould smoke and so there were so manythat would be aligned there along thereof all the time that i have to bike onthe other side of the road and i wouldlook at these healthcare professionalsand just wonder at the hypocrisy or theignorance or the self-delusion where youcould imagine a physician who would beout there smoking a cigarette go back infor a clinical appointment with apatient who has lungfailure and heart disease and he wouldlook at the patient's chart and say ahwell looks like you smoke uh half apound or a pack ofcigarettes a day you really gotta stopsmoking and yet the stench of his owncigarette smoke comes into the clinicalappointment with himthis isand another something i see as a parentyou'll see i've literally seen thishappena mom is at a playground with her childthe and the mom has a little bag ofcandies and the baby the little childcomes up to mom hey can i have somecandy and the mom will give the littlekid a small littlehandful here's some little gummy candiesnow don't ask for any more you've hadenough this isn't good for you to havetoo much and then the moment that littlechild ran away i saw them what did themom start doing it's just hand over fistshoving those gummy candies into hersick body her sick overweight body and ithoughtthese moments of hypocrisy one i took itto heart andanalyzed my own behavior thinkingwhere am i hypocritical where i willtell my child okay you've watched tv foran hour that's enough no more and then iwill go and watch it for four hours youknow i mean just as an example it mademe analyze my own behavior more to bemindful of my own hypocrisy but then itjust was such a such an obvious displayof the hypocrisy that just pervadeshuman nature including thosewho well especially because it is suchblatant hypocrisy those who know betterwe knowwe know that if you are insulinresistant you're a type 2diabetic or type 1 literally yourdisease could be defined as you have ahard time metabolizing sugar in yourblood that's why your sugar is climbingwhy on this good green earth would wethen tell the person which entities doamerican dietetics american diabetesamerican heart they will say eat a lowfathighcarbohydrate diet that is literally theclinic the dietary advice that theseentities promote that they will sayit is criminal and yet there must besuch cognitive dissonance because theyknow the blood sugar levels are gettingtoo high well then as i already said ihate that i'm repeating myself just putless sugar in the system and it willlower the sugar it will lower theinsulin than than the insulin resistancewhich is the heart of all metabolicproblems and then all of the issues thatare derivative of that everything startsto get better rather than trimming thissick little tree at the branches bygiving here a medication or theirmedication we just chop the damn thingdown and now we don't have to worryabout pruning it anymoreyeah one of the one absolutely mostheartbreaking things that happened whenyou start learning about how this wholeinsulinmechanism works and you see thedifference in youis you try and tell your family andfriends and uh one of the worst thing iswhen you have a family member who'sclearly suffering from serious healthproblems and clearly could benefitenormously from them and they might evenbe willing to listen except that theirdoctor told them no noyou don't have to worry about any ofthat stuff focus on taking yourmedication and be sure to come to myoffice once every two weeks so that wecan check your whatever it isbut don't listen to your nephew orgrandkid or all these people that arereading weird things on the internet ihave a degreethis is this is you know think aboutthings that make you go really reallyreally angry and this is yeah and youcan't say one of the dirty secretsespecially of medical practice um i sawthis firsthand there i was a group oflike i think there werefour of us phd students taking classesnot to let phds off the hook we knowthat it is plenty corrupted but we weretaking classes with the md medicalstudents like the physiology and thebiochemistry and stuff some of them andthen we had our ownother coursework i was amazed that if wephd students got anything less than a bwe were on academic probation and thenwe had to repeat the class and if we gotless than a b againthankfully never happened with me butthen you get kicked out of the programso our phd program went from four tothree within the first year i knewmultiple mde students who they theydon't have to just get they could get acand they can take that again as manytimes as they need i knew a guy who'shis graduation from his medical degreewas delayed about a year and a half orso because he kept failing a class andyet it's just once you're in the systemtheydo they move heaven and earth all themore now i mean standards just keepgetting lower and lower as we have allthese outcomes that are based more onensuring you knowwell i i need to be careful ensuringjust you knowthat everyone can have a chance andeveryone gets a degree they're justhanding them out and so there's noquestion that the quality is gettingless and less but alsotragically as the quality is decliningit seems like there's a growingresistance to acknowledging when youdon't know something it is the greattragedy of all terminal degrees a phd inan md are obvious examples the more wehave earned letters after our name themore we refuse to acknowledge someonecould know something that we don't knowand that to me it's the death of scienceit is it truly isin in science is just a mature i meantrue science which is the pursuit oftruth that my phd mentor who was awonderful gentleman just a wonderful manhe would always say ben we're seekingtruth we're seeking truth and we thatmeans you have to be prepared to dumpall of your theoriesthe moment you see data that conflictedthat challenges it should make youchallenge what you thought you knew andand readdress it reassessbut no no now like i said at the outsetof the conversation everyone they havelawn signs and they say we believe inscience and all it is is the declarationof faith at that point it is no longer arigorous objective analysis of what wethink we know and and this is al covidwas the death of yeah i mean it was itwas the outside nail yep yepyeah no i i definitely agree with that ithink thethe the really astonishing uhbait and switch here is that you knowthe whole supposed marketing material ofscience was built on the idea that youknow no more priests no more authorityno more uh listen to what the priestssay no you need to read for yourselfeverybodyuses the scientific method you thinkscientifically and it's a it's a i meanit's really just an explicit statementof what all humans do at all times youknow what when you wake up in themorning let's say your bed has a wall onone side and it doesn't have a wall onthe other side you know it's thescientific method one day you wake upyou hit the wall and then you'veexperimented and then for the rest ofyour life you're to wake up on the rightside of the bed that's science that'swhat the scientific method is you knowyou you have a hypothesis that i couldwake up on the left side you test it outyou smash your head in the walland then youyou figure out the conclusion that youshould try the other side sothinking scientifically is what humansnaturally do when they try andunderstand how things work and thescientific process is a great way ofthinking about itformulating it to make it systematic sothat it's not just you know going by ahunch so you formulate a hypothesis youtest it and you you write it down ithelps you structure your thinking in amuch better waybut with that we've successfully beenconned intoall right we're doing experimentsbutactuallywhat we're going to be doing is thatuh you're not doing experiments you'rejust going to trust priests who claim todo experiments but these are better thanthe other priests the two you trustedbecause the other priests told you youknow they spoke to godthese guys don't speak to god they speakto an experiment so you can feel okaytrusting them but really um it's thesame thing it is a religion like at thispoint we just have priests and we trustthem and we excommunicate people whodon't believe it else said well in facti used to take great pride in being whatis commonly called a hard scientist thehard sciences were these areas ofscience where you could literallyconduct an experiment run the analysisand see was this a significant findingor was it not did something happen thatwe predicted or did it not i would takegreat pride that i was not a softscience guy you know where where you addthe word science in your degree and ithelps you believe it's political sciencesocial sciences run a bunch ofobservationary data yeah there's nothingthere's nothing science i mean it's it'salmost a rule where if if uh if a degreehas the word science in it it's probablynot a science you know like i'm i'm i amin cell biology that's my department wedon't say i mean my other colleagues arein molecular biology you know we don'tsay molecular biology science but it'ssocial science political science and i iwould take such pride that i could knowsomething i could say this is truthwhat we saw this happened i treated thecells with this with insulin and this isliterally what happened so now i canstate it with an absolute authoritybecause it is truth it is reality andunlike the social sciences the softersciences which i don't mean to totallydisparage but they could not make thosesame claimsthey could not do it but now even in thehard sciences you have people makingclaims that are not justifiedi've never beenmore ashamedof ofof of my credential than i have been thelast few years where it has been youhave people making the mostunscientific ridiculous statementsacross a whole spectrum of social issuesright now it's not just disease but itis you know human development um for imean all these things are beingcriticized in a way that i i look atwith such wonderand and i'm left thinkingi'm in a clown world now um but but youknow what the only one no no i know butit's it's funny for me to say thisbecause ihappen to be a professor at a privatereligious university and what's amazingto me is to see that it's these privatereligious universities that still allowthe teaching of traditional kind ofliberal education by that i don't meanbut when i say liberal i mean like aclassic liberal education which trainsyou in the arts and the sciences and theletters and i canknow that my institution will defend mewhen i makestatements about reality and truth inscience and i don't teach anythingreligious whatsoever but it's thesestate sponsored schools who are sodependent on money from the nationalinstitutes of health or from the stateor federal agencies unlike myinstitution where they have to say whatthe party they have to follow the partyline they lit i mean that to your pointabout fiat science being based on fiatmoney that is literally the case withtraditional state schoolsand it's only universities that aren'tdependent like my university for examplewhen you when the federal government washanding out covert relief fundsmy university was one of we literallydeclined the money it was offered thesetens of millions of dollars and myuniversity said no we aren't going totake it because we know the moment youstart doing that things it comes withobligations and demandsand so it's a it's a weird thingto to say that it's these privategenerally religious universities andthey're very very few of them thatactually teachthe reality the binary nature of justscience something is real or it isn'tnow that's not to say there's nosilliness college campuses unfortunatelyit's their very nature nowadays to havesomesomewhat crazy ideology in somedisciplinesbutuh it would be it would be increasinglydifficult for me to be in academia if ifelt like i had to statethe you know something that i i believedto be utterly falseyeah i mean umbetter get some bitcoin because i thinkthe uh i know i know i i think theinquisitors are coming and you're goingto be have to you're going to have toyou know recant on all of your heresiesyou're going to have to cancel the beexcommunicated exactlydenounce your previous work and say thatinsulin is not a problem anymore oh iknow i know well but the nice thing forme i've never gotten an nih grant andthat's actually i'm not ashamed of thatthat's kind of a point of pridei have been able to fund my lab throughindividual donors that are sufficientlyenamored or convinced um have asufficient conviction of my va my viewof health and disease that i've not hadto becomei've not had to become an employee ofthe government uh and say what they wantme to saycongratulations that's i mean reallythis is uh for me uhth this is the goal and this was alwaysthe goal write and be readand have a have a method ofcommunicating with a readership withouthaving to be part of the state-runeducational system because ultimatelythe entire fieldsthey're all related to the academicjournals and i discussed this in detailin the fiat standard the way that thisacademic fiat ponzi works is all runthrough the academic journals thebasically the better way to understandis that the university system and theuniversity professors and the universityadministratorshave effectively been conned intouh becoming slave labor for the academicpublication industry there are a fewlarge publishers that controlumthousands literally thousands uponthousands of academic journals and99.999 of everything written in allthose academic journals is unreadablegarbage nobody ever reads it none ofthese papers are read by anybody even ifyou have access to it yeah even if youhad access to it nobody would read it umi mean the only people who read it arepeople who read it because they want torespond to it or build upon it so thatthey can get into the same journals andget promoted but nobody outside of thejournal circle jerk uh feeds these uhpapersno in fact i i joke it's incestuous isay that all the time you go toconventional meetings i go give a talkat a conventionalscience meeting it's the same handful ofscientists listening to the same handfulof scientists everyone's citing eachother's work you know and that's why atthe very beginning of our conversation inoted that i i began more and more torail against this system where i'dpublish a paper like this paper aboutthe post-mortem biopsies we did onstudying the hippocampus from humans imean this was relevant cool stuff and wepaid five thousand dollars to get itpublished in a journal that no one willread except a handful of people andconventional academia would say all thatmatters i mean like at the end of everyyear you get reviewed in part based onhow many people cited your publishedwork that's part of the game of academiaand yet i looked at thislike about six years ago this was thebeginning of me saying i need to one getinvolved in social media and two i needto write a book because i thought if therest of my career is publishing papersthat 20 other scientists read and itnever actually impacts a human's lifethen i will have ended my careereither i was delusional thinking i madea difference or i will acknowledge andbe humbled by the fact that i never madea lick of difference in every discoveryi made as cool as i might have thoughtit waswas totally irrelevant in the real worldand that to mewas was intolerable the idea of justsitting in the ivory tower of academiaspouting ideas and then wondering ifthey had ever influenced someone i saidno i have to circumvent that wholesystem yes i have to play that game i doi i play it but i also know that i'mplaying the game and then i go right tothe people i directly share publicationsthat are relevant to human healththrough social media and it's neverpictures of me doing anything silly it'sliterally just i'm teaching a littlelesson right now about how testosteroneaffects fat cell function you know forexample or i'm writing a book that isdirectly me going around i mean safe ifyou had had to convey all of your ideasin in the two books that i've read ofyours bitcoin standard and fiat standardif you had to only rely on those ideasbeing conveyed in a classroomyou'd you'd never or your own papersbeing published no good luck a fractionof the number of people would know it sothose of us who know ideas and that'snot relegated to those with phds not atallbut those who have valuable ideas itbehooves us to test those ideas in anopen market are these ideas as valid asi think they are and then how can i helpconvey them if they are and the marketwill tell you if they're valuable or notexactly which is what i really loveabout twitter twitter in particular ithink is the most uhis the most vigorous intellectual andscientific debate that you find may italways stay that way may it stay thatway oh obviously you know of course ithas all of its problems with censorshipand so on but yet even in spite of allof that i think it still manages to bethe most effective platform because uhit's extremely powerful as a way ofcommunication where you need to getthings down to 280 characters so thatmeans you can't waffle around and youcan't waste people's time people justimmediately tune you out get straight tothe point so you know you can link topapers you can link to articles you caninclude the video and audio but you needto get to the punch in 280 points whichforces the brain to focus and for andallows you to really expose things andthen that's where academics really thethe tricks you know academics don't likebrevity academics don't like brevitythey like to be superfluous ineverything they describe exactly becausea lot of it is just honestlyperformative art i mean i've been tothose conferences and i know that a lotof it is just you need to sit there andtalk about your paper nobody's read yourpaper nobody wants to read your paperbut they have to attend the conferenceyou have to speak at the conference andso it's just performance you stand thereand you know you feign being wise andyou talk slowly and then you finish yourtime and then you get on with your lifeand like nobody learns anything and mostof it is just really performativeum but yeah that's uhsocial media on the other hand is realworld that people are going to listen toyour ideas they're going to try them andthey're going to come back and tell youhey i tried to do what you said and lookit's worked and here are the picturesandthat that's the validation that you needi remember you know it was it was it wassomething very similar that i feltduring my grad school when i uhstopped believing in the stuff that theyteach us in the grad school and i justdeveloped this alternative perspectivethe biggest horror that i had was thisidea that hang on so we are just writingall of this garbage to continue toumkeep our jobs in this kind of system andthe only purpose of writing this is sothat we develop the expertise so we canget on tv and newspapers and universityclassroom and gas light people intotelling them hey um yep you knowinflation is actually good for you andprices aren't really rising and uh weneed more inflation and the way that wesolve the problems of inflation is withmore inflation that was basically it andjustrealizing that you're sitting there andyou're writing something that nobody'sgoing to be reading it's it it gave methat image ofthat and i mentioned this in the fieldas well there's that movie the stanleykubrick movie the shining where uh theauthor and his wife they go into aresort to an isolated hotel in middle ofnowhere and they spend months writingand then his wife looks at all thehundreds of pages that he wrote andthey're all just the same sentence allover again and this is what it feelslike when you're in academia it's likewould it even matter if i just filledthis with the same sentence over andover the same exact sentences in thatmoviewould anybody even notice i mean yeahthe seven people in the journals and theseven people who read the journal mightuh notice but like if you them and i weall agree on doing this as a pranknobody would notice it couldwell stay in the in the gym in factthat's been done right but there wasthis i can't remember his name there wasthis physical socal alan he had suchdisdainin fact did you cite this in your bookyes alan yeah oh yeah yeah so i but i'veheard it other times where you have thephysicist who writes a report about likehe just made up like one of them i thinkhe might have been the guy who talkedabout how dogsum having sex was a good example of likeuh you know male domination or orwhatever and it would but that was oneof the things he'd made up but justutter nonsense and getting it publishedin these soft sciencejournals you know the peer reviewprocess was just a jokeyeah and like i think um you knowusually it used to be thata natural scientist would laugh atsocial scientists but i think you knowthese are the same universities thatpublish the same thing so oh no i know iknow yeah that's natural i used tothat's right yeah i don't anymore my mysmugness of being a hard naturalscientist is is gone now because we'vewe've also now started compromisingtruth to fit a narrative unfortunatelyyeah and i think you knowas you said the the recent uhrespiratory illness uh shenanigans werereally i mean the way that the allentire world scientific community wentfrom having never heard about socialdistancingand uh to just say yeah well this isobviously what we need to do becausethat's the only option what are youcrazy yeah well and to totally overlookwhat we we knew very very early on notto maybe maybe i need to be very carefulbut but very briefly we knew very earlyon that the most significant singleliterally the single most relevant riskfactor in determining whether this wouldbe serious infection or a very mildinfection was the amount of fat a personhad on their body and that's not just acoincidenceany inhaled or or virus that gets intothe system it comes in as a viralparticle and it needs to hijack a cellit needs to get into a cell infect acell for that cell to start producingmore of those viral particles to go andinfect others with this particular virusinfects fat cells more than any othercell well they're a couple a littlehigher but fat cells are among the mostreadily infected cell with thisparticular viral particle and so andthen the fat cell becomes an unwittingfactory producing more and more and moreof it because it had on the surface ofthe fat cell these other proteins thatallow the viral particle to get intothat cell much more readily so literallyif you had a fat cell in a muscle cellside by side and each were exposed tothis viral particle it's going to have avery hard time getting into the musclecell because it doesn't have the rightreceptors for that virus to kind oftrick fat cells are very welcoming hostsand so a person who has more fat tissuejust had more likely infection sites toprevent this isn't meant to be anincriminating point about anyone who'soverweight noindeed i truly am not but for us topretendthat that wasn't a relevant variable infact arguably the most relevant variablewas it did no one any serviceno it's absolutely insane i think it'sthe most absurd moment of the entire twoyears was when um and i'm from albertai'm from alberta which means i have agreat distain for any of the easternprovincesyeah i could understand and this thisguy you know he'd locked down ottawa hadsomeone i mean ontario had some of themost strict uhlockdowns in the world for a very longtime and they destroyed small businessesdoug ford got on tv and taughthis citizens how to make cheesecake hismom's or his grandmarecipe for cheesecake which is he madedoug ford you know the the enormous unitwhich he is today so you can imagine howmuchsugar it has in it and uh he went andcooked it you know he was wearing agiant t-shirt uh that said we're all inthis together and he was teaching peoplehow to cook cheesecake while he lockedthem at home and prevented them fromopening their businesses it's absolutelyamazing how nobody said anything aboutyou know it was it was for methat was for me seeing everything thathappened over the last few yearswas was a kind of final nail in thecoffin now of coursemy field itself studying the the originsof metabolic disease had made me alreadysomewhat cynical um of of traditionalviews you know like uh i've mentionedbefore that the fat cell is at the heartof metabolic problems that's whereinsulin resistance startsum and and yettraditional view would be well then justsimply lower calories and that's allthere is to it yes calories matter butthe prevailing paradigm with obesity isthis caloric paradigm totally ignores ortotally refutes the fact that insulincould have anything to do with it andyet insulin is essential to determiningfat storage as well the whole debaclethe last three years settled it for mebut anyway here he is here he isyeah look i mean look at that oh my goshyeah and so he he ought to be he oughtto have been worried about thisrespiratory illness because he has themost significant risk factorwell look at him there's he's had therecipe memorizes he was 10 year olds imean this isoh my gosh this is some seriousdedication yeah it is it is uhthere's the cream so that so what he'smixing here the mix of sugar and fat isis a is a dane is a particularlydangerous one there's the cream a littlemore yeah sugar a little more fat andsugar and in nature it's important tonote in nature carbohydrate and fatdon't come together that doesn't happenin in foods that we eat in nature it'seither pure carbohydrate in the form offruit and vegetable generally or it'sprotein and fatbut he's he's mixing oh gosh what aclownyeah he got re-elected as welloh i'm not surprised i'm not surprisedthey re-elected trudeau it's it's myit's so it's so shamefulum to see what's happened and i i lovedgrowing up in canada i loved mychildhood in this little kind of farmtownin albertaand and but but i my dad raised us allto be um very kind of free marketcapitalist and he would always railagainstthe federal the lack of a kind offederalist systemum now i'm not saying the u.s is perfectit's democracy it's federalist system isis built and only can succeed on a moralpeople as the founding fathers noted andthe loss of kind of morality in the usputs it into a difficult spot in factsafe i've heard you defend a monarchybeforeand and which which i i can be verysympathetic to um i think if you knewif a population could know that it wouldalways have a just kingslam dunkbut but you know the usperspective was we can't trust thatwe'll always have a good king we'lltrust the morality of the people but nowif you have if you don't have a moralpeoplethen it does it doesn't work yeah no ithink the the argument is not that youknow if we can get uh just king everysingle time i think the argument isthat thisyou hit the nail right on the head thatyou you need to just people for ademocracy to work so you need thesociety to be 51 percentjust moral and low time preference ithink this is the really key thing youneed a society to be predominantlythinking about the future thinking yeschildren because otherwise they willsacrifice the future for the sake ofthis that's something you've articulatedvery well before i i love you yeah andand and the difficult thing is that ifit's if it's uh a democracy then it'sthe hand it's uh hopper describes it aswe stand altogether where everybody'shand is in everybody's pocket andeverybody is robbing from everybody elseand when you have that system youincentivize people to think short termand so it's very difficult to you knowwin the lottery then and have 51 percentof the populationuhmanage to do it but with a king you justneed one guyto teach their sonthis is what we do we keep thinking ofthe long term and we don't sacrifice thelong term for the present and so then ifyou just have one familywhere you have one father who just needsto teach this to their son and then theymanage to keep it going for a fewgenerationsyou're arguably better off sticking tothem than you are i agree i agreebecause then their their moral viewwould befor lack of a better word imposedin the population it would be better i itotally agree with that i think it's notso much that they would be able toimpose their moral view i think it'sjust that uh without a high timepreferenceperson in charge of government peoplejust naturally do what's best for themand they naturally develop a long-termperspective because what you need todestroy that is an actively destructivegovernment that takes away your propertytakes away that your freedom takes awayyour security then people becomeum essentially animals fighting againsteach other because they don't see acommon future because theythey think the future is compromisedso this this would be it but i wanted toget back to alzheimer's you'd mentionedthis this is of course very interestingi have uh my grandfather unfortunatelywho suffers from this illness and ofcourse as i mentioned it's one of thoseexamples where constantly trying to getthem to change their diet and the doctorjustsays it's not and everybody in thefamily just laughs when i mention itbut it's uh you know recently new uhresearch on alzheimer's has shown usthat uh yeah apparently uh fiat sciencehas been uh uh naughty and up to it'susual in factis the it is the most perfect example ofof fiat science in science at its workscience at its worst or agenda at itsbestwhere the prevailing theory ofalzheimer's disease has been that it isit is a disease of plaques forming inthe brain and these little things calledamyloid beta peptides or what we callplaques are accumulate in thehippocampus and literally disrupt neuronto neuron connection resulting in thecognitive decline that so typifiesalzheimer's disease butthe challenge why my lab challenged thatamong other labs i'm not alone in thisis that there would be drug after drugwould come out that would be shown toreduce the presence of amyloid betapeptides or plaques in the brain and yetthere would be nono subsequent improvement in cognitionin fact this just happened last yearwhere the fda against the the request ofthe special panel that was put togetherto review this anti-alzheimer's drug itwas an anti-plaque drug so there wasthis special panel put together toreview it they directed the fda todecline fda approval of this drugbecause the efficacy was nil there wasnothing to it but the fda approved itanyway and their justification for itwas that they didn't want to discouragefurther drug development in thealzheimer's realm so they explicitlyapproved a drug they knew had no benefitand so doctors would start prescribingthis to patients even though there wasno known benefit butall of this is just the the the cherryon top of the sickfoundation which was that the very ideathat alzheimer's was a plaque-baseddisease was built on faulty data andthat's what you're referring to it'smade the headlines i wouldn't besurprised if many people have seen thisalreadybut this initial scientific findingspublished in these glamorous journals ofcourseit was that when they would block theformation of the plaques in these animalmodels then the alzheimer's would goaway when the plaques were there thedementia the cognitive decline in therodents would follow and yet it was allfabricatedthey had made up these data and that'spart of this perverse incentive that sotypifies this artificial realm of fiatscience where they want they need topublish and they need to keep gettingfundingand so you you're willing to compromiseand and now we know that that ideas hasbeen tossed to the wayside it simplydoesn't havemoreover additional data in postmortemhuman samples found that there you woulddetect and find plaques in people'sbrain who who died with no evidence ofcognitive decline they were perfectlyhealthy as sharp and witty as they everwere and yet their brains had moreplaques hammers and died with like myown grandma did and and they would haveno plaxen or very very little plaques inthe brain so we've known for years thatthere's something wrong with thisparadigm and yet it continued to bepropped upand those of us who've been beating thedrum and again i'm not alone saying thatthis is not a plaque disease it is ametabolic disease with significant datato to um support this never having beenrefuted yet that i'm aware of but nopaper has it found contrary evidencefinding that it is not a disease ofmetabolism of the brain in the brainit's not been refuted yet and so thisshould be the theory that should havebeen continued to be propped up in orderfor it to continually be criticized ishould add it's not that it makes itbulletproof that bigger a theory getsthe moreit should be able to be topped uptoppled overthen every brick that's being thrownover thrown at it if it's not knockingit down well then it strengthens itappropriatelyit's a stronger theory now if the brickwe're throwing doesn't knock the towerdown it is become incorporated into thestructure and it's stronger there havebeen that little tower of theplaque-based theory of alzheimer's hasbeen knocked over so many times it justit fit the narrative that they wantedwhoever they were if it was easier todevelop drugsthat would address plaques than it hasbeen to just tell people help your brainbecome more insulin sensitive and giveit some ketones from time to time andvery likely your brain is going to bejust fine you don't need to invoke someenormous conspiracy of people whoconsciously came up with those thingsand deliberately lied about it like ifyoui'm sure as you know the way that thesethings work it's just you know if youand i both get our phd and get similarjobs and similar research centersstudying this kind of issueif i come at it from the perspective ofwell i thinkthere's this obscured little chemical inthe brain that causes alzheimer we needto spend 18 million dollars to study howthis thingumgrows and that's what causes alzheimer'sand we tend to figure out how to get adrug that inhibits this mechanism sotherefore will fix that issue this is ahighly promising line of researchbecause of the way that the drugpatent systemworks which is essentially a form ofgovernment monopoly it makes a lot ofsense to just find some symptom anywhereand find some chemical that can be shownin a trial to reduce those symptoms andit's just this is what modern medicinebecomes because you set up theincentives in a certain way where youhave to demonstrate to one monopolygovernment agencyone mechanism that they choose you knowyou set that as you set these as thegoal posts and so then you have billionsof dollars of pharmaceutical companiesout there shooting for those goal postshiring people specifically to shoot forthose goal posts you know we need toconduct the trial to find the diseaseand find the symptoms and then find thechemical that we can patent and makesure that it's artificial it has to beartificial because if it's notartificial you can't patent it yes ithas to be an artificial chemical thatcan cause some significant effect onthat symptomso because if we do that and we spendabout a billion dollars in 10 yearsputting it through trials and then weget the approval then that's a moneyprinting ticket forever because then alldoctors are required to prescribe it asa standard of care for this conditionand that's just going to mean endlessyachts and vacation homes for everybodyinvolved with our pharmaceutical companysoinstead of having a free market systemwhere ideas and drugs are tested by freeagencies thatpublish their findings you have atop-down system where the governmentjust dictates all right this is thestandard of care everybody needs to takeit everybody needs to follow itand you know as a doctor you could loseyour license if youdon't follow those things on the one andi'm proposing this kind of theory thatwould fit into this pattern that couldlead to that drug eventually which couldmake billions you on the other handyou've come up with the conclusion thathey maybe i i have this novel theorythat if we get people to start eatinglessgarbage we could improve theiralzheimer'sall right well you know you could make agood instagram health influencer accountout of that you couldrun a small business that holds peopleaccountable and helps them and makesmeal planning there are a few smallbusinesses on thatnothing like the drugs that you could uhrun if you you know with my theory youknow my theory that says it's a bunch ofcamera it's a chemical imbalance in thebrain and we just need that yeah andthat's exactly what they did withpsychiatry that other big scam which uhwhich also incidentally is massivelyaffected by insulin resistance but alsonobody mentions it because again it'smuch more profitable no it's a chemicalthing in your brain and we just add alittle pill and yeah and that was allrefuted recently too i mean you'reperfect to point that one out where forso long we'd said it's a serotoninimbalance and then we now this big metaanalysis comes out and says oh wellactually it's not at all and that'snever been supported in the science andit challenges i mean the most commonpsychiatric medication for these sortsof things is these serotonin regulatingdrugs that do nothing to benefit thepersonthat's very true and and and of coursethe mechanism i discussed in the fiatstandard because of the way thatfinancing works is look mistakes happeneverywhere but fiat money and fiatfinancing of sciencemakes it so that mistakes can never getcorrected because once you identify thiskind of mechanism all right it's theit's the chemical imbalance of the brainor it's the platelets that cause thealzheimer's or it'sa saturated fat that is causing theheart disease once you've set themechanism so thatgetting government funding depends onformulating your hypothesisto be congruent with that starting pointonce that becomes theeverybody knows in the field once thatbecomes the thing that everybodymentions in the first page of thatscientific paper as a sort of startingfoundation then that's it then that'snever questioned never testednever researched and just it is the lensthrough which it's all viewed exactlyand then there'sthe only way that you can get called thescientist is if you use that lens if youdon't use that lens you're a crank yepyep you're a hair tick that's right yeahand i've i've been accused of thatmyself for challenging conventionalviews and obesity and diseaseum it it just sort of it's it becomestoo threatening unfortunately yeahyeah and i think uh you know to go bringeverything back to the bitcoin and thispodcast is one big giant advertisementfor why bitcoin fixes everythingis i think again all of it is because ofthe fact that without a free market badideas don't die they just continue toget money printing you need to wait forthe money printer to die for that to getfixed but bitcoin is our way out bitcoinis a way for people tofind fund research that they want as faras a way for scientists to becomefinancially independent so that theydon't know always need all these newextra research grants because theirmoney is constantly inflating i thinkyou know the future michael saylor talksabout this people willendow uh foundations with bitcoin andthen that will be a much more effectiveway to continue to do their researchindependent of the fiat uh monster wellthat has to happen yeah you know it atsome point for for science to continueto thrive in what has been such abedrock of the united states having somany advantages it was the system thatthat encouraged and rewarded academicfree thinking in these efforts to toexperiment and find the best ideas letthe best ideas rise to the top the morewe prop up the worst ideasbecause we have money that's allowing itto be propped up we don't allow them toget filteredit's it's it'suh i mean it's the death of of sciencewhich is which is a very sobering notnotthat sounds almost self-aggrandizingwhere where umthat's it's scientists you know it'sthese philosopher kings and it should bethese deep thinkers who are the leadersnono but but the more we refuse to allowtruth and realityand even it even in the reality ofletting the marketshow what ideas have valueum then the more we're artificiallypropping up bad ideas that lead just toour detriment and destructionabsolutely and one thing i also wantedto ask you about is statins what areyour thoughts on stuff oh my gosh so infact i would encourage what a wonderfulquestioni literally just published a paper withtwo other scientistsum on this topic of the efficacy ofstatins in in with for its traditionaluseum and anyone could just go to um i hateto promote pubmed or google scholar butif you just type in bikman and look forany papers published in 2022 you'll findit i think we paid the extra fee to makeit open access which is something ialways do but it's like six thousandbucks seven thousand bucks for my lab topublish a paper so it's not behind a paywall that's how convinced i am thatthese ideas need to have free access umthat people need to get them anywayi think statins are probably the mostoverprescribed drug and my justificationso everyone knows statins are the mostcommon um drug used for heart diseaseand we base thatits use entirely on someone's ldlcholesterol levels that a physician willsay a clinician will say okay patientyour ldl levels are too high you need togo on a statin to reduce your ldl levelsand while statins are effective atlowering ldlthey are tremendously ineffective atlowering the risk of heart diseaseespecially if a person i mean there'sdifferent scenarios but if a person hasnever had a heart attack but they have ahigh ldlin their prescribed statinit it shows no benefit at preventingthat heart attack if someone has had aheart attack and they're given a statinit appears to be that there's a slightreduction in risk but only in somepeople you have to give a statin to like20 people in order for one to get abenefitso this is my view on statins based onall of the best data that i've seenldl cholesterol doesn't matter at allit's a totally useless marker of heartdisease indeed ldl cholesterol is is apredictor of longevity if you want tolive long we have the baltimorelongitudinal study the honolulu agingstudy the shanghai aging studymultiple studies across the world havefound that the longest lived peoplewho have the lowest risk of dementia thelowest risk of cancer have the highestldl levelsi mean what a bloodyparadox we've we've created by wagingwar on ldl ldl is such an essentialmolecule of life it's relevant forhormone production moving cholesterolaround it's relevant for immunity itliterally can bind pathogens and removethem from the body through the liver tobe cleansed from the blood and so that'swhythe more we wage war on ldl the sickeroverall a person's going to getbutwhat i would say if anyone listening iscurious about stanton's and of coursei'm not giving any medical advice per sejust insightdon't rely on your ldl level you go andpay 70 bucks or whatever and get what'scalled a coronary artery calcium scan acac scan you lay under a little ctscanner it zips around you and itactually measures the calcification inyour carotid arteries on your hearti have to say this because the evidenceis so convincing if someone has a cacscore of i think above 1 000 i think itwas or something like that then itshowed a mortality difference in intaking a statin regardless of ldl ldllevels had nothing to do with it high orlow it didn't matter but if someone hadreally high ldl but they had a cac scorein the low hundredsum i think it was the stat had nobenefit whatsoever and because statinshave such significant consequences likelowering sex hormone production loweringvitamin d damaging the mitochondriamaking your muscles ache and these arereal consequences that people need tobalance every drug has a consequenceit's just is the consequence you wantworth the consequences you don't wantthat's something we always have to askourselves as we put these unnaturalchemicals in our bodybut if someone has a high cac scorethen it appears that there could be alongevity a mortality benefit to astatin but if your ldl is through theroof but your cac score is zero i wouldi wouldn't touch ityeahi i think the statins were the mostprofitable drug in the history of thepharmaceutical industry they may havebeen overtaken recently by anunmentionable which i will not mentionbecause idon't want to get cancelled from uh onsocial media but uhit has been enormously profitable to umenormous focus and focus the on this onelittle metric and take a pill for itrather thanthe very blatantly obvious alternativehypothesis which is that it is theinsulin that you should oh and i shouldi should just add though lest it soundlike i'm giving a tacit umgreat pass to statins they're also thereare so many different types of statinsthat people's genetics will metabolizethe statins differently so even if thiswere me giving advice to my dad for aloved one i would say don't do anythinguntil you've gotten a cac score okaylet's say he had a very very high cacscore lots of calcificationin the carotid arteries then next thingi would do is say get what's called apharmacogenomics test these aretypically 200 bucks or so someinsurances actually pay for it here inthe usbut it is our genes will dictate how werespond to medications and it's verypossible that the person gets on astatin that theymetabolize too rapidly and it doesn't doanything or it has some adverse effectthe third leading cause of death in theunited states is adverse drug events forgoodness sakesthat is the third leading cause of deathit's heart disease cancer and adversedrug events and part of this is becauseyou're prescribed a drug that doesn'tget metabolized well in your body peoplenaturally have different genes that areinvolved in the processes of clearingmolecules particularly in the liverthat's where most drugs get metabolizedand eliminated from the body oncethey've kind of lived their life butsome people either metabolize them tooquickly so it doesn't do any good orthey metabolize them too slowly and thechemicals sticking around muchlonger than it should so there are a lotof caveats when it comes to statins areyou should you be using it based on thevery limited data available at all andthen secondyou need to make sure you metabolize itwell but safe to your point even ifsomeone has known calcification in theirarteries there was a cardiologist by thename of bill william davis he publisheda book on thisand he quantified reversingcalcification in the carotid arteriesstrictly through diet in his patients sotypically they will say once once anatheros once a plaque in the bloodvessel has calcified then it's like astone and it's not going anywhere thatis the prevailing idea to this day wellthis cardiologist bill davis he'spublished reports finding quantifyingthe reduction in calcification inpatients strictly through adopting thedietary changes that we've been talkingabout yeahall right um daniel's got a question foryoudanielle yeah hey guys uh hey benjaminnice to meet you uh brilliant brotherbrilliant thank you yeah it's just beenum really really interestingi gotta represent the bitcoin plebs andask you a bit of uhyou probably see the bro science thatgets thrownaround in the bitcoin uh twitter realmso but well first of all uhit's brilliant that your lab isself-funded do you accept bitcoin so ifanybody listening to safe's pod can sendyou some donationsthat is so i appreciate that so muchum one of the tragedies of being at aprivate institution is i i can't acceptdirect donations everything i do comesthrough the university on what's calleda sponsored research agreementum but you guys i've gotten enoughrequests for this kind of thing that i'mthinking about creating a non-profitumi just don't know how to do that likesomething that could accept donation andthen just pay for the equipment and payfor the students that are doing my workso at the moment i hate to say this butno i don'twell someone listening will have ananswer for you i'm sure someone willhonest to goodness i would i wouldwelcome it enormously because it hasgotten a littlechallenging in that regardthe the bro science questions uh there'sa lot of um chat on bitcoin twitterabout see the oils oh yeah yeah yeahwell no i'm glad you're bringing that upbecause that that was something wedidn't get around to so i my my theoryon what is the worst thing how our diethas changed is that it is now consistsof fake carbohydrates or processed carbsand processed oilsand the processed carbohydrates safe andi've i think really beat that to deathreally well which is this is what'sspiking your insulin and chronicallyelevated insulin drives a resistance toinsulin but on the other hand theprocessed oils like seed oils um theyare also problematic um particularly atthe fat cell and that's relevant becausethat's where i believe insulinresistance begins it is the first dominoto fall if you will and when when theprimary fat the primary fatty acid inseed oils is a fat called linoleic acidand anyone who's been diving into theseed oils already knows that fatlinoleic acid is problematic because asit accumulates in the fat cellit can become it gets metabolizedthrough a process called peroxidationinto a molecule called 4 hne that's ofcourse the abbreviated form of a muchlonger name but for h e as itaccumulates in fat cells it forces fatcells to grow through a process calledhypertrophywhere the fat cell itself is being is isbeing expanded and getting fatter andfatter and fatter that is not how allpeople get fatsome people can get fat through aprocess called hyperplasia and this wassomething peter and i just were chattingvery briefly about when safe went tohelp with this baby um at the verybeginning but if some if a person'sphysiology allows their fat tissue togrow through hyperplasia which is whenthe fat cells stay small but we multiplythemthat is the person who paradoxically canget fat but stay metabolically healthytheir blood pressure is okay they don'thave infertility they don't have insulinthey don't have diabetes their glucoselevels are normal that is the vastminority of peoplemost people get fat through hypertrophywhere the fat cell gets reallyfat if you will and it becomes insulinresistantto try to prevent further growth and itbecomes pro-inflammatory literallycreating molecules that turn oninflammation throughout the body all inan effort to try to increase blood flowthrough all these swollen fat cellsanyway to answer the question and bringit full circle that's what seed oilscontribute to among other things seedoils do morebut what i focus on as a metabolicscientist is what they do to the fatcell and seed oils will forcehypertrophy of the fat cell whichbecomes a very insulin resistantpro-inflammatory fat cell which startshaving that firstdomino tip into the other and promotingthe insulin resistance throughout thebody so while we didn't beat that topicto death i'm thrilled you brought it upbecause there's no question it'srelevant so i consider seed oils to be asecondary cause of insulin resistancebecause directly they're not going to doit on the body they have an insulinresistant effect as it alters the growthof fat cells in a unique way in auniquely harmful wayright yeah do you think that do youthink there's merit to the idea thatyou look at traditional populations alot of them did eat carbohydrates nowobviously it was nowhere near as muchcarbohydrates as we eat nowand not as refined exactly that's rightwhat we eat right now but some peoplepoint to that as saying that the issueis not the carbohydrates the issue is iknow they do i know they do i justand but yeah but i i don't know how theycan say that because they're justthey're creating they're making up thescenario wherebecause as we just noted these same likethe kitavans they would eat a tuberousvegetable but it was roastedand you know or steamed or somethingthey're eating that whole thing andabsolutely their insulin would have comeup and come down the thing that peopledon't want to note in those samekitavans is that they're fasting insulinwas like two micro units per mil afantastically low insulin and my problemagain the reason i focus on the carbsnot to necessarily overlook the seedoils is that it's the refined starchesconsumed so frequently that result inthis never-ending insulin spike and soleading to a steady increase we knowthis in people that their fastinginsulin levels will get higher evenfasting insulin will get higher andhigher and higher the more they'reeating processed carbohydratesto the level that we are so the peoplewho are saying well these traditionalcultures ate tuberous vegetables andthey didn't have seed oils so it's notthe carbs that are the problem clearlyit's the seed oils i say well you'vecreated this false protection around thecarbohydrates when my idea is that itit's what's spiking the insulin too muchand if we were all just eating a boiledpotato once a daysimilar to the kitavans we would have noproblemso the seed oil advocatesi think in some instances have become ithink they've gone too far now theywould say well screw you ben you'reignoring the the seed oil data i'm notin fact i literally do experiments withlinoleic acid in my labi'm justjust thinking we have to make sure we'retalking about the whole story here andif someone only eliminated seed oils butthey continue to eatsugar all day long in the form of gummybears and things there'sthere's no question too much insulincauses insulin resistance that's beenwell documented i would say there's moreevidence there's this isn't i would ican't frame it that way there'sabsolutely more evidence over the pastdecades showing that elevated insulincauses insulin resistance then there isshowing that seed oils cause insulinresistanceso i have to i just can't ignore thatnow i'm not ignoring the data on seedoils and linoleic acid it is absolutelythere and so i give it i want to give itits proper dobut thosewho espouse that idea have gone i thinkthey've gone too farno i i agree with you i think uh youknow the the examples that are mentionedand sometimes they'll say well you knowirish people uh ate a lot of potatoesand during uhand they weren't overweight and i thinkof coursethere is some truth to that if you'renot getting fatuh if you're not getting uh if you'renot eating a lot of dietary fat thenyeah you can get away with morecarbohydrates but also the carbohydratesbefore the 20th century are just acompletely differentthey are completely different yeahthat's right and but but even still mymy main rule that first principle wascontrol carbohydrates don't get themfrom a bags or a bag or a box with abarcode and so whole fruits andvegetables they generally have such amodest insulin effect especiallyvegetablescompared to the tropical fruits likebananas pineapples mangoes but like yousaid safe we've changed those over thepast hundred years apples for examplearound the world apples used to be smalland bitter little thingsand we've bred them to become these bigsugar bombs and so even i mean this ishappening around the world so it becomesan easycritique of the kind of carbohydrateinsulin based view of insulin resistancei find it somewhatgalling just because these umnow we've just been criticizing sciencebut i literally create insulinresistance in cells in my lab across thehallway and and linoleic acid can can dothisbased on its effects on the fat cellum but but elevated insulin does as welland that happens through chronicconsumption of refined starchesyeah and i think in in the fiat standardi cite this book called brightlineeating by an author called susanthompson she does a very interestingcomparisonlooking at sugar and flour in particularshe says uh if you look at what hashappened with sugar and flour in the20th century thanks to industrializationit's very similar to what has happenedwith cocaine and heroinbasically opium andtheleaves are things that had existed amongthe human society for thousands of yearsand you know in peru andbolivia and many of those places it's acommon uh cultural thing thatis particularly if you have work so likea worker who wants to put in uh a wholeday of work and they want energyyou chew some coca leaves you get alittle bit of energy until you use it sothis is what it was and for hundreds andthousands of years this is what it waslike and then you get to the 20thcentury where you get to moderntechnology modern hydrocarbon energyallows us to process things so much moreefficiently and powerfully and cheaplyand then you start taking these cocaleaves you know essentially you wouldtake what it would take the averageworker maybe a week to chew throughand then you process it and you condenseit into a tiny little refined whitesubstance that people can snort veryquickly so you can consume and the sameis true with heroin and opiumumso you because of modern processingyou're able to get it in a highlyhighly palatable form you know you don'thave to spend time chewing in order toget to the uhthe essence of it you get the essencestraight awayand that's what makes it so enormouslyaddictive and destructive and she saysthat's exactly the same thing that hashappened with sugar and flour it used tobe extremely expensive and difficult toprocess sugar and flour and to be ableto consume them it's difficult to growplants that have sugar because they geteaten by um pests and other plants andeven if you do manage to grow them youknow you grow a little bit and thenthere'sthere's a limit to how much sugar youcan get you know you need to chewthrough a lot of apple and swallow a lotof indigestible matter in order to get atiny little bit of a sugar hitbut then the 20th century comes alongand now we've gotwhite sugar being sold for practicallynothing at a supermarket or we have pureapple juice you know where we've removedall the chewable stuff and now it's justpure fructose and and water it's i meanit's it's toxic i mean and i i be wedidn't talk about juice but as a parenti consider that to be one of the greattravesties of what parents areunwittingly doing to their childrenchildren should be drinking nothing butwhole milk and waterno no juice i mean fruit juice is is isa horrific just sugary it's like you'regiving them soda pop no absolutely it'sit's terrible and it's um and i see thisa lot in in like the health influencesor certain circlesobviously there's a lot i i think youknow you want to coloryou want to have a little bit ofskepticism about one kind offinancial interest that exists in thisindustry obviously nowhere near ascorrupt andbankrupt as the you know scientificestablishment butwithin the with you know within the umwithin the bro science circles it's notall the sunshine and rainbows it's notall perfect there is of course theslight bias whereinyou get to be more popular as aninfluencer if you tell people they canconsume more indulge in knowledgeit's human nature to want to be to wantvalidation in a destructive behavior yesand also you know if you tell peoplethat no you can have this sugar and youcan have that treat and you can havethat and you'll be fine obviously it'sgoing to sell better than the you knowthe the party pooper who's just going totell you no you shouldn't have any ofthat stuff and like i okay fine isympathize with peoplepeople are addicted everybody has theiraddictionsumbut like realisticallyyou see how this colors people'sanalysis so something like that like youeliminate seed oils and then carbs stopbeing a problem and so you see a lot ofthis kind ofumpeople who are you know just sugarjunkies and looking to justify theirsugar drinking saying oh just take outthe seed oils and then you can keepeating all the sugar that you wantnoit doesn't work that way no i meanwell i mean obviously you can i'm notyour mom you could do whatever you wantyeah right yeah but don't expect it toyield these great reward returns it's anand it's obviously much better thaneating garbage butrealistically it's not as good as justnot eating any of the sugar at all yepyeah all right peter has a couplequestions tooso if sorry sorry peter before you movegoingone more bro science question safe andit's entirely up to you you'll leavethis into your uh podcast i think i knowyou already know where i'm going whichisuh ben i heard you talk briefly abouttestosterone earlier in the showyeahthere's a big uh movement in uh thebitcoin space where uh the plebs like tosun their ballsuh what you'll takeare you seriousis this a euphemism are you mean likeactuallyyeah absolutely yeah there's evenspecial poses for it but you know mygosh this is a real thingand the the idea behind the bro scienceis that it stimulates uh you know the uhthe testosterone umin your body soi don't know if you've experimented thisin the lab but you knowyeah that'd be hard to get irb approvalfor[Laughter]yes so that's that's what bitcoinresearch is for let's fund it withbitcointhis is what an off site there's no irbin bitcoin if you get the coins you canspend them as you want oh that's how itused to be you guys that's how it usedto be i look at the work of whatscientists did in the field ofstarvation and feeding about 80 yearsago before the era of ayakus and irbsthat limit what you can do oh my goshthey were able to get away with so muchglorious work so anyway danieli i have never seen any paper publishedon this um now to to truly kind of thinkthrough the systemi i can't help but wonderhow that mechanic so i'm thinkingthrough the mechanism and maybe someonewould sayso cholesterol is honestly i i can't ican't fathom what the mechanism would bethe mechanism is that sunshine isobviously great for your skin i mean tryand hide from the sun for six monthsso so sunlightsometimes scientists can overcomplicatethings then well no no i knowbut but but let me just come backyeah so i mean sunlight does convertcholesterol into vitamin d so like i'mthinking what is the process wherebycholesterol which is the basis of allsex hormones all sex hormones come fromcholesterol which is why when you wagewar on cholesterol like through a statinlibido plummets in in men because you'redestroying their sex hormone productionbecause you're getting rid of thebuilding block so if sunlight convertscholesterol to vitamin di'm unaware of any effect where sunlightconverts cholesterol to sex hormones butso i i challenge that a little bit andi'm very familiar with that biochemicalpathway i teach lectures on this topicbut i also think evolutionarily if weneeded sunlight to have our testespromote more vitamin d they'd be on thetop of our head not literally notliterally tucked in the darkest spot onour body if we were walking around nakednow that sounds silly but i hope we canall kind of see that there's some wisdomto that if if if your point counterpointthen yeah if they didn't need sunshinethey would be inside your bodywell no that's temperature but that's agood counter but that's a temperaturephenomenon where sperm if it getsproduced at a higher body temperatureit's it's enact it's dead basically ithas to be a little cooler but but ithink that if if ifif our creation story were such that weneededsun exposure on our gonads on our testesto get enough vitamin d they would be onour back or on our shoulder theywouldn't be tucked in the darkest partof the body so i don't believe that itmakes any difference all right well justto finish up my question then if you domanage to get that funding i think thisis going to be the thing that peoplewant to fund you to look at you knowwhat though you guysif if there is any truth to this and andhonestly it would be very easy to makethese experiments i would say that willgive birth to a little device that has auv lampand you just simply tuck it between yourdrawersthey doyeah almost well no not portable deviceswell that no yeah exactlyregular tanning devicesyeah well that would be the way to do ityou just have a small little device andyou just crook it in your crotch andthen you're producing testosterone likegangbusters but but you guys in allsincerity are there reports of peoplewho have only done this independent ofany other therapy like they didn't golow carb and go carnivore which canincrease testosterone they didn't startworking out more which can also increasetestosteroneare you guys familiar is there anythingthat has removed all the confoundingvariables and said i literally didnothing butit put my sack in the sun and i hadhigher testosterone levels i believe ibelieve the uh respected bitcoin twitterscientific authority that is fartface2000 has conducted such an experimentand fart face 2000 is one of my uhreally paragons of truth and bitcoinokay you're not jokingi'm not joking i've met him i've met himbefore he's uh been to a couple of mydinners guys what have i got what have iwhat what have i gotten involved withwellandhe's a great guy he works in um i forgethis exact job he's he works inconstruction i think he's got us a areally successful job somewhere in newjersey like you're just a hard-workingvery smart guy who's just gotten intobitcoin at some point and he's likechallenging dogma yeah and he'll just ilike anything and follow it and do itand he and he was posting all of hisstuff he's like in his 50s i think andhe was you guys let me let me just saylamp and i think you get great resultswell i'll look them up um but you guysin all one very relevant variable hereas much as we fellas who want to bevirile and strong and tough focus ontestosterone the levels of testosteronein a man can vary widelyand it has no predictive power with hislean mass or his muscle mass what is amore predictive variable is that is theconcentration of testosterone receptorson muscle and bone so it's not just howmuch testosterone you have but how wellit's working where you want it to workand that is something that isvery affected by exercise you go out andexercise and you will increase androgenreceptor levels on muscleyou know almost immediately and it'llstay up so as much as wefocus on testosterone levels and theymatter to some degreea normal group of men will have levelsthat can vary almost by 10 timesand it will have nothing to do with howmuscled or you know ripped and viralthey are so i just that's kind of alittle bit of a counterum to this idea um but it's certainlycompellingyeah i mean this is i'll just add onesmall thing which is like myintuition is to just umfollow the fart faces of the worldrather than worry aboutthe mechanismbecause you know the way that scienceadvances is that people try things andthen they work and then they discoverthe mechanism so yeah yeah but but evenstill even still let's say he's exposinghimself to the suni can't help but sayum well he's just making more vitamin dand vitamin d is immune boosting it ismuscle it was bone mass yeah i guess soyou so you want to control you want to iwould just say there's a confoundingvariable here that that you just can'teliminatethat i think what you would want to dois get the same amount of sun exposurebut only difference being yeah you wouldcover that area between two groups ofpeople shouldn't be too difficult toorganize this voluntarily on twitterwell it sounds like there's a wholegroup of people who are lining up to bevolunteers i never would have imaginedi know i think we should do uhthe control group and uh yeahall right all right well peter's danielthat's awesome dude thanksi was happy to giveso my question was aboutthe reversibility of insulin resistanceso we've talked a lot about all thethings that can cause it in terms oflifestyle but if someone has alreadyentered say the pre-diabetes stageare they able to reverse throughlifestyle changes could they could theyreverse their insulin levels down to saythe levels that you're talking about inthe catalans or are they kind of beyondthe point ofa point of no return at some point yeahoh absolutely absolutely they can turnit around um in fact the reversal ofinsulin resistance by adopting this hasbeen well documentedin in india there are multiple casestudies published on this so i can speakto it with confidence umuh you have people who are so insulinresistant that they're on multiplemedicationslike like insulin taking insulin takingmetformin and other anti-diabetic drugsall you can do is start having themengage in fastingand low carb diet and within just weeksthey have to get off all of theirmedications because they've correctedthe problem so quicklyand so everyone who is either on theearliest stages where they just noticethey're a little chubby and they havehigh blood pressure or they're full ontype 2 diabetic which is like the mostobvious form of insulin resistance goingdown the roadthat can be turned around literally inweeks and and a person can start tolower their insulin in just the same daythat they decide i'm going to fast forthe next 24 hours and just drink waterand have maybe some saltto help my fast be a little easier theirinsulin levels will come down by byseveral um not orders but you know it'llgo half then third and then a quarter ofit it'll come down very very quickly andlike i said within just monthsweeks to months they're as insulinsensitive as a marathon runnerso yes very reversible it is the goodnews the gospel of metabolic research isthat if you use diet to cure the problemthen you've cured it but the food we eatis the culprit or the cure and when weacknowledge the relevance of food as thecause then we acknowledge that it alsocan be the cureokayso just one follow-up question then soin terms of the damage that insulinresistance doesif you're saying that it can be totallyreversed thenhow is the damage done is the damagedone cumulatively over time and thenwhen you get to a certain point you knowyou can't reverse the alzheimer's youcan't reverse the condition generatoryes that what a great questionunfortunately i can't give a universalanswer to that because it would betissue specificum let's take for example the musclewhen muscle becomes insulin resistantinsulin can't defend muscle protein aswell and you start to have a higher rateof what's called catabolism or just thebreakdown of the muscle protein whichincreases what's a situation calledsarcopenia a person who says musclesthat are getting wasted away that's partof insulin resistance you can correctthat the moment the muscle becomesinsulin sensitive then then muscleprotein gets defended and you'vecorrected the muscle wasting and thesame would go with the liver fatty liverdisease is the most common liver problemin in in the world and it uh is largelya result at least partly of chronicallyelevated insulin stimulating fatproduction in the liver well you startto lower the insulin and the fat startsto clear itself out so those are totallyreversiblethe brain appears to be somewhat uniquewhere it's its pathology towardsdementia is suchthat that i cannot say that insulinresistance is the only relevant variablebecause as you start to correct insulinresistance in the body of someone withalzheimer's yes it does improve thealzheimer's but it does not fullyreverse it so that either means there isa point of no return with the insulinresistance that maybe a part of thebrain has starved enough that it's nowdead and cannot be resurrected or itsuggests that there is another variablethat we just haven't identified yetwe know it's not plaques because thatappears to have nothing to do with itbut it does suggest that there's some itcould be a differenceone of the other theories of alzheimer'sor contributors is iron metabolism andit could in fact safe i know you hadum oh what's his namemangum yeah yeah he's a big iron guy forexample so he's a good one i could referpeople to but we know although he does idon't think he talks about iron inalzheimer's but we know that iron canaccumulate and disrupt um the the thewhat's called a redox balance andoxidative stress in the brain so that'san additional inputthat might not get addressed in somepeople and that's that's somewhat of agenetic component as well as you knoweating supplemented foods with ironwhich which so many we all do if itcomes in a bag or a box with a barcodeit's got some kind of iron supplementedinto it rather than the heme iron thatyou get from say beefum but anyway yeah so some problemswhich aren't entirely a result ofinsulin resistance and alzheimer's mightbe that aren't going to be totallyreversible that's maybe the safest wayof saying it who else has got questionsyeah i just thought that um on thetanning and discussion we had previouslyif it if it could be possible that theskin on your body that has not beenexposed to the sun at allmaybe um it can absorb more vitamin dyeah absolutely the darker thecomplexionyeah the harder it is to have the uvlight convert the cholesterol intovitamin d which is why in general thefairer the complexion you know i'm apasty white guy um i would make a lotmore vitamin d say if you have a darkercomplexion than me kind of middleeastern complexion you would need moresunyou know like the vitamin d that i'dmake in five minutes you would needmaybe 20. you know so so andreabsolutely um but that is again aconfounding variable to this study thatwould make it difficult is it are theyfeeling better just because there's moretestosterone but again testosteronelevel is only part of the variable it'stestosterone receptor concentration butyeah it could be that you're making morevitamin d because that's such a fairlycomplected skin by fair i mean likelighter complected that you can justmake more vitamin d with a given unit uhgiven you the exposure per time hithis was a very great conversationuh so my question is also one broscience about sunscreenshall we use itor is it better to go so naturally yeahyeah so i'm uniquely qualified to answerthat question because i sunburn soreadily you know you ask that questionto someone else and they say i neverneed sunscreen and they don't theyliterally don't get burned i burnum now i know a lot of people say justdon't eat seed oils and you won'tsunburn anymore that is just not true umthat is just not true some skincomplexions just burn so i would ratherget a sunburn than put sunscreen on mybodyno question i don't even have to thinkabout it so what i but i don't like toget sunburnedso i will just kind of dose my sunexposure if i'm out at a beach or at apool or whatever with the kids i willabsolutely strip down to my just my myswim shorts and i will get some sun fora good chunk of time then when i feellike i'm reaching a limit i'll put on ashirt and just put on a hat and continueto enjoy the sun i will not putsunscreen on it is so there are so manychemicals in that that get readilyabsorbed into the bloodstream i wouldrather get a sunburn than have sunscreenon my bodynow if you're putting on like a zincoxide kind of but then you look allpasty white and weird you knowbut even still i want some sun exposureespecially on the trunk of my body iwant to make vitamin d i want to set mycircadian rhythms such that my melatoninknows when to be suppressed and it knowswhen to turn onso it there are so many benefits to sunexposure that the more you're blockingthissun effectthe more you're undoing a really healthboost and unfortunately because we liveunder fake light in in buildings all daylong with uv protection on our windowswe never are getting sunlight um so ithink people ought to make a pointeven if you're justifying the sunexposure bysaying that your testes need somesunlight then whatever sunlight is justa good thing but i'm i'm very opposed tosunscreenuh can i just follow up also about thethe sun because there's a lot of attackon the sunso would you comment that sunlightmakes you olderif you are avoiding sun that you willlook younger in the older ageand also if you sunburn more will youhave a higher risk of canceryeah yeah yeah good question um soeverybody know please i'm answeringthese questions with a little bit ofspeculation you know i'm a metabolicmitochondria guy these are topics thati'm familiar with but i'm not anauthority on them but i have enoughfamiliarity to have an opinionum so so with sunumit does appear that the more someone isgetting blistering sunburns the morethey will develop skin canceryeah now getting a little pink no idon't see that there's any there's neverbeen correlation but these are allcorrelational studies which i have agreat deal of disdain forand i'm sure this is a group whoappreciates causal studies compared tocorrelational studies all of this iscorrelational where they just happen tosee people who are getting blisteringsunburns will tend to have more skincancer there are a lot of differenttypes of skin cancerand you can have people with very darkcomplexions who don't get any sunburnsever and yet they can still get skincancers because there's just so manydifferent typesand then dorian what was the otherquestion sunburn and cancer and thenwhat was the the first oneyeah sothe people who are attacking thesunlightthey are sayingyeahyeah no i i i don't know i mean i don'tbuy that really um what i do know isthat the higher someone's glucose levelsare allow me to kind of hijack thatquestion and bring it back to somethingi do know whether sun can cause wrinklesi i don't know i've never seen a studyon thatum but i i do know that high levels ofglucose will create what's called a wecall it a my art reaction that canhappen on the skin you guys know a myyard reaction is what happens when youwhen you char something like when welike safe wants some beef he puts it inhis sous vide machine and then no onewants to eat the meat right out of thesous vide you go sear itin that kind of crisp sear that's what'scalled a mayard reaction and a part ofthat is what's happening it happens lesson the meat but it can happen onvegetables from takingglucose molecules and then convertingthem due to the heat or in this case dueto the sun exposure so when someone isgetting a lot of mild reactions that canin fact cause wrinkled skinand soum i would say it's less sun and itwould be more what are your glucoselevelsthank youyeah i mean my personal experience isthat you will burn if you're not uhexposed to sunlight a lot so if you'vespent the winter innorth americaand you fly to mexico in march and thenspend a week in the sun you will burnand it could get ugly couldcould be very bad but if you graduallyum introduce your sun to sunlight if youmake sure that even during the winteryou get exposed as much sun as you canand then you'reif you don't um up the dose of sunlightonceat once then your body will justgrow into it and i'll be able to handlemore and more sun soum i i could spend hours in the sunlightand i don'tbut again who knows i could be wrong itcould be her hiring me in certain wayssowho knowsall right anybody else have any morequestions we'vegone for well it's been two hours and 15minutes almostbut does anyone have any more questionsben oh yeah i've just got a quick oneben on your take um it's back to theinsulin management uh an old supplementbeen around forever called berberineyepyep and so in fact i did a i hate topush anyone to instagram i i found thati initially was on twitter i alsostarted doing more kind of littlelessons on instagram and i did one aboutberberine just because there's so manythere's so much um curiosity about itberberine absolutely works there'sabundant peer-reviewed umplacebo-controlled double-blindedclinical studies which is the best wecan get assuming that everyone's honestwith itthat absolutely show that berberine doesimprove insulin sensitivity and it doesso by activating this little enzymecalled ampk which the moment ambk isactivated which berberine turns on itwill stimulate glycol uh it'll stimulatesugar burning so lowering sugar bloodsugars lowering insulin overallimproving insulin sensitivity so ifsomeone were to go to their physicianand the physician said ah you havepre-diabetes i want to put you on a drugcalled metforminmetformin actually works through a verysimilar mechanism to berberine i wouldsay not that i'm giving anyone clinicaladvice of course i would say you knowwhat maybe try the berberine firstbecause it yes it will have a moremodest effect than metformin will but italso doesn't have the kind of gutwrenchingside effects that metformin hasliterally gone thank you i i gave upsugar about six months ago which waskind of painful but uh opted to uh starttaking 500 milligrams of berberine andnoticed a dramatic i mean it's you knowwhat good for youi was tricky you know as far as you kindof have this lethargic kind of i don'tknow you described it earlier and asyou're trying to get away from thesugars and just uh just burning yourfats if you will um but now it's justlike normalized and you know if you'regoing to go out and do a heavy like woodcutting day which i do a lot of yeahmaybe i don't think that day yeah youknow what also you should try if you'remonitoring your blood sugars at alleveryone could do this it worksremarkably well add a little bit of rawunfiltered apple cider vinegar into yourclub soda or a cup of waterit's it's remarkable these little it'spart of it's part of the lessonsactually doing thatgood for you and it's it's just alltogether just i just was curious on whatyou're really in depth with a lot ofthis stuff and you know i'm just more orless triangulating i've picked up inother places um yeah i think a bigproponent of david sinclair aging guyhas has reallyguided down that lineyeah so david sinclair is more of abiohacker than i'm comfortable with heloves to promote a certain number ofsupplements he's also from harvard sohe's out there to sell a lot ofstuff well the fact he is he is a bit ofa shill yep yep so i've i've reallystarted to lose respect for him anyonelike him who tells people to take thesedrugs like metformin is a drug he tellspeople to takeand and i think what an asinine piece ofadvice to to suppose that thisforeignman-made substance is somehow going tohelp you live longer when and we know inhumansmetformin works by damaging mitochondriaalbeit slightly but this is whyyou show that people who undergo undergoaerobic exercise which i never do i onlydo resistance training for best bang forthe buck but people who undergo aerobicexercise will have bigger strongermitochondriabut when they take metformin it undoesall of the mitochondrial adaptationsthat exercise it puts you back tobaseline and i don't know how someonecould justify taking a drug that wherewe all say everyone would agree exerciseis a key to living a longer healthierlife oh but also take this drug the factthat it will undo the benefits ofexercise well that's just aninconvenient truth i want to be popularand so if i promote all these cleverbiohacking substances people are goingto adore me for iti think he's just gone too far yeah andalso it's it's all the same climatehysteria nonsense and you shouldn't eatmeat then you should eatyou know this magic little grape that ifyou have three grapes in the morningthen yep yep that's right that's what isaid the thing about super foodseveryone says all these super foods justthis molecule and grapes and no i meanit's so silly it's just so silly tothink that humans evolved to need thesekinds of silly little things when ourancestors would have never eaten grapesthey ate yeah and i mean thevast majority of humans have had zeroexposure to the vast majority of plantsfor all their lives like oh the vastmajority of that's right you see in yoursupermarket were only ever available toyour ancestors we yeah we had to breedthem we had to breed them in a way toreduce the toxins and enhance what canbe digestible and and give us energy wehave in our in our clever technologicalerahave created plants from plants thatwould have been inedible in a previousgenerationthank you so much for all of this thishas been absolutely amazing umi really really enjoyed it thank you somuch thank you so much for all your workthank you for really just focusing theflashlight of truth on the thing thatmatters like just stop eating garbageyou get healthy and then you know letthe fiat people argue about their papersforever and their mechanisms and allthese weird acronyms butum the most important thing people needto know is just don't eat garbage yeahwhile they're while they're strugglinggetting papers peer-reviewed i'll be outsharing truthyeah i'll be out eating steak at sharingthe truth that's rightand thriving basically

obesitydiabetes and dementiahe has he earned his phd inbioenergetics and was a post-doctoralfellow in metabolic disorders at dukenational universityof singapore and he joins us today for adiscussion on the topic of why we getsick which is also the title of hisbest-selling book which has beentranslated towhat is it now 20 i think languages wellno not quite about halfway there yeahbut some relevant ones yesso thank you for joining us benoh my pleasure safety thanks so much toyou and the team for getting me on it'sit's it's great to be chatting to you ithink uh your perspective on um diseasein your book is is a very interestingand very refreshing one and it's um whati like about it is that it gets to theheart of the matter in a very practicalway in a sense of you know how can youactually not get sickrather than getting lost in academicdebates and academic pissing contestswhich canbe too often the case in academia soit's good to keep your eye on the prizeon what matters and i think this is thisis what your book doesso let's get right to it why do we getsickyeah yeah thanks again i actually likethe way you framed this because we bothyou and i i think uh share a commondisdain foracademia and it's ironic a little maybefor me i don't mean for it to soundungrateful because i am a professorat a university currently andi amso mindful of the nonsense that happensat universities and so it was very muchan interest of mine to takethe knowledge that we scientists aregainingand go break through the barrier ofyou know the traditional model for uswould be that we publish a paper in apeer-reviewed journal and no one everreads it except a handful of otherscientists and it and thus is largelyirrelevant to actually improvingsomeone's life i really wanted tocircumvent that futile cycle of academiaand take relevant information right topeople so the question why do we getsick you know i naturally was looking atthisquestion through my lens and i mytraining is in kind of metabolicbiochemistry and physiologyand i couldn't help butsee there wasone common foundationto virtually every non-communicablechronic disease so the chronic diseasesthat you getwith that have nothing to do with youknow infectionand you know this is like cancers andheart disease alzheimer's diseasediabetes kidney disease etcandof course each of these problems haveunique inputsi want i would want everyone to knowthat that each of these problems do haveunique origins but they all haveone common origin and that is insulinresistance it is this disorder thatpeoplei mean the reason i didn't call my bookwhat is insulin resistance is why doesit matter is because i knew no one wouldbuy it they would look at the title andthey would say well i'm not a diabetic idon't need to read that they just seeinsulin and they think diabetes butinsulin is an absolute life-givinghormone it is essential you have to haveit and which and if you don't likeuntreated type 1 diabetes you will diein short order so this is an essentialhormone that literally impactsevery cell of the bodythere's no exception to this i don't usethe term literally too liberally likethe kids do these days there's it is itliterally affects every cell in the bodyand it dictates the theme of whatinsulin does is it tells the cell whatto do with the energy that it hasso whatever the the nutrient or thecaloric energy isthat's in the system that's coming inthe system or it's already storedinsulin will tell the cell what to dowith it and thus it's pretty essentialevery cell needs energy neverthelessinsulin resistance is a disorder todefine it now explicitly it's really acoin with two sides or a disorder withtwo facets that must come together youcannot have one side of the coin withoutthe other the first part of thisdefinition of what insulin resistance isis that insulin as a hormone isn'tworking as well as it used to thatevokes the kind of resistance part of itthat some cells aren't responding verywell but then the second part of it isvery often overlooked but equallyessential to understand why it's sopathogenic why insulin resistance issuch a problem and that is that insulinlevels are chronically elevateda condition called hyperinsulinemia soyou have the two of these togetherinsulin isn't working correctly andblood insulin levels are elevated andboth of those together constitute thethe background for so many of thesechronic disorders or diseases you knowfor exampleand then i can finish the answer becausei'm getting long-winded but let's takethe two most common forms of infertilityin women the most common form ofinfertility is a disorder calledpolycystic ovary syndrome pcosand this is a disorder of too muchinsulin and that is why if a woman haspcosshe absolutely has insulin resistanceand but not because the insulin isn'tworking well but because it's too highand when insulin levels get too high ina woman it actually inhibits the ovariesability to create normal balances of sexhormones she can't make estrogens aswell as she could before and she failsto ovulate and now she has polycysticovary syndrome but in a manthe most common infertility is erectiledysfunctionand that's a problem of the insulin notworking well not the elevated insulinper se but again you still have both ofthose things always happening togetherbut in his case for normal erectilefunction you have to have a significantvasodilation or the blood vessels haveto dilate and alter blood flowaccordingly but when the blood vesselsbecome resistant to insulin effectsinsulin which normally is providing thatdilation effect can'tinduce dilation as well and the bloodvessels stay constricted and theconstricted blood vessels means erectiledysfunction so that's such a it's aninterestingdichotomy looking at the two forms ofinfertility in women and men where eachof them is caused by a different aspectof insulin resistance yeah and it's justsomething that continues to come up withall kinds of medical conditions isastonishing even as a non-doctori would say probably especially as anon-doctorit just keeps coming upyou know you you hear about a certaincondition or you know somebody who getssick in something because with somethingand you read more about it you hear themtalk about itandthis always comes up you know there'salways thismention of sugar blood blood sugarlevels insulin levels insulin resistanceit's implicated in so many things what ifind fascinating and you know i i'd liketo kind of uh switch back and forthbetween the academic topic itselfand the way that academics study itbecause that's another focus of my workwhich i discussed in the fiat standardof um just how academia isessentially massively compromised and agiantattack on your ability to understand theworld and reason properly it's not justthat they're doing um innocuous nonsensethat nobody cares about it's thatthey're actively preventing people fromunderstanding what the problem isbecauseyou knoweven as a non-specialist you see thisthing come up everywhere and then if youdo one day in your life try and say heylet me just take a look at this let mesee if i can bring my blood sugars downfor a while and see what i can do andsee what effect it has on me and thenall these different kinds of healthproblems that you thought were just thenormal part of growing up disappear andyou're back to being healthy andpowerful and strong in many waysand so you would imagine you know theyyou'd imagine doctors would be out thereshouting this from the rooftops tellingeverybody to hey you know focus on thislittle thing called insulin your bloodsugar try and keep that downif you are overweight if you're diabeticif you have all these um problemsdementiayou likely benefit from this and yetinstead what we see isjust like with economics we see thesenerds that parrot out complicated wordsthat obfuscate thingsand then ultimately lead to youcontinuing to eat the garbage confusedand not knowing what's going on and ithink the really sad thing is you knowhow many people will umin academia i mean if you if you look atdebates online you know you have allthesegreat instagram and twitter uh socialmedia fitness influencers who've beenout there training clients for years andknow what works and know what doesn'twork and know that you know if you'reoverweight and you want to get in shapelay off the junk do this do that andthey know what works and they're outthere arguing with these overweightusually uh university professors who areout there telling them noyou guys are not authorities you don'tunderstand you're focusing on bloodsugar that's been debunked here's someobscure paper from pubmedabout how actually it's not blood sugarthat matters it's all these othergenetic slash they'll say it's saturatedfat yeahyeah or some other thing or the otherbut you know just whatever you do justmake sure you don't try to cut down onyour sugar intake and you don't lower itlower your insulin levels butthe evidence for it i mean everybody whotries it basically i don't know anybodywho's tried reducing their blood sugarlevels and their insulin levelsand reducing the level of informationthat they've done and have and anddidn't feel better from it and yetacademia continues toignore thisyeah yeah so why do you think this isthe caseyeah well i think there's there'scompeting interests without a doubtum and i very much appreciate theaudience that i have here which isif i may define this group in such a wayat least one attribute would be a heartyskepticismand that's one that i share indeed allscientists by their very nature shouldshare that skepticism the job of ascientist is to try to prove a theoryfalse and now we have thisthis this flipping of science into areligion where people are proud to justproclaim i believe in science and as ascientist i think that is a terriblyunscientific way to view scienceif you're a scientist everyone shouldthink like a scientist in a way if i maysay it like that without sounding smugwhich is we should all be trying tounderstand truth by challenging what wethink we know and now it is just wellthis person said something i like and soi believe in science oh but you're ascientist who's saying somethingdifferent well you're going to beostracized and removed from politesociety but you you brought up a lot ofrelevant points that i just have toelaborate on brieflypart of the problem with conventionalkind of biomedical care or clinical careis that we havewe have based an enormous amount of ourview of metabolic health purely on bloodglucoseand i'm not saying blood glucose doesn'tmatterbut the problem with that view thisglucocentric view of metabolic health isthat we have overlooked insulincompletely and i've given talks toclinicians you know physicians andnurses and physician assistants and iwill saywe are too obsessed with glucose we needto look at insulin and it becomes almosta circular discussion where they willsay we don't need to look at insulinbecause we're measuring glucose and it'skind of the same and i have to teachthem that they're not the same that youcan have someone who's coming in everyyear for their annual checkup and theglucose levels are staying normalstaying normal but what's happeningbehind the scenes is insulin is goinghigher and higher and higher in order totry to keep the blood sugar in checkand that is this exact paradigm ofnormal glucose levels but elevatedinsulin several times higher than whatit should be is insulin resistance andthen it's only once the body has becomeso resistant to insulinone ofwhose jobs it is is to help lowerglucose that the glucose levels start toclimb and now it gets on the clinicalradar but but the problem doesn't endthere so the first problem is by failingto look at insulin we failed to detectthe problem as soon as we could detectit but the next problem is just as badwhich is our obsession with loweringglucose the moment the glucose doesstart to climba conventional clinician conventionalthinking scientist and clinician will beto say let's just give you insulin andlike in a person who's insulin resistantthey'll say let's just push the insulinup and yeah that will lower the glucosebut the more we knowthis is amply published review data forwhatever that's worth because we all gotto be skeptical even of published datanowadays but we know that the more youpush insulin up in an insulin resistanttype 2 diabetic in order to control theglucose they may have normal or idealglucose levels and yet we're killingthem they're three times more likely todie from heart disease and twice aslikely to die from alzheimer's diseaseand cancer so we are killing when wegive an insulin resistant type 2diabetic more insulin it's like we'regiving an alcoholic another glass ofwine hoping it will solve the problemwhen in reality we're giving them moreof the very thing that's causing theproblem too much insulin is a primarydriver of insulin resistance so why onearth would we give them more insulin totry to correct the glucose we make surein so doing that the person gets fatterand sicker and they die fasterbutso much of the problem is that theclinicianespecially if these are in the u.s likemedicare patients it just extends ithink the nhs and the uk has the samekind of target canada i know does andsafe i very much appreciated yourcriticism on social media of canadianhealthcare i was born and raised incanada and me and all of my nine myeight siblings all nine of us got out ofcanada as quickly as we couldum because of in part the ridiculoushealth care but nevertheless um wethe the the clinical model is based onthe clinician will have targets withtheir patient and it will say you needto lower their glucose by you know onepercent of hemoglobin a1c or lower theirglucose by 20 points to try to get itinto a normal range and if they don't doit the clinician gets punishedthey do get docked on the amount ofmoney they can bill for that patient'svisits and so the clinician has thisperverse incentive to say well i justneed to push up your insulin any way ican and and if it's making you fatterand sicker and putting you on more drugsat least it's lowered your glucose andthat's one of the clinical markers i'mgoing to get graded on but at the end ofit all underlying all of thisin my kind of concluding thought forthis rant is that while we're givingpeople all these clever expensive drugsto try to lower their glucose levels theone little rational person on the sidei'm one of them and i get ostracized forit i've been criticized and i've beenthreatened with my position here whereyou will just say you're giving thepatient all these drugs to lower theirglucose why not just have them eat lessglucoseand oh no no no you can't you can't saythat you're accused of heresytruly i've been accused of teachingprinciples that are against science eventhough i strictly rely on publishedhuman clinical trials to defend my viewsand yet it's just too heretical are yousuggesting that people can live withoutdoritos and pringles every day i meanwhat kind of insaneinsane insane cruel doctor are you iknow do you have no regard for humanneeds like how could people yeah i knowhow could people not eat twinkies everyday like how can you not make that thecenter of your world view and this thisis this is what it really comes down tobecause i mean you you keep as youexplain i mean it's just insane that youwould want to raise their insulin levelsrather than reduce the sugar levels ithink one metaphor that i've come upwith to try and explain this to peopleis that it's the equivalent of you havea dirty apartment and you're trying toget somebody to clean up your apartmentand you keep hiring people to clean upthe apartmentand you're getting you're somehowignoring the fact that every day um yourson say comes into the apartment andtakes a big giant jug of pepsi and justturns it inspills it in the middle of the room andthen the cleaning person has to spendall their time just cleaning that up andthen everything else in the house fallsapart and gets dirty because every daywe have this giant mass ofsludgy sugaronthe everywhere that needs to be cleanedout and soif you think the answer is hiring morecleaning peopleyou're not going to make it becausethere's no limit to how muchyou can spill on umin a house like it takes one second tospill uh an amount of liquid sludgethat's going to take three hours toclean you know yeah it just goeseverywhere that it requires a lot ofcleaning soit's insane that medicine takes the pathof just hire more cleaning staffanddon't worry about the cause of thethe disintegration and that's yeah yeahyeah the paradigm ought to be let's putlet's um bring less garbage inand see what that doesrather than continuing to bring more andmore garbage in and hiring more and morecleaners to try to keep up for it let'sjust start putting less garbage in theapartment this is this is the amazingthing and this is this is the thing thatnone of the this is it's exactly likewith economics like with with theeconomists there there's just nevergoing to be a mainstream economist whohas a phd at an important university andat the fed or any of that stuff who'sgoing to come out and say you know whatmaybe we should just try hard money weshould try not inflating we should trynot doing all of that stuff no here'show my magic formula for managing themoney supply is actually going to umallow us to magically havegovernment spending at no cost here'show i am going to defy the rules ofphysics anduh nature and allow us to eat our seedcorn and still plant the same seed cointhat we eat this is essentially how itworks in politics and economics and it'skind of what works in nutrition it'sjustthe mentality of indulgence no we can'tsacrifice the sugary treats and we mustfind a way tomanage it it's it's like you know how dohow do wefix laptops that um get destroyed byhammers by their ownersi meanthere's just never going to be asuccessful science of fixing laptopsdestroyed by hammers because the hammerscan always destroy a laptop beyondbeing able to fix it the best method isjust not destroy it yeah yeah no it's ait's absolutely i believe there aresufficient competing interests that thatwe we are able to prop up so manyeconomies or that might not be the wordto use in an audience like this we wereable to prop up so many entities bytelling people to eat whatever you wantand then we have drugs and health carethat will help you deal with theconsequences and it's just a way ofspending more money on things that wecould go back to that first principle ofum eat better well all right but thensome okay but then the drug companiesaren't going to be able to sell as muchdrugs well then the hospitals aren'tgoing to be able to have as many sickpatients and so we have these sick basedeconomies that will sufferwell of course we shouldn't care aboutthat we want to be live long and healthybut there are all these competinginterests that i mean you there was justrecently a report published by thenutrition center at harvard university imean and this deserves all of ourdisdain and again it makes me ashamedof academia and my fellowquote unquote scientists where theyrankedmini wheats cereal higher than eggs andsteakon on the scale of nutritionin other words mini wheats was better bya wide margin they said that frostedmini wheats the cereal is better forsomeone than eggs and better for someonethan steak i i don't know on what planetthat could be stated other than theirsufficient competing interest like takefor example the american dieteticsassociation which you knowpromotes a lot of these things look atwho funds themit is not the american ranchersassociation they wish they could fundthem but the american dieteticsassociation is so opposed to animalbased products much to the detriment ofevery human on the planetbut it's it's justwho's paying the bills i mean it's avery cynical view and and it requiresit's not been comfortable for mebecause it has made it difficult for meto stay in good standing with sayexample the american diabetesassociationwherethe the conventional advice even to atype 2 diabetic who has plenty ofinsulin in their body it is literallyeat whatever you want but cover it withyour insulin just give yourself moreinsulin yeah it's a wonderful way tosell insulin it's a wonderful way tomake sure these patients are going tothe hospital very very often becausethey're very very sickwe could just say you know eat a littlebetter by that we mean eat less glucoseif you're insulin resistant that as mostpeople are worldwide this is not anamerican unique to the west this is avery much a problem in southeast asiait's very much a problem in the middleeast the most diabetic countries on theplanet are in the middle east numbersone through nine and this is this is aglobal situation we just have to tellthe peopleeat less processed sugars and processedgrains if that is just the simplest stepum that's number one for me that isfirst principle number one controlcarbohydratesbecause it's refined carbohydrates thatare going to spike insulin the most andkeep it elevated and the sooner we lowerinsulin the sooner all these metabolicissues including alzheimer's diseaseincluding certain cancers start to getbetteryeah and if you've uh you know if youhave an internet connection and you'reeven marginally curious about the topicof you know how not to be fat how not tobe sick how not to be diabeticand you just search the internet with alittle bit of an open mind you won't beable to miss the fact that there areliterally millions of people around theworld who have improved their healthhealth immeasurablyby cutting down on eating processedfoods sugary foodfoods that are high in glucose and youknow there arethousands of different ways you can doit thousands of different diets somepeople call it low carb high fat somepeople do low carb low fat some peopledo keto some people do or paleo but allof these things they have one thing incommon youget far fewer glucose spikes and hencefar fewer insulin spikes and whicheverway you take to do that you know mypersonal way to do that is just i eatonly red meat and i drink only water andit's perfect because oh that's adynamite i mean really safe it's sofunny to me everyone raves these daysabout oh eat this berry it's a superfoodor this this this kale green it's asuperfoodand it's so silly to me it is so sillybecause if you want to talk to me iwould say a superfood is a food thatliterally gives you every nutrient youneed in order to survive well that isany ruminant meat so beef exactly ifsomeone eats beef or really any ruminantanimal they're going to literally getevery nutrient they need to survive andthat is why like you mentioned a humancan literally eat nothing but beefand and survive and thrive and thrivethat's right not just survive they willthrive the strongest leanest healthiestpeople i know are the people who arejust pure carnivoreyeah absolutely and i i've tried itmyself i started doing it i think uh bythe end of this month it'll be sevenyearsand it's really been seven years andthere's no going back like once you'vetried being free man uh yeah once you'vetried being superman you never want toeat kryptonite again that's right wellsaid always want to be supermanand uh but i mean i understand you knownot everybody wants to go this far butstill if you're going to um want to makea difference in your health you have toreduce the amount of incident spikesthat you get and it's such a simple ideaand it's so easy there are so manylow-hanging fruits that you could takeout of your diet i mean i remember wheni first became curious about this i meanit's just simply being aware about noteating the bread before the lunch thatthey put there at the restaurantreducing the amount of bread in thesandwichcutting outthe excess soda that i was drinking justdrinking a little bit of soda i meanjust these low hanging fruits that nowsound completely uh undesirable to mebut just these tiny little changes thatweren't even a big issue immediatelymade a huge difference in my head yeahyeah and everybody i know who's donethis has um has witnessed this now forme i just kept on removing more thingsand just feeling better and better andbetter and i i've continued to go on buti i see it with so many people that it'sit's amazing for me that so many peopledon't notice just this think from thisperspective of just pick the low-hangingfruitand that's a far better use of your timethan arguing with academics oh my goshyeah on twitter i mean this is this isthe thing why i mean i honestlythere is absolutely nothing you willeverthat you could ever show me that iswritten in pubmed that will matter to memore than what i know from what my mybody feels yeah you're in becausei look yeah yeah my n of one which is memy own body i've tried because this isthe thing the scientific thing you knowpeople talk about science science theythink science is you know you just goand read on pubmed what some[Music]um procter gamble sponsored uh scientisthad to write in order to keep his joband you think that that's science nothat's not science that's appealed toauthority as the exact opposite ofscience science is experimentation soactually try and remove this from yourfood see how you feel look at your bloodsugar levels look at your insulin levelslook at all these health problems thatyou have you know you'll be able to tellif they're improving or they're gettingworse that there's no escaping it's yourbody you'll be able to tell and mostpeople just completely ignore that andwon't want to look at it and this isthis is why i you know the term fiatscience is accurate in many ways it'snot just that it's financed by fiat butit's also that it intends to enforcethis fiat scientific reality by fiat youknow that it by rule it's not just byfiat money it's also by government rulelike this no your body can handle a dietconsisting of twinkies and doritos andthere's nothing wrong with it becausehere's a bunch of garbage in pubmed thatproves it because it's fine they wouldthey would go further they would go forthey would literally say you're betterfor it eat these sugary cereals and itis better for you not only you canhandle it they will they will literallyrank it and give it a green goodscorei mean all it does is encourageindulgence promoting sicknesspromoting propping up industries andentities that have no business survivingand truly the truly criminal thing aboutit is not just that you're promotingsomething you're promoting somethingthat's highly addictive that's designedto be highly addictive it's designed byfood scientists have spent decadesfiguring out the exact best combinationsto trigger the reward centers in yourbrain to make you a slaveto that oreo cookie or to that snickersbar whatever it is these people haveknow what they're doing so there's thenotion you know that harvard is popularpopularized this idea that everything isgood in moderationis is is extremely pernicious it'sextremely delicious i agreei i i rail against that view the themoderation in all things is a popular umdietitian's bannering like rallying cryand all it does all that is is ajustification for indulgence and ittotally ignores the fact that mostpeople can't moderatei i i have to moderate highly addictivewell that's my pointand so there was this beautiful quote bysaint augustine who saidabstinence is easier than perfectmoderation and so they would say we'lljust have one small bowl i kind of comeback to cereal like many wheat becausethat's kind of my addiction that i'maware of like they will say just eat onelittle bowl of cerealand and sure if you could only eat onelittle bowl of cereal a half cup orwhatever the serving size is all rightyou know you could get away with thatfor a long time but you don't you neverstop there and so it is easier for theperson to look at that ice cream or thatbread or whatever and just sayi know that once i start eating it iwon't stop until i've eaten half theloaf or i won't stop until i've eatenthat whole pint of ice cream and so i'mjust not going to startso moderation in all things ignoreshuman tendency as most people do toengage in addictive self-destructivebehaviors especially with foods that areliterally as you said designed to beaddictive and they always consist ofrefined starches and sugars safe nobodynobody is sitting around on a fridaynightthe kids are in bed the house is cleanthey turn on a show with their withtheir significant otherand they they say oh man i sure coulduse a plate of scrambled eggsno oneis sitting there craving scrambled eggswhat they crave is something sweet andgooey or salty and crunchy it's going tobe a refined carbohydrate that is why myrule number one control carbs and theeasiest way to do that is if it comes ina bag or a box with a barcodeavoid it don't even open it it's notgoing to work if it's going to be ifyou're going to have a carbohydrate keepit in as unadulterated form as possiblea whole fruit or a whole vegetable butthen don't just thinkwhat i would worry is that in thisconversation so far people are onlyhearing this kind of denial denial avoidthis avoid this avoid this but in orderfor it to be sustaining you need toreplace it so replace it with proteinand fat which have little to no insulineffect those are for me rules number twoand three one control carbs twoprioritize protein from animal sourcesand three don't fear fat everyevery animal protein on the planet whichare the best proteins for humans to eatwell every organism to eat um they canevery animal protein comes with fatthere is literally no exception to thatdon't be afraid of the fat that comeswith that protein you will digest itbetter you will digest the proteinbetter and it will help blunt theinsulin the even modest insulin responseto the protein steak the best protein ithas fat eggs egg whites the best proteinthat has the yolk there's no exceptionso protein and fat come together that'show we should eat it don't try to avoidall that fat it is nutritious it is infact essentialwe need to have it but those are thethree rules of an insulin controllinglife-promoting dietyeah i'll uh my personal uh advice thati give to people who uh do this andagain i'm of course i'm not a doctor besure to check with your obese doctoryeah neither of us are giving a clinicaladvice here but we would give it betterthan[Laughter]yeah but i mean what i tell people isthe best way to avoid carbohydrates isyou don't want to fight a defensive warwhere you're hungry and you're trying torestrict yourself that doesn't workthat's right i mean it can work but itrequires an enormous amount of willpoweryep butyou don't have to do that that's reallypunishing yourself that's that's likeyou know you're you you're playing asoccer game blindfold if you're tryingto do it with the uh with that there'sno reason to do that to yourself thebest way to do it is to fill yourself upwith protein and fatfirst thing in the morning every daythink of that as almost like your jobyou know you wake up and the first thingyou dois youfocus on getting at least a pound offattyred meat in youand thenyou've already won 90 of the battleagainst these carbohydrates because thecravings are going to be very differentif you had a pound of beef and you see apint of ice cream it's very different ifyou've had a pound of beef and youhaven't had a pound of beef it'scompletely different so i sayi personally don't usually havebreakfast i only have two meals a dayyep yeah but i think in the transitionperiod if you're used to eating sugaryfood and you want to cut down on sugar iwould recommend starting the day withfatty meat and justfilling up on it and then that that'sgoing to reduce you know without youeven putting in any effort you're justgoing to end up eating less sugar thanusually i have 100 i i agree with thisperspective completely and indeed save iwould say there is significant humanevidence to to defend this so as much asialso criticize the published body ofliterature the tragedy is there are allof these valid gems that have beenpublished and just completely overlookedbecause it doesn't fit the popular iwould that fiat narrative which is wehave to promote something in order togenerate these this kind of artificialwealth through drug companies and inmedicine but if if a person can followthe adage of breakfast like a king lunchlike a prince and dinner or supper likea popper this idea of this kind ofscaling down throughout the day if youcan so i also don't eat breakfast so iwill eat a big hearty filling lunch ieat lunch and i am and it's it's fat andprotein almost exclusively and then wheni go home several hours later to havedinner with my family which issacrosanct for me i will have dinnerwith i want to have dinner with myfamilyand then i will eat a very modest dinnerand then i'm still because i'm stillkind of full from lunch and then in theevening no snacking no snack once aperson has had dinner stop eatingyou do not want to go to bed on a fullstomach and you do not want to go to bedhaving just spiked your insulin andglucose that is in my view the primaryreason why people sleep poorly if you goto bed with spiked glucose you will havean activation of your heart rateyour heart will be beating faster andharder and your body temperature will behigher and you'll be thinking i can'tsleep because i have such anxiety no youthat that's an artificial anxietyactivated by your nervous system inresponse to what you just didmetabolically but tragically that iswhen most people indulge the most it'sin the evening that's when they eat allof these sugar insulin spiking foodsit's the literally the worst time to beeating it so i agree wholeheartedly eatthe bulk of your calories in the earlierpart of the day so you can taper off asyou go into the afternoon and eveningyeah and generally you knowit's it's a great rule to not snack ithink of it this way if you have thedesire to snack less than 12 hoursafter your last meal your last meal didnot contain enough red meat well saidthat's a good ruleyeah that this is this is how you knowhave i eaten enough red meat likethere's no magic number of pounds ofbeef that you need to eat every day thatapplies for every person it depends onyou your body your size the amount ofeffort that you put in and every daybut a good rule of thumb is you shoulddefinitely not be craving anything inthe in the next 12 hours if you ateenough then the next 12 hours fooddoesn't even cross your mind this thisis the right way to go about it andinitially it's going to be moredifficult because you're still a sugaraddict and there's an adjustment but theeasiest way to handle that adjustment isto justdouse it with fatty beans no no in facti to speak on that point of adjustingthe the body is an energetic hybridum where at any moment the body has twoprimary metabolic fuels that it'srelying on which is blood sugar or orfat those are the two fuels at anymoment the body is primarily sugarburning or it's primarily fat burningand that is entirely 100 percentdictated by insulin when insulin iselevated it shifts the metabolic engineto sugar burning when insulins down themetabolic engine if you will shifts tofat burning the more a person is stuckin sugar burning the harder it's goingto be to fast and not snack because thebody has a very finite amount of sugarstored in it and so if we're alwaysburning that sugar that's an engine thatwe need to be topping up that that's atank a fuel tank that the person wouldneed to feel like they have to top upfrequentlybut if they can kind of get through thisinitial adjustment stage as you notedthen insulin starts to come down thenthe body starts to shift and rely on theother fuel tank namely fats and even alean person has well over a hundredthousand calories stored on them as fatit's like we have all of these energybars and energy drinks strapped onto ourbodies that we just can't use becausewe're constantly filling up that littleum tank so it's almost like let me usethe analogy of a big fuel tanker like abig semi truck with a big tank of fuelthat it's hauling on the backand then every four or five hours thistruck or you know six hours it needs tostop and fill upand it's filling it needs to fill upbecause it's relying on this smalllittle tank under the engine in the cabof the of the truck and yet the irony isso much of its effort is hauling aroundall of this other fuel that's strappedto the back of this big fuel tanker andimagine if thisengine was such that it could take thefuel lines from the engine and starttapping into all of the calories all theenergy that it's hauling around butisn't using well then that trunk thattruck could go for daysthe analogy then comparing it to thehuman body is that we have these two twoenergy stores we have about 2 000calories stored as sugar and maybe 200000 calories stored as fat and we keepusing just that sugar using it upfilling it up using it up filling it upand any excess that we fill into thattank spills into this other tank of fatthat we're never tapping into becausewe're constantly filling that sugar tankso the moment we let thesugar tank run dry and it'll be a littleuncomfortable there is that adjustmentbut give it a couple days insulin willhave come down we've basicallyre-plumbed the fuel lines to have thatengine tapping in the metabolic enginetapping into stored fat and now when wego on a hike you know it's here in themountains of the mountain west in utahmy family we go on hikes all the timeand we i will see very overweight peopleand they will have this little theselittle kind of fanny packs of energybars and you have my family we're alllean and fit and strong and healthy wedon't have nothing but waterit's because we have any enough fuel onour bodies we're all lean but we stillhave enough fuel that we could go run 50miles 100 miles and not run out of fuelif we were so inclined and these peoplecan't even hike five miles they start toget hangry and uncomfortable it'sbecause they're stuck in sugar burningmode and the more you eat sugar the moreyou're dependent on it and so you justhave to break that you have to just sayi'm not going to get mycarbs from bags and boxes with barcodesand i'm just going to focus on fats andproteins it'll be a little bituncomfortable give it a few days andit'll be right as rain and that personwill have shifted to becoming a fatburneryeah this is this is really uh it'salmost likerunningtwo different kinds of uh operatingsystems in the human body you knowthere'sit's like there's windows and mac andlinux there's fat burners and sugarburners and i i've tried being a fatburner and i've tried being a sugarburnerand if you've not tried both i thinki mean you know people like toexperiment with all kinds of thingspeople like to enjoy all kinds ofexperiences like watching tv shows andtraveling to places and consuming allkinds of thingsi think you might want to considerthis kind of experience you know trywhat it would be like to be a fat burnerwell saidjustyou know ever wonder what you would looklike if you could put on a superman suityeah that's kind of what it is well andthere's another perk in addition to umthe ability to not be so dependent oneating every two hours when a person isin a state of fat burning that gets tothe order of about 16 to 20 hours it'sthat acuteif insulin is low the body startsburning so much fat that but with lowinsulin it can't stop and so it's burnedenough fat that it's met its energeticdemand every cell is properly fueled butbecause insulin is low it can't stopburning fatand so you start burning more fat thanyou literally need to meet yourenergetic needs and that excess of fatburning turns into these moleculescalled ketones and everyone's heard ofketones or keto and unfortunately it's afour-letter word it's disparaged it'sreviled it's just because it's somisunderstood but ketones speaking offeeling betterwe have just we just published a paperlast year looking at humans we hadpost-mortem brain samplesof the um of the hippocampus which isthe kind of memory learning centerthat's the part of the brain that getscompromised with alzheimer's disease andin these post-mortem samples we lookedat the metabolic genes related toglucose burning and ketone burningbecause the brainrelies on those two fuels the brain doesnot burn fat it uses fat for structuredoesn't burn fat for fuel unlike therest of the body the burn the brain willburn sugar like glucose or ketonesbut what we found in alzheimer's diseaseis that the sugar burning becomescompromisedit can't burn sugar as well because it'sbecome insulin resistant and but it hasa perfect ability to burn ketones andthis is reflected in human case studiescase reports where you have someone withfull-blown alzheimer's disease eitherput them into a ketogenic diet or givethem a ketone drink to boost up theirketones and in real time you detectimprovements in cognition you've notcured the disease it's not that dramaticunfortunately it is irreversible to adegree but whereas someone was so hadsuch dementia that they couldn't getthemselves dressed now they canthey had such dementia that theycouldn't draw the face of an analogclock and now they can i mean these aretrue improvements that you see all byshifting the fuel but the tragic in thetragedy of the average individual isthat with alzheimer's disease especiallywhich is something we're all afraid ofto some degree or another because it'ssuch a horrifying disorder to be trappedwithin your own brainbut we look at the progression of thisdisease and insulin resistanceis more is has a higher statisticallysignificant correlation to alzheimer'sthan age does even and this is howpowerfully predictive insulin resistanceis but as the brain becomesprogressively insulin resistantyou have two tragedies that occurconcurrently one the insulin resistanceof the brain means that it can't get asmuch glucose and so the brain starts togo hungry ironically the body isswimming in a sea of glucose and yet thebrain just can't get it but then secondbecause the person is insulin resistantthey have high insulin levels and highinsulin levels inhibit any production ofketones because it shuts off fat burningand so the brain is starving for a lackof glucose and it's crying out forketones that the body simply will notgive it because the elevated insulinwon't allow it to happen and so the thebrain literally starts to starveand you start to have dementia and it'snot only that that scenario that i justdescribed is not only relevant toalzheimer's disease but several otherneurological disorders like migraineheadaches we have known since 1928 thereare published reports from 1928 thatpeople who frequently suffer frommigraines if you put them into a ketoticstate through a ketogenic diet orfasting they will have no more migrainesthey will literally stopand be maintained and this was repeatedin studies published in 1930 um withepilepsy we've known with epilepsy fordecades that you put that child into aketotic state they will have no epilepsythe problem with these and otherdisorders is as much as we knew thatketones are probably most therapeutic tothe brain more than any other tissue inthe body they fell out of favor themoment we started developing drugsepilepsy was always treated with aketogenic diet well now we have theseepileptic drugs these anti-epilepticsthat'll help they never work as wellmigraines it was once treated with aketogenic diet well now we have thesegood migraine medications so you shouldjust take these instead it absolutelyand the same thing happened with eventype 1 diabetes type 1 diabetes used tobe treated by like basically carnivoredietand because the lower insulin need lowerblood glucose levels help them surviveand feel better in the absence ofinsulin and then the moment we kind ofmass produced insulin which on one handis life-saving so i can't critique thatit does improve the life of the type 1diabetic there's no arguing that but wesh but but now we started to tell themyou can eat just like everybody else eatall that cake eat all those cookies andbreads just cover it with your insulinthat's the line and all it does is putthe poor type 1 diabetic child on thisglycemic roller coaster all dayof getting too high and getting too lowas opposed to telling even the type 1certainly the type 2 diabetic saycontrol your carbohydrates and now theybasically just have a flat line ofglucose all day and their insulin kneesgo down to a tenth of what it would havebeen otherwiseyeah the truly astonishing thing here isthat absolutely nothing by any stretchof the imagination absolutely nothingcomparestocutting down on eating sugary foodin terms of cost reward i mean it's justinsane when you look at all these otherthings like yeah let's give themanti-epileptic drugs like you thinkdecades later now we start to see allthe side effects of those drugs and allthe problems that they cause and all theumcomplications that then require moredrugs which then cause even moreproblems so you have that as an optionso that you you know you sign up for alifetimedrug addictionessentially that doesn't work as welland it costs a lot of money and it ruinsyour healthor you know you just stop eating garbageand it works much better whether it'sepilepsy whether it's diabetes whetherit's alzheimer's whether it's all ofthese health issues you see the samething like it's it's it's out there asyou said in the literature it's alreadybeen demonstrated it's also out theredemonstrated in the real world ofliterally thousands and thousands ofpeople all over the world who startedtheir own blogs and have their ownbusinesses built around this you knowthe outside i mean thankfully theinternet has allowed people toessentially be doctors outside of themedical establishment that's what a lotof these influencers on social mediareally are and and i thoroughly respectthem because they are doing science youknow they they've worked with actualclients they've trained them they'vetaken uhtheir uh measurements they've looked attheir blood work over time they've seenwhat works they've seen what doesn'twork they've read literature andeverybody comes up with the sameconclusion like this stuff works for allkinds of different things and it's it'sit's an enormous amount of mentalgymnastics you have to do to avoid thatvery obvious very low cost very highreturnin the uminterventionand think of other things and reallythis is this is i think if if you're inthe medical field and if you're in thescientific research field and you'relistening to this um of course there's alittle bit of defensiveness of oh wellhow do you know well you're not a phd inumbiology and how do i talk well neitherof us are md's right yeah neither of usare md's and how do i know and of courseall these people will claim expertisebut really if you if your expertisehas resulted in you beinga not being able to notice that the byfar the most effective intervention thatcould possibly be done is reducereducing the level of insulin resistancein a patient through dietary controlthen i'm sorry but your entire degreeand all of your educate education if itis in any sense related to this andyou've missed this lowest hanging fruitthis absoluteelephant of a fruit that is low hangingright there for you to pick and you'vemanaged to miss that but instead you'vestudied all this extremely sophisticatedarcaneacademic discussion aboutall these cells and genetics and all ofthese uh other arcane things drug drugmechanisms yep drug mechanisms and allof these acronyms and names and you knowall these people that are just are soexpert in all those things really ifyou've managed to miss that hey cut downon doritos first and you're talkingabout all these extremely sophisticatedscientific concepts that you thinkyou're better than normal people becauseyou understand them and normal peopledon't understand them i am sorry butyou've been scammed you've been scammedyour education is a big giant stupidscam and you have been conned intowasting your life into joining a giantcriminal enterprise yeah you've beentravelingyeah you you you're helping a bunch ofcriminals profit from people gettingsick that's what it comes down to yeahyou've been credentialed to become alegal um drug dealer um this part ofthis this dissonance that i developedi i think my first loss of innocencejust to really put a fine point in whatwe're describing in addition to i'll addthat humans are great self-deceivers wewe fool ourselves i would when i duringthe course of my phd in north carolina iwould go from our little home and iwould bike i biked all the time we onlyhad one car and my wife was home withour new baby i would bike to the medicalschool where i took most of my phdcoursesthe biochemistry the bioenergetics thephysiology etc i would have to bikeeven though it was less convenient forme i would bike on the opposite side ofthe road of where the med school wasbecause i had to go to the far side ofthe medical school because the sidewalkof the medical school block was filledwith nurses and doctors who weretechnically off the private the propertyof the hospital to go to the sidewalk inorder to smokethey would go to the sidewalk so theycould smoke and so there were so manythat would be aligned there along thereof all the time that i have to bike onthe other side of the road and i wouldlook at these healthcare professionalsand just wonder at the hypocrisy or theignorance or the self-delusion where youcould imagine a physician who would beout there smoking a cigarette go back infor a clinical appointment with apatient who has lungfailure and heart disease and he wouldlook at the patient's chart and say ahwell looks like you smoke uh half apound or a pack ofcigarettes a day you really gotta stopsmoking and yet the stench of his owncigarette smoke comes into the clinicalappointment with himthis isand another something i see as a parentyou'll see i've literally seen thishappena mom is at a playground with her childthe and the mom has a little bag ofcandies and the baby the little childcomes up to mom hey can i have somecandy and the mom will give the littlekid a small littlehandful here's some little gummy candiesnow don't ask for any more you've hadenough this isn't good for you to havetoo much and then the moment that littlechild ran away i saw them what did themom start doing it's just hand over fistshoving those gummy candies into hersick body her sick overweight body and ithoughtthese moments of hypocrisy one i took itto heart andanalyzed my own behavior thinkingwhere am i hypocritical where i willtell my child okay you've watched tv foran hour that's enough no more and then iwill go and watch it for four hours youknow i mean just as an example it mademe analyze my own behavior more to bemindful of my own hypocrisy but then itjust was such a such an obvious displayof the hypocrisy that just pervadeshuman nature including thosewho well especially because it is suchblatant hypocrisy those who know betterwe knowwe know that if you are insulinresistant you're a type 2diabetic or type 1 literally yourdisease could be defined as you have ahard time metabolizing sugar in yourblood that's why your sugar is climbingwhy on this good green earth would wethen tell the person which entities doamerican dietetics american diabetesamerican heart they will say eat a lowfathighcarbohydrate diet that is literally theclinic the dietary advice that theseentities promote that they will sayit is criminal and yet there must besuch cognitive dissonance because theyknow the blood sugar levels are gettingtoo high well then as i already said ihate that i'm repeating myself just putless sugar in the system and it willlower the sugar it will lower theinsulin than than the insulin resistancewhich is the heart of all metabolicproblems and then all of the issues thatare derivative of that everything startsto get better rather than trimming thissick little tree at the branches bygiving here a medication or theirmedication we just chop the damn thingdown and now we don't have to worryabout pruning it anymoreyeah one of the one absolutely mostheartbreaking things that happened whenyou start learning about how this wholeinsulinmechanism works and you see thedifference in youis you try and tell your family andfriends and uh one of the worst thing iswhen you have a family member who'sclearly suffering from serious healthproblems and clearly could benefitenormously from them and they might evenbe willing to listen except that theirdoctor told them no noyou don't have to worry about any ofthat stuff focus on taking yourmedication and be sure to come to myoffice once every two weeks so that wecan check your whatever it isbut don't listen to your nephew orgrandkid or all these people that arereading weird things on the internet ihave a degreethis is this is you know think aboutthings that make you go really reallyreally angry and this is yeah and youcan't say one of the dirty secretsespecially of medical practice um i sawthis firsthand there i was a group oflike i think there werefour of us phd students taking classesnot to let phds off the hook we knowthat it is plenty corrupted but we weretaking classes with the md medicalstudents like the physiology and thebiochemistry and stuff some of them andthen we had our ownother coursework i was amazed that if wephd students got anything less than a bwe were on academic probation and thenwe had to repeat the class and if we gotless than a b againthankfully never happened with me butthen you get kicked out of the programso our phd program went from four tothree within the first year i knewmultiple mde students who they theydon't have to just get they could get acand they can take that again as manytimes as they need i knew a guy who'shis graduation from his medical degreewas delayed about a year and a half orso because he kept failing a class andyet it's just once you're in the systemtheydo they move heaven and earth all themore now i mean standards just keepgetting lower and lower as we have allthese outcomes that are based more onensuring you knowwell i i need to be careful ensuringjust you knowthat everyone can have a chance andeveryone gets a degree they're justhanding them out and so there's noquestion that the quality is gettingless and less but alsotragically as the quality is decliningit seems like there's a growingresistance to acknowledging when youdon't know something it is the greattragedy of all terminal degrees a phd inan md are obvious examples the more wehave earned letters after our name themore we refuse to acknowledge someonecould know something that we don't knowand that to me it's the death of scienceit is it truly isin in science is just a mature i meantrue science which is the pursuit oftruth that my phd mentor who was awonderful gentleman just a wonderful manhe would always say ben we're seekingtruth we're seeking truth and we thatmeans you have to be prepared to dumpall of your theoriesthe moment you see data that conflictedthat challenges it should make youchallenge what you thought you knew andand readdress it reassessbut no no now like i said at the outsetof the conversation everyone they havelawn signs and they say we believe inscience and all it is is the declarationof faith at that point it is no longer arigorous objective analysis of what wethink we know and and this is al covidwas the death of yeah i mean it was itwas the outside nail yep yepyeah no i i definitely agree with that ithink thethe the really astonishing uhbait and switch here is that you knowthe whole supposed marketing material ofscience was built on the idea that youknow no more priests no more authorityno more uh listen to what the priestssay no you need to read for yourselfeverybodyuses the scientific method you thinkscientifically and it's a it's a i meanit's really just an explicit statementof what all humans do at all times youknow what when you wake up in themorning let's say your bed has a wall onone side and it doesn't have a wall onthe other side you know it's thescientific method one day you wake upyou hit the wall and then you'veexperimented and then for the rest ofyour life you're to wake up on the rightside of the bed that's science that'swhat the scientific method is you knowyou you have a hypothesis that i couldwake up on the left side you test it outyou smash your head in the walland then youyou figure out the conclusion that youshould try the other side sothinking scientifically is what humansnaturally do when they try andunderstand how things work and thescientific process is a great way ofthinking about itformulating it to make it systematic sothat it's not just you know going by ahunch so you formulate a hypothesis youtest it and you you write it down ithelps you structure your thinking in amuch better waybut with that we've successfully beenconned intoall right we're doing experimentsbutactuallywhat we're going to be doing is thatuh you're not doing experiments you'rejust going to trust priests who claim todo experiments but these are better thanthe other priests the two you trustedbecause the other priests told you youknow they spoke to godthese guys don't speak to god they speakto an experiment so you can feel okaytrusting them but really um it's thesame thing it is a religion like at thispoint we just have priests and we trustthem and we excommunicate people whodon't believe it else said well in facti used to take great pride in being whatis commonly called a hard scientist thehard sciences were these areas ofscience where you could literallyconduct an experiment run the analysisand see was this a significant findingor was it not did something happen thatwe predicted or did it not i would takegreat pride that i was not a softscience guy you know where where you addthe word science in your degree and ithelps you believe it's political sciencesocial sciences run a bunch ofobservationary data yeah there's nothingthere's nothing science i mean it's it'salmost a rule where if if uh if a degreehas the word science in it it's probablynot a science you know like i'm i'm i amin cell biology that's my department wedon't say i mean my other colleagues arein molecular biology you know we don'tsay molecular biology science but it'ssocial science political science and i iwould take such pride that i could knowsomething i could say this is truthwhat we saw this happened i treated thecells with this with insulin and this isliterally what happened so now i canstate it with an absolute authoritybecause it is truth it is reality andunlike the social sciences the softersciences which i don't mean to totallydisparage but they could not make thosesame claimsthey could not do it but now even in thehard sciences you have people makingclaims that are not justifiedi've never beenmore ashamedof ofof of my credential than i have been thelast few years where it has been youhave people making the mostunscientific ridiculous statementsacross a whole spectrum of social issuesright now it's not just disease but itis you know human development um for imean all these things are beingcriticized in a way that i i look atwith such wonderand and i'm left thinkingi'm in a clown world now um but but youknow what the only one no no i know butit's it's funny for me to say thisbecause ihappen to be a professor at a privatereligious university and what's amazingto me is to see that it's these privatereligious universities that still allowthe teaching of traditional kind ofliberal education by that i don't meanbut when i say liberal i mean like aclassic liberal education which trainsyou in the arts and the sciences and theletters and i canknow that my institution will defend mewhen i makestatements about reality and truth inscience and i don't teach anythingreligious whatsoever but it's thesestate sponsored schools who are sodependent on money from the nationalinstitutes of health or from the stateor federal agencies unlike myinstitution where they have to say whatthe party they have to follow the partyline they lit i mean that to your pointabout fiat science being based on fiatmoney that is literally the case withtraditional state schoolsand it's only universities that aren'tdependent like my university for examplewhen you when the federal government washanding out covert relief fundsmy university was one of we literallydeclined the money it was offered thesetens of millions of dollars and myuniversity said no we aren't going totake it because we know the moment youstart doing that things it comes withobligations and demandsand so it's a it's a weird thingto to say that it's these privategenerally religious universities andthey're very very few of them thatactually teachthe reality the binary nature of justscience something is real or it isn'tnow that's not to say there's nosilliness college campuses unfortunatelyit's their very nature nowadays to havesomesomewhat crazy ideology in somedisciplinesbutuh it would be it would be increasinglydifficult for me to be in academia if ifelt like i had to statethe you know something that i i believedto be utterly falseyeah i mean umbetter get some bitcoin because i thinkthe uh i know i know i i think theinquisitors are coming and you're goingto be have to you're going to have toyou know recant on all of your heresiesyou're going to have to cancel the beexcommunicated exactlydenounce your previous work and say thatinsulin is not a problem anymore oh iknow i know well but the nice thing forme i've never gotten an nih grant andthat's actually i'm not ashamed of thatthat's kind of a point of pridei have been able to fund my lab throughindividual donors that are sufficientlyenamored or convinced um have asufficient conviction of my va my viewof health and disease that i've not hadto becomei've not had to become an employee ofthe government uh and say what they wantme to saycongratulations that's i mean reallythis is uh for me uhth this is the goal and this was alwaysthe goal write and be readand have a have a method ofcommunicating with a readership withouthaving to be part of the state-runeducational system because ultimatelythe entire fieldsthey're all related to the academicjournals and i discussed this in detailin the fiat standard the way that thisacademic fiat ponzi works is all runthrough the academic journals thebasically the better way to understandis that the university system and theuniversity professors and the universityadministratorshave effectively been conned intouh becoming slave labor for the academicpublication industry there are a fewlarge publishers that controlumthousands literally thousands uponthousands of academic journals and99.999 of everything written in allthose academic journals is unreadablegarbage nobody ever reads it none ofthese papers are read by anybody even ifyou have access to it yeah even if youhad access to it nobody would read it umi mean the only people who read it arepeople who read it because they want torespond to it or build upon it so thatthey can get into the same journals andget promoted but nobody outside of thejournal circle jerk uh feeds these uhpapersno in fact i i joke it's incestuous isay that all the time you go toconventional meetings i go give a talkat a conventionalscience meeting it's the same handful ofscientists listening to the same handfulof scientists everyone's citing eachother's work you know and that's why atthe very beginning of our conversation inoted that i i began more and more torail against this system where i'dpublish a paper like this paper aboutthe post-mortem biopsies we did onstudying the hippocampus from humans imean this was relevant cool stuff and wepaid five thousand dollars to get itpublished in a journal that no one willread except a handful of people andconventional academia would say all thatmatters i mean like at the end of everyyear you get reviewed in part based onhow many people cited your publishedwork that's part of the game of academiaand yet i looked at thislike about six years ago this was thebeginning of me saying i need to one getinvolved in social media and two i needto write a book because i thought if therest of my career is publishing papersthat 20 other scientists read and itnever actually impacts a human's lifethen i will have ended my careereither i was delusional thinking i madea difference or i will acknowledge andbe humbled by the fact that i never madea lick of difference in every discoveryi made as cool as i might have thoughtit waswas totally irrelevant in the real worldand that to mewas was intolerable the idea of justsitting in the ivory tower of academiaspouting ideas and then wondering ifthey had ever influenced someone i saidno i have to circumvent that wholesystem yes i have to play that game i doi i play it but i also know that i'mplaying the game and then i go right tothe people i directly share publicationsthat are relevant to human healththrough social media and it's neverpictures of me doing anything silly it'sliterally just i'm teaching a littlelesson right now about how testosteroneaffects fat cell function you know forexample or i'm writing a book that isdirectly me going around i mean safe ifyou had had to convey all of your ideasin in the two books that i've read ofyours bitcoin standard and fiat standardif you had to only rely on those ideasbeing conveyed in a classroomyou'd you'd never or your own papersbeing published no good luck a fractionof the number of people would know it sothose of us who know ideas and that'snot relegated to those with phds not atallbut those who have valuable ideas itbehooves us to test those ideas in anopen market are these ideas as valid asi think they are and then how can i helpconvey them if they are and the marketwill tell you if they're valuable or notexactly which is what i really loveabout twitter twitter in particular ithink is the most uhis the most vigorous intellectual andscientific debate that you find may italways stay that way may it stay thatway oh obviously you know of course ithas all of its problems with censorshipand so on but yet even in spite of allof that i think it still manages to bethe most effective platform because uhit's extremely powerful as a way ofcommunication where you need to getthings down to 280 characters so thatmeans you can't waffle around and youcan't waste people's time people justimmediately tune you out get straight tothe point so you know you can link topapers you can link to articles you caninclude the video and audio but you needto get to the punch in 280 points whichforces the brain to focus and for andallows you to really expose things andthen that's where academics really thethe tricks you know academics don't likebrevity academics don't like brevitythey like to be superfluous ineverything they describe exactly becausea lot of it is just honestlyperformative art i mean i've been tothose conferences and i know that a lotof it is just you need to sit there andtalk about your paper nobody's read yourpaper nobody wants to read your paperbut they have to attend the conferenceyou have to speak at the conference andso it's just performance you stand thereand you know you feign being wise andyou talk slowly and then you finish yourtime and then you get on with your lifeand like nobody learns anything and mostof it is just really performativeum but yeah that's uhsocial media on the other hand is realworld that people are going to listen toyour ideas they're going to try them andthey're going to come back and tell youhey i tried to do what you said and lookit's worked and here are the picturesandthat that's the validation that you needi remember you know it was it was it wassomething very similar that i feltduring my grad school when i uhstopped believing in the stuff that theyteach us in the grad school and i justdeveloped this alternative perspectivethe biggest horror that i had was thisidea that hang on so we are just writingall of this garbage to continue toumkeep our jobs in this kind of system andthe only purpose of writing this is sothat we develop the expertise so we canget on tv and newspapers and universityclassroom and gas light people intotelling them hey um yep you knowinflation is actually good for you andprices aren't really rising and uh weneed more inflation and the way that wesolve the problems of inflation is withmore inflation that was basically it andjustrealizing that you're sitting there andyou're writing something that nobody'sgoing to be reading it's it it gave methat image ofthat and i mentioned this in the fieldas well there's that movie the stanleykubrick movie the shining where uh theauthor and his wife they go into aresort to an isolated hotel in middle ofnowhere and they spend months writingand then his wife looks at all thehundreds of pages that he wrote andthey're all just the same sentence allover again and this is what it feelslike when you're in academia it's likewould it even matter if i just filledthis with the same sentence over andover the same exact sentences in thatmoviewould anybody even notice i mean yeahthe seven people in the journals and theseven people who read the journal mightuh notice but like if you them and i weall agree on doing this as a pranknobody would notice it couldwell stay in the in the gym in factthat's been done right but there wasthis i can't remember his name there wasthis physical socal alan he had suchdisdainin fact did you cite this in your bookyes alan yeah oh yeah yeah so i but i'veheard it other times where you have thephysicist who writes a report about likehe just made up like one of them i thinkhe might have been the guy who talkedabout how dogsum having sex was a good example of likeuh you know male domination or orwhatever and it would but that was oneof the things he'd made up but justutter nonsense and getting it publishedin these soft sciencejournals you know the peer reviewprocess was just a jokeyeah and like i think um you knowusually it used to be thata natural scientist would laugh atsocial scientists but i think you knowthese are the same universities thatpublish the same thing so oh no i know iknow yeah that's natural i used tothat's right yeah i don't anymore my mysmugness of being a hard naturalscientist is is gone now because we'vewe've also now started compromisingtruth to fit a narrative unfortunatelyyeah and i think you knowas you said the the recent uhrespiratory illness uh shenanigans werereally i mean the way that the allentire world scientific community wentfrom having never heard about socialdistancingand uh to just say yeah well this isobviously what we need to do becausethat's the only option what are youcrazy yeah well and to totally overlookwhat we we knew very very early on notto maybe maybe i need to be very carefulbut but very briefly we knew very earlyon that the most significant singleliterally the single most relevant riskfactor in determining whether this wouldbe serious infection or a very mildinfection was the amount of fat a personhad on their body and that's not just acoincidenceany inhaled or or virus that gets intothe system it comes in as a viralparticle and it needs to hijack a cellit needs to get into a cell infect acell for that cell to start producingmore of those viral particles to go andinfect others with this particular virusinfects fat cells more than any othercell well they're a couple a littlehigher but fat cells are among the mostreadily infected cell with thisparticular viral particle and so andthen the fat cell becomes an unwittingfactory producing more and more and moreof it because it had on the surface ofthe fat cell these other proteins thatallow the viral particle to get intothat cell much more readily so literallyif you had a fat cell in a muscle cellside by side and each were exposed tothis viral particle it's going to have avery hard time getting into the musclecell because it doesn't have the rightreceptors for that virus to kind oftrick fat cells are very welcoming hostsand so a person who has more fat tissuejust had more likely infection sites toprevent this isn't meant to be anincriminating point about anyone who'soverweight noindeed i truly am not but for us topretendthat that wasn't a relevant variable infact arguably the most relevant variablewas it did no one any serviceno it's absolutely insane i think it'sthe most absurd moment of the entire twoyears was when um and i'm from albertai'm from alberta which means i have agreat distain for any of the easternprovincesyeah i could understand and this thisguy you know he'd locked down ottawa hadsomeone i mean ontario had some of themost strict uhlockdowns in the world for a very longtime and they destroyed small businessesdoug ford got on tv and taughthis citizens how to make cheesecake hismom's or his grandmarecipe for cheesecake which is he madedoug ford you know the the enormous unitwhich he is today so you can imagine howmuchsugar it has in it and uh he went andcooked it you know he was wearing agiant t-shirt uh that said we're all inthis together and he was teaching peoplehow to cook cheesecake while he lockedthem at home and prevented them fromopening their businesses it's absolutelyamazing how nobody said anything aboutyou know it was it was for methat was for me seeing everything thathappened over the last few yearswas was a kind of final nail in thecoffin now of coursemy field itself studying the the originsof metabolic disease had made me alreadysomewhat cynical um of of traditionalviews you know like uh i've mentionedbefore that the fat cell is at the heartof metabolic problems that's whereinsulin resistance startsum and and yettraditional view would be well then justsimply lower calories and that's allthere is to it yes calories matter butthe prevailing paradigm with obesity isthis caloric paradigm totally ignores ortotally refutes the fact that insulincould have anything to do with it andyet insulin is essential to determiningfat storage as well the whole debaclethe last three years settled it for mebut anyway here he is here he isyeah look i mean look at that oh my goshyeah and so he he ought to be he oughtto have been worried about thisrespiratory illness because he has themost significant risk factorwell look at him there's he's had therecipe memorizes he was 10 year olds imean this isoh my gosh this is some seriousdedication yeah it is it is uhthere's the cream so that so what he'smixing here the mix of sugar and fat isis a is a dane is a particularlydangerous one there's the cream a littlemore yeah sugar a little more fat andsugar and in nature it's important tonote in nature carbohydrate and fatdon't come together that doesn't happenin in foods that we eat in nature it'seither pure carbohydrate in the form offruit and vegetable generally or it'sprotein and fatbut he's he's mixing oh gosh what aclownyeah he got re-elected as welloh i'm not surprised i'm not surprisedthey re-elected trudeau it's it's myit's so it's so shamefulum to see what's happened and i i lovedgrowing up in canada i loved mychildhood in this little kind of farmtownin albertaand and but but i my dad raised us allto be um very kind of free marketcapitalist and he would always railagainstthe federal the lack of a kind offederalist systemum now i'm not saying the u.s is perfectit's democracy it's federalist system isis built and only can succeed on a moralpeople as the founding fathers noted andthe loss of kind of morality in the usputs it into a difficult spot in factsafe i've heard you defend a monarchybeforeand and which which i i can be verysympathetic to um i think if you knewif a population could know that it wouldalways have a just kingslam dunkbut but you know the usperspective was we can't trust thatwe'll always have a good king we'lltrust the morality of the people but nowif you have if you don't have a moralpeoplethen it does it doesn't work yeah no ithink the the argument is not that youknow if we can get uh just king everysingle time i think the argument isthat thisyou hit the nail right on the head thatyou you need to just people for ademocracy to work so you need thesociety to be 51 percentjust moral and low time preference ithink this is the really key thing youneed a society to be predominantlythinking about the future thinking yeschildren because otherwise they willsacrifice the future for the sake ofthis that's something you've articulatedvery well before i i love you yeah andand and the difficult thing is that ifit's if it's uh a democracy then it'sthe hand it's uh hopper describes it aswe stand altogether where everybody'shand is in everybody's pocket andeverybody is robbing from everybody elseand when you have that system youincentivize people to think short termand so it's very difficult to you knowwin the lottery then and have 51 percentof the populationuhmanage to do it but with a king you justneed one guyto teach their sonthis is what we do we keep thinking ofthe long term and we don't sacrifice thelong term for the present and so then ifyou just have one familywhere you have one father who just needsto teach this to their son and then theymanage to keep it going for a fewgenerationsyou're arguably better off sticking tothem than you are i agree i agreebecause then their their moral viewwould befor lack of a better word imposedin the population it would be better i itotally agree with that i think it's notso much that they would be able toimpose their moral view i think it'sjust that uh without a high timepreferenceperson in charge of government peoplejust naturally do what's best for themand they naturally develop a long-termperspective because what you need todestroy that is an actively destructivegovernment that takes away your propertytakes away that your freedom takes awayyour security then people becomeum essentially animals fighting againsteach other because they don't see acommon future because theythey think the future is compromisedso this this would be it but i wanted toget back to alzheimer's you'd mentionedthis this is of course very interestingi have uh my grandfather unfortunatelywho suffers from this illness and ofcourse as i mentioned it's one of thoseexamples where constantly trying to getthem to change their diet and the doctorjustsays it's not and everybody in thefamily just laughs when i mention itbut it's uh you know recently new uhresearch on alzheimer's has shown usthat uh yeah apparently uh fiat sciencehas been uh uh naughty and up to it'susual in factis the it is the most perfect example ofof fiat science in science at its workscience at its worst or agenda at itsbestwhere the prevailing theory ofalzheimer's disease has been that it isit is a disease of plaques forming inthe brain and these little things calledamyloid beta peptides or what we callplaques are accumulate in thehippocampus and literally disrupt neuronto neuron connection resulting in thecognitive decline that so typifiesalzheimer's disease butthe challenge why my lab challenged thatamong other labs i'm not alone in thisis that there would be drug after drugwould come out that would be shown toreduce the presence of amyloid betapeptides or plaques in the brain and yetthere would be nono subsequent improvement in cognitionin fact this just happened last yearwhere the fda against the the request ofthe special panel that was put togetherto review this anti-alzheimer's drug itwas an anti-plaque drug so there wasthis special panel put together toreview it they directed the fda todecline fda approval of this drugbecause the efficacy was nil there wasnothing to it but the fda approved itanyway and their justification for itwas that they didn't want to discouragefurther drug development in thealzheimer's realm so they explicitlyapproved a drug they knew had no benefitand so doctors would start prescribingthis to patients even though there wasno known benefit butall of this is just the the the cherryon top of the sickfoundation which was that the very ideathat alzheimer's was a plaque-baseddisease was built on faulty data andthat's what you're referring to it'smade the headlines i wouldn't besurprised if many people have seen thisalreadybut this initial scientific findingspublished in these glamorous journals ofcourseit was that when they would block theformation of the plaques in these animalmodels then the alzheimer's would goaway when the plaques were there thedementia the cognitive decline in therodents would follow and yet it was allfabricatedthey had made up these data and that'spart of this perverse incentive that sotypifies this artificial realm of fiatscience where they want they need topublish and they need to keep gettingfundingand so you you're willing to compromiseand and now we know that that ideas hasbeen tossed to the wayside it simplydoesn't havemoreover additional data in postmortemhuman samples found that there you woulddetect and find plaques in people'sbrain who who died with no evidence ofcognitive decline they were perfectlyhealthy as sharp and witty as they everwere and yet their brains had moreplaques hammers and died with like myown grandma did and and they would haveno plaxen or very very little plaques inthe brain so we've known for years thatthere's something wrong with thisparadigm and yet it continued to bepropped upand those of us who've been beating thedrum and again i'm not alone saying thatthis is not a plaque disease it is ametabolic disease with significant datato to um support this never having beenrefuted yet that i'm aware of but nopaper has it found contrary evidencefinding that it is not a disease ofmetabolism of the brain in the brainit's not been refuted yet and so thisshould be the theory that should havebeen continued to be propped up in orderfor it to continually be criticized ishould add it's not that it makes itbulletproof that bigger a theory getsthe moreit should be able to be topped uptoppled overthen every brick that's being thrownover thrown at it if it's not knockingit down well then it strengthens itappropriatelyit's a stronger theory now if the brickwe're throwing doesn't knock the towerdown it is become incorporated into thestructure and it's stronger there havebeen that little tower of theplaque-based theory of alzheimer's hasbeen knocked over so many times it justit fit the narrative that they wantedwhoever they were if it was easier todevelop drugsthat would address plaques than it hasbeen to just tell people help your brainbecome more insulin sensitive and giveit some ketones from time to time andvery likely your brain is going to bejust fine you don't need to invoke someenormous conspiracy of people whoconsciously came up with those thingsand deliberately lied about it like ifyoui'm sure as you know the way that thesethings work it's just you know if youand i both get our phd and get similarjobs and similar research centersstudying this kind of issueif i come at it from the perspective ofwell i thinkthere's this obscured little chemical inthe brain that causes alzheimer we needto spend 18 million dollars to study howthis thingumgrows and that's what causes alzheimer'sand we tend to figure out how to get adrug that inhibits this mechanism sotherefore will fix that issue this is ahighly promising line of researchbecause of the way that the drugpatent systemworks which is essentially a form ofgovernment monopoly it makes a lot ofsense to just find some symptom anywhereand find some chemical that can be shownin a trial to reduce those symptoms andit's just this is what modern medicinebecomes because you set up theincentives in a certain way where youhave to demonstrate to one monopolygovernment agencyone mechanism that they choose you knowyou set that as you set these as thegoal posts and so then you have billionsof dollars of pharmaceutical companiesout there shooting for those goal postshiring people specifically to shoot forthose goal posts you know we need toconduct the trial to find the diseaseand find the symptoms and then find thechemical that we can patent and makesure that it's artificial it has to beartificial because if it's notartificial you can't patent it yes ithas to be an artificial chemical thatcan cause some significant effect onthat symptomso because if we do that and we spendabout a billion dollars in 10 yearsputting it through trials and then weget the approval then that's a moneyprinting ticket forever because then alldoctors are required to prescribe it asa standard of care for this conditionand that's just going to mean endlessyachts and vacation homes for everybodyinvolved with our pharmaceutical companysoinstead of having a free market systemwhere ideas and drugs are tested by freeagencies thatpublish their findings you have atop-down system where the governmentjust dictates all right this is thestandard of care everybody needs to takeit everybody needs to follow itand you know as a doctor you could loseyour license if youdon't follow those things on the one andi'm proposing this kind of theory thatwould fit into this pattern that couldlead to that drug eventually which couldmake billions you on the other handyou've come up with the conclusion thathey maybe i i have this novel theorythat if we get people to start eatinglessgarbage we could improve theiralzheimer'sall right well you know you could make agood instagram health influencer accountout of that you couldrun a small business that holds peopleaccountable and helps them and makesmeal planning there are a few smallbusinesses on thatnothing like the drugs that you could uhrun if you you know with my theory youknow my theory that says it's a bunch ofcamera it's a chemical imbalance in thebrain and we just need that yeah andthat's exactly what they did withpsychiatry that other big scam which uhwhich also incidentally is massivelyaffected by insulin resistance but alsonobody mentions it because again it'smuch more profitable no it's a chemicalthing in your brain and we just add alittle pill and yeah and that was allrefuted recently too i mean you'reperfect to point that one out where forso long we'd said it's a serotoninimbalance and then we now this big metaanalysis comes out and says oh wellactually it's not at all and that'snever been supported in the science andit challenges i mean the most commonpsychiatric medication for these sortsof things is these serotonin regulatingdrugs that do nothing to benefit thepersonthat's very true and and and of coursethe mechanism i discussed in the fiatstandard because of the way thatfinancing works is look mistakes happeneverywhere but fiat money and fiatfinancing of sciencemakes it so that mistakes can never getcorrected because once you identify thiskind of mechanism all right it's theit's the chemical imbalance of the brainor it's the platelets that cause thealzheimer's or it'sa saturated fat that is causing theheart disease once you've set themechanism so thatgetting government funding depends onformulating your hypothesisto be congruent with that starting pointonce that becomes theeverybody knows in the field once thatbecomes the thing that everybodymentions in the first page of thatscientific paper as a sort of startingfoundation then that's it then that'snever questioned never testednever researched and just it is the lensthrough which it's all viewed exactlyand then there'sthe only way that you can get called thescientist is if you use that lens if youdon't use that lens you're a crank yepyep you're a hair tick that's right yeahand i've i've been accused of thatmyself for challenging conventionalviews and obesity and diseaseum it it just sort of it's it becomestoo threatening unfortunately yeahyeah and i think uh you know to go bringeverything back to the bitcoin and thispodcast is one big giant advertisementfor why bitcoin fixes everythingis i think again all of it is because ofthe fact that without a free market badideas don't die they just continue toget money printing you need to wait forthe money printer to die for that to getfixed but bitcoin is our way out bitcoinis a way for people tofind fund research that they want as faras a way for scientists to becomefinancially independent so that theydon't know always need all these newextra research grants because theirmoney is constantly inflating i thinkyou know the future michael saylor talksabout this people willendow uh foundations with bitcoin andthen that will be a much more effectiveway to continue to do their researchindependent of the fiat uh monster wellthat has to happen yeah you know it atsome point for for science to continueto thrive in what has been such abedrock of the united states having somany advantages it was the system thatthat encouraged and rewarded academicfree thinking in these efforts to toexperiment and find the best ideas letthe best ideas rise to the top the morewe prop up the worst ideasbecause we have money that's allowing itto be propped up we don't allow them toget filteredit's it's it'suh i mean it's the death of of sciencewhich is which is a very sobering notnotthat sounds almost self-aggrandizingwhere where umthat's it's scientists you know it'sthese philosopher kings and it should bethese deep thinkers who are the leadersnono but but the more we refuse to allowtruth and realityand even it even in the reality ofletting the marketshow what ideas have valueum then the more we're artificiallypropping up bad ideas that lead just toour detriment and destructionabsolutely and one thing i also wantedto ask you about is statins what areyour thoughts on stuff oh my gosh so infact i would encourage what a wonderfulquestioni literally just published a paper withtwo other scientistsum on this topic of the efficacy ofstatins in in with for its traditionaluseum and anyone could just go to um i hateto promote pubmed or google scholar butif you just type in bikman and look forany papers published in 2022 you'll findit i think we paid the extra fee to makeit open access which is something ialways do but it's like six thousandbucks seven thousand bucks for my lab topublish a paper so it's not behind a paywall that's how convinced i am thatthese ideas need to have free access umthat people need to get them anywayi think statins are probably the mostoverprescribed drug and my justificationso everyone knows statins are the mostcommon um drug used for heart diseaseand we base thatits use entirely on someone's ldlcholesterol levels that a physician willsay a clinician will say okay patientyour ldl levels are too high you need togo on a statin to reduce your ldl levelsand while statins are effective atlowering ldlthey are tremendously ineffective atlowering the risk of heart diseaseespecially if a person i mean there'sdifferent scenarios but if a person hasnever had a heart attack but they have ahigh ldlin their prescribed statinit it shows no benefit at preventingthat heart attack if someone has had aheart attack and they're given a statinit appears to be that there's a slightreduction in risk but only in somepeople you have to give a statin to like20 people in order for one to get abenefitso this is my view on statins based onall of the best data that i've seenldl cholesterol doesn't matter at allit's a totally useless marker of heartdisease indeed ldl cholesterol is is apredictor of longevity if you want tolive long we have the baltimorelongitudinal study the honolulu agingstudy the shanghai aging studymultiple studies across the world havefound that the longest lived peoplewho have the lowest risk of dementia thelowest risk of cancer have the highestldl levelsi mean what a bloodyparadox we've we've created by wagingwar on ldl ldl is such an essentialmolecule of life it's relevant forhormone production moving cholesterolaround it's relevant for immunity itliterally can bind pathogens and removethem from the body through the liver tobe cleansed from the blood and so that'swhythe more we wage war on ldl the sickeroverall a person's going to getbutwhat i would say if anyone listening iscurious about stanton's and of coursei'm not giving any medical advice per sejust insightdon't rely on your ldl level you go andpay 70 bucks or whatever and get what'scalled a coronary artery calcium scan acac scan you lay under a little ctscanner it zips around you and itactually measures the calcification inyour carotid arteries on your hearti have to say this because the evidenceis so convincing if someone has a cacscore of i think above 1 000 i think itwas or something like that then itshowed a mortality difference in intaking a statin regardless of ldl ldllevels had nothing to do with it high orlow it didn't matter but if someone hadreally high ldl but they had a cac scorein the low hundredsum i think it was the stat had nobenefit whatsoever and because statinshave such significant consequences likelowering sex hormone production loweringvitamin d damaging the mitochondriamaking your muscles ache and these arereal consequences that people need tobalance every drug has a consequenceit's just is the consequence you wantworth the consequences you don't wantthat's something we always have to askourselves as we put these unnaturalchemicals in our bodybut if someone has a high cac scorethen it appears that there could be alongevity a mortality benefit to astatin but if your ldl is through theroof but your cac score is zero i wouldi wouldn't touch ityeahi i think the statins were the mostprofitable drug in the history of thepharmaceutical industry they may havebeen overtaken recently by anunmentionable which i will not mentionbecause idon't want to get cancelled from uh onsocial media but uhit has been enormously profitable to umenormous focus and focus the on this onelittle metric and take a pill for itrather thanthe very blatantly obvious alternativehypothesis which is that it is theinsulin that you should oh and i shouldi should just add though lest it soundlike i'm giving a tacit umgreat pass to statins they're also thereare so many different types of statinsthat people's genetics will metabolizethe statins differently so even if thiswere me giving advice to my dad for aloved one i would say don't do anythinguntil you've gotten a cac score okaylet's say he had a very very high cacscore lots of calcificationin the carotid arteries then next thingi would do is say get what's called apharmacogenomics test these aretypically 200 bucks or so someinsurances actually pay for it here inthe usbut it is our genes will dictate how werespond to medications and it's verypossible that the person gets on astatin that theymetabolize too rapidly and it doesn't doanything or it has some adverse effectthe third leading cause of death in theunited states is adverse drug events forgoodness sakesthat is the third leading cause of deathit's heart disease cancer and adversedrug events and part of this is becauseyou're prescribed a drug that doesn'tget metabolized well in your body peoplenaturally have different genes that areinvolved in the processes of clearingmolecules particularly in the liverthat's where most drugs get metabolizedand eliminated from the body oncethey've kind of lived their life butsome people either metabolize them tooquickly so it doesn't do any good orthey metabolize them too slowly and thechemicals sticking around muchlonger than it should so there are a lotof caveats when it comes to statins areyou should you be using it based on thevery limited data available at all andthen secondyou need to make sure you metabolize itwell but safe to your point even ifsomeone has known calcification in theirarteries there was a cardiologist by thename of bill william davis he publisheda book on thisand he quantified reversingcalcification in the carotid arteriesstrictly through diet in his patients sotypically they will say once once anatheros once a plaque in the bloodvessel has calcified then it's like astone and it's not going anywhere thatis the prevailing idea to this day wellthis cardiologist bill davis he'spublished reports finding quantifyingthe reduction in calcification inpatients strictly through adopting thedietary changes that we've been talkingabout yeahall right um daniel's got a question foryoudanielle yeah hey guys uh hey benjaminnice to meet you uh brilliant brotherbrilliant thank you yeah it's just beenum really really interestingi gotta represent the bitcoin plebs andask you a bit of uhyou probably see the bro science thatgets thrownaround in the bitcoin uh twitter realmso but well first of all uhit's brilliant that your lab isself-funded do you accept bitcoin so ifanybody listening to safe's pod can sendyou some donationsthat is so i appreciate that so muchum one of the tragedies of being at aprivate institution is i i can't acceptdirect donations everything i do comesthrough the university on what's calleda sponsored research agreementum but you guys i've gotten enoughrequests for this kind of thing that i'mthinking about creating a non-profitumi just don't know how to do that likesomething that could accept donation andthen just pay for the equipment and payfor the students that are doing my workso at the moment i hate to say this butno i don'twell someone listening will have ananswer for you i'm sure someone willhonest to goodness i would i wouldwelcome it enormously because it hasgotten a littlechallenging in that regardthe the bro science questions uh there'sa lot of um chat on bitcoin twitterabout see the oils oh yeah yeah yeahwell no i'm glad you're bringing that upbecause that that was something wedidn't get around to so i my my theoryon what is the worst thing how our diethas changed is that it is now consistsof fake carbohydrates or processed carbsand processed oilsand the processed carbohydrates safe andi've i think really beat that to deathreally well which is this is what'sspiking your insulin and chronicallyelevated insulin drives a resistance toinsulin but on the other hand theprocessed oils like seed oils um theyare also problematic um particularly atthe fat cell and that's relevant becausethat's where i believe insulinresistance begins it is the first dominoto fall if you will and when when theprimary fat the primary fatty acid inseed oils is a fat called linoleic acidand anyone who's been diving into theseed oils already knows that fatlinoleic acid is problematic because asit accumulates in the fat cellit can become it gets metabolizedthrough a process called peroxidationinto a molecule called 4 hne that's ofcourse the abbreviated form of a muchlonger name but for h e as itaccumulates in fat cells it forces fatcells to grow through a process calledhypertrophywhere the fat cell itself is being is isbeing expanded and getting fatter andfatter and fatter that is not how allpeople get fatsome people can get fat through aprocess called hyperplasia and this wassomething peter and i just were chattingvery briefly about when safe went tohelp with this baby um at the verybeginning but if some if a person'sphysiology allows their fat tissue togrow through hyperplasia which is whenthe fat cells stay small but we multiplythemthat is the person who paradoxically canget fat but stay metabolically healthytheir blood pressure is okay they don'thave infertility they don't have insulinthey don't have diabetes their glucoselevels are normal that is the vastminority of peoplemost people get fat through hypertrophywhere the fat cell gets reallyfat if you will and it becomes insulinresistantto try to prevent further growth and itbecomes pro-inflammatory literallycreating molecules that turn oninflammation throughout the body all inan effort to try to increase blood flowthrough all these swollen fat cellsanyway to answer the question and bringit full circle that's what seed oilscontribute to among other things seedoils do morebut what i focus on as a metabolicscientist is what they do to the fatcell and seed oils will forcehypertrophy of the fat cell whichbecomes a very insulin resistantpro-inflammatory fat cell which startshaving that firstdomino tip into the other and promotingthe insulin resistance throughout thebody so while we didn't beat that topicto death i'm thrilled you brought it upbecause there's no question it'srelevant so i consider seed oils to be asecondary cause of insulin resistancebecause directly they're not going to doit on the body they have an insulinresistant effect as it alters the growthof fat cells in a unique way in auniquely harmful wayright yeah do you think that do youthink there's merit to the idea thatyou look at traditional populations alot of them did eat carbohydrates nowobviously it was nowhere near as muchcarbohydrates as we eat nowand not as refined exactly that's rightwhat we eat right now but some peoplepoint to that as saying that the issueis not the carbohydrates the issue is iknow they do i know they do i justand but yeah but i i don't know how theycan say that because they're justthey're creating they're making up thescenario wherebecause as we just noted these same likethe kitavans they would eat a tuberousvegetable but it was roastedand you know or steamed or somethingthey're eating that whole thing andabsolutely their insulin would have comeup and come down the thing that peopledon't want to note in those samekitavans is that they're fasting insulinwas like two micro units per mil afantastically low insulin and my problemagain the reason i focus on the carbsnot to necessarily overlook the seedoils is that it's the refined starchesconsumed so frequently that result inthis never-ending insulin spike and soleading to a steady increase we knowthis in people that their fastinginsulin levels will get higher evenfasting insulin will get higher andhigher and higher the more they'reeating processed carbohydratesto the level that we are so the peoplewho are saying well these traditionalcultures ate tuberous vegetables andthey didn't have seed oils so it's notthe carbs that are the problem clearlyit's the seed oils i say well you'vecreated this false protection around thecarbohydrates when my idea is that itit's what's spiking the insulin too muchand if we were all just eating a boiledpotato once a daysimilar to the kitavans we would have noproblemso the seed oil advocatesi think in some instances have become ithink they've gone too far now theywould say well screw you ben you'reignoring the the seed oil data i'm notin fact i literally do experiments withlinoleic acid in my labi'm justjust thinking we have to make sure we'retalking about the whole story here andif someone only eliminated seed oils butthey continue to eatsugar all day long in the form of gummybears and things there'sthere's no question too much insulincauses insulin resistance that's beenwell documented i would say there's moreevidence there's this isn't i would ican't frame it that way there'sabsolutely more evidence over the pastdecades showing that elevated insulincauses insulin resistance then there isshowing that seed oils cause insulinresistanceso i have to i just can't ignore thatnow i'm not ignoring the data on seedoils and linoleic acid it is absolutelythere and so i give it i want to give itits proper dobut thosewho espouse that idea have gone i thinkthey've gone too farno i i agree with you i think uh youknow the the examples that are mentionedand sometimes they'll say well you knowirish people uh ate a lot of potatoesand during uhand they weren't overweight and i thinkof coursethere is some truth to that if you'renot getting fatuh if you're not getting uh if you'renot eating a lot of dietary fat thenyeah you can get away with morecarbohydrates but also the carbohydratesbefore the 20th century are just acompletely differentthey are completely different yeahthat's right and but but even still mymy main rule that first principle wascontrol carbohydrates don't get themfrom a bags or a bag or a box with abarcode and so whole fruits andvegetables they generally have such amodest insulin effect especiallyvegetablescompared to the tropical fruits likebananas pineapples mangoes but like yousaid safe we've changed those over thepast hundred years apples for examplearound the world apples used to be smalland bitter little thingsand we've bred them to become these bigsugar bombs and so even i mean this ishappening around the world so it becomesan easycritique of the kind of carbohydrateinsulin based view of insulin resistancei find it somewhatgalling just because these umnow we've just been criticizing sciencebut i literally create insulinresistance in cells in my lab across thehallway and and linoleic acid can can dothisbased on its effects on the fat cellum but but elevated insulin does as welland that happens through chronicconsumption of refined starchesyeah and i think in in the fiat standardi cite this book called brightlineeating by an author called susanthompson she does a very interestingcomparisonlooking at sugar and flour in particularshe says uh if you look at what hashappened with sugar and flour in the20th century thanks to industrializationit's very similar to what has happenedwith cocaine and heroinbasically opium andtheleaves are things that had existed amongthe human society for thousands of yearsand you know in peru andbolivia and many of those places it's acommon uh cultural thing thatis particularly if you have work so likea worker who wants to put in uh a wholeday of work and they want energyyou chew some coca leaves you get alittle bit of energy until you use it sothis is what it was and for hundreds andthousands of years this is what it waslike and then you get to the 20thcentury where you get to moderntechnology modern hydrocarbon energyallows us to process things so much moreefficiently and powerfully and cheaplyand then you start taking these cocaleaves you know essentially you wouldtake what it would take the averageworker maybe a week to chew throughand then you process it and you condenseit into a tiny little refined whitesubstance that people can snort veryquickly so you can consume and the sameis true with heroin and opiumumso you because of modern processingyou're able to get it in a highlyhighly palatable form you know you don'thave to spend time chewing in order toget to the uhthe essence of it you get the essencestraight awayand that's what makes it so enormouslyaddictive and destructive and she saysthat's exactly the same thing that hashappened with sugar and flour it used tobe extremely expensive and difficult toprocess sugar and flour and to be ableto consume them it's difficult to growplants that have sugar because they geteaten by um pests and other plants andeven if you do manage to grow them youknow you grow a little bit and thenthere'sthere's a limit to how much sugar youcan get you know you need to chewthrough a lot of apple and swallow a lotof indigestible matter in order to get atiny little bit of a sugar hitbut then the 20th century comes alongand now we've gotwhite sugar being sold for practicallynothing at a supermarket or we have pureapple juice you know where we've removedall the chewable stuff and now it's justpure fructose and and water it's i meanit's it's toxic i mean and i i be wedidn't talk about juice but as a parenti consider that to be one of the greattravesties of what parents areunwittingly doing to their childrenchildren should be drinking nothing butwhole milk and waterno no juice i mean fruit juice is is isa horrific just sugary it's like you'regiving them soda pop no absolutely it'sit's terrible and it's um and i see thisa lot in in like the health influencesor certain circlesobviously there's a lot i i think youknow you want to coloryou want to have a little bit ofskepticism about one kind offinancial interest that exists in thisindustry obviously nowhere near ascorrupt andbankrupt as the you know scientificestablishment butwithin the with you know within the umwithin the bro science circles it's notall the sunshine and rainbows it's notall perfect there is of course theslight bias whereinyou get to be more popular as aninfluencer if you tell people they canconsume more indulge in knowledgeit's human nature to want to be to wantvalidation in a destructive behavior yesand also you know if you tell peoplethat no you can have this sugar and youcan have that treat and you can havethat and you'll be fine obviously it'sgoing to sell better than the you knowthe the party pooper who's just going totell you no you shouldn't have any ofthat stuff and like i okay fine isympathize with peoplepeople are addicted everybody has theiraddictionsumbut like realisticallyyou see how this colors people'sanalysis so something like that like youeliminate seed oils and then carbs stopbeing a problem and so you see a lot ofthis kind ofumpeople who are you know just sugarjunkies and looking to justify theirsugar drinking saying oh just take outthe seed oils and then you can keepeating all the sugar that you wantnoit doesn't work that way no i meanwell i mean obviously you can i'm notyour mom you could do whatever you wantyeah right yeah but don't expect it toyield these great reward returns it's anand it's obviously much better thaneating garbage butrealistically it's not as good as justnot eating any of the sugar at all yepyeah all right peter has a couplequestions tooso if sorry sorry peter before you movegoingone more bro science question safe andit's entirely up to you you'll leavethis into your uh podcast i think i knowyou already know where i'm going whichisuh ben i heard you talk briefly abouttestosterone earlier in the showyeahthere's a big uh movement in uh thebitcoin space where uh the plebs like tosun their ballsuh what you'll takeare you seriousis this a euphemism are you mean likeactuallyyeah absolutely yeah there's evenspecial poses for it but you know mygosh this is a real thingand the the idea behind the bro scienceis that it stimulates uh you know the uhthe testosterone umin your body soi don't know if you've experimented thisin the lab but you knowyeah that'd be hard to get irb approvalfor[Laughter]yes so that's that's what bitcoinresearch is for let's fund it withbitcointhis is what an off site there's no irbin bitcoin if you get the coins you canspend them as you want oh that's how itused to be you guys that's how it usedto be i look at the work of whatscientists did in the field ofstarvation and feeding about 80 yearsago before the era of ayakus and irbsthat limit what you can do oh my goshthey were able to get away with so muchglorious work so anyway danieli i have never seen any paper publishedon this um now to to truly kind of thinkthrough the systemi i can't help but wonderhow that mechanic so i'm thinkingthrough the mechanism and maybe someonewould sayso cholesterol is honestly i i can't ican't fathom what the mechanism would bethe mechanism is that sunshine isobviously great for your skin i mean tryand hide from the sun for six monthsso so sunlightsometimes scientists can overcomplicatethings then well no no i knowbut but but let me just come backyeah so i mean sunlight does convertcholesterol into vitamin d so like i'mthinking what is the process wherebycholesterol which is the basis of allsex hormones all sex hormones come fromcholesterol which is why when you wagewar on cholesterol like through a statinlibido plummets in in men because you'redestroying their sex hormone productionbecause you're getting rid of thebuilding block so if sunlight convertscholesterol to vitamin di'm unaware of any effect where sunlightconverts cholesterol to sex hormones butso i i challenge that a little bit andi'm very familiar with that biochemicalpathway i teach lectures on this topicbut i also think evolutionarily if weneeded sunlight to have our testespromote more vitamin d they'd be on thetop of our head not literally notliterally tucked in the darkest spot onour body if we were walking around nakednow that sounds silly but i hope we canall kind of see that there's some wisdomto that if if if your point counterpointthen yeah if they didn't need sunshinethey would be inside your bodywell no that's temperature but that's agood counter but that's a temperaturephenomenon where sperm if it getsproduced at a higher body temperatureit's it's enact it's dead basically ithas to be a little cooler but but ithink that if if ifif our creation story were such that weneededsun exposure on our gonads on our testesto get enough vitamin d they would be onour back or on our shoulder theywouldn't be tucked in the darkest partof the body so i don't believe that itmakes any difference all right well justto finish up my question then if you domanage to get that funding i think thisis going to be the thing that peoplewant to fund you to look at you knowwhat though you guysif if there is any truth to this and andhonestly it would be very easy to makethese experiments i would say that willgive birth to a little device that has auv lampand you just simply tuck it between yourdrawersthey doyeah almost well no not portable deviceswell that no yeah exactlyregular tanning devicesyeah well that would be the way to do ityou just have a small little device andyou just crook it in your crotch andthen you're producing testosterone likegangbusters but but you guys in allsincerity are there reports of peoplewho have only done this independent ofany other therapy like they didn't golow carb and go carnivore which canincrease testosterone they didn't startworking out more which can also increasetestosteroneare you guys familiar is there anythingthat has removed all the confoundingvariables and said i literally didnothing butit put my sack in the sun and i hadhigher testosterone levels i believe ibelieve the uh respected bitcoin twitterscientific authority that is fartface2000 has conducted such an experimentand fart face 2000 is one of my uhreally paragons of truth and bitcoinokay you're not jokingi'm not joking i've met him i've met himbefore he's uh been to a couple of mydinners guys what have i got what have iwhat what have i gotten involved withwellandhe's a great guy he works in um i forgethis exact job he's he works inconstruction i think he's got us a areally successful job somewhere in newjersey like you're just a hard-workingvery smart guy who's just gotten intobitcoin at some point and he's likechallenging dogma yeah and he'll just ilike anything and follow it and do itand he and he was posting all of hisstuff he's like in his 50s i think andhe was you guys let me let me just saylamp and i think you get great resultswell i'll look them up um but you guysin all one very relevant variable hereas much as we fellas who want to bevirile and strong and tough focus ontestosterone the levels of testosteronein a man can vary widelyand it has no predictive power with hislean mass or his muscle mass what is amore predictive variable is that is theconcentration of testosterone receptorson muscle and bone so it's not just howmuch testosterone you have but how wellit's working where you want it to workand that is something that isvery affected by exercise you go out andexercise and you will increase androgenreceptor levels on muscleyou know almost immediately and it'llstay up so as much as wefocus on testosterone levels and theymatter to some degreea normal group of men will have levelsthat can vary almost by 10 timesand it will have nothing to do with howmuscled or you know ripped and viralthey are so i just that's kind of alittle bit of a counterum to this idea um but it's certainlycompellingyeah i mean this is i'll just add onesmall thing which is like myintuition is to just umfollow the fart faces of the worldrather than worry aboutthe mechanismbecause you know the way that scienceadvances is that people try things andthen they work and then they discoverthe mechanism so yeah yeah but but evenstill even still let's say he's exposinghimself to the suni can't help but sayum well he's just making more vitamin dand vitamin d is immune boosting it ismuscle it was bone mass yeah i guess soyou so you want to control you want to iwould just say there's a confoundingvariable here that that you just can'teliminatethat i think what you would want to dois get the same amount of sun exposurebut only difference being yeah you wouldcover that area between two groups ofpeople shouldn't be too difficult toorganize this voluntarily on twitterwell it sounds like there's a wholegroup of people who are lining up to bevolunteers i never would have imaginedi know i think we should do uhthe control group and uh yeahall right all right well peter's danielthat's awesome dude thanksi was happy to giveso my question was aboutthe reversibility of insulin resistanceso we've talked a lot about all thethings that can cause it in terms oflifestyle but if someone has alreadyentered say the pre-diabetes stageare they able to reverse throughlifestyle changes could they could theyreverse their insulin levels down to saythe levels that you're talking about inthe catalans or are they kind of beyondthe point ofa point of no return at some point yeahoh absolutely absolutely they can turnit around um in fact the reversal ofinsulin resistance by adopting this hasbeen well documentedin in india there are multiple casestudies published on this so i can speakto it with confidence umuh you have people who are so insulinresistant that they're on multiplemedicationslike like insulin taking insulin takingmetformin and other anti-diabetic drugsall you can do is start having themengage in fastingand low carb diet and within just weeksthey have to get off all of theirmedications because they've correctedthe problem so quicklyand so everyone who is either on theearliest stages where they just noticethey're a little chubby and they havehigh blood pressure or they're full ontype 2 diabetic which is like the mostobvious form of insulin resistance goingdown the roadthat can be turned around literally inweeks and and a person can start tolower their insulin in just the same daythat they decide i'm going to fast forthe next 24 hours and just drink waterand have maybe some saltto help my fast be a little easier theirinsulin levels will come down by byseveral um not orders but you know it'llgo half then third and then a quarter ofit it'll come down very very quickly andlike i said within just monthsweeks to months they're as insulinsensitive as a marathon runnerso yes very reversible it is the goodnews the gospel of metabolic research isthat if you use diet to cure the problemthen you've cured it but the food we eatis the culprit or the cure and when weacknowledge the relevance of food as thecause then we acknowledge that it alsocan be the cureokayso just one follow-up question then soin terms of the damage that insulinresistance doesif you're saying that it can be totallyreversed thenhow is the damage done is the damagedone cumulatively over time and thenwhen you get to a certain point you knowyou can't reverse the alzheimer's youcan't reverse the condition generatoryes that what a great questionunfortunately i can't give a universalanswer to that because it would betissue specificum let's take for example the musclewhen muscle becomes insulin resistantinsulin can't defend muscle protein aswell and you start to have a higher rateof what's called catabolism or just thebreakdown of the muscle protein whichincreases what's a situation calledsarcopenia a person who says musclesthat are getting wasted away that's partof insulin resistance you can correctthat the moment the muscle becomesinsulin sensitive then then muscleprotein gets defended and you'vecorrected the muscle wasting and thesame would go with the liver fatty liverdisease is the most common liver problemin in in the world and it uh is largelya result at least partly of chronicallyelevated insulin stimulating fatproduction in the liver well you startto lower the insulin and the fat startsto clear itself out so those are totallyreversiblethe brain appears to be somewhat uniquewhere it's its pathology towardsdementia is suchthat that i cannot say that insulinresistance is the only relevant variablebecause as you start to correct insulinresistance in the body of someone withalzheimer's yes it does improve thealzheimer's but it does not fullyreverse it so that either means there isa point of no return with the insulinresistance that maybe a part of thebrain has starved enough that it's nowdead and cannot be resurrected or itsuggests that there is another variablethat we just haven't identified yetwe know it's not plaques because thatappears to have nothing to do with itbut it does suggest that there's some itcould be a differenceone of the other theories of alzheimer'sor contributors is iron metabolism andit could in fact safe i know you hadum oh what's his namemangum yeah yeah he's a big iron guy forexample so he's a good one i could referpeople to but we know although he does idon't think he talks about iron inalzheimer's but we know that iron canaccumulate and disrupt um the the thewhat's called a redox balance andoxidative stress in the brain so that'san additional inputthat might not get addressed in somepeople and that's that's somewhat of agenetic component as well as you knoweating supplemented foods with ironwhich which so many we all do if itcomes in a bag or a box with a barcodeit's got some kind of iron supplementedinto it rather than the heme iron thatyou get from say beefum but anyway yeah so some problemswhich aren't entirely a result ofinsulin resistance and alzheimer's mightbe that aren't going to be totallyreversible that's maybe the safest wayof saying it who else has got questionsyeah i just thought that um on thetanning and discussion we had previouslyif it if it could be possible that theskin on your body that has not beenexposed to the sun at allmaybe um it can absorb more vitamin dyeah absolutely the darker thecomplexionyeah the harder it is to have the uvlight convert the cholesterol intovitamin d which is why in general thefairer the complexion you know i'm apasty white guy um i would make a lotmore vitamin d say if you have a darkercomplexion than me kind of middleeastern complexion you would need moresunyou know like the vitamin d that i'dmake in five minutes you would needmaybe 20. you know so so andreabsolutely um but that is again aconfounding variable to this study thatwould make it difficult is it are theyfeeling better just because there's moretestosterone but again testosteronelevel is only part of the variable it'stestosterone receptor concentration butyeah it could be that you're making morevitamin d because that's such a fairlycomplected skin by fair i mean likelighter complected that you can justmake more vitamin d with a given unit uhgiven you the exposure per time hithis was a very great conversationuh so my question is also one broscience about sunscreenshall we use itor is it better to go so naturally yeahyeah so i'm uniquely qualified to answerthat question because i sunburn soreadily you know you ask that questionto someone else and they say i neverneed sunscreen and they don't theyliterally don't get burned i burnum now i know a lot of people say justdon't eat seed oils and you won'tsunburn anymore that is just not true umthat is just not true some skincomplexions just burn so i would ratherget a sunburn than put sunscreen on mybodyno question i don't even have to thinkabout it so what i but i don't like toget sunburnedso i will just kind of dose my sunexposure if i'm out at a beach or at apool or whatever with the kids i willabsolutely strip down to my just my myswim shorts and i will get some sun fora good chunk of time then when i feellike i'm reaching a limit i'll put on ashirt and just put on a hat and continueto enjoy the sun i will not putsunscreen on it is so there are so manychemicals in that that get readilyabsorbed into the bloodstream i wouldrather get a sunburn than have sunscreenon my bodynow if you're putting on like a zincoxide kind of but then you look allpasty white and weird you knowbut even still i want some sun exposureespecially on the trunk of my body iwant to make vitamin d i want to set mycircadian rhythms such that my melatoninknows when to be suppressed and it knowswhen to turn onso it there are so many benefits to sunexposure that the more you're blockingthissun effectthe more you're undoing a really healthboost and unfortunately because we liveunder fake light in in buildings all daylong with uv protection on our windowswe never are getting sunlight um so ithink people ought to make a pointeven if you're justifying the sunexposure bysaying that your testes need somesunlight then whatever sunlight is justa good thing but i'm i'm very opposed tosunscreenuh can i just follow up also about thethe sun because there's a lot of attackon the sunso would you comment that sunlightmakes you olderif you are avoiding sun that you willlook younger in the older ageand also if you sunburn more will youhave a higher risk of canceryeah yeah yeah good question um soeverybody know please i'm answeringthese questions with a little bit ofspeculation you know i'm a metabolicmitochondria guy these are topics thati'm familiar with but i'm not anauthority on them but i have enoughfamiliarity to have an opinionum so so with sunumit does appear that the more someone isgetting blistering sunburns the morethey will develop skin canceryeah now getting a little pink no idon't see that there's any there's neverbeen correlation but these are allcorrelational studies which i have agreat deal of disdain forand i'm sure this is a group whoappreciates causal studies compared tocorrelational studies all of this iscorrelational where they just happen tosee people who are getting blisteringsunburns will tend to have more skincancer there are a lot of differenttypes of skin cancerand you can have people with very darkcomplexions who don't get any sunburnsever and yet they can still get skincancers because there's just so manydifferent typesand then dorian what was the otherquestion sunburn and cancer and thenwhat was the the first oneyeah sothe people who are attacking thesunlightthey are sayingyeahyeah no i i i don't know i mean i don'tbuy that really um what i do know isthat the higher someone's glucose levelsare allow me to kind of hijack thatquestion and bring it back to somethingi do know whether sun can cause wrinklesi i don't know i've never seen a studyon thatum but i i do know that high levels ofglucose will create what's called a wecall it a my art reaction that canhappen on the skin you guys know a myyard reaction is what happens when youwhen you char something like when welike safe wants some beef he puts it inhis sous vide machine and then no onewants to eat the meat right out of thesous vide you go sear itin that kind of crisp sear that's what'scalled a mayard reaction and a part ofthat is what's happening it happens lesson the meat but it can happen onvegetables from takingglucose molecules and then convertingthem due to the heat or in this case dueto the sun exposure so when someone isgetting a lot of mild reactions that canin fact cause wrinkled skinand soum i would say it's less sun and itwould be more what are your glucoselevelsthank youyeah i mean my personal experience isthat you will burn if you're not uhexposed to sunlight a lot so if you'vespent the winter innorth americaand you fly to mexico in march and thenspend a week in the sun you will burnand it could get ugly couldcould be very bad but if you graduallyum introduce your sun to sunlight if youmake sure that even during the winteryou get exposed as much sun as you canand then you'reif you don't um up the dose of sunlightonceat once then your body will justgrow into it and i'll be able to handlemore and more sun soum i i could spend hours in the sunlightand i don'tbut again who knows i could be wrong itcould be her hiring me in certain wayssowho knowsall right anybody else have any morequestions we'vegone for well it's been two hours and 15minutes almostbut does anyone have any more questionsben oh yeah i've just got a quick oneben on your take um it's back to theinsulin management uh an old supplementbeen around forever called berberineyepyep and so in fact i did a i hate topush anyone to instagram i i found thati initially was on twitter i alsostarted doing more kind of littlelessons on instagram and i did one aboutberberine just because there's so manythere's so much um curiosity about itberberine absolutely works there'sabundant peer-reviewed umplacebo-controlled double-blindedclinical studies which is the best wecan get assuming that everyone's honestwith itthat absolutely show that berberine doesimprove insulin sensitivity and it doesso by activating this little enzymecalled ampk which the moment ambk isactivated which berberine turns on itwill stimulate glycol uh it'll stimulatesugar burning so lowering sugar bloodsugars lowering insulin overallimproving insulin sensitivity so ifsomeone were to go to their physicianand the physician said ah you havepre-diabetes i want to put you on a drugcalled metforminmetformin actually works through a verysimilar mechanism to berberine i wouldsay not that i'm giving anyone clinicaladvice of course i would say you knowwhat maybe try the berberine firstbecause it yes it will have a moremodest effect than metformin will but italso doesn't have the kind of gutwrenchingside effects that metformin hasliterally gone thank you i i gave upsugar about six months ago which waskind of painful but uh opted to uh starttaking 500 milligrams of berberine andnoticed a dramatic i mean it's you knowwhat good for youi was tricky you know as far as you kindof have this lethargic kind of i don'tknow you described it earlier and asyou're trying to get away from thesugars and just uh just burning yourfats if you will um but now it's justlike normalized and you know if you'regoing to go out and do a heavy like woodcutting day which i do a lot of yeahmaybe i don't think that day yeah youknow what also you should try if you'remonitoring your blood sugars at alleveryone could do this it worksremarkably well add a little bit of rawunfiltered apple cider vinegar into yourclub soda or a cup of waterit's it's remarkable these little it'spart of it's part of the lessonsactually doing thatgood for you and it's it's just alltogether just i just was curious on whatyou're really in depth with a lot ofthis stuff and you know i'm just more orless triangulating i've picked up inother places um yeah i think a bigproponent of david sinclair aging guyhas has reallyguided down that lineyeah so david sinclair is more of abiohacker than i'm comfortable with heloves to promote a certain number ofsupplements he's also from harvard sohe's out there to sell a lot ofstuff well the fact he is he is a bit ofa shill yep yep so i've i've reallystarted to lose respect for him anyonelike him who tells people to take thesedrugs like metformin is a drug he tellspeople to takeand and i think what an asinine piece ofadvice to to suppose that thisforeignman-made substance is somehow going tohelp you live longer when and we know inhumansmetformin works by damaging mitochondriaalbeit slightly but this is whyyou show that people who undergo undergoaerobic exercise which i never do i onlydo resistance training for best bang forthe buck but people who undergo aerobicexercise will have bigger strongermitochondriabut when they take metformin it undoesall of the mitochondrial adaptationsthat exercise it puts you back tobaseline and i don't know how someonecould justify taking a drug that wherewe all say everyone would agree exerciseis a key to living a longer healthierlife oh but also take this drug the factthat it will undo the benefits ofexercise well that's just aninconvenient truth i want to be popularand so if i promote all these cleverbiohacking substances people are goingto adore me for iti think he's just gone too far yeah andalso it's it's all the same climatehysteria nonsense and you shouldn't eatmeat then you should eatyou know this magic little grape that ifyou have three grapes in the morningthen yep yep that's right that's what isaid the thing about super foodseveryone says all these super foods justthis molecule and grapes and no i meanit's so silly it's just so silly tothink that humans evolved to need thesekinds of silly little things when ourancestors would have never eaten grapesthey ate yeah and i mean thevast majority of humans have had zeroexposure to the vast majority of plantsfor all their lives like oh the vastmajority of that's right you see in yoursupermarket were only ever available toyour ancestors we yeah we had to breedthem we had to breed them in a way toreduce the toxins and enhance what canbe digestible and and give us energy wehave in our in our clever technologicalerahave created plants from plants thatwould have been inedible in a previousgenerationthank you so much for all of this thishas been absolutely amazing umi really really enjoyed it thank you somuch thank you so much for all your workthank you for really just focusing theflashlight of truth on the thing thatmatters like just stop eating garbageyou get healthy and then you know letthe fiat people argue about their papersforever and their mechanisms and allthese weird acronyms butum the most important thing people needto know is just don't eat garbage yeahwhile they're while they're strugglinggetting papers peer-reviewed i'll be outsharing truthyeah i'll be out eating steak at sharingthe truth that's rightand thriving basically

guest is dr benjaminbickman dr benjamin bickman is abest-selling author and professor atbrigham young university he specializesin the role that insulin and nutrientmetabolism play in regulating obesitydiabetes and dementiahe has he earned his phd inbioenergetics and was a post-doctoralfellow in metabolic disorders at dukenational universityof singapore and he joins us today for adiscussion on the topic of why we getsick which is also the title of hisbest-selling book which has beentranslated towhat is it now 20 i think languages wellno not quite about halfway there yeahbut some relevant ones yesso thank you for joining us benoh my pleasure safety thanks so much toyou and the team for getting me on it'sit's it's great to be chatting to you ithink uh your perspective on um diseasein your book is is a very interestingand very refreshing one and it's um whati like about it is that it gets to theheart of the matter in a very practicalway in a sense of you know how can youactually not get sickrather than getting lost in academicdebates and academic pissing contestswhich canbe too often the case in academia soit's good to keep your eye on the prizeon what matters and i think this is thisis what your book doesso let's get right to it why do we getsickyeah yeah thanks again i actually likethe way you framed this because we bothyou and i i think uh share a commondisdain foracademia and it's ironic a little maybefor me i don't mean for it to soundungrateful because i am a professorat a university currently andi amso mindful of the nonsense that happensat universities and so it was very muchan interest of mine to takethe knowledge that we scientists aregainingand go break through the barrier ofyou know the traditional model for uswould be that we publish a paper in apeer-reviewed journal and no one everreads it except a handful of otherscientists and it and thus is largelyirrelevant to actually improvingsomeone's life i really wanted tocircumvent that futile cycle of academiaand take relevant information right topeople so the question why do we getsick you know i naturally was looking atthisquestion through my lens and i mytraining is in kind of metabolicbiochemistry and physiologyand i couldn't help butsee there wasone common foundationto virtually every non-communicablechronic disease so the chronic diseasesthat you getwith that have nothing to do with youknow infectionand you know this is like cancers andheart disease alzheimer's diseasediabetes kidney disease etcandof course each of these problems haveunique inputsi want i would want everyone to knowthat that each of these problems do haveunique origins but they all haveone common origin and that is insulinresistance it is this disorder thatpeoplei mean the reason i didn't call my bookwhat is insulin resistance is why doesit matter is because i knew no one wouldbuy it they would look at the title andthey would say well i'm not a diabetic idon't need to read that they just seeinsulin and they think diabetes butinsulin is an absolute life-givinghormone it is essential you have to haveit and which and if you don't likeuntreated type 1 diabetes you will diein short order so this is an essentialhormone that literally impactsevery cell of the bodythere's no exception to this i don't usethe term literally too liberally likethe kids do these days there's it is itliterally affects every cell in the bodyand it dictates the theme of whatinsulin does is it tells the cell whatto do with the energy that it hasso whatever the the nutrient or thecaloric energy isthat's in the system that's coming inthe system or it's already storedinsulin will tell the cell what to dowith it and thus it's pretty essentialevery cell needs energy neverthelessinsulin resistance is a disorder todefine it now explicitly it's really acoin with two sides or a disorder withtwo facets that must come together youcannot have one side of the coin withoutthe other the first part of thisdefinition of what insulin resistance isis that insulin as a hormone isn'tworking as well as it used to thatevokes the kind of resistance part of itthat some cells aren't responding verywell but then the second part of it isvery often overlooked but equallyessential to understand why it's sopathogenic why insulin resistance issuch a problem and that is that insulinlevels are chronically elevateda condition called hyperinsulinemia soyou have the two of these togetherinsulin isn't working correctly andblood insulin levels are elevated andboth of those together constitute thethe background for so many of thesechronic disorders or diseases you knowfor exampleand then i can finish the answer becausei'm getting long-winded but let's takethe two most common forms of infertilityin women the most common form ofinfertility is a disorder calledpolycystic ovary syndrome pcosand this is a disorder of too muchinsulin and that is why if a woman haspcosshe absolutely has insulin resistanceand but not because the insulin isn'tworking well but because it's too highand when insulin levels get too high ina woman it actually inhibits the ovariesability to create normal balances of sexhormones she can't make estrogens aswell as she could before and she failsto ovulate and now she has polycysticovary syndrome but in a manthe most common infertility is erectiledysfunctionand that's a problem of the insulin notworking well not the elevated insulinper se but again you still have both ofthose things always happening togetherbut in his case for normal erectilefunction you have to have a significantvasodilation or the blood vessels haveto dilate and alter blood flowaccordingly but when the blood vesselsbecome resistant to insulin effectsinsulin which normally is providing thatdilation effect can'tinduce dilation as well and the bloodvessels stay constricted and theconstricted blood vessels means erectiledysfunction so that's such a it's aninterestingdichotomy looking at the two forms ofinfertility in women and men where eachof them is caused by a different aspectof insulin resistance yeah and it's justsomething that continues to come up withall kinds of medical conditions isastonishing even as a non-doctori would say probably especially as anon-doctorit just keeps coming upyou know you you hear about a certaincondition or you know somebody who getssick in something because with somethingand you read more about it you hear themtalk about itandthis always comes up you know there'salways thismention of sugar blood blood sugarlevels insulin levels insulin resistanceit's implicated in so many things what ifind fascinating and you know i i'd liketo kind of uh switch back and forthbetween the academic topic itselfand the way that academics study itbecause that's another focus of my workwhich i discussed in the fiat standardof um just how academia isessentially massively compromised and agiantattack on your ability to understand theworld and reason properly it's not justthat they're doing um innocuous nonsensethat nobody cares about it's thatthey're actively preventing people fromunderstanding what the problem isbecauseyou knoweven as a non-specialist you see thisthing come up everywhere and then if youdo one day in your life try and say heylet me just take a look at this let mesee if i can bring my blood sugars downfor a while and see what i can do andsee what effect it has on me and thenall these different kinds of healthproblems that you thought were just thenormal part of growing up disappear andyou're back to being healthy andpowerful and strong in many waysand so you would imagine you know theyyou'd imagine doctors would be out thereshouting this from the rooftops tellingeverybody to hey you know focus on thislittle thing called insulin your bloodsugar try and keep that downif you are overweight if you're diabeticif you have all these um problemsdementiayou likely benefit from this and yetinstead what we see isjust like with economics we see thesenerds that parrot out complicated wordsthat obfuscate thingsand then ultimately lead to youcontinuing to eat the garbage confusedand not knowing what's going on and ithink the really sad thing is you knowhow many people will umin academia i mean if you if you look atdebates online you know you have allthesegreat instagram and twitter uh socialmedia fitness influencers who've beenout there training clients for years andknow what works and know what doesn'twork and know that you know if you'reoverweight and you want to get in shapelay off the junk do this do that andthey know what works and they're outthere arguing with these overweightusually uh university professors who areout there telling them noyou guys are not authorities you don'tunderstand you're focusing on bloodsugar that's been debunked here's someobscure paper from pubmedabout how actually it's not blood sugarthat matters it's all these othergenetic slash they'll say it's saturatedfat yeahyeah or some other thing or the otherbut you know just whatever you do justmake sure you don't try to cut down onyour sugar intake and you don't lower itlower your insulin levels butthe evidence for it i mean everybody whotries it basically i don't know anybodywho's tried reducing their blood sugarlevels and their insulin levelsand reducing the level of informationthat they've done and have and anddidn't feel better from it and yetacademia continues toignore thisyeah yeah so why do you think this isthe caseyeah well i think there's there'scompeting interests without a doubtum and i very much appreciate theaudience that i have here which isif i may define this group in such a wayat least one attribute would be a heartyskepticismand that's one that i share indeed allscientists by their very nature shouldshare that skepticism the job of ascientist is to try to prove a theoryfalse and now we have thisthis this flipping of science into areligion where people are proud to justproclaim i believe in science and as ascientist i think that is a terriblyunscientific way to view scienceif you're a scientist everyone shouldthink like a scientist in a way if i maysay it like that without sounding smugwhich is we should all be trying tounderstand truth by challenging what wethink we know and now it is just wellthis person said something i like and soi believe in science oh but you're ascientist who's saying somethingdifferent well you're going to beostracized and removed from politesociety but you you brought up a lot ofrelevant points that i just have toelaborate on brieflypart of the problem with conventionalkind of biomedical care or clinical careis that we havewe have based an enormous amount of ourview of metabolic health purely on bloodglucoseand i'm not saying blood glucose doesn'tmatterbut the problem with that view thisglucocentric view of metabolic health isthat we have overlooked insulincompletely and i've given talks toclinicians you know physicians andnurses and physician assistants and iwill saywe are too obsessed with glucose we needto look at insulin and it becomes almosta circular discussion where they willsay we don't need to look at insulinbecause we're measuring glucose and it'skind of the same and i have to teachthem that they're not the same that youcan have someone who's coming in everyyear for their annual checkup and theglucose levels are staying normalstaying normal but what's happeningbehind the scenes is insulin is goinghigher and higher and higher in order totry to keep the blood sugar in checkand that is this exact paradigm ofnormal glucose levels but elevatedinsulin several times higher than whatit should be is insulin resistance andthen it's only once the body has becomeso resistant to insulinone ofwhose jobs it is is to help lowerglucose that the glucose levels start toclimb and now it gets on the clinicalradar but but the problem doesn't endthere so the first problem is by failingto look at insulin we failed to detectthe problem as soon as we could detectit but the next problem is just as badwhich is our obsession with loweringglucose the moment the glucose doesstart to climba conventional clinician conventionalthinking scientist and clinician will beto say let's just give you insulin andlike in a person who's insulin resistantthey'll say let's just push the insulinup and yeah that will lower the glucosebut the more we knowthis is amply published review data forwhatever that's worth because we all gotto be skeptical even of published datanowadays but we know that the more youpush insulin up in an insulin resistanttype 2 diabetic in order to control theglucose they may have normal or idealglucose levels and yet we're killingthem they're three times more likely todie from heart disease and twice aslikely to die from alzheimer's diseaseand cancer so we are killing when wegive an insulin resistant type 2diabetic more insulin it's like we'regiving an alcoholic another glass ofwine hoping it will solve the problemwhen in reality we're giving them moreof the very thing that's causing theproblem too much insulin is a primarydriver of insulin resistance so why onearth would we give them more insulin totry to correct the glucose we make surein so doing that the person gets fatterand sicker and they die fasterbutso much of the problem is that theclinicianespecially if these are in the u.s likemedicare patients it just extends ithink the nhs and the uk has the samekind of target canada i know does andsafe i very much appreciated yourcriticism on social media of canadianhealthcare i was born and raised incanada and me and all of my nine myeight siblings all nine of us got out ofcanada as quickly as we couldum because of in part the ridiculoushealth care but nevertheless um wethe the the clinical model is based onthe clinician will have targets withtheir patient and it will say you needto lower their glucose by you know onepercent of hemoglobin a1c or lower theirglucose by 20 points to try to get itinto a normal range and if they don't doit the clinician gets punishedthey do get docked on the amount ofmoney they can bill for that patient'svisits and so the clinician has thisperverse incentive to say well i justneed to push up your insulin any way ican and and if it's making you fatterand sicker and putting you on more drugsat least it's lowered your glucose andthat's one of the clinical markers i'mgoing to get graded on but at the end ofit all underlying all of thisin my kind of concluding thought forthis rant is that while we're givingpeople all these clever expensive drugsto try to lower their glucose levels theone little rational person on the sidei'm one of them and i get ostracized forit i've been criticized and i've beenthreatened with my position here whereyou will just say you're giving thepatient all these drugs to lower theirglucose why not just have them eat lessglucoseand oh no no no you can't you can't saythat you're accused of heresytruly i've been accused of teachingprinciples that are against science eventhough i strictly rely on publishedhuman clinical trials to defend my viewsand yet it's just too heretical are yousuggesting that people can live withoutdoritos and pringles every day i meanwhat kind of insaneinsane insane cruel doctor are you iknow do you have no regard for humanneeds like how could people yeah i knowhow could people not eat twinkies everyday like how can you not make that thecenter of your world view and this thisis this is what it really comes down tobecause i mean you you keep as youexplain i mean it's just insane that youwould want to raise their insulin levelsrather than reduce the sugar levels ithink one metaphor that i've come upwith to try and explain this to peopleis that it's the equivalent of you havea dirty apartment and you're trying toget somebody to clean up your apartmentand you keep hiring people to clean upthe apartmentand you're getting you're somehowignoring the fact that every day um yourson say comes into the apartment andtakes a big giant jug of pepsi and justturns it inspills it in the middle of the room andthen the cleaning person has to spendall their time just cleaning that up andthen everything else in the house fallsapart and gets dirty because every daywe have this giant mass ofsludgy sugaronthe everywhere that needs to be cleanedout and soif you think the answer is hiring morecleaning peopleyou're not going to make it becausethere's no limit to how muchyou can spill on umin a house like it takes one second tospill uh an amount of liquid sludgethat's going to take three hours toclean you know yeah it just goeseverywhere that it requires a lot ofcleaning soit's insane that medicine takes the pathof just hire more cleaning staffanddon't worry about the cause of thethe disintegration and that's yeah yeahyeah the paradigm ought to be let's putlet's um bring less garbage inand see what that doesrather than continuing to bring more andmore garbage in and hiring more and morecleaners to try to keep up for it let'sjust start putting less garbage in theapartment this is this is the amazingthing and this is this is the thing thatnone of the this is it's exactly likewith economics like with with theeconomists there there's just nevergoing to be a mainstream economist whohas a phd at an important university andat the fed or any of that stuff who'sgoing to come out and say you know whatmaybe we should just try hard money weshould try not inflating we should trynot doing all of that stuff no here'show my magic formula for managing themoney supply is actually going to umallow us to magically havegovernment spending at no cost here'show i am going to defy the rules ofphysics anduh nature and allow us to eat our seedcorn and still plant the same seed cointhat we eat this is essentially how itworks in politics and economics and it'skind of what works in nutrition it'sjustthe mentality of indulgence no we can'tsacrifice the sugary treats and we mustfind a way tomanage it it's it's like you know how dohow do wefix laptops that um get destroyed byhammers by their ownersi meanthere's just never going to be asuccessful science of fixing laptopsdestroyed by hammers because the hammerscan always destroy a laptop beyondbeing able to fix it the best method isjust not destroy it yeah yeah no it's ait's absolutely i believe there aresufficient competing interests that thatwe we are able to prop up so manyeconomies or that might not be the wordto use in an audience like this we wereable to prop up so many entities bytelling people to eat whatever you wantand then we have drugs and health carethat will help you deal with theconsequences and it's just a way ofspending more money on things that wecould go back to that first principle ofum eat better well all right but thensome okay but then the drug companiesaren't going to be able to sell as muchdrugs well then the hospitals aren'tgoing to be able to have as many sickpatients and so we have these sick basedeconomies that will sufferwell of course we shouldn't care aboutthat we want to be live long and healthybut there are all these competinginterests that i mean you there was justrecently a report published by thenutrition center at harvard university imean and this deserves all of ourdisdain and again it makes me ashamedof academia and my fellowquote unquote scientists where theyrankedmini wheats cereal higher than eggs andsteakon on the scale of nutritionin other words mini wheats was better bya wide margin they said that frostedmini wheats the cereal is better forsomeone than eggs and better for someonethan steak i i don't know on what planetthat could be stated other than theirsufficient competing interest like takefor example the american dieteticsassociation which you knowpromotes a lot of these things look atwho funds themit is not the american ranchersassociation they wish they could fundthem but the american dieteticsassociation is so opposed to animalbased products much to the detriment ofevery human on the planetbut it's it's justwho's paying the bills i mean it's avery cynical view and and it requiresit's not been comfortable for mebecause it has made it difficult for meto stay in good standing with sayexample the american diabetesassociationwherethe the conventional advice even to atype 2 diabetic who has plenty ofinsulin in their body it is literallyeat whatever you want but cover it withyour insulin just give yourself moreinsulin yeah it's a wonderful way tosell insulin it's a wonderful way tomake sure these patients are going tothe hospital very very often becausethey're very very sickwe could just say you know eat a littlebetter by that we mean eat less glucoseif you're insulin resistant that as mostpeople are worldwide this is not anamerican unique to the west this is avery much a problem in southeast asiait's very much a problem in the middleeast the most diabetic countries on theplanet are in the middle east numbersone through nine and this is this is aglobal situation we just have to tellthe peopleeat less processed sugars and processedgrains if that is just the simplest stepum that's number one for me that isfirst principle number one controlcarbohydratesbecause it's refined carbohydrates thatare going to spike insulin the most andkeep it elevated and the sooner we lowerinsulin the sooner all these metabolicissues including alzheimer's diseaseincluding certain cancers start to getbetteryeah and if you've uh you know if youhave an internet connection and you'reeven marginally curious about the topicof you know how not to be fat how not tobe sick how not to be diabeticand you just search the internet with alittle bit of an open mind you won't beable to miss the fact that there areliterally millions of people around theworld who have improved their healthhealth immeasurablyby cutting down on eating processedfoods sugary foodfoods that are high in glucose and youknow there arethousands of different ways you can doit thousands of different diets somepeople call it low carb high fat somepeople do low carb low fat some peopledo keto some people do or paleo but allof these things they have one thing incommon youget far fewer glucose spikes and hencefar fewer insulin spikes and whicheverway you take to do that you know mypersonal way to do that is just i eatonly red meat and i drink only water andit's perfect because oh that's adynamite i mean really safe it's sofunny to me everyone raves these daysabout oh eat this berry it's a superfoodor this this this kale green it's asuperfoodand it's so silly to me it is so sillybecause if you want to talk to me iwould say a superfood is a food thatliterally gives you every nutrient youneed in order to survive well that isany ruminant meat so beef exactly ifsomeone eats beef or really any ruminantanimal they're going to literally getevery nutrient they need to survive andthat is why like you mentioned a humancan literally eat nothing but beefand and survive and thrive and thrivethat's right not just survive they willthrive the strongest leanest healthiestpeople i know are the people who arejust pure carnivoreyeah absolutely and i i've tried itmyself i started doing it i think uh bythe end of this month it'll be sevenyearsand it's really been seven years andthere's no going back like once you'vetried being free man uh yeah once you'vetried being superman you never want toeat kryptonite again that's right wellsaid always want to be supermanand uh but i mean i understand you knownot everybody wants to go this far butstill if you're going to um want to makea difference in your health you have toreduce the amount of incident spikesthat you get and it's such a simple ideaand it's so easy there are so manylow-hanging fruits that you could takeout of your diet i mean i remember wheni first became curious about this i meanit's just simply being aware about noteating the bread before the lunch thatthey put there at the restaurantreducing the amount of bread in thesandwichcutting outthe excess soda that i was drinking justdrinking a little bit of soda i meanjust these low hanging fruits that nowsound completely uh undesirable to mebut just these tiny little changes thatweren't even a big issue immediatelymade a huge difference in my head yeahyeah and everybody i know who's donethis has um has witnessed this now forme i just kept on removing more thingsand just feeling better and better andbetter and i i've continued to go on buti i see it with so many people that it'sit's amazing for me that so many peopledon't notice just this think from thisperspective of just pick the low-hangingfruitand that's a far better use of your timethan arguing with academics oh my goshyeah on twitter i mean this is this isthe thing why i mean i honestlythere is absolutely nothing you willeverthat you could ever show me that iswritten in pubmed that will matter to memore than what i know from what my mybody feels yeah you're in becausei look yeah yeah my n of one which is memy own body i've tried because this isthe thing the scientific thing you knowpeople talk about science science theythink science is you know you just goand read on pubmed what some[Music]um procter gamble sponsored uh scientisthad to write in order to keep his joband you think that that's science nothat's not science that's appealed toauthority as the exact opposite ofscience science is experimentation soactually try and remove this from yourfood see how you feel look at your bloodsugar levels look at your insulin levelslook at all these health problems thatyou have you know you'll be able to tellif they're improving or they're gettingworse that there's no escaping it's yourbody you'll be able to tell and mostpeople just completely ignore that andwon't want to look at it and this isthis is why i you know the term fiatscience is accurate in many ways it'snot just that it's financed by fiat butit's also that it intends to enforcethis fiat scientific reality by fiat youknow that it by rule it's not just byfiat money it's also by government rulelike this no your body can handle a dietconsisting of twinkies and doritos andthere's nothing wrong with it becausehere's a bunch of garbage in pubmed thatproves it because it's fine they wouldthey would go further they would go forthey would literally say you're betterfor it eat these sugary cereals and itis better for you not only you canhandle it they will they will literallyrank it and give it a green goodscorei mean all it does is encourageindulgence promoting sicknesspromoting propping up industries andentities that have no business survivingand truly the truly criminal thing aboutit is not just that you're promotingsomething you're promoting somethingthat's highly addictive that's designedto be highly addictive it's designed byfood scientists have spent decadesfiguring out the exact best combinationsto trigger the reward centers in yourbrain to make you a slaveto that oreo cookie or to that snickersbar whatever it is these people haveknow what they're doing so there's thenotion you know that harvard is popularpopularized this idea that everything isgood in moderationis is is extremely pernicious it'sextremely delicious i agreei i i rail against that view the themoderation in all things is a popular umdietitian's bannering like rallying cryand all it does all that is is ajustification for indulgence and ittotally ignores the fact that mostpeople can't moderatei i i have to moderate highly addictivewell that's my pointand so there was this beautiful quote bysaint augustine who saidabstinence is easier than perfectmoderation and so they would say we'lljust have one small bowl i kind of comeback to cereal like many wheat becausethat's kind of my addiction that i'maware of like they will say just eat onelittle bowl of cerealand and sure if you could only eat onelittle bowl of cereal a half cup orwhatever the serving size is all rightyou know you could get away with thatfor a long time but you don't you neverstop there and so it is easier for theperson to look at that ice cream or thatbread or whatever and just sayi know that once i start eating it iwon't stop until i've eaten half theloaf or i won't stop until i've eatenthat whole pint of ice cream and so i'mjust not going to startso moderation in all things ignoreshuman tendency as most people do toengage in addictive self-destructivebehaviors especially with foods that areliterally as you said designed to beaddictive and they always consist ofrefined starches and sugars safe nobodynobody is sitting around on a fridaynightthe kids are in bed the house is cleanthey turn on a show with their withtheir significant otherand they they say oh man i sure coulduse a plate of scrambled eggsno oneis sitting there craving scrambled eggswhat they crave is something sweet andgooey or salty and crunchy it's going tobe a refined carbohydrate that is why myrule number one control carbs and theeasiest way to do that is if it comes ina bag or a box with a barcodeavoid it don't even open it it's notgoing to work if it's going to be ifyou're going to have a carbohydrate keepit in as unadulterated form as possiblea whole fruit or a whole vegetable butthen don't just thinkwhat i would worry is that in thisconversation so far people are onlyhearing this kind of denial denial avoidthis avoid this avoid this but in orderfor it to be sustaining you need toreplace it so replace it with proteinand fat which have little to no insulineffect those are for me rules number twoand three one control carbs twoprioritize protein from animal sourcesand three don't fear fat everyevery animal protein on the planet whichare the best proteins for humans to eatwell every organism to eat um they canevery animal protein comes with fatthere is literally no exception to thatdon't be afraid of the fat that comeswith that protein you will digest itbetter you will digest the proteinbetter and it will help blunt theinsulin the even modest insulin responseto the protein steak the best protein ithas fat eggs egg whites the best proteinthat has the yolk there's no exceptionso protein and fat come together that'show we should eat it don't try to avoidall that fat it is nutritious it is infact essentialwe need to have it but those are thethree rules of an insulin controllinglife-promoting dietyeah i'll uh my personal uh advice thati give to people who uh do this andagain i'm of course i'm not a doctor besure to check with your obese doctoryeah neither of us are giving a clinicaladvice here but we would give it betterthan[Laughter]yeah but i mean what i tell people isthe best way to avoid carbohydrates isyou don't want to fight a defensive warwhere you're hungry and you're trying torestrict yourself that doesn't workthat's right i mean it can work but itrequires an enormous amount of willpoweryep butyou don't have to do that that's reallypunishing yourself that's that's likeyou know you're you you're playing asoccer game blindfold if you're tryingto do it with the uh with that there'sno reason to do that to yourself thebest way to do it is to fill yourself upwith protein and fatfirst thing in the morning every daythink of that as almost like your jobyou know you wake up and the first thingyou dois youfocus on getting at least a pound offattyred meat in youand thenyou've already won 90 of the battleagainst these carbohydrates because thecravings are going to be very differentif you had a pound of beef and you see apint of ice cream it's very different ifyou've had a pound of beef and youhaven't had a pound of beef it'scompletely different so i sayi personally don't usually havebreakfast i only have two meals a dayyep yeah but i think in the transitionperiod if you're used to eating sugaryfood and you want to cut down on sugar iwould recommend starting the day withfatty meat and justfilling up on it and then that that'sgoing to reduce you know without youeven putting in any effort you're justgoing to end up eating less sugar thanusually i have 100 i i agree with thisperspective completely and indeed save iwould say there is significant humanevidence to to defend this so as much asialso criticize the published body ofliterature the tragedy is there are allof these valid gems that have beenpublished and just completely overlookedbecause it doesn't fit the popular iwould that fiat narrative which is wehave to promote something in order togenerate these this kind of artificialwealth through drug companies and inmedicine but if if a person can followthe adage of breakfast like a king lunchlike a prince and dinner or supper likea popper this idea of this kind ofscaling down throughout the day if youcan so i also don't eat breakfast so iwill eat a big hearty filling lunch ieat lunch and i am and it's it's fat andprotein almost exclusively and then wheni go home several hours later to havedinner with my family which issacrosanct for me i will have dinnerwith i want to have dinner with myfamilyand then i will eat a very modest dinnerand then i'm still because i'm stillkind of full from lunch and then in theevening no snacking no snack once aperson has had dinner stop eatingyou do not want to go to bed on a fullstomach and you do not want to go to bedhaving just spiked your insulin andglucose that is in my view the primaryreason why people sleep poorly if you goto bed with spiked glucose you will havean activation of your heart rateyour heart will be beating faster andharder and your body temperature will behigher and you'll be thinking i can'tsleep because i have such anxiety no youthat that's an artificial anxietyactivated by your nervous system inresponse to what you just didmetabolically but tragically that iswhen most people indulge the most it'sin the evening that's when they eat allof these sugar insulin spiking foodsit's the literally the worst time to beeating it so i agree wholeheartedly eatthe bulk of your calories in the earlierpart of the day so you can taper off asyou go into the afternoon and eveningyeah and generally you knowit's it's a great rule to not snack ithink of it this way if you have thedesire to snack less than 12 hoursafter your last meal your last meal didnot contain enough red meat well saidthat's a good ruleyeah that this is this is how you knowhave i eaten enough red meat likethere's no magic number of pounds ofbeef that you need to eat every day thatapplies for every person it depends onyou your body your size the amount ofeffort that you put in and every daybut a good rule of thumb is you shoulddefinitely not be craving anything inthe in the next 12 hours if you ateenough then the next 12 hours fooddoesn't even cross your mind this thisis the right way to go about it andinitially it's going to be moredifficult because you're still a sugaraddict and there's an adjustment but theeasiest way to handle that adjustment isto justdouse it with fatty beans no no in facti to speak on that point of adjustingthe the body is an energetic hybridum where at any moment the body has twoprimary metabolic fuels that it'srelying on which is blood sugar or orfat those are the two fuels at anymoment the body is primarily sugarburning or it's primarily fat burningand that is entirely 100 percentdictated by insulin when insulin iselevated it shifts the metabolic engineto sugar burning when insulins down themetabolic engine if you will shifts tofat burning the more a person is stuckin sugar burning the harder it's goingto be to fast and not snack because thebody has a very finite amount of sugarstored in it and so if we're alwaysburning that sugar that's an engine thatwe need to be topping up that that's atank a fuel tank that the person wouldneed to feel like they have to top upfrequentlybut if they can kind of get through thisinitial adjustment stage as you notedthen insulin starts to come down thenthe body starts to shift and rely on theother fuel tank namely fats and even alean person has well over a hundredthousand calories stored on them as fatit's like we have all of these energybars and energy drinks strapped onto ourbodies that we just can't use becausewe're constantly filling up that littleum tank so it's almost like let me usethe analogy of a big fuel tanker like abig semi truck with a big tank of fuelthat it's hauling on the backand then every four or five hours thistruck or you know six hours it needs tostop and fill upand it's filling it needs to fill upbecause it's relying on this smalllittle tank under the engine in the cabof the of the truck and yet the irony isso much of its effort is hauling aroundall of this other fuel that's strappedto the back of this big fuel tanker andimagine if thisengine was such that it could take thefuel lines from the engine and starttapping into all of the calories all theenergy that it's hauling around butisn't using well then that trunk thattruck could go for daysthe analogy then comparing it to thehuman body is that we have these two twoenergy stores we have about 2 000calories stored as sugar and maybe 200000 calories stored as fat and we keepusing just that sugar using it upfilling it up using it up filling it upand any excess that we fill into thattank spills into this other tank of fatthat we're never tapping into becausewe're constantly filling that sugar tankso the moment we let thesugar tank run dry and it'll be a littleuncomfortable there is that adjustmentbut give it a couple days insulin willhave come down we've basicallyre-plumbed the fuel lines to have thatengine tapping in the metabolic enginetapping into stored fat and now when wego on a hike you know it's here in themountains of the mountain west in utahmy family we go on hikes all the timeand we i will see very overweight peopleand they will have this little theselittle kind of fanny packs of energybars and you have my family we're alllean and fit and strong and healthy wedon't have nothing but waterit's because we have any enough fuel onour bodies we're all lean but we stillhave enough fuel that we could go run 50miles 100 miles and not run out of fuelif we were so inclined and these peoplecan't even hike five miles they start toget hangry and uncomfortable it'sbecause they're stuck in sugar burningmode and the more you eat sugar the moreyou're dependent on it and so you justhave to break that you have to just sayi'm not going to get mycarbs from bags and boxes with barcodesand i'm just going to focus on fats andproteins it'll be a little bituncomfortable give it a few days andit'll be right as rain and that personwill have shifted to becoming a fatburneryeah this is this is really uh it'salmost likerunningtwo different kinds of uh operatingsystems in the human body you knowthere'sit's like there's windows and mac andlinux there's fat burners and sugarburners and i i've tried being a fatburner and i've tried being a sugarburnerand if you've not tried both i thinki mean you know people like toexperiment with all kinds of thingspeople like to enjoy all kinds ofexperiences like watching tv shows andtraveling to places and consuming allkinds of thingsi think you might want to considerthis kind of experience you know trywhat it would be like to be a fat burnerwell saidjustyou know ever wonder what you would looklike if you could put on a superman suityeah that's kind of what it is well andthere's another perk in addition to umthe ability to not be so dependent oneating every two hours when a person isin a state of fat burning that gets tothe order of about 16 to 20 hours it'sthat acuteif insulin is low the body startsburning so much fat that but with lowinsulin it can't stop and so it's burnedenough fat that it's met its energeticdemand every cell is properly fueled butbecause insulin is low it can't stopburning fatand so you start burning more fat thanyou literally need to meet yourenergetic needs and that excess of fatburning turns into these moleculescalled ketones and everyone's heard ofketones or keto and unfortunately it's afour-letter word it's disparaged it'sreviled it's just because it's somisunderstood but ketones speaking offeeling betterwe have just we just published a paperlast year looking at humans we hadpost-mortem brain samplesof the um of the hippocampus which isthe kind of memory learning centerthat's the part of the brain that getscompromised with alzheimer's disease andin these post-mortem samples we lookedat the metabolic genes related toglucose burning and ketone burningbecause the brainrelies on those two fuels the brain doesnot burn fat it uses fat for structuredoesn't burn fat for fuel unlike therest of the body the burn the brain willburn sugar like glucose or ketonesbut what we found in alzheimer's diseaseis that the sugar burning becomescompromisedit can't burn sugar as well because it'sbecome insulin resistant and but it hasa perfect ability to burn ketones andthis is reflected in human case studiescase reports where you have someone withfull-blown alzheimer's disease eitherput them into a ketogenic diet or givethem a ketone drink to boost up theirketones and in real time you detectimprovements in cognition you've notcured the disease it's not that dramaticunfortunately it is irreversible to adegree but whereas someone was so hadsuch dementia that they couldn't getthemselves dressed now they canthey had such dementia that theycouldn't draw the face of an analogclock and now they can i mean these aretrue improvements that you see all byshifting the fuel but the tragic in thetragedy of the average individual isthat with alzheimer's disease especiallywhich is something we're all afraid ofto some degree or another because it'ssuch a horrifying disorder to be trappedwithin your own brainbut we look at the progression of thisdisease and insulin resistanceis more is has a higher statisticallysignificant correlation to alzheimer'sthan age does even and this is howpowerfully predictive insulin resistanceis but as the brain becomesprogressively insulin resistantyou have two tragedies that occurconcurrently one the insulin resistanceof the brain means that it can't get asmuch glucose and so the brain starts togo hungry ironically the body isswimming in a sea of glucose and yet thebrain just can't get it but then secondbecause the person is insulin resistantthey have high insulin levels and highinsulin levels inhibit any production ofketones because it shuts off fat burningand so the brain is starving for a lackof glucose and it's crying out forketones that the body simply will notgive it because the elevated insulinwon't allow it to happen and so the thebrain literally starts to starveand you start to have dementia and it'snot only that that scenario that i justdescribed is not only relevant toalzheimer's disease but several otherneurological disorders like migraineheadaches we have known since 1928 thereare published reports from 1928 thatpeople who frequently suffer frommigraines if you put them into a ketoticstate through a ketogenic diet orfasting they will have no more migrainesthey will literally stopand be maintained and this was repeatedin studies published in 1930 um withepilepsy we've known with epilepsy fordecades that you put that child into aketotic state they will have no epilepsythe problem with these and otherdisorders is as much as we knew thatketones are probably most therapeutic tothe brain more than any other tissue inthe body they fell out of favor themoment we started developing drugsepilepsy was always treated with aketogenic diet well now we have theseepileptic drugs these anti-epilepticsthat'll help they never work as wellmigraines it was once treated with aketogenic diet well now we have thesegood migraine medications so you shouldjust take these instead it absolutelyand the same thing happened with eventype 1 diabetes type 1 diabetes used tobe treated by like basically carnivoredietand because the lower insulin need lowerblood glucose levels help them surviveand feel better in the absence ofinsulin and then the moment we kind ofmass produced insulin which on one handis life-saving so i can't critique thatit does improve the life of the type 1diabetic there's no arguing that but wesh but but now we started to tell themyou can eat just like everybody else eatall that cake eat all those cookies andbreads just cover it with your insulinthat's the line and all it does is putthe poor type 1 diabetic child on thisglycemic roller coaster all dayof getting too high and getting too lowas opposed to telling even the type 1certainly the type 2 diabetic saycontrol your carbohydrates and now theybasically just have a flat line ofglucose all day and their insulin kneesgo down to a tenth of what it would havebeen otherwiseyeah the truly astonishing thing here isthat absolutely nothing by any stretchof the imagination absolutely nothingcomparestocutting down on eating sugary foodin terms of cost reward i mean it's justinsane when you look at all these otherthings like yeah let's give themanti-epileptic drugs like you thinkdecades later now we start to see allthe side effects of those drugs and allthe problems that they cause and all theumcomplications that then require moredrugs which then cause even moreproblems so you have that as an optionso that you you know you sign up for alifetimedrug addictionessentially that doesn't work as welland it costs a lot of money and it ruinsyour healthor you know you just stop eating garbageand it works much better whether it'sepilepsy whether it's diabetes whetherit's alzheimer's whether it's all ofthese health issues you see the samething like it's it's it's out there asyou said in the literature it's alreadybeen demonstrated it's also out theredemonstrated in the real world ofliterally thousands and thousands ofpeople all over the world who startedtheir own blogs and have their ownbusinesses built around this you knowthe outside i mean thankfully theinternet has allowed people toessentially be doctors outside of themedical establishment that's what a lotof these influencers on social mediareally are and and i thoroughly respectthem because they are doing science youknow they they've worked with actualclients they've trained them they'vetaken uhtheir uh measurements they've looked attheir blood work over time they've seenwhat works they've seen what doesn'twork they've read literature andeverybody comes up with the sameconclusion like this stuff works for allkinds of different things and it's it'sit's an enormous amount of mentalgymnastics you have to do to avoid thatvery obvious very low cost very highreturnin the uminterventionand think of other things and reallythis is this is i think if if you're inthe medical field and if you're in thescientific research field and you'relistening to this um of course there's alittle bit of defensiveness of oh wellhow do you know well you're not a phd inumbiology and how do i talk well neitherof us are md's right yeah neither of usare md's and how do i know and of courseall these people will claim expertisebut really if you if your expertisehas resulted in you beinga not being able to notice that the byfar the most effective intervention thatcould possibly be done is reducereducing the level of insulin resistancein a patient through dietary controlthen i'm sorry but your entire degreeand all of your educate education if itis in any sense related to this andyou've missed this lowest hanging fruitthis absoluteelephant of a fruit that is low hangingright there for you to pick and you'vemanaged to miss that but instead you'vestudied all this extremely sophisticatedarcaneacademic discussion aboutall these cells and genetics and all ofthese uh other arcane things drug drugmechanisms yep drug mechanisms and allof these acronyms and names and you knowall these people that are just are soexpert in all those things really ifyou've managed to miss that hey cut downon doritos first and you're talkingabout all these extremely sophisticatedscientific concepts that you thinkyou're better than normal people becauseyou understand them and normal peopledon't understand them i am sorry butyou've been scammed you've

first loss of innocencejust to really put a fine point in whatwe're describing in addition to i'll addthat humans are great self-deceivers wewe fool ourselves i would when i duringthe course of my phd in north carolina iwould go from our little home and iwould bike i biked all the time we onlyhad one car and my wife was home withour new baby i would bike to the medicalschool where i took most of my phdcoursesthe biochemistry the bioenergetics thephysiology etc i would have to bikeeven though it was less convenient forme i would bike on the opposite side ofthe road of where the med school wasbecause i had to go to the far side ofthe medical school because the sidewalkof the medical school block was filledwith nurses and doctors who weretechnically off the private the propertyof the hospital to go to the sidewalk inorder to smokethey would go to the sidewalk so theycould smoke and so there were so manythat would be aligned there along thereof all the time that i have to bike onthe other side of the road and i wouldlook at these healthcare professionalsand just wonder at the hypocrisy or theignorance or the self-delusion where youcould imagine a physician who would beout there smoking a cigarette go back infor a clinical appointment with apatient who has lungfailure and heart disease and he wouldlook at the patient's chart and say ahwell looks like you smoke uh half apound or a pack ofcigarettes a day you really gotta stopsmoking and yet the stench of his owncigarette smoke comes into the clinicalappointment with himthis isand another something i see as a parentyou'll see i've literally seen thishappena mom is at a playground with her childthe and the mom has a little bag ofcandies and the baby the little childcomes up to mom hey can i have somecandy and the mom will give the littlekid a small littlehandful here's some little gummy candiesnow don't ask for any more you've hadenough this isn't good for you to havetoo much and then the moment that littlechild ran away i saw them what did themom start doing it's just hand over fistshoving those gummy candies into hersick body her sick overweight body and ithoughtthese moments of hypocrisy one i took itto heart andanalyzed my own behavior thinkingwhere am i hypocritical where i willtell my child okay you've watched tv foran hour that's enough no more and then iwill go and watch it for four hours youknow i mean just as an example it mademe analyze my own behavior more to bemindful of my own hypocrisy but then itjust was such a such an obvious displayof the hypocrisy that just pervadeshuman nature including thosewho well especially because it is suchblatant hypocrisy those who know betterwe knowwe know that if you are insulinresistant you're a type 2diabetic or type 1 literally yourdisease could be defined as you have ahard time metabolizing sugar in yourblood that's why your sugar is climbingwhy on this good green earth would wethen tell the person which entities doamerican dietetics american diabetesamerican heart they will say eat a lowfathighcarbohydrate diet that is literally theclinic the dietary advice that theseentities promote that they will sayit is criminal and yet there must besuch cognitive dissonance because theyknow the blood sugar levels are gettingtoo high well then as i already said ihate that i'm repeating myself just putless sugar in the system and it willlower the sugar it will lower theinsulin than than the insulin resistancewhich is the heart of all metabolicproblems and then all of the issues thatare derivative of that everything startsto get better rather than trimming thissick little tree at the branches bygiving here a medication or theirmedication we just chop the damn thingdown and now we don't have to worryabout pruning it anymoreyeah one of the one absolutely mostheartbreaking things that happened whenyou start learning about how this wholeinsulinmechanism works and you see thedifference in youis you try and tell your family andfriends and uh one of the worst thing iswhen you have a family member who'sclearly suffering from serious healthproblems and clearly could benefitenormously from them and they might evenbe willing to listen except that theirdoctor told them no noyou don't have to worry about any ofthat stuff focus on taking yourmedication and be sure to come to myoffice once every two weeks so that wecan check your whatever it isbut don't listen to your nephew orgrandkid or all these people that arereading weird things on the internet ihave a degreethis is this is you know think aboutthings that make you go really reallyreally angry and this is yeah and youcan't say one of the dirty secretsespecially of medical practice um i sawthis firsthand there i was a group oflike i think there werefour of us phd students taking classesnot to let phds off the hook we knowthat it is plenty corrupted but we weretaking classes with the md medicalstudents like the physiology and thebiochemistry and stuff some of them andthen we had our ownother coursework i was amazed that if wephd students got anything less than a bwe were on academic probation and thenwe had to repeat the class and if we gotless than a b againthankfully never happened with me butthen you get kicked out of the programso our phd program went from four tothree within the first year i knewmultiple mde students who they theydon't have to just get they could get acand they can take that again as manytimes as they need i knew a guy who'shis graduation from his medical degreewas delayed about a year and a half orso because he kept failing a class andyet it's just once you're in the systemtheydo they move heaven and earth all themore now i mean standards just keepgetting lower and lower as we have allthese outcomes that are based more onensuring you knowwell i i need to be careful ensuringjust you knowthat everyone can have a chance andeveryone gets a degree they're justhanding them out and so there's noquestion that the quality is gettingless and less but alsotragically as the quality is decliningit seems like there's a growingresistance to acknowledging when youdon't know something it is the greattragedy of all terminal degrees a phd inan md are obvious examples the more wehave earned letters after our name themore we refuse to acknowledge someonecould know something that we don't knowand that to me it's the death of scienceit is it truly isin in science is just a mature i meantrue science which is the pursuit oftruth that my phd mentor who was awonderful gentleman just a wonderful manhe would always say ben we're seekingtruth we're seeking truth and we thatmeans you have to be prepared to dumpall of your theoriesthe moment you see data that conflictedthat challenges it should make youchallenge what you thought you knew andand readdress it reassessbut no no now like i said at the outsetof the conversation everyone they havelawn signs and they say we believe inscience and all it is is the declarationof faith at that point it is no longer arigorous objective analysis of what wethink we know and and this is al covidwas the death of yeah i mean it was itwas the outside nail yep yepyeah no i i definitely agree with that ithink thethe the really astonishing uhbait and switch here is that you knowthe whole supposed marketing material ofscience was built on the idea that youknow no more priests no more authorityno more uh listen to what the priestssay no you need to read for yourselfeverybodyuses the scientific method you thinkscientifically and it's a it's a i meanit's really just an explicit statementof what all humans do at all times youknow what when you wake up in themorning let's say your bed has a wall onone side and it doesn't have a wall onthe other side you know it's thescientific method one day you wake upyou hit the wall and then you'veexperimented and then for the rest ofyour life you're to wake up on the rightside of the bed that's science that'swhat the scientific method is you knowyou you have a hypothesis that i couldwake up on the left side you test it outyou smash your head in the walland then youyou figure out the conclusion that youshould try the other side sothinking scientifically is what humansnaturally do when they try andunderstand how things work and thescientific process is a great way ofthinking about itformulating it to make it systematic sothat it's not just you know going by ahunch so you formulate a hypothesis youtest it and you you write it down ithelps you structure your thinking in amuch better waybut with that we've successfully beenconned intoall right we're doing experimentsbutactuallywhat we're going to be doing is thatuh you're not doing experiments you'rejust going to trust priests who claim todo experiments but these are better thanthe other priests the two you trustedbecause the other priests told you youknow they spoke to godthese guys don't speak to god they speakto an experiment so you can feel okaytrusting them but really um it's thesame thing it is a religion like at thispoint we just have priests and we trustthem and we excommunicate people whodon't believe it else said well in facti used to take great pride in being whatis commonly called a hard scientist thehard sciences were these areas ofscience where you could literallyconduct an experiment run the analysisand see was this a significant findingor was it not did something happen thatwe predicted or did it not i would takegreat pride that i was not a softscience guy you know where where you addthe word science in your degree and ithelps you believe it's political sciencesocial sciences run a bunch ofobservationary data yeah there's nothingthere's nothing science i mean it's it'salmost a rule where if if uh if a degreehas the word science in it it's probablynot a science you know like i'm i'm i amin cell biology that's my department wedon't say i mean my other colleagues arein molecular biology you know we don'tsay molecular biology science but it'ssocial science political science and i iwould take such pride that i could knowsomething i could say this is truthwhat we saw this happened i treated thecells with this with insulin and this isliterally what happened so now i canstate it with an absolute authoritybecause it is truth it is reality andunlike the social sciences the softersciences which i don't mean to totallydisparage but they could not make thosesame claimsthey could not do it but now even in thehard sciences you have people makingclaims that are not justifiedi've never beenmore ashamedof ofof of my credential than i have been thelast few years where it has been youhave people making the mostunscientific ridiculous statementsacross a whole spectrum of social issuesright now it's not just disease but itis you know human development um for imean all these things are beingcriticized in a way that i i look atwith such wonderand and i'm left thinkingi'm in a clown world now um but but youknow what the only one no no i know butit's it's funny for me to say thisbecause ihappen to be a professor at a privatereligious university and what's amazingto me is to see that it's these privatereligious universities that still allowthe teaching of traditional kind ofliberal education by that i don't meanbut when i say liberal i mean like aclassic liberal education which trainsyou in the arts and the sciences and theletters and i canknow that my institution will defend mewhen i makestatements about reality and truth inscience and i don't teach anythingreligious whatsoever but it's thesestate sponsored schools who are sodependent on money from the nationalinstitutes of health or from the stateor federal agencies unlike myinstitution where they have to say whatthe party they have to follow the partyline they lit i mean that to your pointabout fiat science being based on fiatmoney that is literally the case withtraditional state schoolsand it's only universities that aren'tdependent like my university for examplewhen you when the federal government washanding out covert relief fundsmy university was one of we literallydeclined the money it was offered thesetens of millions of dollars and myuniversity said no we aren't going totake it because we know the moment youstart doing that things it comes withobligations and demandsand so it's a it's a weird thingto to say that it's these privategenerally religious universities andthey're very very few of them thatactually teachthe reality the binary nature of justscience something is real or it isn'tnow that's not to say there's nosilliness college campuses unfortunatelyit's their very nature nowadays to havesomesomewhat crazy ideology in somedisciplinesbutuh it would be it would be increasinglydifficult for me to be in academia if ifelt like i had to statethe you know something that i i believedto be utterly falseyeah i mean umbetter get some bitcoin because i thinkthe uh i know i know i i think theinquisitors are coming and you're goingto be have to you're going to have toyou know recant on all of your heresiesyou're going to have to cancel the beexcommunicated exactlydenounce your previous work and say thatinsulin is not a problem anymore oh iknow i know well but the nice thing forme i've never gotten an nih grant andthat's actually i'm not ashamed of thatthat's kind of a point of pridei have been able to fund my lab throughindividual donors that are sufficientlyenamored or convinced um have asufficient conviction of my va my viewof health and disease that i've not hadto becomei've not had to become an employee ofthe government uh and say what they wantme to saycongratulations that's i mean reallythis is uh for me uhth this is the goal and this was alwaysthe goal write and be readand have a have a method ofcommunicating with a readership withouthaving to be part of the state-runeducational system because ultimatelythe entire fieldsthey're all related to the academicjournals and i discussed this in detailin the fiat standard the way that thisacademic fiat ponzi works is all runthrough the academic journals thebasically the better way to understandis that the university system and theuniversity professors and the universityadministratorshave effectively been conned intouh becoming slave labor for the academicpublication industry there are a fewlarge publishers that controlumthousands literally thousands uponthousands of academic journals and99.999 of everything written in allthose academic journals is unreadablegarbage nobody ever reads it none ofthese papers are read by anybody even ifyou have access to it yeah even if youhad access to it nobody would read it umi mean the only people who read it arepeople who read it because they want torespond to it or build upon it so thatthey can get into the same journals andget promoted but nobody outside of thejournal circle jerk uh feeds these uhpapersno in fact i i joke it's incestuous isay that all the time you go toconventional meetings i go give a talkat a conventionalscience meeting it's the same handful ofscientists listening to the same handfulof scientists everyone's citing eachother's work you know and that's why atthe very beginning of our conversation inoted that i i began more and more torail against this system where i'dpublish a paper like this paper aboutthe post-mortem biopsies we did onstudying the hippocampus from humans imean this was relevant cool stuff and wepaid five thousand dollars to get itpublished in a journal that no one willread except a handful of people andconventional academia would say all thatmatters i mean like at the end of everyyear you get reviewed in part based onhow many people cited your publishedwork that's part of the game of academiaand yet i looked at thislike about six years ago this was thebeginning of me saying i need to one getinvolved in social media and two i needto write a book because i thought if therest of my career is publishing papersthat 20 other scientists read and itnever actually impacts a human's lifethen i will have ended my careereither i was delusional thinking i madea difference or i will acknowledge andbe humbled by the fact that i never madea lick of difference in every discoveryi made as cool as i might have thoughtit waswas totally irrelevant in the real worldand that to mewas was intolerable the idea of justsitting in the ivory tower of academiaspouting ideas and then wondering ifthey had ever influenced someone i saidno i have to circumvent that wholesystem yes i have to play that game i doi i play it but i also know that i'mplaying the game and then i go right tothe people i directly share publicationsthat are relevant to human healththrough social media and it's neverpictures of me doing anything silly it'sliterally just i'm teaching a littlelesson right now about how testosteroneaffects fat cell function you know forexample or i'm writing a book that isdirectly me going around i mean safe ifyou had had to convey all of your ideasin in the two books that i've read ofyours bitcoin standard and fiat standardif you had to only rely on those ideasbeing conveyed in a classroomyou'd you'd never or your own papersbeing published no good luck a fractionof the number of people would know it sothose of us who know ideas and that'snot relegated to those with phds not atallbut those who have valuable ideas itbehooves us to test those ideas in anopen market are these ideas as valid asi think they are and then how can i helpconvey them if they are and the marketwill tell you if they're valuable or notexactly which is what i really loveabout twitter twitter in particular ithink is the most uhis the most vigorous intellectual andscientific debate that you find may italways stay that way may it stay thatway oh obviously you know of course ithas all of its problems with censorshipand so on but yet even in spite of allof that i think it still manages to bethe most effective platform because uhit's extremely powerful as a way ofcommunication where you need to getthings down to 280 characters so thatmeans you can't waffle around and youcan't waste people's time people justimmediately tune you out get straight tothe point so you know you can link topapers you can link to articles you caninclude the video and audio but you needto get to the punch in 280 points whichforces the brain to focus and for andallows you to really expose things andthen that's where academics really thethe tricks you know academics don't likebrevity academics don't like brevitythey like to be superfluous ineverything they describe exactly becausea lot of it is just honestlyperformative art i mean i've been tothose conferences and i know that a lotof it is just you need to sit there andtalk about your paper nobody's read yourpaper nobody wants to read your paperbut they have to attend the conferenceyou have to speak at the conference andso it's just performance you stand thereand you know you feign being wise andyou talk slowly and then you finish yourtime and then you get on with your lifeand like nobody learns anything and mostof it is just really performativeum but yeah that's uhsocial media on the other hand is realworld that people are going to listen toyour ideas they're going to try them andthey're going to come back and tell youhey i tried to do what you said and lookit's worked and here are the picturesandthat that's the validation that you needi remember you know it was it was it wassomething very similar that i feltduring my grad school when i uhstopped believing in the stuff that theyteach us in the grad school and i justdeveloped this alternative perspectivethe biggest horror that i had was thisidea that hang on so we are just writingall of this garbage to continue toumkeep our jobs in this kind of system andthe only purpose of writing this is sothat we develop the expertise so we canget on tv and newspapers and universityclassroom and gas light people intotelling them hey um yep you knowinflation is actually good for you andprices aren't really rising and uh weneed more inflation and the way that wesolve the problems of inflation is withmore inflation that was basically it andjustrealizing that you're sitting there andyou're writing something that nobody'sgoing to be reading it's it it gave methat image ofthat and i mentioned this in the fieldas well there's that movie the stanleykubrick movie the shining where uh theauthor and his wife they go into aresort to an isolated hotel in middle ofnowhere and they spend months writingand then his wife looks at all thehundreds of pages that he wrote andthey're all just the same sentence allover again and this is what it feelslike when you're in academia it's likewould it even matter if i just filledthis with the same sentence over andover the same exact sentences in thatmoviewould anybody even notice i mean yeahthe seven people in the journals and theseven people who read the journal mightuh notice but like if you them and i weall agree on doing this as a pranknobody would notice it couldwell stay in the in the gym in factthat's been done right but there wasthis i can't remember his name there wasthis physical socal alan he had suchdisdainin fact did you cite this in your bookyes alan yeah oh yeah yeah so i but i'veheard it other times where you have thephysicist who writes a report about likehe just made up like one of them i thinkhe might have been the guy who talkedabout how dogsum having sex was a good example of likeuh you know male domination or orwhatever and it would but that was oneof the things he'd made up but justutter nonsense and getting it publishedin these soft sciencejournals you know the peer reviewprocess was just a jokeyeah and like i think um you knowusually it used to be thata natural scientist would laugh atsocial scientists but i think you knowthese are the same universities thatpublish the same thing so oh no i know iknow yeah that's natural i used tothat's right yeah i don't anymore my mysmugness of being a hard naturalscientist is is gone now because we'vewe've also now started compromisingtruth to fit a narrative unfortunatelyyeah and i think you knowas you said the the recent uhrespiratory illness uh shenanigans werereally i mean the way that the allentire world scientific community wentfrom having never heard about socialdistancingand uh to just say yeah well this isobviously what we need to do becausethat's the only option what are youcrazy yeah well and to totally overlookwhat we we knew very very early on notto maybe maybe i need to be very carefulbut but very briefly we knew very earlyon that the most significant singleliterally the single most relevant riskfactor in determining whether this wouldbe serious infection or a very mildinfection was the amount of fat a personhad on their body and that's not just acoincidenceany inhaled or or virus that gets intothe system it comes in as a viralparticle and it needs to hijack a cellit needs to get into a cell infect acell for that cell to start producingmore of those viral particles to go andinfect others with this particular virusinfects fat cells more than any othercell well they're a couple a littlehigher but fat cells are among the mostreadily infected cell with thisparticular viral particle and so andthen the fat cell becomes an unwittingfactory producing more and more and moreof it because it had on the surface ofthe fat cell these other proteins thatallow the viral particle to get intothat cell much more readily so literallyif you had a fat cell in a muscle cellside by side and each were exposed tothis viral particle it's going to have avery hard time getting into the musclecell because it doesn't have the rightreceptors for that virus to kind oftrick fat cells are very welcoming hostsand so a person who has more fat tissuejust had more likely infection sites toprevent this isn't meant to be anincriminating point about anyone who'soverweight noindeed i truly am not but for us topretendthat that wasn't a relevant variable infact arguably the most relevant variablewas it did no one any serviceno it's absolutely insane i think it'sthe most absurd moment of the entire twoyears was when um and i'm from albertai'm from alberta which means i have agreat distain for any of the easternprovincesyeah i could understand and this thisguy you know he'd locked down ottawa hadsomeone i mean ontario had some of themost strict uhlockdowns in the world for a very longtime and they destroyed small businessesdoug ford got on tv and taughthis citizens how to make cheesecake hismom's or his grandmarecipe for cheesecake which is he madedoug ford you know the the enormous unitwhich he is today so you can imagine howmuchsugar it has in it and uh he went andcooked it you know he was wearing agiant t-shirt uh that said we're all inthis together and he was teaching peoplehow to cook cheesecake while he lockedthem at home and prevented them fromopening their businesses it's absolutelyamazing how nobody said anything aboutyou know it was it was for methat was for me seeing everything thathappened over the last few yearswas was a kind of final nail in thecoffin now of coursemy field itself studying the the originsof metabolic disease had made me alreadysomewhat cynical um of of traditionalviews you know like uh i've mentionedbefore that the fat cell is at the heartof metabolic problems that's whereinsulin resistance startsum and and yettraditional view would be well then justsimply lower calories and that's allthere is to it yes calories matter butthe prevailing paradigm with obesity isthis caloric paradigm totally ignores ortotally refutes the fact that insulincould have anything to do with it andyet insulin is essential to determiningfat storage as well the whole debaclethe last three years settled it for mebut anyway here he is here he isyeah look i mean look at that oh my goshyeah and so he he ought to be he oughtto have been worried about thisrespiratory illness because he has themost significant risk factorwell look at him there's he's had therecipe memorizes he was 10 year olds imean this isoh my gosh this is some seriousdedication yeah it is it is uhthere's the cream so that so what he'smixing here the mix of sugar and fat isis a is a dane is a particularlydangerous one there's the cream a littlemore yeah sugar a little more fat andsugar and in nature it's important tonote in nature carbohydrate and fatdon't come together that doesn't happenin in foods that we eat in nature it'seither pure carbohydrate in the form offruit and vegetable generally or it'sprotein and fatbut he's he's mixing oh gosh what aclownyeah he got re-elected as welloh i'm not surprised i'm not surprisedthey re-elected trudeau it's it's myit's so it's so shamefulum to see what's happened and i i lovedgrowing up in canada i loved mychildhood in this little kind of farmtownin albertaand and but but i my dad raised us allto be um very kind of free marketcapitalist and he would always railagainstthe federal the lack of a kind offederalist systemum now i'm not saying the u.s is perfectit's democracy it's federalist system isis built and only can succeed on a moralpeople as the founding fathers noted andthe loss of kind of morality in the usputs it into a difficult spot in factsafe i've heard you defend a monarchybeforeand and which which i i can be verysympathetic to um i think if you knewif a population could know that it wouldalways have a just kingslam dunkbut but you know the usperspective was we can't trust thatwe'll always have a good king we'lltrust the morality of the people but nowif you have if you don't have a moralpeoplethen it does it doesn't work yeah no ithink the the argument is not that youknow if we can get uh just king everysingle time i think the argument isthat thisyou hit the nail right on the head thatyou you need to just people for ademocracy to work so you need thesociety to be 51 percentjust moral and low time preference ithink this is the really key thing youneed a society to be predominantlythinking about the future thinking yeschildren because otherwise they willsacrifice the future for the sake ofthis that's something you've articulatedvery well before i i love you yeah andand and the difficult thing is that ifit's if it's uh a democracy then it'sthe hand it's uh hopper describes it aswe stand altogether where everybody'shand is in everybody's pocket andeverybody is robbing from everybody elseand when you have that system youincentivize people to think short termand so it's very difficult to you knowwin the lottery then and have 51 percentof the populationuhmanage to do it but with a king you justneed one guyto teach their sonthis is what we do we keep thinking ofthe long term and we don't sacrifice thelong term for the present and so then ifyou just have one familywhere you have one father who just needsto teach this to their son and then theymanage to keep it going for a fewgenerationsyou're arguably better off sticking tothem than you are i agree i agreebecause then their their moral viewwould befor lack of a better word imposedin the population it would be better i itotally agree with that i think it's notso much that they would be able toimpose their moral view i think it'sjust that uh without a high timepreferenceperson in charge of government peoplejust naturally do what's best for themand they naturally develop a long-termperspective because what you need todestroy that is an actively destructivegovernment that takes away your propertytakes away that your freedom takes awayyour security then people becomeum essentially animals fighting againsteach other because they don't see acommon future because theythey think the future is compromisedso this this would be it but i wanted toget back to alzheimer's you'd mentionedthis this is of course very interestingi have uh my grandfather unfortunatelywho suffers from this illness and ofcourse as i mentioned it's one of thoseexamples where constantly trying to getthem to change their diet and the doctorjustsays it's not and everybody in thefamily just laughs when i mention itbut it's uh you know recently new uhresearch on alzheimer's has shown usthat uh yeah apparently uh fiat sciencehas been uh uh naughty and up to it'susual in factis the it is the most perfect example ofof fiat science in science at its workscience at its worst or agenda at itsbestwhere the prevailing theory ofalzheimer's disease has been that it isit is a disease of plaques forming inthe brain and these little things calledamyloid beta peptides or what we callplaques are accumulate in thehippocampus and literally disrupt neuronto neuron connection resulting in thecognitive decline that so typifiesalzheimer's disease butthe challenge why my lab challenged thatamong other labs i'm not alone in thisis that there would be drug after drugwould come out that would be shown toreduce the presence of amyloid betapeptides or plaques in the brain and yetthere would be nono subsequent improvement in cognitionin fact this just happened last yearwhere the fda against the the request ofthe special panel that was put togetherto review this anti-alzheimer's drug itwas an anti-plaque drug so there wasthis special panel put together toreview it they directed the fda todecline fda approval of this drugbecause the efficacy was nil there wasnothing to it but the fda approved itanyway and their justification for itwas that they didn't want to discouragefurther drug development in thealzheimer's realm so they explicitlyapproved a drug they knew had no benefitand so doctors would start prescribingthis to patients even though there wasno known benefit butall of this is just the the the cherryon top of the sickfoundation which was that the very ideathat alzheimer's was a plaque-baseddisease was built on faulty data andthat's what you're referring to it'smade the headlines i wouldn't besurprised if many people have seen thisalreadybut this initial scientific findingspublished in these glamorous journals ofcourseit was that when they would block theformation of the plaques in these animalmodels then the alzheimer's would goaway when the plaques were there thedementia the cognitive decline in therodents would follow and yet it was allfabricatedthey had made up these data and that'spart of this perverse incentive that sotypifies this artificial realm of fiatscience where they want they need topublish and they need to keep gettingfundingand so you you're willing to compromiseand and now we know that that ideas hasbeen tossed to the wayside it simplydoesn't havemoreover additional data in postmortemhuman samples found that there you woulddetect and find plaques in people'sbrain who who died with no evidence ofcognitive decline they were perfectlyhealthy as sharp and witty as they everwere and yet their brains had moreplaques hammers and died with like myown grandma did and and they would haveno plaxen or very very little plaques inthe brain so we've known for years thatthere's something wrong with thisparadigm and yet it continued to bepropped upand those of us who've been beating thedrum and again i'm not alone saying thatthis is not a plaque disease it is ametabolic disease with significant datato to um support this never having beenrefuted yet that i'm aware of but nopaper has it found contrary evidencefinding that it is not a disease ofmetabolism of the brain in the brainit's not been refuted yet and so thisshould be the theory that should havebeen continued to be propped up in orderfor it to continually be criticized ishould add it's not that it makes itbulletproof that bigger a theory getsthe moreit should be able to be topped uptoppled overthen every brick that's being thrownover thrown at it if it's not knockingit down well then it strengthens itappropriatelyit's a stronger theory now if the brickwe're throwing doesn't knock the towerdown it is become incorporated into thestructure and it's stronger there havebeen that little tower of theplaque-based theory of alzheimer's hasbeen knocked over so many times it justit fit the narrative that they wantedwhoever they were if it was easier todevelop drugsthat would address plaques than it hasbeen to just tell people help your brainbecome more insulin sensitive and giveit some ketones from time to time andvery likely your brain is going to bejust fine you don't need to invoke someenormous conspiracy of people whoconsciously came up with those thingsand deliberately lied about it like ifyoui'm sure as you know the way that thesethings work it's just you know if youand i both get our phd and get similarjobs and similar research centersstudying this kind of issueif i come at it from the perspective ofwell i thinkthere's this obscured little chemical inthe brain that causes alzheimer we needto spend 18 million dollars to study howthis thingumgrows and that's what causes alzheimer'sand we tend to figure out how to get adrug that inhibits this mechanism sotherefore will fix that issue this is ahighly promising line of researchbecause of the way that the drugpatent systemworks which is essentially a form ofgovernment monopoly it makes a lot ofsense to just find some symptom anywhereand find some chemical that can be shownin a trial to reduce those symptoms andit's just this is what modern medicinebecomes because you set up theincentives in a certain way where youhave to demonstrate to one monopolygovernment agencyone mechanism that they choose you knowyou set that as you set these as thegoal posts and so then you have billionsof dollars of pharmaceutical companiesout there shooting for those goal postshiring people specifically to shoot forthose goal posts you know we need toconduct the trial to find the diseaseand find the symptoms and then find thechemical that we can patent and makesure that it's artificial it has to beartificial because if it's notartificial you can't patent it yes ithas to be an artificial chemical thatcan cause some significant effect onthat symptomso because if we do that and we spendabout a billion dollars in 10 yearsputting it through trials and then weget the approval then that's a moneyprinting ticket forever because then alldoctors are required to prescribe it asa standard of care for this conditionand that's just going to mean endlessyachts and vacation homes for everybodyinvolved with our pharmaceutical companysoinstead of having a free market systemwhere ideas and drugs are tested by freeagencies thatpublish their findings you have atop-down system where the governmentjust dictates all right this is thestandard of care everybody needs to takeit everybody needs to follow itand you know as a doctor you could loseyour license if youdon't follow those things on the one andi'm proposing this kind of theory thatwould fit into this pattern that couldlead to that drug eventually which couldmake billions you on the other handyou've come up with the conclusion thathey maybe i i have this novel theorythat if we get people to start eatinglessgarbage we could improve theiralzheimer'sall right well you know you could make agood instagram health influencer accountout of that you couldrun a small business that holds peopleaccountable and helps them and makesmeal planning there are a few smallbusinesses on thatnothing like the drugs that you could uhrun if you you know with my theory youknow my theory that says it's a bunch ofcamera it's a chemical imbalance in thebrain and we just need that yeah andthat's exactly what they did withpsychiatry that other big scam which uhwhich also incidentally is massivelyaffected by insulin resistance but alsonobody mentions it because again it'smuch more profitable no it's a chemicalthing in your brain and we just add alittle pill and yeah and that was allrefuted recently too i mean you'reperfect to point that one out where forso long we'd said it's a serotoninimbalance and then we now this big metaanalysis comes out and says oh wellactually it's not at all and that'snever been supported in the science andit challenges i mean the most commonpsychiatric medication for these sortsof things is these serotonin regulatingdrugs that do nothing to benefit thepersonthat's very true and and and of coursethe mechanism i discussed in the fiatstandard because of the way thatfinancing works is look mistakes happeneverywhere but fiat money and fiatfinancing of sciencemakes it so that mistakes can never getcorrected because once you identify thiskind of mechanism all right it's theit's the chemical imbalance of the brainor it's the platelets that cause thealzheimer's or it'sa saturated fat that is causing theheart disease once you've set themechanism so thatgetting government funding depends onformulating your hypothesisto be congruent with that starting pointonce that becomes theeverybody knows in the field once thatbecomes the thing that everybodymentions in the first page of thatscientific paper as a sort of startingfoundation then that's it then that'snever questioned never testednever researched and just it is the lensthrough which it's all viewed exactlyand then there'sthe only way that you can get called thescientist is if you use that lens if youdon't use that lens you're a crank yepyep you're a hair tick that's right yeahand i've i've been accused of thatmyself for challenging conventionalviews and obesity and diseaseum it it just sort of it's it becomestoo threatening unfortunately yeahyeah and i think uh you know to go bringeverything back to the bitcoin and thispodcast is one big giant advertisementfor why bitcoin fixes everythingis i think again all of it is because ofthe fact that without a free market badideas don't die they just continue toget money printing you need to wait forthe money printer to die for that to getfixed but bitcoin is our way out bitcoinis a way for people tofind fund research that they want as faras a way for scientists to becomefinancially independent so that theydon't know always need all these newextra research grants because theirmoney is constantly inflating i thinkyou know the future michael saylor talksabout this people willendow uh foundations with bitcoin andthen that will be a much more effectiveway to continue to do their researchindependent of the fiat uh monster wellthat has to happen yeah you know it atsome point for for science to continueto thrive in what has been such abedrock of the united states having somany advantages it was the system thatthat encouraged and rewarded academicfree thinking in these efforts to toexperiment and find the best ideas letthe best ideas rise to the top the morewe prop up the worst ideasbecause we have money that's allowing itto be propped up we don't allow them toget filteredit's it's it'suh i mean it's the death of of sciencewhich is which is a very sobering notnotthat sounds almost self-aggrandizingwhere where umthat's it's scientists you know it'sthese philosopher kings and it should bethese deep thinkers who are the leadersnono but but the more we refuse to allowtruth and realityand even it even in the reality ofletting the marketshow what ideas have valueum then the more we're artificiallypropping up bad ideas that lead just toour detriment and destructionabsolutely and one thing i also wantedto ask you about is statins what areyour thoughts on stuff oh my gosh so infact i would encourage what a wonderfulquestioni literally just published a paper withtwo other scientistsum on this topic of the efficacy ofstatins in in with for its traditionaluseum and anyone could just go to um i hateto promote pubmed or google scholar butif you just type in bikman and look forany papers published in 2022 you'll findit i think we paid the extra fee to makeit open access which is something ialways do but it's like six thousandbucks seven thousand bucks for my lab topublish a paper so it's not behind a paywall that's how convinced i am thatthese ideas need to have free access umthat people need to get them anywayi think statins are probably the mostoverprescribed drug and my justificationso everyone knows statins are the mostcommon um drug used for heart diseaseand we base thatits use entirely on someone's ldlcholesterol levels that a physician willsay a clinician will say okay patientyour ldl levels are too high you need togo on a statin to reduce your ldl levelsand while statins are effective atlowering ldlthey are tremendously ineffective atlowering the risk of heart diseaseespecially if a person i mean there'sdifferent scenarios but if a person hasnever had a heart attack but they have ahigh ldlin their prescribed statinit it shows no benefit at preventingthat heart attack if someone has had aheart attack and they're given a statinit appears to be that there's a slightreduction in risk but only in somepeople you have to give a statin to like20 people in order for one to get abenefitso this is my view on statins based onall of the best data that i've seenldl cholesterol doesn't matter at allit's a totally useless marker of heartdisease indeed ldl cholesterol is is apredictor of longevity if you want tolive long we have the baltimorelongitudinal study the honolulu agingstudy the shanghai aging studymultiple studies across the world havefound that the longest lived peoplewho have the lowest risk of dementia thelowest risk of cancer have the highestldl levelsi mean what a bloodyparadox we've we've created by wagingwar on ldl ldl is such an essentialmolecule of life it's relevant forhormone production moving cholesterolaround it's relevant for immunity itliterally can bind pathogens and removethem from the body through the liver tobe cleansed from the blood and so that'swhythe more we wage war on ldl the sickeroverall a person's going to getbutwhat i would say if anyone listening iscurious about stanton's and of coursei'm not giving any medical advice per sejust insightdon't rely on your ldl level you go andpay 70 bucks or whatever and get what'scalled a coronary artery calcium scan acac scan you lay under a little ctscanner it zips around you and itactually measures the calcification inyour carotid arteries on your hearti have to say this because the evidenceis so convincing if someone has a cacscore of i think above 1 000 i think itwas or something like that then itshowed a mortality difference in intaking a statin regardless of ldl ldllevels had nothing to do with it high orlow it didn't matter but if someone hadreally high ldl but they had a cac scorein the low hundredsum i think it was the stat had nobenefit whatsoever and because statinshave such significant consequences likelowering sex hormone production loweringvitamin d damaging the mitochondriamaking your muscles ache and these arereal consequences that people need tobalance every drug has a consequenceit's just is the consequence you wantworth the consequences you don't wantthat's something we always have to askourselves as we put these unnaturalchemicals in our bodybut if someone has a high cac scorethen it appears that there could be alongevity a mortality benefit to astatin but if your ldl is through theroof but your cac score is zero i wouldi wouldn't touch ityeahi i think the statins were the mostprofitable drug in the history of thepharmaceutical industry they may havebeen overtaken recently by anunmentionable which i will not mentionbecause idon't want to get cancelled from uh onsocial media but uhit has been enormously profitable to umenormous focus and focus the on this onelittle metric and take a pill for itrather thanthe very blatantly obvious alternativehypothesis which is that it is theinsulin that you should oh and i shouldi should just add though lest it soundlike i'm giving a tacit umgreat pass to statins they're also thereare so many different types of statinsthat people's genetics will metabolizethe statins differently so even if thiswere me giving advice to my dad for aloved one i would say don't do anythinguntil you've gotten a cac score okaylet's say he had a very very high cacscore lots of calcificationin the carotid arteries then next thingi would do is say get what's called apharmacogenomics test these aretypically 200 bucks or so someinsurances actually pay for it here inthe usbut it is our genes will dictate how werespond to medications and it's verypossible that the person gets on astatin that theymetabolize too rapidly and it doesn't doanything or it has some adverse effectthe third leading cause of death in theunited states is adverse drug events forgoodness sakesthat is the third leading cause of deathit's heart disease cancer and adversedrug events and part of this is becauseyou're prescribed a drug that doesn'tget metabolized well in your body peoplenaturally have different genes that areinvolved in the processes of clearingmolecules particularly in the liverthat's where most drugs get metabolizedand eliminated from the body oncethey've kind of lived their life butsome people either metabolize them tooquickly so it doesn't do any good orthey metabolize them too slowly and thechemicals sticking around muchlonger than it should so there are a lotof caveats when it comes to statins areyou should you be using it based on thevery limited data available at all andthen secondyou need to make sure you metabolize itwell but safe to your point even ifsomeone has known calcification in theirarteries there was a cardiologist by thename of bill william davis he publisheda book on thisand he quantified reversingcalcification in the carotid arteriesstrictly through diet in his patients sotypically they will say once once anatheros once a plaque in the bloodvessel has calcified then it's like astone and it's not going anywhere thatis the prevailing idea to this day wellthis cardiologist bill davis he'spublished reports finding quantifyingthe reduction in calcification inpatients strictly through adopting thedietary changes that we've been talkingabout yeahall right um daniel's got a question foryoudanielle yeah hey guys uh hey benjaminnice to meet you uh brilliant brotherbrilliant thank you yeah it's just beenum really really interestingi gotta represent the bitcoin plebs andask you a bit of uhyou probably see the bro science thatgets thrownaround in the bitcoin uh twitter realmso but well first of all uhit's brilliant that your lab isself-funded do you accept bitcoin so ifanybody listening to safe's pod can sendyou some donationsthat is so i appreciate that so muchum one of the tragedies of being at aprivate institution is i i can't acceptdirect donations everything i do comesthrough the university on what's calleda sponsored research agreementum but you guys i've gotten enoughrequests for this kind of thing that i'mthinking about creating a non-profitumi just don't know how to do that likesomething that could accept donation andthen just pay for the equipment and payfor the students that are doing my workso at the moment i hate to say this butno i don'twell someone listening will have ananswer for you i'm sure someone willhonest to goodness i would i wouldwelcome it enormously because it hasgotten a littlechallenging in that regardthe the bro science questions uh there'sa lot of um chat on bitcoin twitterabout see the oils oh yeah yeah yeahwell no i'm glad you're bringing that upbecause that that was something wedidn't get around to so i my my theoryon what is the worst thing how our diethas changed is that it is now consistsof fake carbohydrates or processed carbsand processed oilsand the processed carbohydrates safe andi've i think really beat that to deathreally well which is this is what'sspiking your insulin and chronicallyelevated insulin drives a resistance toinsulin but on the other hand theprocessed oils like seed oils um theyare also problematic um particularly atthe fat cell and that's relevant becausethat's where i believe insulinresistance begins it is the first dominoto fall if you will and when when theprimary fat the primary fatty acid inseed oils is a fat called linoleic acidand anyone who's been diving into theseed oils already knows that fatlinoleic acid is problematic because asit accumulates in the fat cellit can become it gets metabolizedthrough a process called peroxidationinto a molecule called 4 hne that's ofcourse the abbreviated form of a muchlonger name but for h e as itaccumulates in fat cells it forces fatcells to grow through a process calledhypertrophywhere the fat cell itself is being is isbeing expanded and getting fatter andfatter and fatter that is not how allpeople get fatsome people can get fat through aprocess called hyperplasia and this wassomething peter and i just were chattingvery briefly about when safe went tohelp with this baby um at the verybeginning but if some if a person'sphysiology allows their fat tissue togrow through hyperplasia which is whenthe fat cells stay small but we multiplythemthat is the person who paradoxically canget fat but stay metabolically healthytheir blood pressure is okay they don'thave infertility they don't have insulinthey don't have diabetes their glucoselevels are normal that is the vastminority of peoplemost people get fat through hypertrophywhere the fat cell gets reallyfat if you will and it becomes insulinresistantto try to prevent further growth and itbecomes pro-inflammatory literallycreating molecules that turn oninflammation throughout the body all inan effort to try to increase blood flowthrough all these swollen fat cellsanyway to answer the question and bringit full circle that's what seed oilscontribute to among other things seedoils do morebut what i focus on as a metabolicscientist is what they do to the fatcell and seed oils will forcehypertrophy of the fat cell whichbecomes a very insulin resistantpro-inflammatory fat cell which startshaving that firstdomino tip into the other and promotingthe insulin resistance throughout thebody so while we didn't beat that topicto death i'm thrilled you brought it upbecause there's no question it'srelevant so i consider seed oils to be asecondary cause of insulin resistancebecause directly they're not going to doit on the body they have an insulinresistant effect as it alters the growthof fat cells in a unique way in auniquely harmful wayright yeah do you think that do youthink there's merit to the idea thatyou look at traditional populations alot of them did eat carbohydrates nowobviously it was nowhere near as muchcarbohydrates as we eat nowand not as refined exactly that's rightwhat we eat right now but some peoplepoint to that as saying that the issueis not the carbohydrates the issue is iknow they do i know they do i justand but yeah but i i don't know how theycan say that because they're justthey're creating they're making up thescenario wherebecause as we just noted these same likethe kitavans they would eat a tuberousvegetable but it was roastedand you know or steamed or somethingthey're eating that whole thing andabsolutely their insulin would have comeup and come down the thing that peopledon't want to note in those samekitavans is that they're fasting insulinwas like two micro units per mil afantastically low insulin and my problemagain the reason i focus on the carbsnot to necessarily overlook the seedoils is that it's the refined starchesconsumed so frequently that result inthis never-ending insulin spike and soleading to a steady increase we knowthis in people that their fastinginsulin levels will get higher evenfasting insulin will get higher andhigher and higher the more they'reeating processed carbohydratesto the level that we are so the peoplewho are saying well these traditionalcultures ate tuberous vegetables andthey didn't have seed oils so it's notthe carbs that are the problem clearlyit's the seed oils i say well you'vecreated this false protection around thecarbohydrates when my idea is that itit's what's spiking the insulin too muchand if we were all just eating a boiledpotato once a daysimilar to the kitavans we would have noproblemso the seed oil advocatesi think in some instances have become ithink they've gone too far now theywould say well screw you ben you'reignoring the the seed oil data i'm notin fact i literally do experiments withlinoleic acid in my labi'm justjust thinking we have to make sure we'retalking about the whole story here andif someone only eliminated seed oils butthey continue to eatsugar all day long in the form of gummybears and things there'sthere's no question too much insulincauses insulin resistance that's beenwell documented i would say there's moreevidence there's this isn't i would ican't frame it that way there'sabsolutely more evidence over the pastdecades showing that elevated insulincauses insulin resistance then there isshowing that seed oils cause insulinresistanceso i have to i just can't ignore thatnow i'm not ignoring the data on seedoils and linoleic acid it is absolutelythere and so i give it i want to give itits proper dobut thosewho espouse that idea have gone i thinkthey've gone too farno i i agree with you i think uh youknow the the examples that are mentionedand sometimes they'll say well you knowirish people uh ate a lot of potatoesand during uhand they weren't overweight and i thinkof coursethere is some truth to that if you'renot getting fatuh if you're not getting uh if you'renot eating a lot of dietary fat thenyeah you can get away with morecarbohydrates but also the carbohydratesbefore the 20th century are just acompletely differentthey are completely different yeahthat's right and but but even still mymy main rule that first principle wascontrol carbohydrates don't get themfrom a bags or a bag or a box with abarcode and so whole fruits andvegetables they generally have such amodest insulin effect especiallyvegetablescompared to the tropical fruits likebananas pineapples mangoes but like yousaid safe we've changed those over thepast hundred years apples for examplearound the world apples used to be smalland bitter little thingsand we've bred them to become these bigsugar bombs and so even i mean this ishappening around the world so it becomesan easycritique of the kind of carbohydrateinsulin based view of insulin resistancei find it somewhatgalling just because these umnow we've just been criticizing sciencebut i literally create insulinresistance in cells in my lab across thehallway and and linoleic acid can can dothisbased on its effects on the fat cellum but but elevated insulin does as welland that happens through chronicconsumption of refined starchesyeah and i think in in the fiat standardi cite this book called brightlineeating by an author called susanthompson she does a very interestingcomparisonlooking at sugar and flour in particularshe says uh if you look at what hashappened with sugar and flour in the20th century thanks to industrializationit's very similar to what has happenedwith cocaine and heroinbasically opium andtheleaves are things that had existed amongthe human society for thousands of yearsand you know in peru andbolivia and many of those places it's acommon uh cultural thing thatis particularly if you have work so likea worker who wants to put in uh a wholeday of work and they want energyyou chew some coca leaves you get alittle bit of energy until you use it sothis is what it was and for hundreds andthousands of years this is what it waslike and then you get to the 20thcentury where you get to moderntechnology modern hydrocarbon energyallows us to process things so much moreefficiently and powerfully and cheaplyand then you start taking these cocaleaves you know essentially you wouldtake what it would take the averageworker maybe a week to chew throughand then you process it and you condenseit into a tiny little refined whitesubstance that people can snort veryquickly so you can consume and the sameis true with heroin and opiumumso you because of modern processingyou're able to get it in a highlyhighly palatable form you know you don'thave to spend time chewing in order toget to the uhthe essence of it you get the essencestraight awayand that's what makes it so enormouslyaddictive and destructive and she saysthat's exactly the same thing that hashappened with sugar and flour it used tobe extremely expensive and difficult toprocess sugar and flour and to be ableto consume them it's difficult to growplants that have sugar because they geteaten by um pests and other plants andeven if you do manage to grow them youknow you grow a little bit and thenthere'sthere's a limit to how much sugar youcan get you know you need to chewthrough a lot of apple and swallow a lotof indigestible matter in order to get atiny little bit of a sugar hitbut then the 20th century comes alongand now we've gotwhite sugar being sold for practicallynothing at a supermarket or we have pureapple juice you know where we've removedall the chewable stuff and now it's justpure fructose and and water it's i meanit's it's toxic i mean and i i be wedidn't talk about juice but as a parenti consider that to be one of the greattravesties of what parents areunwittingly doing to their childrenchildren should be drinking nothing butwhole milk and waterno no juice i mean fruit juice is is isa horrific just sugary it's like you'regiving them soda pop no absolutely it'sit's terrible and it's um and i see thisa lot in in like the health influencesor certain circlesobviously there's a lot i i think youknow you want to coloryou want to have a little bit ofskepticism about one kind offinancial interest that exists in thisindustry obviously nowhere near ascorrupt andbankrupt as the you know scientificestablishment butwithin the with you know within the umwithin the bro science circles it's notall the sunshine and rainbows it's notall perfect there is of course theslight bias whereinyou get to be more popular as aninfluencer if you tell people they canconsume more indulge in knowledgeit's human nature to want to be to wantvalidation in a destructive behavior yesand also you know if you tell peoplethat no you can have this sugar and youcan have that treat and you can havethat and you'll be fine obviously it'sgoing to sell better than the you knowthe the party pooper who's just going totell you no you shouldn't have any ofthat stuff and like i okay fine isympathize with peoplepeople are addicted everybody has theiraddictionsumbut like realisticallyyou see how this colors people'sanalysis so something like that like youeliminate seed oils and then carbs stopbeing a problem and so you see a lot ofthis kind ofumpeople who are you know just sugarjunkies and looking to justify theirsugar drinking saying oh just take outthe seed oils and then you can keepeating all the sugar that you wantnoit doesn't work that way no i meanwell i mean obviously you can i'm notyour mom you could do whatever you wantyeah right yeah but don't expect it toyield these great reward returns it's anand it's obviously much better thaneating garbage butrealistically it's not as good as justnot eating any of the sugar at all yepyeah all right peter has a couplequestions tooso if sorry sorry peter before you movegoingone more bro science question safe andit's entirely up to you you'll leavethis into your uh podcast i think i knowyou already know where i'm going whichisuh ben i heard you talk briefly abouttestosterone earlier in the showyeahthere's a big uh movement in uh thebitcoin space where uh the plebs like tosun their ballsuh what you'll takeare you seriousis this a euphemism are you mean likeactuallyyeah absolutely yeah there's evenspecial poses for it but you know mygosh this is a real thingand the the idea behind the bro scienceis that it stimulates uh you know the uhthe testosterone umin your body soi don't know if you've experimented thisin the lab but you knowyeah that'd be hard to get irb approvalfor[Laughter]yes so that's that's what bitcoinresearch is for let's fund it withbitcointhis is what an off site there's no irbin bitcoin if you get the coins you canspend them as you want oh that's how itused to be you guys that's how it usedto be i look at the work of whatscientists did in the field ofstarvation and feeding about 80 yearsago before the era of ayakus and irbsthat limit what you can do oh my goshthey were able to get away with so muchglorious work so anyway danieli i have never seen any paper publishedon this um now to to truly kind of thinkthrough the systemi i can't help but wonderhow that mechanic so i'm thinkingthrough the mechanism and maybe someonewould sayso cholesterol is honestly i i can't ican't fathom what the mechanism would bethe mechanism is that sunshine isobviously great for your skin i mean tryand hide from the sun for six monthsso so sunlightsometimes scientists can overcomplicatethings then well no no i knowbut but but let me just come backyeah so i mean sunlight does convertcholesterol into vitamin d so like i'mthinking what is the process wherebycholesterol which is the basis of allsex hormones all sex hormones come fromcholesterol which is why when you wagewar on cholesterol like through a statinlibido plummets in in men because you'redestroying their sex hormone productionbecause you're getting rid of thebuilding block so if sunlight convertscholesterol to vitamin di'm unaware of any effect where sunlightconverts cholesterol to sex hormones butso i i challenge that a little bit andi'm very familiar with that biochemicalpathway i teach lectures on this topicbut i also think evolutionarily if weneeded sunlight to have our testespromote more vitamin d they'd be on thetop of our head not literally notliterally tucked in the darkest spot onour body if we were walking around nakednow that sounds silly but i hope we canall kind of see that there's some wisdomto that if if if your point counterpointthen yeah if they didn't need sunshinethey would be inside your bodywell no that's temperature but that's agood counter but that's a temperaturephenomenon where sperm if it getsproduced at a higher body temperatureit's it's enact it's dead basically ithas to be a little cooler but but ithink that if if ifif our creation story were such that weneededsun exposure on our gonads on our testesto get enough vitamin d they would be onour back or on our shoulder theywouldn't be tucked in the darkest partof the body so i don't believe that itmakes any difference all right well justto finish up my question then if you domanage to get that funding i think thisis going to be the thing that peoplewant to fund you to look at you knowwhat though you guysif if there is any truth to this and andhonestly it would be very easy to makethese experiments i would say that willgive birth to a little device that has auv lampand you just simply tuck it between yourdrawersthey doyeah almost well no not portable deviceswell that no yeah exactlyregular tanning devicesyeah well that would be the way to do ityou just have a small little device andyou just crook it in your crotch andthen you're producing testosterone likegangbusters but but you guys in allsincerity are there reports of peoplewho have only done this independent ofany other therapy like they didn't golow carb and go carnivore which canincrease testosterone they didn't startworking out more which can also increasetestosteroneare you guys familiar is there anythingthat has removed all the confoundingvariables and said i literally didnothing butit put my sack in the sun and i hadhigher testosterone levels i believe ibelieve the uh respected bitcoin twitterscientific authority that is fartface2000 has conducted such an experimentand fart face 2000 is one of my uhreally paragons of truth and bitcoinokay you're not jokingi'm not joking i've met him i've met himbefore he's uh been to a couple of mydinners guys what have i got what have iwhat what have i gotten involved withwellandhe's a great guy he works in um i forgethis exact job he's he works inconstruction i think he's got us a areally successful job somewhere in newjersey like you're just a hard-workingvery smart guy who's just gotten intobitcoin at some point and he's likechallenging dogma yeah and he'll just ilike anything and follow it and do itand he and he was posting all of hisstuff he's like in his 50s i think andhe was you guys let me let me just saylamp and i think you get great resultswell i'll look them up um but you guysin all one very relevant variable hereas much as we fellas who want to bevirile and strong and tough focus ontestosterone the levels of testosteronein a man can vary widelyand it has no predictive power with hislean mass or his muscle mass what is amore predictive variable is that is theconcentration of testosterone receptorson muscle and bone so it's not just howmuch testosterone you have but how wellit's working where you want it to workand that is something that isvery affected by exercise you go out andexercise and you will increase androgenreceptor levels on muscleyou know almost immediately and it'llstay up so as much as wefocus on testosterone levels and theymatter to some degreea normal group of men will have levelsthat can vary almost by 10 timesand it will have nothing to do with howmuscled or you know ripped and viralthey are so i just that's kind of alittle bit of a counterum to this idea um but it's certainlycompellingyeah i mean this is i'll just add onesmall thing which is like myintuition is to just umfollow the fart faces of the worldrather than worry aboutthe mechanismbecause you know the way that scienceadvances is that people try things andthen they work and then they discoverthe mechanism so yeah yeah but but evenstill even still let's say he's exposinghimself to the suni can't help but sayum well he's just making more vitamin dand vitamin d is immune boosting it ismuscle it was bone mass yeah i guess soyou so you want to control you want to iwould just say there's a confoundingvariable here that that you just can'teliminatethat i think what you would want to dois get the same amount of sun exposurebut only difference being yeah you wouldcover that area between two groups ofpeople shouldn't be too difficult toorganize this voluntarily on twitterwell it sounds like there's a wholegroup of people who are lining up to bevolunteers i never would have imaginedi know i think we should do uhthe control group and uh yeahall right all right well peter's danielthat's awesome dude thanksi was happy to giveso my question was aboutthe reversibility of insulin resistanceso we've talked a lot about all thethings that can cause it in terms oflifestyle but if someone has alreadyentered say the pre-diabetes stageare they able to reverse throughlifestyle changes could they could theyreverse their insulin levels down to saythe levels that you're talking about inthe catalans or are they kind of beyondthe point ofa point of no return at some point yeahoh absolutely absolutely they can turnit around um in fact the reversal ofinsulin resistance by adopting this hasbeen well documentedin in india there are multiple casestudies published on this so i can speakto it with confidence umuh you have people who are so insulinresistant that they're on multiplemedicationslike like insulin taking insulin takingmetformin and other anti-diabetic drugsall you can do is start having themengage in fastingand low carb diet and within just weeksthey have to get off all of theirmedications because they've correctedthe problem so quicklyand so everyone who is either on theearliest stages where they just noticethey're a little chubby and they havehigh blood pressure or they're full ontype 2 diabetic which is like the mostobvious form of insulin resistance goingdown the roadthat can be turned around literally inweeks and and a person can start tolower their insulin in just the same daythat they decide i'm going to fast forthe next 24 hours and just drink waterand have maybe some saltto help my fast be a little easier theirinsulin levels will come down by byseveral um not orders but you know it'llgo half then third and then a quarter ofit it'll come down very very quickly andlike i said within just monthsweeks to months they're as insulinsensitive as a marathon runnerso yes very reversible it is the goodnews the gospel of metabolic research isthat if you use diet to cure the problemthen you've cured it but the food we eatis the culprit or the cure and when weacknowledge the relevance of food as thecause then we acknowledge that it alsocan be the cureokayso just one follow-up question then soin terms of the damage that insulinresistance doesif you're saying that it can be totallyreversed thenhow is the damage done is the damagedone cumulatively over time and thenwhen you get to a certain point you knowyou can't reverse the alzheimer's youcan't reverse the condition generatoryes that what a great questionunfortunately i can't give a universalanswer to that because it would betissue specificum let's take for example the musclewhen muscle becomes insulin resistantinsulin can't defend muscle protein aswell and you start to have a higher rateof what's called catabolism or just thebreakdown of the muscle protein whichincreases what's a situation calledsarcopenia a person who says musclesthat are getting wasted away that's partof insulin resistance you can correctthat the moment the muscle becomesinsulin sensitive then then muscleprotein gets defended and you'vecorrected the muscle wasting and thesame would go with the liver fatty liverdisease is the most common liver problemin in in the world and it uh is largelya result at least partly of chronicallyelevated insulin stimulating fatproduction in the liver well you startto lower the insulin and the fat startsto clear itself out so those are totallyreversiblethe brain appears to be somewhat uniquewhere it's its pathology towardsdementia is suchthat that i cannot say that insulinresistance is the only relevant variablebecause as you start to correct insulinresistance in the body of someone withalzheimer's yes it does improve thealzheimer's but it does not fullyreverse it so that either means there isa point of no return with the insulinresistance that maybe a part of thebrain has starved enough that it's nowdead and cannot be resurrected or itsuggests that there is another variablethat we just haven't identified yetwe know it's not plaques because thatappears to have nothing to do with itbut it does suggest that there's some itcould be a differenceone of the other theories of alzheimer'sor contributors is iron metabolism andit could in fact safe i know you hadum oh what's his namemangum yeah yeah he's a big iron guy forexample so he's a good one i could referpeople to but we know although he does idon't think he talks about iron inalzheimer's but we know that iron canaccumulate and disrupt um the the thewhat's called a redox balance andoxidative stress in the brain so that'san additional inputthat might not get addressed in somepeople and that's that's somewhat of agenetic component as well as you knoweating supplemented foods with ironwhich which so many we all do if itcomes in a bag or a box with a barcodeit's got some kind of iron supplementedinto it rather than the heme iron thatyou get from say beefum but anyway yeah so some problemswhich aren't entirely a result ofinsulin resistance and alzheimer's mightbe that aren't going to be totallyreversible that's maybe the safest wayof saying it who else has got questionsyeah i just thought that um on thetanning and discussion we had previouslyif it if it could be possible that theskin on your body that has not beenexposed to the sun at allmaybe um it can absorb more vitamin dyeah absolutely the darker thecomplexionyeah the harder it is to have the uvlight convert the cholesterol intovitamin d which is why in general thefairer the complexion you know i'm apasty white guy um i would make a lotmore vitamin d say if you have a darkercomplexion than me kind of middleeastern complexion you would need moresunyou know like the vitamin d that i'dmake in five minutes you would needmaybe 20. you know so so andreabsolutely um but that is again aconfounding variable to this study thatwould make it difficult is it are theyfeeling better just because there's moretestosterone but again testosteronelevel is only part of the variable it'stestosterone receptor concentration butyeah it could be that you're making morevitamin d because that's such a fairlycomplected skin by fair i mean likelighter complected that you can justmake more vitamin d with a given unit uhgiven you the exposure per time hithis was a very great conversationuh so my question is also one broscience about sunscreenshall we use itor is it better to go so naturally yeahyeah so i'm uniquely qualified to answerthat question because i sunburn soreadily you know you ask that questionto someone else and they say i neverneed sunscreen and they don't theyliterally don't get burned i burnum now i know a lot of people say justdon't eat seed oils and you won'tsunburn anymore that is just not true umthat is just not true some skincomplexions just burn so i would ratherget a sunburn than put sunscreen on mybodyno question i don't even have to thinkabout it so what i but i don't like toget sunburnedso i will just kind of dose my sunexposure if i'm out at a beach or at apool or whatever with the kids i willabsolutely strip down to my just my myswim shorts and i will get some sun fora good chunk of time then when i feellike i'm reaching a limit i'll put on ashirt and just put on a hat and continueto enjoy the sun i will not putsunscreen on it is so there are so manychemicals in that that get readilyabsorbed into the bloodstream i wouldrather get a sunburn than have sunscreenon my bodynow if you're putting on like a zincoxide kind of but then you look allpasty white and weird you knowbut even still i want some sun exposureespecially on the trunk of my body iwant to make vitamin d i want to set mycircadian rhythms such that my melatoninknows when to be suppressed and it knowswhen to turn onso it there are so many benefits to sunexposure that the more you're blockingthissun effectthe more you're undoing a really healthboost and unfortunately because we liveunder fake light in in buildings all daylong with uv protection on our windowswe never are getting sunlight um so ithink people ought to make a pointeven if you're justifying the sunexposure bysaying that your testes need somesunlight then whatever sunlight is justa good thing but i'm i'm very opposed tosunscreenuh can i just follow up also about thethe sun because there's a lot of attackon the sunso would you comment that sunlightmakes you olderif you are avoiding sun that you willlook younger in the older ageand also if you sunburn more will youhave a higher risk of canceryeah yeah yeah good question um soeverybody know please i'm answeringthese questions with a little bit ofspeculation you know i'm a metabolicmitochondria guy these are topics thati'm familiar with but i'm not anauthority on them but i have enoughfamiliarity to have an opinionum so so with sunumit does appear that the more someone isgetting blistering sunburns the morethey will develop skin canceryeah now getting a little pink no idon't see that there's any there's neverbeen correlation but these are allcorrelational studies which i have agreat deal of disdain forand i'm sure this is a group whoappreciates causal studies compared tocorrelational studies all of this iscorrelational where they just happen tosee people who are getting blisteringsunburns will tend to have more skincancer there are a lot of differenttypes of skin cancerand you can have people with very darkcomplexions who don't get any sunburnsever and yet they can still get skincancers because there's just so manydifferent typesand then dorian what was the otherquestion sunburn and cancer and thenwhat was the the first oneyeah sothe people who are attacking thesunlightthey are sayingyeahyeah no i i i don't know i mean i don'tbuy that really um what i do know isthat the higher someone's glucose levelsare allow me to kind of hijack thatquestion and bring it back to somethingi do know whether sun can cause wrinklesi i don't know i've never seen a studyon thatum but i i do know that high levels ofglucose will create what's called a wecall it a my art reaction that canhappen on the skin you guys know a myyard reaction is what happens when youwhen you char something like when welike safe wants some beef he puts it inhis sous vide machine and then no onewants to eat the meat right out of thesous vide you go sear itin that kind of crisp sear that's what'scalled a mayard reaction and a part ofthat is what's happening it happens lesson the meat but it can happen onvegetables from takingglucose molecules and then convertingthem due to the heat or in this case dueto the sun exposure so when someone isgetting a lot of mild reactions that canin fact cause wrinkled skinand soum i would say it's less sun and itwould be more what are your glucoselevelsthank youyeah i mean my personal experience isthat you will burn if you're not uhexposed to sunlight a lot so if you'vespent the winter innorth americaand you fly to mexico in march and thenspend a week in the sun you will burnand it could get ugly couldcould be very bad but if you graduallyum introduce your sun to sunlight if youmake sure that even during the winteryou get exposed as much sun as you canand then you'reif you don't um up the dose of sunlightonceat once then your body will justgrow into it and i'll be able to handlemore and more sun soum i i could spend hours in the sunlightand i don'tbut again who knows i could be wrong itcould be her hiring me in certain wayssowho knowsall right anybody else have any morequestions we'vegone for well it's been two hours and 15minutes almostbut does anyone have any more questionsben oh yeah i've just got a quick oneben on your take um it's back to theinsulin management uh an old supplementbeen around forever called berberineyepyep and so in fact i did a i hate topush anyone to instagram i i found thati initially was on twitter i alsostarted doing more kind of littlelessons on instagram and i did one aboutberberine just because there's so manythere's so much um curiosity about itberberine absolutely works there'sabundant peer-reviewed umplacebo-controlled double-blindedclinical studies which is the best wecan get assuming that everyone's honestwith itthat absolutely show that berberine doesimprove insulin sensitivity and it doesso by activating this little enzymecalled ampk which the moment ambk isactivated which berberine turns on itwill stimulate glycol uh it'll stimulatesugar burning so lowering sugar bloodsugars lowering insulin overallimproving insulin sensitivity so ifsomeone were to go to their physicianand the physician said ah you havepre-diabetes i want to put you on a drugcalled metforminmetformin actually works through a verysimilar mechanism to berberine i wouldsay not that i'm giving anyone clinicaladvice of course i would say you knowwhat maybe try the berberine firstbecause it yes it will have a moremodest effect than metformin will but italso doesn't have the kind of gutwrenchingside effects that metformin hasliterally gone thank you i i gave upsugar about six months ago which waskind of painful but uh opted to uh starttaking 500 milligrams of berberine andnoticed a dramatic i mean it's you knowwhat good for youi was tricky you know as far as you kindof have this lethargic kind of i don'tknow you described it earlier and asyou're trying to get away from thesugars and just uh just burning yourfats if you will um but now it's justlike normalized and you know if you'regoing to go out and do a heavy like woodcutting day which i do a lot of yeahmaybe i don't think that day yeah youknow what also you should try if you'remonitoring your blood sugars at alleveryone could do this it worksremarkably well add a little bit of rawunfiltered apple cider vinegar into yourclub soda or a cup of waterit's it's remarkable these little it'spart of it's part of the lessonsactually doing thatgood for you and it's it's just alltogether just i just was curious on whatyou're really in depth with a lot ofthis stuff and you know i'm just more orless triangulating i've picked up inother places um yeah i think a bigproponent of david sinclair aging guyhas has reallyguided down that lineyeah so david sinclair is more of abiohacker than i'm comfortable with heloves to promote a certain number ofsupplements he's also from harvard sohe's out there to sell a lot ofstuff well the fact he is he is a bit ofa shill yep yep so i've i've reallystarted to lose respect for him anyonelike him who tells people to take thesedrugs like metformin is a drug he tellspeople to takeand and i think what an asinine piece ofadvice to to suppose that thisforeignman-made substance is somehow going tohelp you live longer when and we know inhumansmetformin works by damaging mitochondriaalbeit slightly but this is whyyou show that people who undergo undergoaerobic exercise which i never do i onlydo resistance training for best bang forthe buck but people who undergo aerobicexercise will have bigger strongermitochondriabut when they take metformin it undoesall of the mitochondrial adaptationsthat exercise it puts you back tobaseline and i don't know how someonecould justify taking a drug that wherewe all say everyone would agree exerciseis a key to living a longer healthierlife oh but also take this drug the factthat it will undo the benefits ofexercise well that's just aninconvenient truth i want to be popularand so if i promote all these cleverbiohacking substances people are goingto adore me for iti think he's just gone too far yeah andalso it's it's all the same climatehysteria nonsense and you shouldn't eatmeat then you should eatyou know this magic little grape that ifyou have three grapes in the morningthen yep yep that's right that's what isaid the thing about super foodseveryone says all these super foods justthis molecule and grapes and no i meanit's so silly it's just so silly tothink that humans evolved to need thesekinds of silly little things when ourancestors would have never eaten grapesthey ate yeah and i mean thevast majority of humans have had zeroexposure to the vast majority of plantsfor all their lives like oh the vastmajority of that's right you see in yoursupermarket were only ever available toyour ancestors we yeah we had to breedthem we had to breed them in a way toreduce the toxins and enhance what canbe digestible and and give us energy wehave in our in our clever technologicalerahave created plants from plants thatwould have been inedible in a previousgenerationthank you so much for all of this thishas been absolutely amazing umi really really enjoyed it thank you somuch thank you so much for all your workthank you for really just focusing theflashlight of truth on the thing thatmatters like just stop eating garbageyou get healthy and then you know letthe fiat people argue about their papersforever and their mechanisms and allthese weird acronyms butum the most important thing people needto know is just don't eat garbage yeahwhile they're while they're strugglinggetting papers peer-reviewed i'll be outsharing truthyeah i'll be out eating steak at sharingthe truth that's rightand thriving basically yeahso thank you so much ben my pleasurethanks this is great guys thanks so muchcheers[Music]you",
