  "text": "[Music]hey guysthis is robert reed love from the whatis money show and as you learn bywatching this show bitcoin is the singlemost important asset you can own in the21st centuryand one of the most important companiesin bitcoin todayis nydigknightig's mission is to facilitatefinancial security for allthey accomplished this by bringing ahigh level of professionalizationand sophistication to the bitcoinmarketplaceas a true game changer in the industrynida is safely unlocking the power ofbitcoin for forward-thinking individualsand institutions alikeby using nidaega you will gain access toan end-to-end institutional gradeplatform providing bitcoin otctransactions bitcoin collateralizedborrowing secure custody assetmanagement derivatives financing marketresearch and moreand all of these services meet thehighest regulatory governance and auditstandardsled by robbie guttmann yen zhao and rossstevens naidic is absolutely explodedonto the bitcoin scene recently and isleading the way for ongoinginstitutional adoption in this nascentasset classso please be sure to check out naidig asa single source for all your bitcoinneedsso we're talking about the seven layersof security and the proof-of-worknetworkand the first layer is energy and thesecond layer is technology and the thirdlayer is politicaland um in all these cases bitcoin isbecoming more secure more long-livedbecause it's co-optinguh important actors in each of thesethree areaswe need a network of politiciansto defend the networkyou need a network of technologyproviders and semiconductor providers inorder to secure itwe need a network of energy providers tosecure it the fourth area that'sfascinating to me isthe financialdimension of security of bitcoinbecause miners are capital intensiveyou need capitaluh to build the mining facilities and toacquire the rigs and to do theengineeringso that capital comes from outside thebitcoin system so it's u.s dollarcapital for the most partor it's currency equivalencebitcoin miners therefore are recruitinga networkoffiat investorsthere's a whole set of conventionalinvestorsthey can't buy bitcoinor they wouldn't buy bitcoin but theywould buy an operating companythat mines bitcoinkind of like people that don't want toown gold but they want to own goldmining companiesso this is incredibly stabilizing forthe network becausefor exampletoday the news was fidelity had boughtseven percent of marathonso a bigcredible umtraditional investori think fidelity has like two trilliondollars trillions of dollars of capitaland 20 millioncustomersand they've been around foreverright that company is now invested ina bitcoin minerhow does bitcoin benefit wellnow you've got hundreds of millions ofdollars to lose if the bitcoin minerfails and so the investorhas a vested interest in protectingtheir interestand so bitcoin recruitsuha whole network of legalmarketingand political lobbying capabilityas it recruits investorsthere are trillions and trillions ofdollarsin the conventional economythat for legal reasons or politicalreasons or business reasons or taxreasonsuhor practical reasons and technicalreasonsthey can't buy bitcoinbut they canbuy a security based on bitcoinso in fact from their point of viewthey would prefer to buy the publiclytraded company orif you're a public company investoryou would prefer to buy a publiclytraded company and if you're a privateinvestor you prefer to buy the stock ofa privately traded companyand that's just what their pool ofcapital doessoyouif you want to co-opt that financialnetwork of investors you need a capitalintensive use of proceedsso bitcoin mining is capital intensiveand proof of work is capital intensiveif i snap my fingersand i go say the proof of stake and youdon't actually need to buy equipmentand you don't need to engineer thefacilityand you don't need to buy the energythen you don't need the capitalwell then you don't need the investorthen you don't need the investmentbankerthen you don't need the market theytrade ini guess then you don't need the supportof the congressmen the senators and theregulators they knowand you probably don't need the mediajournalists that they talk toyou're losing all of thatright and you're also starting to looklikeyou've created your owndifferent systemokay you created a virtual worldwherethe politicians and the media and thecapital and the bankers in the otherworld are irrelevantyou created your imaginary world rightand bitcoinbitcoin mining bridgesthe bitcoin universe the you know thecrypto asset of bitcoin with thephysicaland the political universeand if if moneymoney is uhit's socio-economicenergywell there's two elements that theenergy part says that it needs to bethermodynamically sound and conservativeand correctbut the social economic part saysyou need the politiciansand you need the media and you need theinfluencers rightsothe the process by which i constructbitcoin mining companies is a process ofrecruiting the supportof bankersinvestors politicians and influencersas well as technologistsand energy producersandthat is a virtuous processthat that is actually the hard work youcould think of it isas when you're building a bitcoin minethat's the cash and or that's thefoundation upon which you're buildingthe bridge you know if you ever look atthese bridges that cross the chesapeakebay they have to dig down and they haveto put in place massive pilings in orderto uh to buildthe bridge on top of it so if if thesubstructure and the foundationis weakthen the bridge itself is prone tocollapse rightthe bitcoin miners themselvesthey do all four of these things andthen and then the fifth thing the fifthlayer of security is the networkitself andby the networki'm really referring to the bitcoinmining centersevery place every place the bitcoinminers set up their own mining centerthey're they're plugging into the energygrid they're pl they're bringing in themining rigs they're engineering them andsuiting them they're getting thepolitical supportthey're raising moneyand now the miners themselves have theirown companiesand there's a lot of public companiesand a lot of private companies we'llhave flank a dozen publicly tradedbitcoin miners by the end of the yearbut let's say there's hundreds ofprivate companiesall of these companies are part of thenetwork of security for bitcoin they allhave skin in the gamethey all have invested human capitalfinancial capital technical capitalenergy capitaltimeas you can imagine they don't want tolose thatright they feel painand so because they feel pain they don'twant to lose that they invest to protectthat and so how do you invest to protecta hundred million dollars invested inbitcoin miningyou're going to contribute to politicalcampaignsyou're going to hire lawyers you knowthere are experts in texas energy lawyou're going to hire lobbyists you'regoing to hire uh marketing people thatare going to explain why bitcoin is goodfor the world not bad for the worldyou're going to you're going to hire hrpeople to manage all your hr issuesyou're going to hire financiers toreport this to the investorsyou're going to spend a lot of timetalking to all these constituencies tomake the investors happykeep the politicians happyyou're going to be an early warningsystem uh against mishap like if ifthere'sif there's a bug in the software bitcoinor if there's a bug in the hardware ofbitcoin if you don't trust the miningrig manufacturer you're gonna push backif if you think that the software is notbeing upgraded fast enough or the thehardware is not being upgraded fastenoughto keep the network secure and toprotect your investment you're going tolobby and agitateand uh you're going to do that in acontext wherewhere there's a balance of power betweenyouand the node operators the validatorswho's a lot right there's a lot of themand then there's also a balance of powerwith bitcoin investorsright if you try to change the number ofbitcoin or you try to change the hash ortry to change the block size you'llprobably have a lot of bitcoin holdersthat'll push back on youumand then you're going to do it inbalance with yourfiat investorsthe people that hold your securities orthe derivativesand you're going to bemanaging the business to try to stay inalignment with regulations in 100different jurisdictionsand you're going to be communicating allthe time sothe bitcoin mining network is the fifthlayer of security approved workand ultimately when you get to a pointwhere you have 50 well-capitalizedbitcoin minersand they've got billions of dollars eachat stakeand they're spread across all thecountries in the worldthenthey are in essence the first line ofdefense for bitcoinright you can call them different thingsyou can think of them as i refer them asa motor of sovereigntythey're running the motor that keeps thesovereign network fresh and they'reproviding the transactions and thesecuritybut you can also look at them as the uhat the round houses on the wall righttherethey are the first thing you're going toattackright when you decide you want to attackbitcoin you're going to attack a bitcoinminer they're the first thing to getattackedsince they have the most at riskif you're a bitcoin miner in china rightwhat have you sufferedyou know thata lotthey have the most to loseand so the bitcoin miner in switzerlandis going to be spending a lot of timeyou know thinking about whether there'sa political attack coming fromswitzerland on bitcoin rightthey will be the early warning systemthe canaries in the coal mine if youwilland so those those five layersthose are they're implied by theproof-of-work algorithmand we get energy technology politics weget finance and we getnetworksupport and they're all sources ofinertia and anti-fragilityand they they all draw forms of capitalthat are not bitcoin bitcoin is capitalbutdollar capital tech semiconductorcapital you knowpolitical capital energy capital righthuman capitalall of these forms of capitalare creating a genetic diversityand a darwinian vitalityfor the networkif i get rid of all that capitalif i just said well uh bitcoin's gonnabecome a proof of stake network andwe're just gonna stake bitcoin to runbitcoinright you see what you've done iscreated again a hermetically sealedclosed systembut that becomes an inbred systemand that means the biggest bitcoinholder when they go insaneright the heart the security is notgoing to get upgradedrightwe're not going to look for we're notgoing to continue to distribute thenetwork we're not going to upgrade thetechnology anymorewe're not going to spend much timecomplying withthe local political rulesyou know when howard hughes was therichest man in the world he ended upretiring to the top floor of his hoteland didn't come out of his room forseven yearshe went bat crazyyou know you can do that when you're therichest man in the world when you don'tneed anybody else yeahyou know but but you can't do thatyou know when you have responsibilitiesyou have to get up every day and youhave to go and put on a suit or a tireor at least conform with the localmorays rightand that keeps you from going off thedeep end or off the abyss so this thisthis vortexyou're describing of you know energytechnology politics surrounding bitcointhat it's kind of assembling for itselfit's centered onthe expenditure of energy that's whatmakes it real that's what gives allthese actors skin in the gameand the proof of stake model would besomething that severs that bridge youknow we have this digital reality andphysical reality that's anchored byenergy expenditure but if you move theproof of stake you've now you've severedthat bridgeand yeahthe uh it's creating i mean on thenetwork mining specifically there's kindof this dynamic equilibrium rightbetween of the governance between minersnodes and all these various stakeholdersand i guess the last point that i thinkis really important when we sawexhibiteduh in this the chinese mining exodus wasthe network's very amorphous you knowlike you try one jurisdiction tries tostamp it downand what happens a lot of these minersget boxed up shipped elsewhere pluggedback in it's a swarm creature yesit's a swarm creature yeahand it's a swat but it's a swarmcreature that livesin the physical world and in thepolitical world it is not a is not acreature in in cyberspace or it's not adisembodied astral projectioni meanif you cut the cord if you don't needenergy you don't need the semiconductorsif you don't need political support ifyou don't need external capital and ifyou don't need to engineer a facilityyou don't need a corporate structurethen uh you've created a virtual worldlike second life right and nowright if i create a virtual worldand i design in a virtual money orvirtual tokenand then i stake that virtual token tosecure a virtual networkso that people can trade you knowvirtual goods and virtual thingsyou know i can create virtual securitybut it's virtually certainright that someone's going to createanother virtual worldright rightyeahyou knowand so you're creating the problem isyeah you outsmarted yourself you createdsomething which was free and easywhich means that you knowthe guy that uh the guy that copiedwhatever to create aetherium well thenthe guy copies ethereum to createcardano and then someone copies corodanoto create theunisthey make sushi swap and then they makethe next thingbecause you can do it fast and easywhat you've done is you've created avirtual casino or a virtual world andvirtual moneyandit's not that you can't create abusiness around it like second life is abusinessright uh fortnite is a business rightyou know online gambling is a businessyou can create a virtual casino or avirtual game or a virtual worlddungeons and dragons and you can live init you can buy your virtual vorpal bladeand you can use it to kill the virtualdragonbut the problem isyou don't have a bridgeto the thermodynamic real worldright nor do you have a a politicalbridge to the political worldandand you have umyou have lostthe space space-time constantsthat uh that give the property integrityand durabilityand that's probably it's a good seguefor me to go to layers six and seventhe sixth layer is the spatial layer andthe seventh layer is the temporal layerso by spatial layer i meanthe proof of work bitcoin mining networkumforces you to spread out throughout theworld because you're not going to find120terawatt hours of energyin one buildingand even if you did in one buildingthe heat engineering is such that youcan't stack the bitcoin miners up overeach other like thatso you have to spread out and thenatural competition means that well wefind a volcano here and a nuclearreactor there and we find some strandedgas hereit's an open system and it's it'snaturally diffusing and decentralizingand umand that's important ifif you have a proof proof-of-stakenetwork and i have 50or 20 percent of all the moneyright then i can just stake the entirenetwork in monacorightright there's what why would why wouldyou need to spread it to the fourcorners of the earthwell the problem with staking thenetwork in monaco right is that maybemonaco as a as a political attack ormaybe the building gets wiped outyou know what if i stake the entirenetwork on like 16 computers in the sameplace right centralizationyeah you're centralizing it andyou're putting itthere there is no thermodynamicincentive to decentralize it and thereis no requirementbut in in factwith proof of work and and therequirement of energyit naturally is going to create anincentive for someone to put this on awaterfall in the middle of africaandthat that distributes the security loadyou don't want all the security to comefrom manhattanrightright if all the security comes tomanhattan that's proof of stake that'scentralized pretty soon you've gotcentral bankyou know pretty soon you know like threepeople get together and decide yourdestinyeverything just centralizes you reallywant to have the security come from acountry that you can't get to because ifyou can't get to ityour enemy can't get to itand ideally it decentralizes so it'seven hard to just to distinguish whereit's coming fromso that that spatial um that spatiallayeris forcibly decentralizing it and it'snot it's not just decentralizing itgeographically it's also decentralizingit politically rightand andthat causes it to decentralize acrosslots of institutionslots of political jurisdictionsand lots of geographic placesand if you want to attack it there is noone central place to attack right youcan't find the vector yeah right there'sno logical nexus and there's no physicalnexus right how do i find the top youknow 51 of the hash rates in 198facilities around the world how do itake control of all 50 you know all 198of them overnight without it to benoticing because that's crossing 100borders yeah yeah it's neutralizing allthese central attack vectorsso that it'si guess it's by virtue of its ownproliferation it's becoming more immuneto attackfrom anyoneit becomes immune to a cyber attack itbecomesimmune to a physical attack and itbecomes immune to a political attackyeahand it even becomes somewhat immune toum to a protocol attack where someonetries to get people to change theprotocol right it's just much harder toattack the durability the integrity ofthe network becauseit becomes so spatiallydistributed yeah the proof of stake 10people might actually stake 51 so now ican actually identify the 10 people nowi know who to attack rightpsychologicallyphysicallywhatever yeahi don't even know where to start withsomething which isspatially distributedso the the seventh layer is temporaldistributionand by that it just means thatthe attack has to come over timebecause it takes 12 to 24 months tocreate a world-classbitcoin mining centerit takes another 12 months maybe toorder all the equipmentsohow do i go about ordering seventhgeneration equipmentsecretlyor with malicious intentand then i have to convince someone tofront me the money right so i have tohood wink a billion billions of dollarsof investors then i have to buy billionsof dollars of equipmentthen i have to wait 12 monthsthen i have toget someone to engineer the center and ihave to get them to agree to do itbecause they trust me they're not goingto do it if they think i'm going toattack the networkthen i have to get the politicians tolet me build itcould take three five yearsthen i have to get all the engineersthen i have to build it i have to bringit online so that i can attack thenetworkand i got to do all thatwithout a single person guessing thati'm trying to do it if one person thinksthat i might have malicious intent theyleaked that on twitter and two millionpeople would know it in seven minutesyeahsoso thatthat's incredible the space-timeuh functioning of bitcoin is importantyou don't want it to move fast this iswhy you knowif you if you read the block size wars alot of maneuvering back and forth but atthe end of the daythe immediate a priori observation isthey shouldn't have tried to changeanything it was a mistake to try tochange the block size it's a mistake tochange the frequencywhybecausewhen you create a crypto universe or acrypto creaturethe block size and the frequency of thenetwork are akin to the space-timeconstants of the universe it's liketrying to change the gravitationalconstant and the speed of lightis like you don't get to play godexcept onceyou can play god onceif satoshi had designed the network withyou know1.2 megabyte blocks and eight minutefrequency it might have workedand there are some parameters thatwouldn't have worked but once he starteditand it started to spin then you don'tchange itbecausebecause the umthe size of the the block sizeis kind of like the packing density ofcarbon atoms you know or carbonmolecules you know all right it's likeyou don'tif you if you were to change the speedof light or the gravitational constantlet's say you change gravity on the onthe surface of the earthlet's say i made it 3xwhat it is right nowwhat happens to every creatureevery bridge every buildingevery plantevery factorywhat happens when i crank up thegravitational constant by a factor ofthreethey are failing strategies all of asuddenif you change gravityheck crank it up by a factor of tenwhat happensevery buildingand everything built up till nowcollapsesi.e all workis negated not just work by mankind workby animalswork by mother nature yes riversmountains collapseyou know bridges collapse companiescollapsecountries collapseso you would negate all past workyou would uhyou would imperil or or umor uh impair all structuresyou would imp you would impair or ordestroy all machinery constructed anymachine that works would stop workingand you would throw the future to chaosand it's pretty obvious you're playinggod right change the speed of light samething's going to happen right thereynolds number determines the hullspeed of a shipchange the reynolds number change theway that molecules move around you knowa hydroyou know foilyeah nothing workssomething syncat best everything just gets destroyedyou know commerce collapsesso when you think about it like that youcome back to the crypto universe yousaid okay you created a cryptoyou set your space time parametersnow the future of mining is based onthat block size and that frequencychange the block size change theforecast of the mining revenue changethe change the expectations of everyinvestorchange every business decisioninvalidate all business decisions yeahat some point right if you keepthe the foolishness of like doubling theblock size which is what the bigblockers wanted to do is if they haddoubled the block size over and overagain they would have driven transactionfees to zerowhen transactions fees go to zero therevenue of the bitcoin mining businessisdramatically changed now there's nofuture revenue model now you have minerslobbying to change the block rewards youwould basicallybankrupt the mining business screw itall up and then you would have you knowyou've got no security network because ican't afford to actually secure thenetwork soso what they were imagining a worldwhere everything had to be on the baselayer and they're monkeying with thebase layer and instead what they shouldhave seen is that the world is in layersthe the key isthe base layer of bitcoin is like thegraniteunderlying manhattanyou never needed it to be lighter ifsomebody said i have an idea let's turnthe granite in manhattan into cottoncandy it'll taste betterit's like are you an idiotif you turn all of manhattan into cottoncandy all the buildings are going tosink we're all going to diein a cotton candy swampit's like you know it's so silly likewe're laughingbut the point is but the granite's heavyand it's hard for me to move and it'sslow and the transaction fees on movinggranite around are highyesexactly you're not supposed to move thegranite yeah you're supposed to build ontop of the graniteand the same is true with the base layeryou're not supposed to move the baselayer the point of the base layer is tobe here a thousand years from now rightright yeah you can wave your arm andconvert the granite into sand or intoyou know into mudand you can move ityou know you can shovel it out of theway with your little toy shovel from theseashore when you were a kidright but but the point is you can'tbuild a city that's going to last athousand years on mud and on sandand if you had if you have aunderstanding of the universethe universe is layers and layersand the consequences of the speed ofsoundis everything that flies through the airand the consequence of the speed oflightis everything in the universe and theconsequence of the gravitationalconstant is how the water flows and howthe mountains moveand once you understand those things youcan build everything everything thathumanity's done in the history of thehuman race is predicated upon thosespace-time constants being what theywere and when you decide to routinelychange them you're playing godand when you play godright you you pretty much destroyeverything that came before and throwinto chaos everything that comesafterwardsyou know after leveling every buildingand wrecking leaving a trail of wreckageyou know inin the present dayyeah like an earthquake except it'sit's worse than an earthquakeit's like a continual rollingyou know randomized series of differentearthquakes every secondyeah and that's why you don't want toscrew with thatright yeah forthe way i'm looking at this is if we goback to thatyou know life and bitcoin being thesurvival strategy propagating forwardthose strategiesoptimizefor the environmental invarianceso you know life is optimizing kind ofto overcome gravity in a way and if youchange one of these invariants all of asudden you invalidate all the survivalstrategies like everything that's allthe adaptationall the fitness modification that's everbeen done it's just worthless all of asudden double gravity kill all the birdsyeah like that yeah kill all the birdsright likeit's like it's a very why would justdouble the block size or cut it in halfyeah because like everything will diewhy don't we cut the oxygen you know theoxygen content in half yes happens andthen that veryprecedentdestroys bitcoin right has there been asuccessful change and i've heard it putthis way is thatyou know bitcoin cannot be reproducedbecause ear reproducibility was theinvention it's like to create somethingthat no one can changeso if you somehowyeah if you somehow change it then allof a suddenyou've destroyed that you knowinvariants that it was offeringumand this is incredible i've neverthought about how these layers actuallypreserve it in such a way and thetemporal layer is interesting toobecause it'sif you try to attack it it's likethere's no way to do it without alertingnetwork participants so there's justthis it's kind of like a lag or a bufferand a complex system that stabilizes itlike you try to create a changepeople adaptthat's the soundthat's the speed of soundlike for example you're like wouldn't itbe great if sound move faster or slowerwella shock wave is when you attack the airfaster than it moves out of the wayright so well do we need a speed ofsoundyeah you need a speed of sound what ifwe made the speed of sound equal tospeed of lightnot a good ideayou know likenot a good idea if you want the universeto workwhat if we got rid of frictionlike transaction fees are too high let'stake them to zero well that's the sameas saying let's just get rid of frictionand let's get rid of gravity wellgetting rid of gravity and getting ridof friction is a problem because likepretty much every everything we createdlike works with itright like try how about your tireswithout frictionlike how well is your car going to drivewithout frictionuhyou know so like they're not bad thingsthe thing that was you know in thedefense of the big blockers thelightning network was not as manifestlyclear today but if all you have to do islook at a lightning wallet a lightningtransactionand look at um a layer two and a layerthree transaction look at how squarecache app workslook at how moon worksi can send a thousand sats in a splitsecond for one satonce you see that you realize layer twoplatforms layer three applications aregonna move bitcoin at the speed of lightin an almost friction free wayand what did you really want frombitcoin you wanted it to not breakyeahright you never it was foolish to it'sfoolish to riskthe immortality[Music]of bitcoin in order to go from onemegabyte to two megabyte blocks rightit's foolish how aboutyou could have had something that wouldbe immortal and you could build acivilization that would last for 10 000years and you could just do it usinglayer two and layer three appsbut instead we're risking putting outthe fire of civilization to try tochange the space-time coefficients of ofthe one crypto networkwhich successfully took root anddecentralized right yeah and thatemulates nature properly to your pointwhere nature evolves in layers so weneed an unshakable foundation to supporthigher layersso let's talk a little bit aboutproof-of-stake and the like becausethat's the elephant in the room herelook proof of work is an opencompetitivenatural systemit emulates darwinian competitionand it's openproof of stake is a closed controlledsystemand so the problem with a closed controlsystemis it's not darwinianand uh and there's no genetic diversityit becomes inbredso if you look at let's take a shorelinea living shoreline if you're trying toactually uh maintain such a thing theway they engineer it isyou would create 200 foot long uhrevitments and then you would put abreak in it for the sea water to come inand then you create another revit meantto to protect the shore from the surfbut you always have to have a break forsea water to come inif you don't leave that channel for seawater to come in then the water behindthe revetment becomes putridrightit's pretty you know you don't want youknow you ever seen a putrid standingbody of water without any circulationyou know it breeds bacteria it becomesinfested it becomes dangerous it's nothealthyright umand why it's closedyou know it's closed systemall you know all cities allcivilizations why do you build a city ona river because you need something tocarry the waste awayright what happens if you recirculateyour waste in your ownhow long can you you know recirculatethe waste in your spacesuithow long can you recirculate the waterin the waste in your apartment you knowwellproof of stake is recirculating itselfand and the problem there is unless youhave perfect components and you neverand you haveyou know perfect conditionsat some point eitherthe toxicity of the closed environmentdestroys the ecosystemor it becomes so fragilebecause of the lack of darwiniancompetition and a lack of ecologicalgenetic diversity that umeventually it diesit's likeyou know it's like ait's like a creature endlessly cloningitself rightafter you endlessly clone yourselfyou're subject to genetic mutations anddefects you you know that's why you knowevery organic creature has sex right youyou actually want to keep mixing the dnaright in order to avoid themutated defectsright and you can't cleanse yourself youcan't fixthe species this is like a closed systemlike a photocopy of a photocopy of aphotocopy eventually it gets veryblurry rightyeahand and i guess coming back to the otherelephant in the room herebitcoin is a successful proof-of-worknetwork that has created our firstdigital moneyour first digital propertybitcoin has done that we can see thatthere are no successful examplesof a proof-of-stakenetwork succeeding as digital propertythat's the elephant in the roomthere are no successful proof-of-stakenetworksright we've never gottenwhat would be required to be successfulwell here's a simple oneuhif the united states governmentdesignated a proof-of-stakenetworkas propertyand not a securityit's never happenedin fact you know the head of the secjust went on television and said ifthere's an ico and there's ashared enterprise with intent to profitthen it's a security yeahso as far as i can see everyproof-of-stake network that's beenlaunchedlooks to be by legal definition ofsecurity not propertyand even ethereumisn't a proof-of-stake network sothere's a debate about about whether itis property or not and that'lleventually be resolvedright butbut umthere's absolutely no question thatat this point the only successfuldigital property that's ever beencreated in the history of the worldwas created on a proof-of-work networkrightthere's nothing else everything else isjust like a garage science experimentright a venture a venture experiment andon the surfacethey all appear to be securitiesright i mean not none of them havesuccessfully decentralized or beenembracedas propertyand it's not clear whether they cansuccessfully decentralizei mean theoreticallytheoretically new things are possiblebut practically speakingwe have one exampleof crypto property or crypto moneythat is bitcoin and everything else isis a speculation let me ask you thecould we sayit seems to me like central banks in awayare kind of a proof-of-stake networkwhere essentially the moregold they have or reserves they'restakingthe more interest and inflation revenuethey can generate effectively socould we say that then a proof of stakenetworkcould only really exist with becauseagain there's gold underlying that aproof of work underlying central banksumno uhcountries are you know currencies areproof of stakeif you own a countrylike if you own a country you candesignateyour currencyor your token to be a currencybecause you make the lawrightright so i mean that's the case right imean venezuela can designate theircurrency and the us can designate itscurrencyso you have you have examples of thosesystems they're they're not crypto proofof stake systems they're right right orfiat but they are inherentlycentralizing which i don't see why acrypto system and they are centralizedyeah and they all centralize yeahand and uh you know it seems logicalthat uh that other stake systems willcentralize yeahand and by the waycentralization is notinherently a vice as long as it's thisas long as it's treated as a securityfor exampleyou knowa publicly traded company that has astockhas a centralized token that is thestockbut they are they have obligations todisclose the number of those such tokensto their shareholders and it's illegaluh for them to act in a duplicitousunethical fashionand it's alsoit's also illegal for a politician topromotethat security because that gives itunfair advantage to uhto one company over another rightso if you treat it as a securitythen a staked tokenyou know isis uh ethical and legal yeah it couldjust never work for moneyyeah it's just not it's not ethical tocreateprivate money as a security token andrepresent that it's propertyright that that's where you're you'recrossing the moral hazard boundaryand so ii think the summary here isbitcoin has created digital moneydigital propertyif you will either um on top of adecentralized proof-of-work networkthere are there are other proof-of-worknetworks that are much smaller and lesssuccessfulthat are less decentralizedthat are struggling to a degreenot winning against bitcoinand there are other theoreticalapproaches to creating a decentralizednetwork none of them have succeeded todateif the definition of success isis to be deemed morally and legally aspropertyby a legitimate governmentall right everybody that was episode 15of the sailor series uh and this episodegot intothe second half of sailor's frameworkwhich he calls the seven layers ofsecurityuh so we went through layers fourthrough seven in this episodewe started withthe fourth layer which is the financiallayerum this one's somewhatintuitive but there is an element to itthat that may be uh is less intuitivethis essentially means bitcoin'srecruiting capital right butspecificallylarge long-lived pools of capitaland it'sdoing this in a way that is actuallycreating incentives for those that can'tpurchase bitcoin directly to adopt it uheven indirectly sosailor gave the example of you knowfundsentities convertible debt offerings allof these being mechanismsfor you know large capital pools likeuhinstitutions endowments things like thisto gainuh financial access to bitcoinindirectlybeing that a lot of these investmentcharters are restricted from owningcrypto assets or um or are required toown a certain mix of say equities orbonds uh of a certain credit rating etcetera et ceterasothis umthisfinancial lairis interesting because it'sbasically causingall of the money in the world which iswe've touched on a lotbitcoin is really just out competing allother forms of money so all othercapital pools which are expresslyorganized to optimize the returns oftheir shareholders or their stakeholdersit uh bitcoin kind of enmeshes itselfinto thesethese alternative capital networksand this just becomes a virtuous cyclerightthis again the key to understandingbitcoin is thatno one has figured out how you breakthis virtuous cycle of its monetizationprocessso we have thisvirtual cycle of rational actorsbasicallycoming into bitcoin or gaining exposureto it either directly or indirectly umto optimize their own benefits soit's it's not even a matter of like haveyou studied bitcoin or are you ignoringbitcoin it's uh i think sailor said wayearlier in this seriesquoting someone who said war you may notbe interested in war but war isinterested in youthis vortex of incentives that bitcoinrepresents is justno one's figured out how to stop it andif you areto any extent a rational economic actorthat seeks to preserve wealth over timethen you're basically being forced umto look into bitcoin to learn aboutbitcoin ultimately to buy bitcoin soi think ifthe difficulty in understanding bitcoinissignificant you have to understand a lotof different a lot of different thingsabout different fieldsbut i think theawareness of itsreal impact on the world is right hereright in this virtuous in the heart ofthis virtuous cyclethat you know sailor has properlyidentified but no one has figured outhow you can stopumso that's that's the fourth layer andthen we got into the fifth layer whichis the mining network itselfandyou know the point here is that bitcoinminersagain if bitcoin is a microcosm ofcapitalism bitcoin miners have skin inthe game and this is the key key pointthat they are incentivized to protectthese large capital investments they'vecreated in the form of the miningnetworkum and this is you know again thecenterpiece to drawing all thepoliticians the lawyers the marketingthe educators etc etc is that um minerswill invest in these people to protecttheir capital investment in the miningnetworkand soyou know being that they have skin inthe gameit's when any time bitcoin is underduress in any form you know a politicalphysical attack whatever maybe atechnical attackminers feel the pain right theyexperience this directlyas an impact to their capital investmentand then they are the defensethey're the first responders right orthetheuh drivers of the adaptivity and thenetwork if you will um and maybe it'suseful here to to just define skin inthe gameit's a term thrown around a lotuh you know you're probably you probablyhave an intuitive sense of what it meansbut specifically it is a balanceof incentives and disincentivesso for instance we often think thata an executive in a corporation may bealigned his incentives may be alignedwith a corporation because he has astock options plan or equity orsomething like that and that's true in asense and that he's positively alignedbutif the stock price suffersthey're notthere's no clawback on their stockoptions for instance oror claw back on past salary or anythinglike that socorporate executives are oftenpositively aligned with the interest ofthe corporation but they don't have thisdisincentive uh component to skin in thegameand this the distance of portion isreally important right this is whatmakes nature workif youcause someone pain or an animal painthat is the strongest signalimaginable to cause them to want toadapt and change whatever they're doingto avoid the painum soit says carrots plus sticks right it'snot skin in the game it's not just thecarrots you also have the sticks as welland this inspires responsibility franklyand you see thisin capitalism this thisidea of skin in the game is enshrined incapitalism and that if you have propertyrights in somethingthe rights arethe access you have to the benefits theasset can create right but you also haveresponsibilities right you areresponsible to care for that asset tosecure that asset to custody itto cultivate it in a way that createsmaximal value for youumso we also see so skin in the gamethere's there's incentives anddisincentives to property right you'reincentivized to optimize your propertyand you'reyou have a responsibility to take careof the property which is a disincentiveuh not to be negligent essentiallyand then we also have like profits andlosses right this is the the pricesignal that's guiding entrepreneurialaction and the allocation of capitalclearly it's a risk and reward right thethecarrot are the profits if something'sprofitable that means you're satisfyinga want in an economic way that'ssomething entrepreneurs pursue and theytry to avoid losseswhich would be the allocation of capitalin an uneconomic wayso this likewhat's so key to this is that painis informationum you know you're getting signals aboutwhat's going right but it's reallythe things that really sharpen you tendto be the pain frankly and you may haveyou may know this from your own lifewherethere's thisold joke about the uh some related jokejust the curse of the entrepreneur so ifyou've executed one strategy or recipeor business model successfully in theworldyour tendency is to want to repeat thatexact model even though it may not besuccessful in all circumstancesso there's good guidance you get fromsuccess and profit but you really learnthrough painand i think this is a just a reallyimportant point that the all the marketactors in bitcoinhave the highest possible skin in thegame right we talk about bitcoininspiring this hyper responsibility ifyou will even if you're just a holderright the fact that you can holdyour private keys as a bare assetthat's a lot of power but that comeswith a great deal of responsibility aswell so there's thisthis balance of incentives anddisincentives as every aspect of thebitcoin network that really makes itshineand thisso we could say skin in the gameactually drivestherapidness and the effectiveness ofadaptation itselfand so the network actors or networksthatrespond more quickly to pain right tosay their actors have more skin in thegame they are going to out compete allthose that do notby definition right this is justdarwinianso when you look at uhsay these zombie companies that areliving off of qe infinity right they'rejust generating perpetual losses butthanks to government subsidies theycontinue to survivethose businesses will be out competed bymore capitalistic businesses um and thenthe money itself rightfiat currencyit's not something that feels pain itdoes the actors in the central bank feelno pain whatsoever about their decisionmakingthey're compensated the same right theydon't share in the downside riskof fiat currency production soyou're just talking about thisperfectly incentivized networkof actors competing with another netnetwork of actors that are basicallyanesthetized to all pain so which one doyou think is going to adapt out competeand perform better i mean the answerbecomes quite intuitiveum and so for that reason you knowsailor described bitcoin mining networkas kind of like an early warning systemyou know if there are protocol issues ifthere's supply chain disruptions for thethe semiconductors themselvesuh miners are going to be the first torespond because again their capital isat stake right their investment theirreputation etc etcand sosailor described bitcoin miningas a motor of sovereigntywhich i thought was really interestingthatyou kind of maximize the sovereignty ofthese individual actorsandin doing so you've given them anincentive and disincentive schematobasically optimize for bitcoin successand network growthwhich is itself empowering thesovereignty of individual holders sothere's this virtuous feedback loopuh between the motors of sovereignty isthe the miners and then uhself-sovereign holders themselvesandi heard it you know someone said thisrecently too thatbitcoin makes sovereignty scalable rightfor the first time in historyserving the ultimate minorityright the individual the ultimateminority in the worldthe interests of that minority areprotected and andprovided for by bitcoin so bitcoin isa motor of sovereignty that's optimizingthe sovereignty of individuals andthat's what causes it to out-compete andit causes it to out-can be these otheryou know quote-unquote sovereign systemsthat have established our sovereigntythrough forceso we're talking about you know thepower of choice versus the power offorceand i think thatit's just more energetically efficientto have asystem based on volunteerismthan on involuntarismand that that is why these systems opensystems out compete in the long runright that's why the internet outcompeted the intranet and that's whybitcoin is effectively going tooutcompete all closed source moniesuh sothe first five layers as sailor said itgives the network inertiagives it anti-fragility and it causes itto attract capitaland if you flip thatthat's all based on proof of work if youflip that to proof-of-stake all thoselayers would dissipate so all theseprotective layers that are insulatingbitcoin from competitive disruptionthey would not coalesce around aproof-of-stake model for the verylogical reasons we've explored hereand sothe examplegiven was bitcoin is like this swarmcreature that's anchored in the physicalworld via energy expenditure so we'veyou knowsailor made the great point anyconsensus mechanism besides proof ofwork which is not bridged intothermodynamic realityjust becomes a video gameand that can have value right there'sfortnite and all thesevery popular video games that have valueand they have their own little economiesbut they are segregated from the realworld and that there is no thermodynamicbridge between the twoand bitcoin's different in that it islike one of these video game monies ifyou willbut it'sit becomes real it makes the game realby requiring energy expenditurein the mining competition that's whatmakes thisdigital money a real world monetarynetworkit's a super interesting way to look atitand then so after covering the firstfive layers we got into the fifth andthe sixth which are spatial and temporaland so looking at the spatial layer abitbitcoinisforcing miners to basically spread outright they are in hunt of the cheapestenergy resources available in the worldum stranded energy things that are noteconomically usablethat's what bitcoin flows to first nowi've given this example before that uhnick carter gave at one point if youimaginethe world as a sphere like a topologicalsphere wherepoints of more expensive energy arehigher points of cheaper energy or loweryou can imagine bitcoin like pouring aglass of water on this sphere where itlevels out and goes to the lowestlowest places first sobitcoin'seconomizingthe use of energy by basically allowingus to monetizeunderused or unused energy sourcesand this iscausingit to spread out spatially so thenetwork is self-distributing if you willuh it's naturally diffusing anddecentralizing via the incentives thatare intrinsic to bitcoin itselfso again it's not a matter of a top-downplan like determining who needs to bewhere is thisthis microcosm of capitalism that isbitcoin justflowering and deciding where it shouldbe based on market consensus you knowbased on thethe individual self-interest of eachmarket actor but which is aligned withthe greater interest ofof all users of money and that'syou know keep kind of dancing around butthat's the core point here is thisvortex of incentives that no one canavoid and everyone benefits uh byaligning themselves withand this is opposite to proof-of-stakeagain proof-of-stakeleads to spatial centralization becauseall of a suddenyou don't need to attach it to energyyou don't need to spread it around theworld you just need to do it efficientlywhich is the whole point of proof ofstake in the first place so you just putit all in one place you know i thinksailor gave the example of monacoand that just leads to politicalvulnerability right if your wholesecurity model is in one place thatmeans it's very easilyidentifiableand attackablesoproof of work is this consensusmechanismthat self decentralizes away from theseattack vectors physical politicaltechnicaland it basically neutralizes them soit'sthe power of the open networkthe voluntary open network is reallyhard to overstateespecially when it comes to threats youknow single attack vectors specificallyit just envelops them and neutralizesthemand again opposite of proof of stakeproof of stake is going to make you morevulnerable to all these attacksyou know cyber physical political etcso finally we got into the seventh layerwhich is the temporal layerand this is this one blew my mindbecauseeveryone knows about the 51 attack inbitcoin uh this is its oneyou know quote unquote vulnerabilitysatoshi addressed it from the beginningthat if you could controla majority simple majority of the thehash poweryou could basically uh bend the networkto your will now you're not incentivizedto do so so you couldum you know double spend and do theconduct other fraudulent transactionsand whatnotalthough the incentives stilllean towards uh or point actors towardshonesty even in the event of a 51 attackbut to execute a 51 attack means gaining51 percent of the hash powerand i had never thought aboutthe impediments to that the temporalimpedimentsbeing that you would need you knowyou have to go through all of theseproduction processes to fabricate thesemiconductorsto raise the capitalto manufacture them deploy them plugthem inumand you'd have to do all you know thiswhole process they ever get to 51you're chasing a moving target to youbecause the hash rate just keeps growingandthe temporal layers like as you're doingthis clearly you're making a lot ofnoise rightit's a lot of money to try and i thinkumthe numbers today i want to say aroundbetween 30 and 50 million per day ofminor revenue so this would be blocksubsidy plus transaction feesum[Music]that that's a big number right that's abig number it's a big incentive it'sdrawing in more competitors into bitcoinmining if you're trying to get to 51 ofthat you're chasing a really quicklymoving targetyou're making a lot of noise in theworld and this would be signalingto all other market actors that there'sa big entrant coming in to miningwhich would inspire them to pursuesimilar strategies sothis buffer of time is really importantin insulating bitcoin and that if youtry to mobilize enough hash power toattack ityou're just signaling to all othermarket actors to be on the defensive orto accumulateeven more hash power for themselvesmaking it even harder for you to mount a51 attacksoi thought that was just reallymind-blowing and thenyou know lastly we got into this idea ofbitcoin's space-time constantsand sailor analogized the block sizeand the block frequency as being akin tothe speed of light and gravity in theuniversethis is a really really interestingpointand heput this under therubric of you only get to play god oncewhich is effectively what satoshi didand here's the way i think about this isso the common thread again betweenorganisms organizationsinstitutions is that they are allcomplex adaptive strategiesthey're propagating across space andtime they're adapting to changes in theenvironment uh attempting to improvetheir fitness and reproduce right andagain this is true of life this is trueof business this is true of institutionsthese strategies necessarily adapt toconstants or invariancetwo of which uhcosmologically are the speed of lightand gravitythisall the strategies then so all the lifeforms all the businesses all theinstitutions arebasicallyoptimized around these constants suchthat if you change the constant in anyway like he gave the example of gravityif you double gravityyou destroy all the lifethat has or let's say the vast majorityof the life that has optimized itself tosurvive in those gravitationalconditions same is true of buildingsright the civil engineeringcodes that were used to construct thebuilding would not work under doublegravity buildings would collapse youknow tires would explode etc etc etc sothere is thiswe have the variance of these strategiesyou know life business institutionsadapting themselves to the invariancein their ecosystemsgravity speed of light etcand this similar dynamic plays out withmoney and that we have this is darwinismright this is universal darwinismwhat did market actors adopt as moneyhistoricallythey adopted gold why did they adoptgoldbecause gold was the mostslow and predictableno matter how much effort was allocatedtowards gold's productionits supply increased the most slowly andmost predictably which is to saythe supply of gold or the scarcity ofgold was the mostinvariant magnitude in the marketplacesothat caused market actors to rationallyselect it as a store of value rightyou're out in the marketplacedoing uh you know executing yourentrepreneurial craft whatever it isyou're facing a lot of variants a lot ofuncertainty a lot of changesit's controlled chaos effectively thisis the business worldwhere do you want to store thethespoils of that battle if you will youwant to store it in a place that'smaximally insulated from that variancethe most invariant goodthat was gold historicallysoin the same way that you know life formsadapt themselves to the constancy ofgravity on earthmarket actors adapt themselves to theconstancy of money the most invariantmoney which was gold historicallybut now in bitcoin we have somethingradically newit's the first perfect constant orinvariant ever in history uh in that wehave this fixed supply of 21 millionbitcoinandin order for the network to functionproperly it only needed certainconstantsso again we talked about the blockfrequencyevery 10 minutes and then the block sizethese were basically set in stone bysatoshi in the beginning these were justinvariants that he arbitrarily selectedbut the point is that that network hasnow organically grown up and all themarket actors and businesses have grownup and adapted themselves to theseconstants to these universal constantswithin bitcoinsuch that if you now try to go in andvary these constants or vary theseinvariantsyou would shudder and uh debilitate allthe strategies that had that come intothe bitcoin networkso this just i mean he's just blowingthis whole block sizedebate out of the water i mean it'salready market proven in 2017 but hadyou even stopped to think about it for amoment going through sailors frameworkhere it would have been very obviousthatum[Music]these changes would not work essentiallyand umyou know again to give the big blockersome credit lightning network was lessobvious then but if you took a bigpicture view on this you would see thatyou know not only does nature evolve inlayers but technology evolves in lyricstoo the internet itselfis a stack of open source protocols it'scalled the internet protocol suite it'sevolved in layers over timeand as i've argued in the past i thinkit's proper to conceive bitcoin as thelatestlatest layer in the internet protocolsuite so you say bitcoin is the internetitselfall of these other crypto assets umso we'll stay focused on proof of stakethat's an open network right proof ofwork is openuh it's self-distributing it's resistingpolitical attack vectors physical attackvectors technical proof of stake is theopposite right it's a closed system it'scontrolled by someone it's non-darwinianit's not going through thisinternally competitive process thatcauses it to proliferateand immunize itself to attack vectorsand you know sailor gave the examplehere of stagnant water becoming putridand that proof of stake is effectivelyrecirculating itself rightthose that stake the most are rewardedthe most so it's it'sif you just envision it like a pyramidand those that hold the most whateverthe etherium token let's just sayethereum's proof of stakethat are at the top of that pyramidthey're going to be rewarded most of thestake staking rewards whether that'sinflation or some other uh economicdisbursement sothose that have the most will gain themost i mean it's intuitive that thisthing is centralizinguh which leads to detoxification andcorruptionand we have a great example of thisin the world today like we don't need totheorizecentral bankingis proof of stakeright it's whoever has the most goldwhich is the proof of work money theycan effectively stake that into thenetwork and be the most irresponsiblewith monetary policy so in the currentgeopolitical paradigm that is the theu.sthe u.s central bank is the fed we havethe most gold so we haveallowed ourselves or irrigated ourselvesthe ability to write the banking ruleswhich is exactly what we did in brettonwoodsand since then we've been able to exportthese paper slips called the dollarto the world and receive goods andservices in exchange so this is this isa proof of stake model and we see whatcentral banking does to wealth disparityright it centralizes control of ourassets and eviscerates the middle classum and so it's very logical and i wouldargue intuitive that a crypto proof ofstake system would be similarlycentralizing over timeand that's whyproof-of-stakeit will fail i meanmaybe they'll find a way for it to workfor someorthogonal marketplace but it will neverwork in money right you need theexpenditure of energytoconstitute the skin in the game thatcreates these layers around bitcoinright the f the five layers of securityplus the the spatial and temporal layersanything short of workright work beingthe one phenomenon that mankind cannotcounterfeit it is impossible tocounterfeit work right this isthermodynamic realityenergy cannot be created nor destroyedwe can only be transformed through workthat is at the heart and center of thiswhole incentive vortexthat we call bitcoinumandyou know it's obvious that that wouldout compete all closed source systemsincluding proof of stake systemsespecially proof of stake systemsthat again if we look at theirimplementation of fiat currencyhistoricallyvia the central bank they'reself-annihilating right they centralizeover time until they collapseso this is episode 15 uh of the sailorseries i think this framework he laidoutuh the seven layers of security whichwas you know episode 14 in episode 15 isjust brillianti've never heard anyone put it like thisi would say that sailor has officiallycemented proof of work asthe most inarguable and arguablysuccessful consensus mechanism for moneythere is and i justi have yet to hear a good counterargument against it andif i ever didi would have them check out these pasttwo episodes so i hope you guys enjoyedthatuhwe'll be back soon with episode 16 anddiving further into this bitcoin game soi'll see you soon[Music]",
