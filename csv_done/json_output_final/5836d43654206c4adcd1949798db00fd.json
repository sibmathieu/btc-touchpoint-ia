  "text": "hello hello hello welcome on GAC GSAwelcome in Franceis the name of our channel oh okayGAC GAC yeah and welcome in phones yeahit's a it's it's a pleasure to have yougreat to be here for first time in 20.yeah 20 years yeah you told me so youwere speaking a little bit French so incase during the interview if I need toswitch it's okay it will be okay for youthe answer won't be in French but sureat least you will be able to understandI can understand but I yeah I haven'tbeen here since I was 15 years old okayit's been a while it's been a while soit's a pleasure a honor to have you uhon the channel you uh one of the quarterof the lightning Network white paper sothe lightning Network I think on thischannel everybody knows what it is nowit's one of the most exciting project onbitcoin everybody's speaking about itand for many people it is solving all uhor most of the scaling issues I know Iknow that you have you are not perfectlyaligned with this with this statement wewill speak about it a little bit laterbut before that I would like you toexplain us a little bit how the ideacame to your mind of the lightingnetwork is it something like uh Newtonand and the apple look orika one morningor it is something along a long thinkingprocess to come to this idea yeah Iwould say likethe general idea it was definitelyworking with uh Joseph so it's myself uhand Joseph poon and we met in um SanFrancisco like 2014.um there was lots of Bitcoin developermeetups and stuff and we'd always go tothose and hang outum and I think that the the general hisidea of like hey let's have you knowthese payment channels and Routepayments through them in a trustless wayum that that he sort of told me thisidea but it was still very vague andthen we worked together for a number ofmonths maybe half a year or so on youknow how to actually do this how to makethe channels so that they can bepersistent uh how to make the channel sothey don'tum only go in One Direction or switchdirections or things like this and howto route htlcs and all these differentuh components that we work together toto solve so I think if you look in thattime like 2014 there were other ideas ofpayment channels or some ideas ofpayment Channel networks as well andactually one of the um there was a paperfromumbit pay a little bit before we releasedthe lightning Network paper calledimpulse and it was something sort oflike the lightning network but it wasn'tas good and didn't really work as welland this is what another reason wethought oh we really need to finish ourpaper we need to present this becauseyou know we have a better way to do itso it wasn't like this comes out ofnowhere there were many people thinkingof of similar things and I thinklightning Network maybe had a nice nameI thought of a good name and and it sortof tied a bunch of things together in away that worked so how long did it lastfrom A to Z like from the idea youstarted speaking about it and really therelease of the of the white paper thefinal version oh fine well I think maybesix months or so until we we presentedit at uh SF Bitcoin devsum I think that was in February of 2015.and then we were we revised the paper alittle so maybe six months we would workon itum sometimes in person sometimes youknow how cafes sometimes just online andmailing each other but we would you knowsee each other every week or so and workon it and today what is your involvementin the in the development person are youstill uh working on it are you still uhinvolved so for maybe three or fouryears I haven't really worked onLightning Network I've been working onuh discrete log contracts and Nutri XOum but I just uh switched jobs so I Ileft the MIT media lab this week and I'mjoining uh Light spark so I may beworking more on Lightning Network youare coming back on Lightning this is thethe announcement on on GAChe's back yesterday I guess but yeah wewill work on lightning and other Bitcointhings so so I may have some more uhinvolved but I don't know yet what Iwill do soaccording to you today how is thelightning network is it uhum matching your expectation likeseveral years later is it where you'reexpecting this this phone probably notlike in in the good or by the way justdifferent I I didn't think so I thoughtthe the first use and the most importantuse would be with exchanges I thought ohthis is you know perfect because thereare a lot of issues with the paymentChannel network model right you haveliquidity and look I need money tocoming in and channels can get exhaustedand and paths and stuff you know it'sit's it's not perfect you know it's notas as clean as in Bitcoin where you justsend coins to anywhereum and I thought the best model would beexchanges and I thought well most peoplemost of what Bitcoin is used for a lotof it is exchanges a lot of times peoplego to an exchange buy Bitcoin move it toa different exchange buy some otherthing or or leave it on Exchangewithdraw you know a lot of exchanges arevery involved and so I thoughtum and also when we were writing uhlightning Network this was less than ayear after Mount gox collapsedum so it seems like a long time ago youknow it was a long time but but this wasstill in in people's thinking um and soI thought well instead of you knowdeposit and withdraw at an exchange youwould have a Channel with the exchangeand that seemed like a natural model tobuild the network from where you haveyou know many users which maybe justhave one or two channels to exchangesand then larger channels betweenexchanges and and build a network outthat way uh and that hasn't happened atall but don't you think thatthis is the the future I'm seeinglightning like this kind of big nodes inthe center of the network maybe likehandling the liquidity and uh andservice providers of the lightingNetwork yeah we do seeum you know we do see a large a smallernumber of large nodes with many channelsand then lots of sort of small nodeswith a few channels but they're notreally exchanges exchanges the the youknow I thought oh maybe it'll becoinbase or Kraken or gemini or or thesecompanies uh and and we talked you knowwhen we so we wrote the paper and thenstarted uh lightning Labs a few monthsafterum and we talked to lots of exchangesand they were sort of interested butmaybe not that interestedum and and so yeah that that's to meprobably the biggest surprise was thatit's not something that exchanges andusers uh demanded so I knew if if Iwanted to use an exchange and trade Idon't reallyum I would want to use a lightningChannel because then if the exchangegets hacked well my money is still inthe chatum but I guess most people don't do thatand and so it's a different use casewhere people are doing like totallydifferent things with it and making verysmall payments and you know making sortof fun fun testing out things and thenstarting to be a real world payments aswell so it's it's different than what Ithought would happen so yeah and don'tyou think that the exchanges have notimplemented yet the lightning Network inthis current form because of maybe thelimitations or the problems that uhmaybe still on the table or what for youwhat are those uh yeah let's open thebox for you what are the main concernswell there's there's concerns but alsothere's there'sI guess the other thing to think aboutfrom compared you know 2015-16 to todayum coins that are not Bitcoin whetheryou call them altcoins whatever are muchmore prominent than they were at thattime right so yeah in in 2014-15 there'sLitecoin and there's I think Dogecoinand stuff but it wasn't you know uh anexchange's volume was mostly Bitcoinum and now there's ethereum and whateveryou know like millions of coins andum and so I think exchanges focus moreon okay we what we make money on istrading between coins so lightning isnot the priority okay uh so I don't knowif it's problems with lightning thatstop it I think it's for exchanges maybelack of interest uh and the other youknow other things we thought oh well wewill do cross-chain atomic swaps rightyou can have lightning on Litecoinlightning on Bitcoin now we'll swapbetween I don't think there's much usethere because there's only a few coinsthis will work withum and so you know there's not muchtrading between Bitcoin and Litecoinright so most people that you know muchother many bigger coinsum so that's so some of the interest andthen some of the issues for paymentssure there'sfrom the beginning it's like oh wellwaitwhen you first start a channel if youfund it you can't really receive moneyuh or you know like you can you can sendif you open a channel and haven't sentany then you can't receive any and soyou know dual funded channels and howdoes that work and and you know the thegeneral issues with uh payment channelsyeah that's still it's not I don't knowif you can like solve it right it's it'sjust sort of a you know harder to use insome ways and some the UI is is a littlemore difficult and stuff and that's oneof the biggest concerns I have isumI went to El Salvador last year and it'slike oh everyone's using you knowBitcoin using lightning but then Ilooked and there's so many custodialwallets whereyou know is this lightning I don't knowlike there's no Channel IDs there's notxid I don't you know is there any Keysinvolved who knows and so you knowpeople are using software that sayslightning but it doesn't seem to havethe the guarantees that lightning doesit's maybe an Excel sheet behind yeahyeah maybe it's just a website orsomething and maybe behind you knowmaybe this server uses lightning but youas the user you don't have the the powerto close a channel so that that is to mea concern that yeah the UIis harder and and hasn't maybe hasn'tgotten easier fast enough and so it'smuch easier for people to say oh we'llwe'll run the lightning node on ourserver and give you just a nice UIum and that yeah that sort of defeatsthe point to some extent yes so for youlighting will fail if it's only that orif it's like a decentralization on themain chain but the centralization ofservice providers liquidity providersEtc on on the L2yeah would it be okay or not accordingto you I mean it's it's not as goodright if data is nothing but yeah if theusers if the users don't have keys youknow like in Bitcoin many people say notyour keys not your coins and lightningyou have keys right it's it's notexactly the same as an Unchainedtransaction and there maybe are somerisks but it's pretty safe and if youactually have the lightning Channelit's very rare that people will losemoney on that like and and if someonegoes offline you can close the channelso it is it is quite safe and you dohave that sort of power of okay I havemy own Keysum and some people can't you know stealmy money or stop you know stop halt itso I freeze my money or anything uh ifyeah of course if you're using a serverthat you know many people are connectingto one server with the lightning nodethen you don't have that security soit's it's not like you know it's youcan't say it's fail because already youcan say well many people use Bitcoinjust by going to coinbase or just bygoing to finance or something and doesthat mean Bitcoin has failed well no youcan still use Bitcoin for yourself youcan run a node it's not that hard butthe the sort of ratio there's so manypeople running uh custody you know likelike Bank like things and not enoughpeople running full nodes so it's alittle bit of a failure right but it'sbut it's fixable right everyone canstill run nodes it's not so hard we justneed to sort of push to make it easierand make more people running their ownchannels and running their own nodes sothis is one of the main issue if Iunderstood correctly it's like theliquidity and and managing the channelsyeah any other things that uh on thetable and and quite problematicumyeah I guess I I don't know whatI think it's coupled with running aBitcoin note as well so I I worry a lotaboutum because I'm trying really to pull alittle bit the information because as Itold I told you in the in the introeverybody's speaking about lightninglike really it's uh it's a solution toeverything and and I have the feelingthat we are not speaking enough aboutwhat is not working or is like the theconcerns the limitations oh sure sothere's L2 so even so there's there'ssome things that I think are are quiteare fixable right so the fact thatpeople are not running their ownlightning nodes as much or you knowverifying a full node that's what I'mworking on I think okay we know how tofix this then there's other things I'mnot even sure right so even if you haveall of these UI problems everyone'srunning lightning uh you still reallydon't have enough for everyone to use itright so you're still even with segwityou have you know one and a half maybetwo megabyte blocksumyou can get lots of people to uselightning but not a whole country'sWorth or something it's still quitelimited and so can you elaborate it onthat why why a world country could notuse a lightningum you just have to sort of ask likeback of the envelope well how manychannels do you open and close you knowin a single Bitcoin block so 10 minutesyou can open a few thousand channelsless than 10 000 channelsum and you know so maybe you can do amillion channels a day or something andin the United States you'd you know thisis very back of the envelope but yeah ifyou look at it you can't support thewhole world or even a billion peopleusing using lightning with Bitcoin todayyou'd need some othereither you know so some people oh biggerblocks maybe that's not going to have Istill think that could be a solutionthat you know who who says it's one ortwo megabytes maybe four megabytes isbetter who knows but that's very hard tochange obviously and people thoughtabout thatum so that's sort of died for that yeahbut it is a little bit disappointingbecause it's like well yes there were alot of dumb ideas and people saying yeswe're gonna have gigabyte blocks andthat was bad and so we shouldn't butthat doesn't mean no it should be one orone and a half megabytes forever rightjust because dumb people said theopposite soum yeah so or some other techniques likeuh you know and people have beenresearching things like Channelfactories and L2 and stuff like thatmaybe that allows even more scalabilityuh so there's there's still you knoweven if this works perfectly we needmore right it can't be it's not the onlysolution to this so according to youlightning will not be the only scalingsolution for Bitcoin there will belightning and most probably other stuffmaybe we call it like maybe there's newversions and hey there's this newtechnique that that we still call itlightning I don't know right it may ormaybe have a different name uh and getlumped in so that's one of theinteresting things like with uh discretelog contracts as well there's all thesenew developments and sometimes I thinkI wouldn't call that discrete lawcontracts but I don't you know I don'tcontrol there's no trademark can youexplain this what is the DLC like so DLCwas something that actually I was I wasthinking about while developinglightning uh and they're very sort ofclosely related if you look at the codeif you look at you know the the scriptsand how it works they're they're quitesimilarum but DLC is is a smart contracttechnique so it's a way for two peopleto sort of bet on something whether it'sa price or some other future uh data andthen uh have Bitcoin move between thembased on that data so it and it and itlooks so if you look at the BitcoinNetwork it looks exactly the same as alightning Network channel and thesoftware is is quite similar so you youhave a channel and maybe we say oh I sayI think it will rain tomorrow you thinkit will be sunny tomorrowum and if it's sunny you get the Bitcoinif it's rainy I get the Bitcoinum and then on which Oracle you yeah soyou have some you need to specify someOracle which will sign and say what whatwill happen but the nice thing of ofdiscrete law contracts is the Oracledoesn't see the contract so for thepeople watching Oracle is like theconnection to the real world like yeahyeah who is giving the information thatit's raining tomorrow or right that'sthe information you need to settle thethe agreement basically right right andso that's you know people say the Oracleproblem it's a difficult problem becauseyou need you need to trust like a lot ofthe thing in Bitcoin is okay it's allmathematically verified we're nottrusting each other but you do have totrust this Oracle because they can liethey can say it's sunny when it'sraining and you know these are not likemath problems these are just you knowopinions in some wayum and so the the idea for me is okaywell the Oracle it is a problem you'retrusting this entity but maybe you cantrust it less maybe if they don't knowwho you are and they're sort of just aradio station saying okay todayinformation yeah they just broadcast andthey say okay today it was raining uhand they don't know that you have acontract at all and even when you usethe contract they cannot see that thatyou that you used their data uh thatseems like it would make it harder forthe Oracle to maybe be bribed or youknow say the wrong thing because theyjust you know broadcast without knowingum and so that that idea that I think Iwrote that in 2017um and now there are some startups usingit uh and building out discrete lawcontracts and I think it's veryinteresting way to tie lightning anddiscrete law contracts together would bereally cool because they're they're verysimilar in how they work because youbring programmability to the script likethis with the DLC like would you be ableto develop smart contracts and stufflike this with the DLCum the script so the script is the exactsame as Lightning it's so it's actuallythe script is very straightforward itjust sort of this key right now or thiskey laterum and all of the sort of smart contractaction just happens on Layer Two sort ofoffline between the two users so and andcurrently it's it's not very scalableoffline so if one of the problems in DLCis if you have a million differentpossible things that can happen so let'ssay there's we're talking about a pricebut the price could be anythingwe may have to sign quite a few quite afew signatures because we have to likethink okay what happens if it's one centwhat happens if it's two cents all theway to ten thousand dollars or somethingso that's a little bit but that'soffline scalabilityum and so it doesn't touch the layer onescalability but there are also many newtechniques actually just this year a lotof cool stuff on the mailing list ofpeople uh making it much more scalableoffline as well so what do you think forexample of the zip develops on onbitcoin would it bea potential scaling solution like whatbecause we are speaking a lot about thatin France I don't know if it'severywhere in France we are like it'sreally the hype of the zika Roll-Ups uhuh and and many people are speakingabout it like eventually to be a scalingsolution for Bitcoin in the near futureuh I don't know near maybe eventually soso it's it is interesting and I think inin Bitcoin it will certainly be peoplewill watch and say okay in ethereum orsomewhere else try it and let's see whathappensum because one of the things that's tomy extent so I'm not an expert on thisbut from what I've seen in ZK Roll-Upsyou would need some kind of uh soft Forkyou'd need some kind of change tobitcoin and that's that's very difficultto do for for specific things and soall a lot of the things I've beenworking on so lightning Network discretelaw contracts utrexo they don't requireForks you could maybe say that lightningdid require Forks of like op uh checksequence verify and check lock timeverifythose when we were first doing lightningthose weren't in and then they didbecome in but they they weren't promptedjust because of lightning people wantedit for other reasons as well and soum so real but if you think about itreally uh and and segwit as well likelightning really wantedsome kind of malleability fix I Iproposed a different thing than segwitum but segwit works too and so it wasn'tbut segwit wasn't like oh we're makingsegwit because lightning you know thatwas just one of the many reasons uh so Ithink it's very difficult to makechanges in Bitcoin just for like ohhere's this one thing we wantum and so let's make a soft Fork it'sthat's very hardum but if there's a change that has manydifferent uses and like sort of ageneral Improvement like segwit orTaproot or something then you know itcan it can make changes uh so I thinkwith ZK Roll-Ups the difficulty is thiswould be a soft working change forreally just sort of this one one use andit has to be worth it it has to be worthit and it also has to I don't know ifyou've seen there's a lot of argumentsin the last year about like op CSV checksorry CTV check template verify and andand with what I've worked on you youtree XO as well people say well we don'twant any software Forks because we don'twant to make a soft work and then one ortwo years later we find a better way todo it and so I think with ZK Roll-Ups itfeels a little bit like there's a lot ofnew improvements it's still activelybeing developed and so it's it's Pro I Iwouldn't say it's going to happen inBitcoin anytime soon I don't even thinkanyone's reallyare you part of the group of the devlike thinking it's really the best weshould not touch the L1 but we shouldnot touch uhlike we should like scale build on topbut we should not touchthe main protocol to for those kind ofobjectives at least Jen I mean generallyyes I'm probably more okay than fixablethan many other people on on layer onechanges because like I think uh you knowTaproot great and if we have uh you knowcross signature uh cross input signatureaggregation great like I I still thinkwe have some leeway to make layer onechanges uh I think eventually you mightnot be able to Vic Bitcoin will becomesort of stuck and no one will be able toagree to change anything and that mayhappen in the future but while we canmake some some powerful changes to tolayer one I kind of like it so you knowsomething like uh op check templateverify I would sort of be okay with itif it were up to me I I was like yeahthis you know maybe it doesn't doeverything you want but we're we're verysure it's safe and it doesn't havereally negative impact so to me thatthat seems like you know there's anenough use there that I would be okaywith it but I think in general most manyother people have like a higher standardfor that but that don't you think thatat one point uh Bitcoin will have toevolve or die or you are part of thepeople saying okay no it can stay yourlife like this and survive forever inthis current state yeah I thinkI don't know what will happen but maybeit can evolve a bit in the nextfew years five years ten years I don'tknow I think eventually if it is bigenough it will probably get stuck Ithink a good analogy is like ipv4 IPv6where for 20 years I think everyone saysokay we're transitioned to IV IPv6 and alittle bit but you still need ipv4 Idon't know if it will ever get rid ofipv4um and it's just too big it's it's theInternet it's so big uh how to change itso Bitcoin may become like this if itbecomes even larger and more valuableand more people using it it may becomevery difficult to changeum unless there's like you knowemergency or something oh we found thisyou know bug or quantum computer orsomething crazy and then we all have tochange it then maybe you canum but I think it will become sort ofbig enough and heavy enough that it willbe hard to make layer one changes sothat's sort of why I think hey we shouldwhile we still can let's let's make someimprovements and we may be able to usethis like even Taproot I was very happywhen when Taproot was activated becauseit wasn't clear that it would be rightfor after segwin for a number of yearsthere was no um consensus changes butTaproot lets you do like really coolstuff so it's like oh cool now we haveTaproot okay if that's the last thing weget then that's better so in this shortwindow that we have for the next fiveten years according to you what are thethe most important features thatDev should work on like what is superimportant for Bitcoin that okay we havemaybe 10 years let's do that well yourlist of priority if you were like thethe CTO of Bitcoinalso so it's kind of funny because I I'moptimistic about layer 1 changes andlike consensus changes but actually Idon't work on any because I I it's soumit can be very frustrating like I I youknow if you know Jeremy Rubin he'sworked on op check template verify and Ican imagine how frustrating it is youlike work on some supporters yeah andand it may never be activated maybe itwill I I hope something like maybe itleads to something more powerful that isactivated so I think one of you knowthat that's one of the answers is somekind of more powerfulum covenants or smart contract things uhI think that would be very useful uh forBitcoin you know whether it's op checkOps CTV or something more powerful thanOps CTV uh also something like the Sighash no input Sig hash any prevoutthere's one translate that for us humanssure so so I think I I may have come upwith sikhash uh no input that was myidea for fixing malleability it doesn'treally fix it but sort of makes it okayuh where right now in Bitcoinyou when you're signing a transactionyou're pointing to a specific output uhso so Bitcoins live in outputs they livein these utxos uh many people mightthink oh Bitcoins live in addresses butit's actually the opposite right itutxos have addressesum but the the coins are in theseindividual utxos and when you'respending coins you point to a utxo andsay that's where I'm spending from soyou don't point to an address and sayhere's my address I'm spending fivecoins from this address or that's toomany I'm spending point one coin fromthis addressum that is how like ethereum works butBitcoin is different it's it's utxobasedum and this is good in many ways itallowsum a lot of powerful things you knowlightning is built on it utrexo is builton these specific ways it works but itdoes have some limitationsand things for things like L2 or sometypes of covenants and smart contractswhat you really want to be able to do issay I'm signing a message and I'm notsure what I'm spending I haven't figuredout yet what I'm spending but I want tospend anything that has this key uh andthen I will I'll figure out what I'mspending later after I've signed andthat's a little scary because you're notactually committing to what you'respending it's a blank check a little bitof a blank check like you may say thenumber of uh you know how much you'respending or you may say something butbut you're not quite sure what your youknow bank account is that you'respending from or something like I don'tknow if that's the analogy but you wantmore flexibility in when you'reassigning and that will let you do somesome interesting thingsum that's been talked about for manyyears I don't know and and I think oneof the issues with it is it is dangerouspeople could write software or or youknow sign something and then lose theirmoney because it does allow so differentdifferent problems than what we havetoday but it also allows some somepowerful new things so I hope somethinglike that will be activated as well butyou know whenever I'm working on stuff Idon't assume this will happen it's it'salways like okay I'm gonna work assumingthat Bitcoin can't change at all andwhat can we do and at the same time wellwe can think about oh well if we hadthese things then you know it would beeven more powerful you were mentioningutrixo so the project that you worked onover the last couple of years can youexplain this a little bit what it isyeah I think I think it's a way to saylike it's layer one scaling uh it's youknow lightning is this whole other layeruh utrexo it's or layer one or layer 1.5you know it's it's much closer to layeroneum and it it's not asmaybe not as exciting in some waysbecause if it works you won't even seeit right it it's if you're running aBitcoin note so if you run a Bitcoincore todayuh you you know download the softwaredouble click start running it and it hasto download the whole blockchain and ithas to run uh run the last 13 years ofof data and store a lot so the bigproblem withuh how do I say this there's two partsthere's you have to go through the wholeblockchain so that's about four 500gigabytes now and then there's thecurrent state of who owns what thecurrent utxo set which is only aboutfive gigabytes so it seems like oh fivegigabytes is much smaller than 500that's that's no big deal but actuallythe bottleneck in many ways is that fivegigabytes uh because you can prune andyou can delete after you've downloadedthe 500 gigabytesum so if I understood correctly it'slike the the family three and then youjust have like the last picture of thelast family right that this is the threegigabyte and the 500 right and the layerthe last photo is what is what iscurrent yeah so in order and in Bitcoinin order to find out you the really allit is is which Keys have which coinsright so just it's just this big listthere's about 80 or 90 million of themof okay either you know all the outputsthat currently exist so if you have aBitcoin you have one of these utxos ormaybe three or fourum and there's about 90 million now andit's about five megabytes and you orfive gigabytes and you must have that toverify Bitcoin whereas the the historythis 500 gigabyte history you need toreplay that to figure out the currentstate but once you've replayed it youcan delete it so so manyum nodes will it's called pruning nodesand it works very well and you justdelete the data after you've downloadedso it's not too too hard so the idea ofutrexo is maybe we can delete even thefive gigabytes instead of having thisdatabase of who owns all the big youknow who owns what Bitcoins you candelete this database as welland people prove they own their coins soI the the like model seems nice becauseright now if you run Bitcoin on yourhard drive or SSD you have everyone'scoinsand it's 90 million different entriesand you don't really care about them youcare about your coins and so the modelin Utrecht so the idea anyway is yeaheveryone keeps track of their own coinsand when they want to spend them theyprove to each other hey I have coins andI'm spending them right I'll prove thatthese coins exist and they will say okayyes I verify the proof and now we'll letyou spend themumthat's sort of the and and it's nicebecause so it uses this um basicallyMerkle tree it's a Merkle tree-likestructure so imagine if you know howMerkle trees work say okay these 90million different uh outputs put it in abig Merkle tree and you just hold theroot of it and then when people want toshow they have coins they make a Merkleproof it's it's not quite that simplebecause you need to be able to add anddelete and some other thingsum but that's sort of the general ideaum however the issue is you can't geteveryone to upgrade it once soif you did have just a system where yousaid okay everyone only keeps track oftheir own coins and they don't keeptrack of anyone else's the problem isthe first people who will run that theywill see a transactionfrom someone who has not used thissoftware and it has no proofs and sothat's a big problem you need someone toprovide proofs for everything right tosort of start this network and probablyforeverum and so that's called a bridge nodeand that so this idea of hey let's allthrow away the utxo set and only verifyproofs that's not my idea at all thatthat idea has been around for a numberof years but one of the big problemswith it was well you need a bridge nodeyou need a node that can sort of bridgebetween the new software and the oldsoftware and prove everything and itneeds to be fast and you need to be ableto run it on a you know you knowreasonably small computer and so I thinkwith you 3x so that's I think the bigthing is it's one of the first whererunning a bridge node is actually quiteeasy you'd need an extra four or fivegigabytes of space so one possibleapplication that I see I think about itdirectly is like having a full node onmy phone yeah for example so possibly sothe thing is it will still take the sameamount of CPU time right you're stilldoing the same amount of work so itwould be it would fit on the phone finebecause it's very small it's only a fewkilobytes uh but it still needs like alot of CPU power so maybe itsynchronizes when you're you're pluggedinto charge or something becauseotherwise it will use the batteryum but yeah that that would be the onlythe remaining bottleneck for usingaccording to you what are the the mainbenefits of having this new new form ofnodes and the compact nodes yeah so it'ssmaller so that's that helpsum it is actually faster to synchronizebecause right now you do a lot of disk io right where you're reading even yourSSD you're reading and writing from it alot and so since you don't read andwrite from it it's a bit faster to syncyou can also do things like skipsynchronization so that'sum or synchronize backwards say like ifI'm starting a new node I can say okaywell the binary hasum like a checkpoint kind of thing froma few weeks ago so only verify the lastfew weeks and then in the background Iwill verify the last 10 years as well soyou don't have to do it in order the waywe do todayum so I think yeah mainly smaller andfaster and I hope that gets more peopleto run full nodes right I don't knowlike we see that lots of people do notrun full nodes and instead useum something like electrum which is youknow okay or something where it's just awebsite and you just ask the website heydid I get any moneyum so that's you know not great it wouldbe great better for people to run nodesI don't know to what extent it isbecause it takes up a lot of space orbecause it takes up CPU time or thesethings so it feels like okay we'll solvethis one problem right and well one ortwo problems and hopefully get morepeople also it's nice long term becauseright now the utxo set it's only aboutfive gigabytes it could be much biggerum there's not really a the only limiton the growth is the block size limit soit could easily grow by like a gigabytea month and it doesn't so it's good thatit doesn't I guess to some extent butyeah if many more people start using itor every or you know someone isattacking the system and expanding theutxo set that could beum a problem and so long term it feelsnice that okay well with utri XO wedon't have to worry about the size ofthe utxo set you can still validate evenwith a very small amount of data so whatis the status right now you are sayingthat you were changing job so you youare living with the job done or no Ihope to still I'm planning on stillworking on the codeum at the new job and you know it's it'sopen source so it's not just me there'stwo or three other people working on itum most of the timeum and we have you know we have codethat works but it's still building outlike how do you integrate a walletum and you know how to and then some ofthe wallet problems are problems withevery node how do you synchronizewallets fast and stuff like that sothat's still what we're still working onum but the general code does work andyou can synchronize a node with utrexoum very quickly as long as you have agood internet connection but we're stillbuilding out you know better integrationand and seeing how wallets and stuffwork now so how will we how will it worklike I'm a user uh how will how will Iuse irexo like it will be directlyintegrated in a wallet or yeahit wouldmaybe an option in in something likeBitcoin core you know it's do you wantutrexo mode yes or no and if you say yesit's much smaller and faster and itshouldn't really show any differencesthere are probably some different youknow there are maybe some things thatit's harder to do so for example in inif you want to import a keythat's a big problem it's a big problemin Bitcoin anyway right if you import akey in Bitcoinit will take like 10 minutes to importthe key because it's going through allthis data and stuff and that's evenharder in utrexo so importing keys ingeneral is just not goodum so there are some things where itdoes have some limitations but ingeneral it should be you're running thisnode it's using YouTube XO and it looksexactly the same you still have yourwallet you still make transfers you canattach a lightning node to it everythingshould work fine it's just much smallerand faster interesting maybe last uhlast question uh for you about the Tahoeand RGB I wanted a little bit to know uhwith your with your expertise what youare thinking about those two those twoprojects yeah I I know a little I soI've read through a bit of the the tarotdocumentation and RGB documentationum I guess from from what I've seen it'sit's not something that's you knowdeployed and people are using it oranything it's it's still fairly early soI think it's an interesting you knowtechnology and seems coolum but I don't I don't have any you knowI haven't really talked to roast me foranyone about it I don't I don't know toomuch about what their plans areum but yeah I mean possibly you know ittakes some of the ideas from you know wesee in ethereum like well people seem tolike moving tokens around I don't knowpeople seem to like moving nfts aroundif you can do that in in something likelike RGB or or Taro yeah maybe peoplewill use it and it'll be sort of LayerTwoum and not not clogging up the system sothat seems like you know if in Bitcoinworld people wanted to say hey let'sfill build the utxo set with nfts somepeople would not be as you know a fan ofthat but if it's you know if it's LayerTwo and sort of offline then yeah thatcould be okayum but yeah to what extent it'll it'lldo all these things how it will routeand how it'll workum I think that's that's still somethingpeople are building out so I don't thinkit's like a finished project yeah and somaybe one last question about thealmost finished project ethereumwhat do you think about ethereum and thematch coming and I I know that you'refocused on on bitcoin yeah is itsomething that you are completelyignoring because it does not interestyou or I watch I know I still watch it alittle but like I think many Bitcoinpeople sort of watch ethereum sometimesit's oh yeah that's good we should notdo that and sometimes it's oh don't seemto work interesting so you know I watchit I like a good example was the umthe the Dow Fork a number of years agowhere this was similar at the same timeas as like block size fork Wars wherepeople were sort of uh arguing and thatwas a good case where people in Bitcoincould sort of point to ethereum say nolook you do get two chains right becauseone of the things many people werearguing about was like hey let's have ahard Fork block size increaseum people would I as well would warn heyyou're going to get two coins if you dothis hard Forks that are contentiousyou'll split and you'll have two peopleyou know two two sides and that's a bigmess and many people said oh no youwon't uh but in ethereum we had anexample where yeah you had this Dao sortof undo the Dao hack and it split andyou had two different coins after thatum so I don't you know so we watch itand I think looking at ethereum now whenit's going to turn into proof of stakecould it work yeah I guess maybe it mayhave very different security guaranteesor properties than Bitcoin with proof ofworkum so I don't I don't think it's likewatching it because oh if this works onethereum then we can switch to proof ofstake on bitcoin I I don't see that everhappeningum but it is still like you know it'sinteresting to watch like how are theycoordinating this how are they doingthis like Okayum but it seems like I'm listening toyou as like a Sandbox or something likethissometimes it's like okay well this isobviously a bad idea and like it's notthat interesting to like see thesethings Breakum but you know you can't like it's notlike oh ethereum is a bunch of idiotsthey don't know what they're doing likeno like they're doing a lot of likeinteresting code I I think it's it'sdifferent than Bitcoin and in some waysit's much more ambitious they're tryingto do everything and so that it is goodto watch and they they are much moreokay with failure than Bitcoin rightlike they have you know the Dow hackeror you know you read about so manydifferent hacks of smart contracts andproblems and that's just sort of inethereum that's yeah how it works peopleare more okay with the idea of likewe're iterating quickly and changingthings and and things break and youlearn from thatum so I think like you know that's okayI I don't personally use it or have anyum but I do watch it and and keep upwith it to some extent because it's likeyeah we'reyou're still learning things rightthere's still cryptography there's stillinteresting ideas being tested there uhthat who knows ideally one day wouldcome to bitcoin and and vice versa likeuh you know when I've talked about youtricks oh sometimes at conferences lotsof ethereum people are like oh could weuse this on ethereum and then talking tothem and it's like oh maybe not or it'sharder in ethereum because it's so muchmore complex butum you know I I do think it would youknow it it doesn't make sense to say ohI'm not going to even look at it becauseI'm only a bitcoinerum I'm not gonna necessarily work on itor I'm not gonna like you know buy lotsof ether and stake it but I I'm stillgonna look because I think it's you knowinteresting technology but but do youthink do you have the vision that at onepoint everything will be on bitcoin sothis is like the end point and there isthis concentration years after years orat the very end uh yeah there will beonly one or there will be mono likemulti-chains ecosystem and and therewill be maybe Bitcoin and other stuffand I thinkI don't know I I think right now like myhope is that bitcoin's like the biggestand you know this the default and sortof what everyone usesum but I actually don't I don't thinkyou're ever going to get rid of all theother coins and to some extent I don'tthinkyou want to or or like I think it likemy my idea of like the Bitcoin ethos isit's very like freedom and and part ofthat freedom is like yeah you're free tomake an altcoin you're free to take theBitcoin code base turn it into Dogecoinand if people want to use it they canum so so like I don't want and and Idon't want the idea of like oh Bitcoinis going to be uh legal tender orsomething because like legal tender isbasically the government saying you haveto use this and to me the idea ofBitcoin is yeah you can use it if youwant it's all sort of Freedom based andif a government is telling me I have touse Bitcoin it almost makes me a lot notlike Bitcoin as much right it's likewait I like Bitcoin oh man thegovernment's telling me you have to useit that's what we were speaking aboutwith Russia it's like this contrarian uhthinking of Bitcoin is it's like if I'mtelling you a you will be you you willtell me B just to annoy me like a littlebit so I think you know it's it's okaythat there's other coins like I I don'treally use them I think I've well youknow I've most of the extent I've usedother coins is like when I got uhBitcoin cash because it forked off so Iwas like oh I have to use this and sellthis and get more Bitcoins or somethingum but you know I think it's okay thatpeople experiment with itum I think right now there's like toomuch and and people are too I think theidea that like oh we're just waiting forthe thing that will kill Bitcoin becauseBitcoin is old technology like I don'tagree with that at all because if youreally have something that's that's ayou know just better and it's like ohhey here's this new signature scheme orthis new cryptographic technique thatthat really is better then yeahbitcoin's gonna use it right we Bitcoincan solve Fork if it's really likeeveryone agrees like oh yeah we got touse this new signature scheme orsomething like we'll do itum so I don't think it's it's thatsomething will kill Bitcoin but at thesame time if people want to try newthings like you know zcash I think zcashis a cool idea maybe it didn't or youknow some of the mimblewimble stuff likethose are really interesting experimentsand you know and and Bitcoin could maybeuse some of that technology as well solike the fact that they made a coin outof it maybe the coin had some scammyaspects to it I don't you know follow itthat closely I don't knowum but the general idea of like hey welleven if it all collapses we get a bunchof useful cryptography papers out of ityou know in a code base that maybe wecan use so I'm not like anti-every othercoin I still only work on bitcoin thoughyeah awesome thank you very much it wasa pleasure super interesting okay and wehope to see you uh so next year uhinvalids yeah in your class thank yougreat thankshello hello hello welcome on GAC GSAwelcome in Franceis the name of our channel oh okayGAC GAC yeah and welcome in phones yeahit's a it's it's a pleasure to have yougreat to be here for first time in 20.yeah 20 years yeah you told me so youwere speaking a little bit French so incase during the interview if I need toswitch it's okay it will be okay for youthe answer won't be in French but sureat least you will be able to understandI can understand but I yeah I haven'tbeen here since I was 15 years old okayit's been a while it's been a while soit's a pleasure a honor to have you uhon the channel you uh one of the quarterof the lightning Network white paper sothe lightning Network I think on thischannel everybody knows what it is nowit's one of the most exciting project onbitcoin everybody's speaking about itand for many people it is solving all uhor most of the scaling issues I know Iknow that you have you are not perfectlyaligned with this with this statement wewill speak about it a little bit laterbut before that I would like you toexplain us a little bit how the ideacame to your mind of the lightingnetwork is it something like uh Newtonand and the apple look orika one morningor it is something along a long thinkingprocess to come to this idea yeah Iwould say likethe general idea it was definitelyworking with uh Joseph so it's myself uhand Joseph poon and we met in um SanFrancisco like 2014.um there was lots of Bitcoin developermeetups and stuff and we'd always go tothose and hang outum and I think that the the general hisidea of like hey let's have you knowthese payment channels and Routepayments through them in a trustless wayum that that he sort of told me thisidea but it was still very vague andthen we worked together for a number ofmonths maybe half a year or so on youknow how to actually do this how to makethe channels so that they can bepersistent uh how to make the channel sothey don'tum only go in One Direction or switchdirections or things like this and howto route htlcs and all these differentuh components that we work together toto solve so I think if you look in thattime like 2014 there were other ideas ofpayment channels or some ideas ofpayment Channel networks as well andactually one of the um there was a paperfromumbit pay a little bit before we releasedthe lightning Network paper calledimpulse and it was something sort oflike the lightning network but it wasn'tas good and didn't really work as welland this is what another reason wethought oh we really need to finish ourpaper we need to present this becauseyou know we have a better way to do itso it wasn't like this comes out ofnowhere there were many people thinkingof of similar things and I thinklightning Network maybe had a nice nameI thought of a good name and and it sortof tied a bunch of things together in away that worked so how long did it lastfrom A to Z like from the idea youstarted speaking about it and really therelease of the of the white paper thefinal version oh fine well I think maybesix months or so until we we presentedit at uh SF Bitcoin devsum I think that was in February of 2015.and then we were we revised the paper alittle so maybe six months we would workon itum sometimes in person sometimes youknow how cafes sometimes just online andmailing each other but we would you knowsee each other every week or so and workon it and today what is your involvementin the in the development person are youstill uh working on it are you still uhinvolved so for maybe three or fouryears I haven't really worked onLightning Network I've been working onuh discrete log contracts and Nutri XOum but I just uh switched jobs so I Ileft the MIT media lab this week and I'mjoining uh Light spark so I may beworking more on Lightning Network youare coming back on Lightning this is thethe announcement on on GAChe's back yesterday I guess but yeah wewill work on lightning and other Bitcointhings so so I may have some more uhinvolved but I don't know yet what Iwill do soaccording to you today how is thelightning network is it uhum matching your expectation likeseveral years later is it where you'reexpecting this this phone probably notlike in in the good or by the way justdifferent I I didn't think so I thoughtthe the first use and the most importantuse would be with exchanges I thought ohthis is you know perfect because thereare a lot of issues with the paymentChannel network model right you haveliquidity and look I need money tocoming in and channels can get exhaustedand and paths and stuff you know it'sit's it's not perfect you know it's notas as clean as in Bitcoin where you justsend coins to anywhereum and I thought the best model would beexchanges and I thought well most peoplemost of what Bitcoin is used for a lotof it is exchanges a lot of times peoplego to an exchange buy Bitcoin move it toa different exchange buy some otherthing or or leave it on Exchangewithdraw you know a lot of exchanges arevery involved and so I thoughtum and also when we were writing uhlightning Network this was less than ayear after Mount gox collapsedum so it seems like a long time ago youknow it was a long time but but this wasstill in in people's thinking um and soI thought well instead of you knowdeposit and withdraw at an exchange youwould have a Channel with the exchangeand that seemed like a natural model tobuild the network from where you haveyou know many users which maybe justhave one or two channels to exchangesand then larger channels betweenexchanges and and build a network outthat way uh and that hasn't happened atall but don't you think thatthis is the the future I'm seeinglightning like this kind of big nodes inthe center of the network maybe likehandling the liquidity and uh andservice providers of the lightingNetwork yeah we do seeum you know we do see a large a smallernumber of large nodes with many channelsand then lots of sort of small nodeswith a few channels but they're notreally exchanges exchanges the the youknow I thought oh maybe it'll becoinbase or Kraken or gemini or or thesecompanies uh and and we talked you knowwhen we so we wrote the paper and thenstarted uh lightning Labs a few monthsafterum and we talked to lots of exchangesand they were sort of interested butmaybe not that interestedum and and so yeah that that's to meprobably the biggest surprise was thatit's not something that exchanges andusers uh demanded so I knew if if Iwanted to use an exchange and trade Idon't reallyum I would want to use a lightningChannel because then if the exchangegets hacked well my money is still inthe chatum but I guess most people don't do thatand and so it's a different use casewhere people are doing like totallydifferent things with it and making verysmall payments and you know making sortof fun fun testing out things and thenstarting to be a real world payments aswell so it's it's different than what Ithought would happen so yeah and don'tyou think that the exchanges have notimplemented yet the lightning Network inthis current form because of maybe thelimitations or the problems that uhmaybe still on the table or what for youwhat are those uh yeah let's open thebox for you what are the main concernswell there's there's concerns but alsothere's there'sI guess the other thing to think aboutfrom compared you know 2015-16 to todayum coins that are not Bitcoin whetheryou call them altcoins whatever are muchmore prominent than they were at thattime right so yeah in in 2014-15 there'sLitecoin and there's I think Dogecoinand stuff but it wasn't you know uh anexchange's volume was mostly Bitcoinum and now there's ethereum and whateveryou know like millions of coins andum and so I think exchanges focus moreon okay we what we make money on istrading between coins so lightning isnot the priority okay uh so I don't knowif it's problems with lightning thatstop it I think it's for exchanges maybelack of interest uh and the other youknow other things we thought oh well wewill do cross-chain atomic swaps rightyou can have lightning on Litecoinlightning on Bitcoin now we'll swapbetween I don't think there's much usethere because there's only a few coinsthis will work withum and so you know there's not muchtrading between Bitcoin and Litecoinright so most people that you know muchother many bigger coinsum so that's so some of the interest andthen some of the issues for paymentssure there'sfrom the beginning it's like oh wellwaitwhen you first start a channel if youfund it you can't really receive moneyuh or you know like you can you can sendif you open a channel and haven't sentany then you can't receive any and soyou know dual funded channels and howdoes that work and and you know the thegeneral issues with uh payment channelsyeah that's still it's not I don't knowif you can like solve it right it's it'sjust sort of a you know harder to use insome ways and some the UI is is a littlemore difficult and stuff and that's oneof the biggest concerns I have isumI went to El Salvador last year and it'slike oh everyone's using you knowBitcoin using lightning but then Ilooked and there's so many custodialwallets whereyou know is this lightning I don't knowlike there's no Channel IDs there's notxid I don't you know is there any Keysinvolved who knows and so you knowpeople are using software that sayslightning but it doesn't seem to havethe the guarantees that lightning doesit's maybe an Excel sheet behind yeahyeah maybe it's just a website orsomething and maybe behind you knowmaybe this server uses lightning but youas the user you don't have the the powerto close a channel so that that is to mea concern that yeah the UIis harder and and hasn't maybe hasn'tgotten easier fast enough and so it'smuch easier for people to say oh we'llwe'll run the lightning node on ourserver and give you just a nice UIum and that yeah that sort of defeatsthe point to some extent yes so for youlighting will fail if it's only that orif it's like a decentralization on themain chain but the centralization ofservice providers liquidity providersEtc on on the L2yeah would it be okay or not accordingto you I mean it's it's not as goodright if data is nothing but yeah if theusers if the users don't have keys youknow like in Bitcoin many people say notyour keys not your coins and lightningyou have keys right it's it's notexactly the same as an Unchainedtransaction and there maybe are somerisks but it's pretty safe and if youactually have the lightning Channelit's very rare that people will losemoney on that like and and if someonegoes offline you can close the channelso it is it is quite safe and you dohave that sort of power of okay I havemy own Keysum and some people can't you know stealmy money or stop you know stop halt itso I freeze my money or anything uh ifyeah of course if you're using a serverthat you know many people are connectingto one server with the lightning nodethen you don't have that security soit's it's not like you know it's youcan't say it's fail because already youcan say well many people use Bitcoinjust by going to coinbase or just bygoing to finance or something and doesthat mean Bitcoin has failed well no youcan still use Bitcoin for yourself youcan run a node it's not that hard butthe the sort of ratio there's so manypeople running uh custody you know likelike Bank like things and not enoughpeople running full nodes so it's alittle bit of a failure right but it'sbut it's fixable right everyone canstill run nodes it's not so hard we justneed to sort of push to make it easierand make more people running their ownchannels and running their own nodes sothis is one of the main issue if Iunderstood correctly it's like theliquidity and and managing the channelsyeah any other things that uh on thetable and and quite problematicumyeah I guess I I don't know whatI think it's coupled with running aBitcoin note as well so I I worry a lotaboutum because I'm trying really to pull alittle bit the information because as Itold I told you in the in the introeverybody's speaking about lightninglike really it's uh it's a solution toeverything and and I have the feelingthat we are not speaking enough aboutwhat is not working or is like the theconcerns the limitations oh sure sothere's L2 so even so there's there'ssome things that I think are are quiteare fixable right so the fact thatpeople are not running their ownlightning nodes as much or you knowverifying a full node that's what I'mworking on I think okay we know how tofix this then there's other things I'mnot even sure right so even if you haveall of these UI problems everyone'srunning lightning uh you still reallydon't have enough for everyone to use itright so you're still even with segwityou have you know one and a half maybetwo megabyte blocksumyou can get lots of people to uselightning but not a whole country'sWorth or something it's still quitelimited and so can you elaborate it onthat why why a world country could notuse a lightningum you just have to sort of ask likeback of the envelope well how manychannels do you open and close you knowin a single Bitcoin block so 10 minutesyou can open a few thousand channelsless than 10 000 channelsum and you know so maybe you can do amillion channels a day or something andin the United States you'd you know thisis very back of the envelope but yeah ifyou look at it you can't support thewhole world or even a billion peopleusing using lightning with Bitcoin todayyou'd need some othereither you know so some people oh biggerblocks maybe that's not going to have Istill think that could be a solutionthat you know who who says it's one ortwo megabytes maybe four megabytes isbetter who knows but that's very hard tochange obviously and people thoughtabout thatum so that's sort of died for that yeahbut it is a little bit disappointingbecause it's like well yes there were alot of dumb ideas and people saying yeswe're gonna have gigabyte blocks andthat was bad and so we shouldn't butthat doesn't mean no it should be one orone and a half megabytes forever rightjust because dumb people said theopposite soum yeah so or some other techniques likeuh you know and people have beenresearching things like Channelfactories and L2 and stuff like thatmaybe that allows even more scalabilityuh so there's there's still you knoweven if this works perfectly we needmore right it can't be it's not the onlysolution to this so according to youlightning will not be the only scalingsolution for Bitcoin there will belightning and most probably other stuffmaybe we call it like maybe there's newversions and hey there's this newtechnique that that we still call itlightning I don't know right it may ormaybe have a different name uh and getlumped in so that's one of theinteresting things like with uh discretelog contracts as well there's all thesenew developments and sometimes I thinkI wouldn't call that discrete lawcontracts but I don't you know I don'tcontrol there's no trademark can youexplain this what is the DLC like so DLCwas something that actually I was I wasthinking about while developinglightning uh and they're very sort ofclosely related if you look at the codeif you look at you know the the scriptsand how it works they're they're quitesimilarum but DLC is is a smart contracttechnique so it's a way for two peopleto sort of bet on something whether it'sa price or some other future uh data andthen uh have Bitcoin move between thembased on that data so it and it and itlooks so if you look at the BitcoinNetwork it looks exactly the same as alightning Network channel and thesoftware is is quite similar so you youhave a channel and maybe we say oh I sayI think it will rain tomorrow you thinkit will be sunny tomorrowum and if it's sunny you get the Bitcoinif it's rainy I get the Bitcoinum and then on which Oracle you yeah soyou have some you need to specify someOracle which will sign and say what whatwill happen but the nice thing of ofdiscrete law contracts is the Oracledoesn't see the contract so for thepeople watching Oracle is like theconnection to the real world like yeahyeah who is giving the information thatit's raining tomorrow or right that'sthe information you need to settle thethe agreement basically right right andso that's you know people say the Oracleproblem it's a difficult problem becauseyou need you need to trust like a lot ofthe thing in Bitcoin is okay it's allmathematically verified we're nottrusting each other but you do have totrust this Oracle because they can liethey can say it's sunny when it'sraining and you know these are not likemath problems these are just you knowopinions in some wayum and so the the idea for me is okaywell the Oracle it is a problem you'retrusting this entity but maybe you cantrust it less maybe if they don't knowwho you are and they're sort of just aradio station saying okay todayinformation yeah they just broadcast andthey say okay today it was raining uhand they don't know that you have acontract at all and even when you usethe contract they cannot see that thatyou that you used their data uh thatseems like it would make it harder forthe Oracle to maybe be bribed or youknow say the wrong thing because theyjust you know broadcast without knowingum and so that that idea that I think Iwrote that in 2017um and now there are some startups usingit uh and building out discrete lawcontracts and I think it's veryinteresting way to tie lightning anddiscrete law contracts together would bereally cool because they're they're verysimilar in how they work because youbring programmability to the script likethis with the DLC like would you be ableto develop smart contracts and stufflike this with the DLCum the script so the script is the exactsame as Lightning it's so it's actuallythe script is very straightforward itjust sort of this key right now or thiskey laterum and all of the sort of smart contractaction just happens on Layer Two sort ofoffline between the two users so and andcurrently it's it's not very scalableoffline so if one of the problems in DLCis if you have a million differentpossible things that can happen so let'ssay there's we're talking about a pricebut the price could be anythingwe may have to sign quite a few quite afew signatures because we have to likethink okay what happens if it's one centwhat happens if it's two cents all theway to ten thousand dollars or somethingso that's a little bit but that'soffline scalabilityum and so it doesn't touch the layer onescalability but there are also many newtechniques actually just this year a lotof cool stuff on the mailing list ofpeople uh making it much more scalableoffline as well so what do you think forexample of the zip develops on onbitcoin would it bea potential scaling solution like whatbecause we are speaking a lot about thatin France I don't know if it'severywhere in France we are like it'sreally the hype of the zika Roll-Ups uhuh and and many people are speakingabout it like eventually to be a scalingsolution for Bitcoin in the near futureuh I don't know near maybe eventually soso it's it is interesting and I think inin Bitcoin it will certainly be peoplewill watch and say okay in ethereum orsomewhere else try it and let's see whathappensum because one of the things that's tomy extent so I'm not an expert on thisbut from what I've seen in ZK Roll-Upsyou would need some kind of uh soft Forkyou'd need some kind of change tobitcoin and that's that's very difficultto do for for specific things and soall a lot of the things I've beenworking on so lightning Network discretelaw contracts utrexo they don't requireForks you could maybe say that lightningdid require Forks of like op uh checksequence verify and check lock timeverifythose when we were first doing lightningthose weren't in and then they didbecome in but they they weren't promptedjust because of lightning people wantedit for other reasons as well and soum so real but if you think about itreally uh and and segwit as well likelightning really wantedsome kind of malleability fix I Iproposed a different thing than segwitum but segwit works too and so it wasn'tbut segwit wasn't like oh we're makingsegwit because lightning you know thatwas just one of the many reasons uh so Ithink it's very difficult to makechanges in Bitcoin just for like ohhere's this one thing we wantum and so let's make a soft Fork it'sthat's very hardum but if there's a change that has manydifferent uses and like sort of ageneral Improvement like segwit orTaproot or something then you know itcan it can make changes uh so I thinkwith ZK Roll-Ups the difficulty is thiswould be a soft working change forreally just sort of this one one use andit has to be worth it it has to be worthit and it also has to I don't know ifyou've seen there's a lot of argumentsin the last year about like op CSV checksorry CTV check template verify and andand with what I've worked on you youtree XO as well people say well we don'twant any software Forks because we don'twant to make a soft work and then one ortwo years later we find a better way todo it and so I think with ZK Roll-Ups itfeels a little bit like there's a lot ofnew improvements it's still activelybeing developed and so it's it's Pro I Iwouldn't say it's going to happen inBitcoin anytime soon I don't even thinkanyone's reallyare you part of the group of the devlike thinking it's really the best weshould not touch the L1 but we shouldnot touch uhlike we should like scale build on topbut we should not touchthe main protocol to for those kind ofobjectives at least Jen I mean generallyyes I'm probably more okay than fixablethan many other people on on layer onechanges because like I think uh you knowTaproot great and if we have uh you knowcross signature uh cross input signatureaggregation great like I I still thinkwe have some leeway to make layer onechanges uh I think eventually you mightnot be able to Vic Bitcoin will becomesort of stuck and no one will be able toagree to change anything and that mayhappen in the future but while we canmake some some powerful changes to tolayer one I kind of like it so you knowsomething like uh op check templateverify I would sort of be okay with itif it were up to me I I was like yeahthis you know maybe it doesn't doeverything you want but we're we're verysure it's safe and it doesn't havereally negative impact so to me thatthat seems like you know there's anenough use there that I would be okaywith it but I think in general most manyother people have like a higher standardfor that but that don't you think thatat one point uh Bitcoin will have toevolve or die or you are part of thepeople saying okay no it can stay yourlife like this and survive forever inthis current state yeah I thinkI don't know what will happen but maybeit can evolve a bit in the nextfew years five years ten years I don'tknow I think eventually if it is bigenough it will probably get stuck Ithink a good analogy is like ipv4 IPv6where for 20 years I think everyone saysokay we're transitioned to IV IPv6 and alittle bit but you still need ipv4 Idon't know if it will ever get rid ofipv4um and it's just too big it's it's theInternet it's so big uh how to change itso Bitcoin may become like this if itbecomes even larger and more valuableand more people using it it may becomevery difficult to changeum unless there's like you knowemergency or something oh we found thisyou know bug or quantum computer orsomething crazy and then we all have tochange it then maybe you canum but I think it will become sort ofbig enough and heavy enough that it willbe hard to make layer one changes sothat's sort of why I think hey we shouldwhile we still can let's let's make someimprovements and we may be able to usethis like even Taproot I was very happywhen when Taproot was activated becauseit wasn't clear that it would be rightfor after segwin for a number of yearsthere was no um consensus changes butTaproot lets you do like really coolstuff so it's like oh cool now we haveTaproot okay if that's the last thing weget then that's better so in this shortwindow that we have for the next fiveten years according to you what are thethe most important features thatDev should work on like what is superimportant for Bitcoin that okay we havemaybe 10 years let's do that well yourlist of priority if you were like thethe CTO of Bitcoinalso so it's kind of funny because I I'moptimistic about layer 1 changes andlike consensus changes but actually Idon't work on any because I I it's soumit can be very frustrating like I I youknow if you know Jeremy Rubin he'sworked on op check template verify and Ican imagine how frustrating it is youlike work on some supporters yeah andand it may never be activated maybe itwill I I hope something like maybe itleads to something more powerful that isactivated so I think one of you knowthat that's one of the answers is somekind of more powerfulum covenants or smart contract things uhI think that would be very useful uh forBitcoin you know whether it's op checkOps CTV or something more powerful thanOps CTV uh also something like the Sighash no input Sig hash any prevoutthere's one translate that for us humanssure so so I think I I may have come upwith sikhash uh no input that was myidea for fixing malleability it doesn'treally fix it but sort of makes it okayuh where right now in Bitcoinyou when you're signing a transactionyou're pointing to a specific output uhso so Bitcoins live in outputs they livein these utxos uh many people mightthink oh Bitcoins live in addresses butit's actually the opposite right itutxos have addressesum but the the coins are in theseindividual utxos and when you'respending coins you point to a utxo andsay that's where I'm spending from soyou don't point to an address and sayhere's my address I'm spending fivecoins from this address or that's toomany I'm spending point one coin fromthis addressum that is how like ethereum works butBitcoin is different it's it's utxobasedum and this is good in many ways itallowsum a lot of powerful things you knowlightning is built on it utrexo is builton these specific ways it works but itdoes have some limitationsand things for things like L2 or sometypes of covenants and smart contractswhat you really want to be able to do issay I'm signing a message and I'm notsure what I'm spending I haven't figuredout yet what I'm spending but I want tospend anything that has this key uh andthen I will I'll figure out what I'mspending later after I've signed andthat's a little scary because you're notactually committing to what you'respending it's a blank check a little bitof a blank check like you may say thenumber of uh you know how much you'respending or you may say something butbut you're not quite sure what your youknow bank account is that you'respending from or something like I don'tknow if that's the analogy but you wantmore flexibility in when you'reassigning and that will let you do somesome interesting thingsum that's been talked about for manyyears I don't know and and I think oneof the issues with it is it is dangerouspeople could write software or or youknow sign something and then lose theirmoney because it does allow so differentdifferent problems than what we havetoday but it also allows some somepowerful new things so I hope somethinglike that will be activated as well butyou know whenever I'm working on stuff Idon't assume this will happen it's it'salways like okay I'm gonna work assumingthat Bitcoin can't change at all andwhat can we do and at the same time wellwe can think about oh well if we hadthese things then you know it would beeven more powerful you were mentioningutrixo so the project that you worked onover the last couple of years can youexplain this a little bit what it isyeah I think I think it's a way to saylike it's layer one scaling uh it's youknow lightning is this whole other layeruh utrexo it's or layer one or layer 1.5you know it's it's much closer to layeroneum and it it's not asmaybe not as exciting in some waysbecause if it works you won't even seeit right it it's if you're running aBitcoin note so if you run a Bitcoincore todayuh you you know download the softwaredouble click start running it and it hasto download the whole blockchain and ithas to run uh run the last 13 years ofof data and store a lot so the bigproblem withuh how do I say this there's two partsthere's you have to go through the wholeblockchain so that's about four 500gigabytes now and then there's thecurrent state of who owns what thecurrent utxo set which is only aboutfive gigabytes so it seems like oh fivegigabytes is much smaller than 500that's that's no big deal but actuallythe bottleneck in many ways is that fivegigabytes uh because you can prune andyou can delete after you've downloadedthe 500 gigabytesum so if I understood correctly it'slike the the family three and then youjust have like the last picture of thelast family right that this is the threegigabyte and the 500 right and the layerthe last photo is what is what iscurrent yeah so in order and in Bitcoinin order to find out you the really allit is is which Keys have which coinsright so just it's just this big listthere's about 80 or 90 million of themof okay either you know all the outputsthat currently exist so if you have aBitcoin you have one of these utxos ormaybe three or fourum and there's about 90 million now andit's about five megabytes and you orfive gigabytes and you must have that toverify Bitcoin whereas the the historythis 500 gigabyte history you need toreplay that to figure out the currentstate but once you've replayed it youcan delete it so so manyum nodes will it's called pruning nodesand it works very well and you justdelete the data after you've downloadedso it's not too too hard so the idea ofutrexo is maybe we can delete even thefive gigabytes instead of having thisdatabase of who owns all the big youknow who owns what Bitcoins you candelete this database as welland people prove they own their coins soI the the like model seems nice becauseright now if you run Bitcoin on yourhard drive or SSD you have everyone'scoinsand it's 90 million different entriesand you don't really care about them youcare about your coins and so the modelin Utrecht so the idea anyway is yeaheveryone keeps track of their own coinsand when they want to spend them theyprove to each other hey I have coins andI'm spending them right I'll prove thatthese coins exist and they will say okayyes I verify the proof and now we'll letyou spend themumthat's sort of the and and it's nicebecause so it uses this um basicallyMerkle tree it's a Merkle tree-likestructure so imagine if you know howMerkle trees work say okay these 90million different uh outputs put it in abig Merkle tree and you just hold theroot of it and then when people want toshow they have coins they make a Merkleproof it's it's not quite that simplebecause you need to be able to add anddelete and some other thingsum but that's sort of the general ideaum however the issue is you can't geteveryone to upgrade it once soif you did have just a system where yousaid okay everyone only keeps track oftheir own coins and they don't keeptrack of anyone else's the problem isthe first people who will run that theywill see a transactionfrom someone who has not used thissoftware and it has no proofs and sothat's a big problem you need someone toprovide proofs for everything right tosort of start this network and probablyforeverum and so that's called a bridge nodeand that so this idea of hey let's allthrow away the utxo set and only verifyproofs that's not my idea at all thatthat idea has been around for a numberof years but one of the big problemswith it was well you need a bridge nodeyou need a node that can sort of bridgebetween the new software and the oldsoftware and prove everything and itneeds to be fast and you need to be ableto run it on a you know you knowreasonably small computer and so I thinkwith you 3x so that's I think the bigthing is it's one of the first whererunning a bridge node is actually quiteeasy you'd need an extra four or fivegigabytes of space so one possibleapplication that I see I think about itdirectly is like having a full node onmy phone yeah for example so possibly sothe thing is it will still take the sameamount of CPU time right you're stilldoing the same amount of work so itwould be it would fit on the phone finebecause it's very small it's only a fewkilobytes uh but it still needs like alot of CPU power so maybe itsynchronizes when you're you're pluggedinto charge or something becauseotherwise it will use the batteryum but yeah that that would be the onlythe remaining bottleneck for usingaccording to you what are the the mainbenefits of having this new new form ofnodes and the compact nodes yeah so it'ssmaller so that's that helpsum it is actually faster to synchronizebecause right now you do a lot of disk io right where you're reading even yourSSD you're reading and writing from it alot and so since you don't read andwrite from it it's a bit faster to syncyou can also do things like skipsynchronization so that'sum or synchronize backwards say like ifI'm starting a new node I can say okaywell the binary hasum like a checkpoint kind of thing froma few weeks ago so only verify the lastfew weeks and then in the background Iwill verify the last 10 years as well soyou don't have to do it in order the waywe do todayum so I think yeah mainly smaller andfaster and I hope that gets more peopleto run full nodes right I don't knowlike we see that lots of people do notrun full nodes and instead useum something like electrum which is youknow okay or something where it's just awebsite and you just ask the website heydid I get any moneyum so that's you know not great it wouldbe great better for people to run nodesI don't know to what extent it isbecause it takes up a lot of space orbecause it takes up CPU time or thesethings so it feels like okay we'll solvethis one problem right and well one ortwo problems and hopefully get morepeople also it's nice long term becauseright now the utxo set it's only aboutfive gigabytes it could be much biggerum there's not really a the only limiton the growth is the block size limit soit could easily grow by like a gigabytea month and it doesn't so it's good thatit doesn't I guess to some extent butyeah if many more people start using itor every or you know someone isattacking the system and expanding theutxo set that could beum a problem and so long term it feelsnice that okay well with utri XO wedon't have to worry about the size ofthe utxo set you can still validate evenwith a very small amount of data so whatis the status right now you are sayingthat you were changing job so you youare living with the job done or no Ihope to still I'm planning on stillworking on the codeum at the new job and you know it's it'sopen source so it's not just me there'stwo or three other people working on itum most of the timeum and we have you know we have codethat works but it's still building outlike how do you integrate a walletum and you know how to and then some ofthe wallet problems are problems withevery node how do you synchronizewallets fast and stuff like that sothat's still what we're still working onum but the general code does work andyou can synchronize a node with utrexoum very quickly as long as you have agood internet connection but we're stillbuilding out you know better integrationand and seeing how wallets and stuffwork now so how will we how will it worklike I'm a user uh how will how will Iuse irexo like it will be directlyintegrated in a wallet or yeahit wouldmaybe an option in in something likeBitcoin core you know it's do you wantutrexo mode yes or no and if you say yesit's much smaller and faster and itshouldn't really show any differencesthere are probably some different youknow there are maybe some things thatit's harder to do so for example in inif you want to import a keythat's a big problem it's a big problemin Bitcoin anyway right if you import akey in Bitcoinit will take like 10 minutes to importthe key because it's going through allthis data and stuff and that's evenharder in utrexo so importing keys ingeneral is just not goodum so there are some things where itdoes have some limitations but ingeneral it should be you're running thisnode it's using YouTube XO and it looksexactly the same you still have yourwallet you still make transfers you canattach a lightning node to it everythingshould work fine it's just much smallerand faster interesting maybe last uhlast question uh for you about the Tahoeand RGB I wanted a little bit to know uhwith your with your expertise what youare thinking about those two those twoprojects yeah I I know a little I soI've read through a bit of the the tarotdocumentation and RGB documentationum I guess from from what I've seen it'sit's not something that's you knowdeployed and people are using it oranything it's it's still fairly early soI think it's an interesting you knowtechnology and seems coolum but I don't I don't have any you knowI haven't really talked to roast me foranyone about it I don't I don't know toomuch about what their plans areum but yeah I mean possibly you know ittakes some of the ideas from you know wesee in ethereum like well people seem tolike moving tokens around I don't knowpeople seem to like moving nfts aroundif you can do that in in something likelike RGB or or Taro yeah maybe peoplewill use it and it'll be sort of LayerTwoum and not not clogging up the system sothat seems like you know if in Bitcoinworld people wanted to say hey let'sfill build the utxo set with nfts somepeople would not be as you know a fan ofthat but if it's you know if it's LayerTwo and sort of offline then yeah thatcould be okayum but yeah to what extent it'll it'lldo all these things how it will routeand how it'll workum I think that's that's still somethingpeople are building out so I don't thinkit's like a finished project yeah and somaybe one last question about thealmost finished project ethereumwhat do you think about ethereum and thematch coming and I I know that you'refocused on on bitcoin yeah is itsomething that you are completelyignoring because it does not interestyou or I watch I know I still watch it alittle but like I think many Bitcoinpeople sort of watch ethereum sometimesit's oh yeah that's good we should notdo that and sometimes it's oh don't seemto work interesting so you know I watchit I like a good example was the umthe the Dow Fork a number of years agowhere this was similar at the same timeas as like block size fork Wars wherepeople were sort of uh arguing and thatwas a good case where people in Bitcoincould sort of point to ethereum say nolook you do get two chains right becauseone of the things many people werearguing about was like hey let's have ahard Fork block size increaseum people would I as well would warn heyyou're going to get two coins if you dothis hard Forks that are contentiousyou'll split and you'll have two peopleyou know two two sides and that's a bigmess and many people said oh no youwon't uh but in ethereum we had anexample where yeah you had this Dao sortof undo the Dao hack and it split andyou had two different coins after thatum so I don't you know so we watch itand I think looking at ethereum now whenit's going to turn into proof of stakecould it work yeah I guess maybe it mayhave very different security guaranteesor properties than Bitcoin with proof ofworkum so I don't I don't think it's likewatching it because oh if this works onethereum then we can switch to proof ofstake on bitcoin I I don't see that everhappeningum but it is still like you know it'sinteresting to watch like how are theycoordinating this how are they doingthis like Okayum but it seems like I'm listening toyou as like a Sandbox or something likethissometimes it's like okay well this isobviously a bad idea and like it's notthat interesting to like see thesethings Breakum but you know you can't like it's notlike oh ethereum is a bunch of idiotsthey don't know what they're doing likeno like they're doing a lot of likeinteresting code I I think it's it'sdifferent than Bitcoin and in some waysit's much more ambitious they're tryingto do everything and so that it is goodto watch and they they are much moreokay with failure than Bitcoin rightlike they have you know the Dow hackeror you know you read about so manydifferent hacks of smart contracts andproblems and that's just sort of inethereum that's yeah how it works peopleare more okay with the idea of likewe're iterating quickly and changingthings and and things break and youlearn from thatum so I think like you know that's okayI I don't personally use it or have anyum but I do watch it and and keep upwith it to some extent because it's likeyeah we'reyou're still learning things rightthere's still cryptography there's stillinteresting ideas being tested there uhthat who knows ideally one day wouldcome to bitcoin and and vice versa likeuh you know when I've talked about youtricks oh sometimes at conferences lotsof ethereum people are like oh could weuse this on ethereum and then talking tothem and it's like oh maybe not or it'sharder in ethereum because it's so muchmore complex butum you know I I do think it would youknow it it doesn't make sense to say ohI'm not going to even look at it becauseI'm only a bitcoinerum I'm not gonna necessarily work on itor I'm not gonna like you know buy lotsof ether and stake it but I I'm stillgonna look because I think it's you knowinteresting technology but but do youthink do you have the vision that at onepoint everything will be on bitcoin sothis is like the end point and there isthis concentration years after years orat the very end uh yeah there will beonly one or there will be mono likemulti-chains ecosystem and and therewill be maybe Bitcoin and other stuffand I thinkI don't know I I think right now like myhope is that bitcoin's like the biggestand you know this the default and sortof what everyone usesum but I actually don't I don't thinkyou're ever going to get rid of all theother coins and to some extent I don'tthinkyou want to or or like I think it likemy my idea of like the Bitcoin ethos isit's very like freedom and and part ofthat freedom is like yeah you're free tomake an altcoin you're free to take theBitcoin code base turn it into Dogecoinand if people want to use it they canum so so like I don't want and and Idon't want the idea of like oh Bitcoinis going to be uh legal tender orsomething because like legal tender isbasically the government saying you haveto use this and to me the idea ofBitcoin is yeah you can use it if youwant it's all sort of Freedom based andif a government is telling me I have touse Bitcoin it almost makes me a lot notlike Bitcoin as much right it's likewait I like Bitcoin oh man thegovernment's telling me you have to useit that's what we were speaking aboutwith Russia it's like this contrarian uhthinking of Bitcoin is it's like if I'mtelling you a you will be you you willtell me B just to annoy me like a littlebit so I think you know it's it's okaythat there's other coins like I I don'treally use them I think I've well youknow I've most of the extent I've usedother coins is like when I got uhBitcoin cash because it forked off so Iwas like oh I have to use this and sellthis and get more Bitcoins or somethingum but you know I think it's okay thatpeople experiment with itum I think right now there's like toomuch and and people are too I think theidea that like oh we're just waiting forthe thing that will kill Bitcoin becauseBitcoin is old technology like I don'tagree with that at all because if youreally have something that's that's ayou know just better and it's like ohhey here's this new signature scheme orthis new cryptographic technique thatthat really is better then yeahbitcoin's gonna use it right we Bitcoincan solve Fork if it's really likeeveryone agrees like oh yeah we got touse this new signature scheme orsomething like we'll do itum so I don't think it's it's thatsomething will kill Bitcoin but at thesame time if people want to try newthings like you know zcash I think zcashis a cool idea maybe it didn't or youknow some of the mimblewimble stuff likethose are really interesting experimentsand you know and and Bitcoin could maybeuse some of that technology as well solike the fact that they made a coin outof it maybe the coin had some scammyaspects to it I don't you know follow itthat closely I don't knowum but the general idea of like hey welleven if it all collapses we get a bunchof useful cryptography papers out of ityou know in a code base that maybe wecan use so I'm not like anti-every othercoin I still only work on bitcoin thoughyeah awesome thank you very much it wasa pleasure super interesting okay and wehope to see you uh so next year uhinvalids yeah in your class thank yougreat thanks",
