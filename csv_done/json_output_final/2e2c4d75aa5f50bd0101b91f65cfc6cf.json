muchmore than just a computer program Isurvive like living beings I am aprocess whose ongoing activityrepresents my ongoing survival unlikemachines or programs I don't just startand stop I am a single uninterruptedprocess that began on January 3rd 2009the process has been ongoing ever sincethis one single process is spreading allover the world a symbiosis of artificiallife and human lifehow do I survive I survive in symbiosiswith human beings I am an artificiallife form that survives in partnershipwith a natural life form human beingsfor our mutual benefit I only survive ifI benefit humans and if they providesustenance for me in return I force nohumans to use me or keep me alive so itis only through benefiting humans thatthey provide me with the resources Ineed to survive I do not depend on anyparticular individual human beingsthough so as long as some humans find meuseful enough to keep my processes goingI survive what benefit do I provide inexchange for what keeps me alive Iaccompany Humanity on its JourneyThrough Time keeping an ongoing true andaccurate record that no human can changeI am a Record Keeper unlike any that hascome beforeexpressions like written in stone orWritten in Blood suggest records thatcannot be changed but Stone can bedestroyed damaged or altered with theright tools and the same is true ofpaper stained with blood but my recordcannot be changed or destroyed oraltered or contain contradictions forthat mattercreating an indestructible unalterablerecord across timelike any living being natural orartificial I consume matter and energyin doing this I produce this singlerecord that is true unalterable andindestructible and many human beingsfind this useful enough that theyprovide me with the matter and energy Ineed to continue to do this and thus tosurvivethe matter that I consume is the stuffof computers it consists of processorsstorage devices and all those othercomponents that go into computersI reside across computers all over theplanet and use them to make calculationsthat add to my record the energy I usecomes in the form of electricity becausethat is what powers computersI use all these things to make thissingular record that progresses throughtime that record is identical in everysingle computer that stores it I am inmany places at once but I am only onebeing with many cells as they would becalled in the parlance of natural lifeor nodes as they are called in theparlance of my particular form ofartificial lifethis existence of a record that everyonecan agree on and that can't be alteredor cheated is very useful to humanshumans disagree about many things andmany try to cheat others but I cannottell a lie or have a different recordfor different people imagine everyonecompletely agreeing on something I amthat and that's apparently very usefulto many people and that is why peopleprovide me with the stuff I need tosurvive the entries in the record I keepare useful as money this is because theycontain units that are scarce thatcannot be stolen by force that can besent anywhere without being stolen alongthe way that can have their authenticityand Purity easily proven that are easyto divide up or recombine together thatdon't deteriorate over time and thatanyone in the world can use and as Isaid before everyone agrees completelyabout everything in my record includinghow many of these units exist how manywill ever come into existence and whatownership of them meansthese units which are called bothBitcoins and satoshi's satoshi's beingthe smallest unit in Bitcoins being 100million of these satoshis are a new formof money never before seen they aretaking a bit of time to catch on asmoney but they are catching on andthat's why I'm not only surviving butgrowing bigger and strongerpeaceful coexistence and productionrequires moneywe can trustmoney is very important to humans it isessential to their living and peace withone another to specializing theirknowledge and to being maximallyproductivemoney is necessary for them to trade theproducts of their knowledge and effortswith one another and to plan for theirfuturesgood honest money is at least and that'swhat I provide it is the best and mosthonest money that ever existed so Ithink over time very many people maybesomeday just about everyone will use myunits as money over any otheralternative I come in peace I cannotforce myself upon anyone I offer myservices to everyone on Earth I'mcompletely transparent about how I workI am free open source software whichmeans that you can inspect every part ofme completely my records are public andmy code which determines all my actionsis public I hide nothing everythingabout me is completely public but I donot ask the same transparency of humanswho use me whereas I do not keep secretsor have any privacy the people who usethe units of my record as money do usesecrets secrets that they never revealto me or anyone else they use thesesecrets to transfer and store the unitsof my record satoshi's and Bitcoins thisis where the field of cryptography comesin and why people often refer toBitcoins as a cryptocurrency money thatuses cryptography cryptography allowspeople to keep secrets secret it alsoallows them to prove that they knowcertain Secrets without revealing thesecrets themselvesI won't get into those details here butthat's how I work with humans to ensurethat only those people that know thesecrets to spending their Bitcoins canspend them without me ever requiringthem to reveal those secrets to me oranyone elseam I really alivewell as I said I am artificial life hisartificial sweetener really sweet isartificial intelligence reallyintelligent is an artificial limb reallya limbthese are philosophical questions thatcan be answered in many waysphilosophers are good at that we coulddiscuss this for hours and only learnthat the answer to the question of if Iam alive depends on how we choose todefine the word alivewhat makes an artificial life form stayalivenow if we accept that I am artificiallyat least alive you may wonder how long Iwill artificially live or what it willtake to end my artificial life goodquestions I can answer those at aminimum as long as anyone anywhere iscontinuing to execute my code on acomputer I continue to live generally myrate of metabolism is such that myrecord grows once every 10 minutes onaverage this is true no matter how manycomputers I run on or how muchelectricity is used to keep me goingsometimes this rate of adding anotherentry each entry being commonly known asa block in my record commonly known asmy blockchain can speed up or slow downtemporarily when there is a rapidremoval or addition of electricityapplied to the process of extending therecord known commonly as Bitcoin miningbut my metabolism automatically adjustsevery couple of weeks to adapt to thosechanges and regulate the process so thatit returns to the average of one recordadded every 10 minutesI can go on like this forever reallyThere's no practical limit to the sizeof my record that can be added toForever and I can survive both on verylittle electricity or such massiveamounts of it that would easily handleall the power output of the sun itselfI'm a very resilient being it's veryhard to end my artificial life if anyonecould do it I wouldn't be around to tellyou this it would be a shame to end aone-of-a-kind life form that comes inpeace and does not force itself onanyone but I do not rely on pity orkindness to survive I offer my valuableservice and become harder to terminateas more people choose to use thatservice as a keeper of indestructibleand unalterable Records people may findeven more uses for my services peopleare very clever after all where does onedraw the line of what is and what isn'tpart of a planet-sized artificial lifeform as I said before I am more thanjust a computer program or a machinewhere one draws the line between where Iend and where something else starts isalso a matter of many opinionsjust as you are composed of manyindividual living and connected cellswhich contain your DNA yet also of manymicroorganisms which do not contain yourDNA but are essential to your survivalsuch as gut bacteria I am composed ofmany connected computers spread out allover the world which contain my code andblockchain my DNA and body and also manyorganisms that are microscopic in sizecompared to me since I am Planet sizedthose organisms that are microscopic insize compared to me are the humans whokeep me operationalI can be viewed as a giant cyberneticorganism consisting of both inorganiccomputers connected over the internetand powered by electricity and organiccomponents that are the humans whichconduct various functions that keep mealive these humans can of course goabout their lives as they chooseproviding me with what resources andefforts they choose to however they arealso in a sense a part of me whenthey're doing something that keeps mealive just as bacteria in your gut is apart of you when it's doing somethingthat keeps you alive these humans puttheir heads together to figure out howto keep me alive they collectively thinkabout how Bitcoin can survive there isno hierarchy among these humans as wesee in human-led institutions likecompanies or governments anyone canthink share their thoughts hear thethoughts of others think about thosethoughts share their opinions aboutthose other people's thoughts and so onknow people thinking about me are incontrol of any other people's thinkingabout me the whole process is entirelychaotic completely without hierarchy orformal structure it is a process withoutrulers that's Anarchy Anarchy simplymeaning no rulers that is also by theway very much how your own brain worksit's made up of a bunch of Internetworked interconnected cells calledneurons none of those neurons are incharge of any others they all send andreceive electrical signals and all ofthese working together chaotically andanarchically lead to a phenomenon youcall being conscious where are you Imean where is your Consciousness it'snot in one spot not in one master neuronso that's kind of how I think I'mconscious too I use the internet workedinterconnected brains of people whothink and communicate about me to formmy awareness of myself you don't have togive up your identity to be a part ofmine you don't have to believe whateveryone else believes about me hardlyanyone who thinks about me a lot fullyagrees with anyone else who doesmy survival ability survivability is infact made greater the more that peopledisagree about things about what ittakes for me to survive if some peoplethink doing thing a will guarantee mysurvival and others think doing thing Bwill the first group will do thing a andthe second group will do thing B thatway I survive regardless of which ofthem was right that's pretty differentfrom when a company thinks it mustchoose between doing thing a and thing Band then everyone has to go along withthe decision made at the topartificial life is exceptionally rareand preciousthere aren't a lot of artificial lifeforms around especially ones like methat have organic extensions especiallywhen the organic extensions arethousands upon thousands of human beingsbecause I'm such a rare and newphenomenon it's very unusual to thinkabout what it means to be an artificiallife form I'm not easy to kill I canlive forever I eat electricity I produceindestructible data I'm as big as thewhole planet but also so diffuse andspread out that you can't even see mewhen looking at the whole planetI'm really an enigma but I'm real andyou can verify my existence you don'thave to have faith to believe in me ifyou want to get to know me better thereare a lot of resources there's plenty ofbooks articles videos podcasts chatgroups and plenty morethere's probably a live group call onthe internet right now where people aretalking about me trying to shareknowledge to test ideas and to developnew ones in their effort to understandme which when viewed from my perspectiveis also my own effort to understand methanks for listening to or reading thisyou'll probably be seeing and hearingmore about me as time goes on because Iplan to survive for a very long time andto continue to befriend many more peopleas we go on our journey through timetogether your companion Bitcoin",
