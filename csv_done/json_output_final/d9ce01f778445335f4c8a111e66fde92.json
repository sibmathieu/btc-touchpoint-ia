  "text": "[00:00:59] Preston Pysh: Hey everyone. Welcometo the show. I’m here with Tuur Demeester.Tuur, I want to start off by saying we’vebeen having these conversations for quitea few years now. I was looking back and ourfirst chat was in 2017 and I was like, ohmy God, it has been so many years already.Welcome back to the show. It is so awesomehaving you here.[00:01:17] Preston Pysh: You just come witha wealth of information. So, great to haveyou.[00:01:20] Tuur Demeester: Happy to be here.And you’re right, I mean, that’s likesix years ago. That was, that was a differenttime. Although, interestingly enough, weirdly,some of these debates are coming back now,like the block size and stuff like that. Anyway,I’m sure we can talk about it.[00:01:33] Preston Pysh: Well, that’s whereI, that’s exactly where I want to start,because yeah, I think in our first conversationwe were probably talking about how fees werehigh, how you needed to have some type ofsolution that was, you know, second layerfor immediate settlement, low fees. And herewe are back with inscriptions now happeningon the base layer and lots of people saying,oh my God, like what’s happening?[00:01:59] Preston Pysh: And you’re seeingall the OGs kind of just smirk. What are,what are your thoughts on inscriptions?[00:02:07] Tuur Demeester: This is both ofus smirking right now for the audio listeners.Yeah, I mean, and, and the nice thing is thatback then we were saying these things of like,yes, so we cannot do everything on the baselayer.[00:02:19] Tuur Demeester: It’s just howprotocols work in general. You have to engineerthese things with a particular function fora particular layer, and if you have a differentfunction, you build another layer on top.That’s how you scale. The foundations ofa building have a particular function that’snot where you’re going to hang the picture.[00:02:35] Tuur Demeester: Right. The pictureis going to be on the first floor, the secondfloor. So, but back then, the challenge wasthat the Lightning Network had been conceived,which is the, the payment layer on top ofBitcoin. Theoretically, it had been conceivedthat it wasn’t built yet, and now, six yearslater, it’s actually here.[00:02:51] Tuur Demeester: We have over 5,000Bitcoin that are circulating at massivelyrapid speeds in that lightning layer, andespecially I think that’s going to be importantfor this year, is large exchanges are startingto implement it and they’re motivated bythese high fees because they also pay a partof that and they know they can lose customersif they’re going to charge $10 per, youknow, if you, you have $50 worth of Bitcoinand we, you get a $10 withdrawal fee, that’sreally heavy. Or $20.[00:03:17] Tuur Demeester: I mean, who knowswhere it’s going to go this year. So it’sit’s a problem that is solving itself. And,but it’s true on the other hand that a lotof people have the same question. And I thinkit’s understandable because there’s alwaysa bit of an eternal September that happensin Bitcoin where there’s always newcomers.[00:03:34] Tuur Demeester: There’s alwaysnew people that need to be educated. And soit’s, it’s great that people are askingthese questions.[00:03:40] Preston Pysh: I love the exampleof not hanging the picture on the foundation,and you have so many people that are literallytrying to buy the picture and it literallyput it on the foundation of Bitcoin.[00:03:52] Preston Pysh: Talk to us aboutthe, like what inscriptions are and when thisbecame capable to even do on the base layer,because I think there’s people that hearinscriptions and they have no idea what we’reeven talking about. So give them a littlebit of context and kind of your thoughts atlarge at what this is and what it means.[00:04:11] Tuur Demeester: Actually, I’vebeen leaning back about this. I haven’tdug in deep because I felt like, you know,from the get-go, it seemed like an odd thingto do on the main layer. I do think in themain layer it can be a place for preservation.Like, you know, literally what you inscribeon the main Bitcoin blockchain could be storedfor hundreds of years.[00:04:29] Tuur Demeester: So there, thereis a, there is a, a meaning to it potentially.But I, I haven’t taken the deep dive. I,I still felt like I was a bit of a hype. Somaybe you can take my role here and, and shareus with the audience what you’ve learnedso far, and we can kind of tell us a littlebit about this.[00:04:45] Preston Pysh: Yeah, I mean, andjust in general, the intention is, is thatthe storage in each block is for transactions.[00:04:51] Preston Pysh: I don’t think thatthere was an intention for some of that storageon the base layer blocks to be used for thingsbeyond payment. But through the latest updateswith the Taproot update and SegWit and someof these other things, that there’s nowa way that you can actually inscribe datainto the base layer.[00:05:12] Preston Pysh: You’re going topay a fee to do it. And as we’re findingout, I think there’s 150 blocks or somethinglike, I mean, it’s a really high numberthat are in the queue of the mempool waitingto be. What’s the proper term I should use?Minted or found by the miners? What wouldbe the correct terminology for…[00:05:29] Tuur Demeester: Yeah, I mean maybeyou could say in inscribed or waiting to beto be broadcast, you know, broadcast on thenetwork and then inscribed in the ledger forever.And so in, in a way, it doesn’t even reallymatter what it is that the, these people arewanting to inscribe, like clearly it’s relatedto some kind of a perceived idea of scarcity.Like a, there’s, there’s a collector’svalue to having something particular inscribedin a particular block, and then you get toclaim something.[00:05:57] Tuur Demeester: I mean, peoplehave always, you know, for status sake, likepeople have built statues in the past andall kinds of things that cost money and that,that don’t have like clear utility. Otherthan to like say something about the authoror the owner. And so I think it’s actuallyreally interesting to think about the quoteunquote waste because there is an ongoingconcern that the Bitcoin block rewards aregetting less, less every four years, so, sothis is what people generally think aboutwhen they think about mining Bitcoin, is thatthere’s new bitcoins being minted and aregiven to the miners, and then on top of that,there’s transaction fees that are earnedby the miners.[00:06:37] Tuur Demeester: But for the first,I don’t know, five, 60 years, there’sso little transactions happening that therewere no fees basically. And so that was thereward. But then the concern has been, well,if this keeps going and the new Bitcoins getless and less, because we know it’s goingto stop at 21 million. So by probably in,in about 20 years from now, it’s the, thenew supply is is going to be virtually zeroalready.[00:06:59] Tuur Demeester: And so if we wouldn’tworried, like, well, how are the miners goingto keep making enough money to build thatfirewall, to keep protecting Bitcoin, to haveenough hash power and, and, and throw enoughelectricity at the network to deter attackers?And the answer is, is of course, fees, right?Transaction fees. And so you could argue thatwhen transaction fees are artificially low,say for example, in a bear market, peoplewill come up with some kind of use for themain blockchain, whatever it is, it’s ordinalsor it’s NFTs or whatever, some smart contractthat sounds funny or fancy or, or profitable.[00:07:31] Tuur Demeester: And they’ll,they’ll stick it on the blockchain and ina way they’ll clog up the, slowly the, themempool until it’s high enough. Which isthe mempool by the way, is like the queue,the queue of transactions, until finally theblocks are getting full and the fees go upagain. So in a way, you could say it’s thisself-regulating mechanism if there’s notenough naturally occurring, just very kindof pragmatic transactions that there’s otheruses that are eventually generating profitsfor the minors.[00:08:00] Tuur Demeester: So it’s an argumentto say that rather than calling this spam,and we have to fight it at all costs, we canjust be like, look, the, the block size isfixed, like blocks are never going to be morethan about four megabytes in size. And soyeah, let them throw whatever in those blocksbecause it’s going to help us fund the Bitcoinfirewall.[00:08:19] Preston Pysh: So Dylan LeClairhad a tweet yesterday that I think encapsulatesmy opinion and probably your opinion quitewell. He wrote, Bitcoin has a security budgetproblem. Fees aren’t sufficient. It needstail emissions, which is the argument thatpeople were making when the fees were toolow. Now that the fees are really high, thisis the continuation of his tweet.[00:08:42] Preston Pysh: Bitcoin has a throughputproblem. Fees are too high, it needs biggerblocks, and so then he writes, your inherentdesire for human intervention at every turnis exactly what Bitcoin solved. Please justshut up.[00:08:57] Tuur Demeester: That’s it. Likepeople should like print that on a posterand hang it on the wall or something.[00:09:02] Tuur Demeester: Or it should belike a one of those car stickers.[00:09:04] Preston Pysh: You know, Saylordid an interview and he was talking abouthow not tinkering with the base layer. Andit being so difficult to implement changesat this point in the process, at the baselayer is akin to not being able to tinkerwith the laws of physics and how everythingcan be built and constructed upon such a baselayer because people can base their developmentand base their engineering around these thingsthat are core principles.[00:09:37] Preston Pysh: That aren’t goingto be changed. And it really goes to Dylan’squote that he, that he has there. And I reallychallenge people to think about how importantthat is. Your inherent desire for human interventionat every turn is exactly what Bitcoin solves.It’s something we can build upon.[00:09:55] Tuur Demeester: Yeah. And, andthe Bitcoin’s immutability is, its bedrock.[00:09:59] Tuur Demeester: Like that is whateverything is built on. And so what you’resaying, exactly what you’re saying is Satoshiintuited this, there’s this brilliant littlethrowaway message that he wrote on the forumsback in 2010, I think, where he’s like comparingBitcoin to a boring gray metal. He’s like,imagine a boring gray metal that has likeno clear use in industry or, or technology.[00:10:24] Tuur Demeester: It’s just sittingthere. The only properties it has is thatit’s scarce and you can send it througha communications channel. Like you can sendit around digitally at very low cost. Likewhat would happen? Oh, that, you know, hewas referring to Bitcoin, right? In his mind,Bitcoin is like one of the atomic elements.[00:10:42] Tuur Demeester: It’s like a boringgray metal with fixed properties that youcan just send around the world. And so, yeah,it’s immutability and this is a learningprocess. People have to understand. They’reso used to everything being that you can engineereverything. And, and then we come from a financialparadigm where literally you want higher interestrates.[00:10:59] Tuur Demeester: We’re just goingto sit in a room and push a button, and theinterest rates are higher. Like we can, youknow, we’re like the Wizards of Oz, likethe, the man behind the curtain. Like we’reso used to having that man around. So I thinkit’s understandable that people are tryingto, whenever they’re anxious about something,they think the, the protocol needs to be tinkeredwith.[00:11:17] Preston Pysh: I was at the MicroStrategy Conference last week and I had thepleasure of having a one-on-one chat withMichael Saylor and I, I said to Michael, well,how about from like an attack standpoint withthe inscriptions? And they’re just inundatingit with endless supply of fiat. And he justkind of like smiled and he says, okay, sonow they’re incentivizing use of the LightningNetwork and everybody kind of moving to buildingthat out and loading that up with additionalchannels so that they can transact with near,you know, frictionless fees on layer two.[00:11:50] Preston Pysh: He’s like, so it’sa win. It’s a win for layer two. And I justkind of like smiled and I was like going backto things that you and I have been talkingabout for years. It just seems like everyattack made on Bitcoin is an opportunity forit to grow and expand and become strongerin the area that maybe the attacker isn’tthinking is necessary, and then it doesn’teven address the fact that these higher feesare going straight into the pockets of minersthat then are either retaining that in Bitcoinor buying more rigs to deploy in the lowestcost energy environment, or location possible.I don’t necessarily know whether the wholeinscription thing is good or bad, but wheneverI’m looking at this idea of not interveningand not messing with the code, it seems likethe build, it naturally incentivizes buildingin, in places where it needs to happen.[00:12:45] Tuur Demeester: Right. I mean,Bitcoin is an ecosystem with clear rules,and so if you put stress on an ecosystem likethat, it’s going to grow around it and,and, and creatively build around the problem.And that’s why like, it’s brilliant likethat. We have these pressures. The fees aregoing up, people are starting to get uncomfortable.[00:13:03] Tuur Demeester: That’s what givesthe impetus for people to be like, I’m goingto install a lightning wallet on my phonefor the exchanges that I’ve been like, Imean, Coinbase has been resisting it forever.The same with Binance and all the big exchangeslike the, the exchanges that have been cuttingedge, that are kind of like, you know slowerplayers and they’re probably going to winin the long run.[00:13:21] Tuur Demeester: To be honest, theyhave been implementing lighting for quitea while, like Bitfinex, Kraken, and it’s,it’s kind of like the big ones that havebeen running these casinos. They’re theones that are finally coming around now, andthat I think is closing the circle almost.I think that, you know, once these last chainsare starting to be lightning compatible, peopleare going to really experience the power oflightning.[00:13:44] Tuur Demeester: And I think youcould even make the argument that would ElSalvador have adopted Bitcoin if lightningwasn’t around? Because as far as I understand,I think Chivo was integrated with lightningso that if people wanted to buy $20 worthof Bitcoin or $10 worth of Bitcoin, it would.Maybe they had some kind of centralized, theywere like the central relay or something,but I, I think that’s important.[00:14:06] Tuur Demeester: You know, thesekind of things, they’re little steppingstones. So, yeah, and sometimes people justhave to kind of experience network effectsfor themselves. Like it, it or logarithmicevolution of things like, yeah, it’s growingat 20% a year, but they don’t think it’sfast enough. It’s like, well, let’s giveit a few years and you’ll see what thatmeans.[00:14:25] Preston Pysh: Yeah. I had a momentrecently talking about layer one versus layertwo, so, I was using Nostr, everybody’sfamiliar with basically zapping Satoshi toother people, almost like their likes, youknow, on Twitter. And I tried out Cash App,so I was using Wallet of Satoshi to use theapps and I was like, you know what?[00:14:43] Preston Pysh: Let me try out CashApp. And I used Cash App and what was so amazingto me was I went into Cash App, I bought,call it $20 worth of Bitcoin into the, intothe Cash app if I wanted to send that layerone to another wallet. You know, I just putin the, the wallet address for a layer oneBitcoin address and it just sent it.[00:15:04] Preston Pysh: But everything happeningon these Zaps on Nostr is layer two. It’simmediately settling lightning layer two.I go there and I’m zapping somebody’saccount with some SATs and I use cash appand it just immediately sent the SAT. AndI know that’s layer two, that’s that’shappening. So, It’s already completely seamlesson Cash App, whether I’m using layer oneor layer two, and I never, like, I just putthe the address for layer two in there andit’s just naturally new.[00:15:36] Preston Pysh: And if I put Layerone in there, it’s just naturally new. Andso from a user experience standpoint, theuser doesn’t even have to understand anyof that. And I can’t, I mean, this is, Idon’t know the market cap, size of CashApp and Square, but I mean it’s probablylike a 30 billion company that has implementedthis.[00:15:52] Preston Pysh: And I think they’rethe first one that I’ve come across whereit was literally just seamless. Whether, Ididn’t even have to know what I was using.I just knew I was using quote unquote Bitcoinand I could put any address in there and itjust worked.[00:16:04] Tuur Demeester: Right. Yeah. Andthis, this is the kind of stuff that is knownas like the 10 year overnight success.[00:16:09] Tuur Demeester: Like if you’vebeen in the Bitcoin ecosystem, you understandthat people have been working on lightningfor so long. But if you’re an outsider,you’re going to, all of a sudden it’slike the light is switched on. It’s like,oh, whoa. Like this is possible. Yeah. Andand, and all of a sudden all these, like,all this concern monitoring about like, Bitcoinis slow and you can only do three, three transactionsa second and it’s never going to scale.[00:16:32] Tuur Demeester: Like all that isjust going poof. Yeah. And then the same thingis happening, I don’t know if you’ve beenfollowing that, is Andrew Pool Star’s miniscript. And all the incredible new solutionsthat are opening up for Bitcoin custody andbasically smart contracts that are blowing,totally blowing out of the water.[00:16:53] Tuur Demeester: These altcoin projectsthat have been huffing and puffing that youneeded individual professor coin that is likespecially designed for smart contracts thatis just also going to go poof, and that’salso going to be part of Bitcoin’s 10 yearovernight success. Is that like, Oh, but thefear mongers were always saying like, no,no, no.[00:17:14] Tuur Demeester: Bitcoin is justsome kind of weird E gold. You can never buildcontracts on that. And then all of a sudden,here we are with, with Oros, with confidentialasset issuance. All of a sudden all the stuffthat supposedly you could only do on Altcoins,it’s right here. It’s in the Bitcoin worldand it’s nuclear proof.[00:17:32] Tuur Demeester: Like it has thatlike really solid bedrock of code that iscarefully designed, carefully, pen testedfor years so that if you built something,it’s not actually all apart. Let’s sayit’s like the Lego blocks, like, you know,it’s, it has that internal logic where youalmost can’t do it wrong. And that’s justso exciting.[00:17:51] Tuur Demeester: And that’s, that’scoming, that’s happening right now.[00:17:53] Preston Pysh: And what I’m soexcited about is if they’re trying to dothis and inscribe it into the base layer.If they do it and there’s no actual usersand there’s nobody that’s actually usingthis thing that they’re engineering, they’regoing to go bankrupt, they’re going to runoutta, they’re going to run outta money,and they’re not going to be able to affordthe fees.[00:18:11] Preston Pysh: In order to makethese inscriptions and use up the space onlayer one, I’m hopeful that it’s all justgoing to naturally like the fee, and as thefees go higher, it’s just going to naturallysolve demand for a limited scarce amount ofspace every 10 minutes. And it’s going toincentivize miners to make, continue, to makethe, the network more secure. And, yeah, Idon’t know.[00:18:37] Tuur Demeester: I mean, peoplehave made this comparison with, you know,the Bitcoin, blockchain and internationalshipping, you know, the, the, the whole ecosystemof international shipping and, and, and the,the, the format of the shipping containerand that you know, one, one Bitcoin blockyou can compare to like a big container shipand you know, there’s only so many shipsand they go pretty slow.[00:18:58] Tuur Demeester: But every blockcan contain a huge amount of data, right?And just like a, every single container cancontain all kinds of stuff, and it’s makingthe world wealthier, and it’s such a, agreat system. And like, no, we don’t wantbigger containers, right? It just tricklesdown, like people just have to slowly understandthese, these concepts.[00:19:17] Preston Pysh: Why do you thinkpeople have this urge to always step in andthink that they have to fix the base layerof Bitcoin? Because isn’t that kind of likeinherently the issue we’re talking aboutis how can we cognitively, how can we convincepeople, Hey, keep your hands off of it. Thatis truly the thing that was solved for wasthis, you know, laws of physics type.[00:19:39] Preston Pysh: Going back to thatexample, why, why do people feel like theyhave to step in and that they have to do thischange?[00:19:46] Tuur Demeester: Yeah, that’sa good question. It’s probably like, there’sprobably a multitude of like factors thatplay into that. I think one is of course,that we’ve been living in the fiat era since1913.[00:19:56] Tuur Demeester: Yes. And that there’sall these economic theories that, that aretrying to justify why we need to print money,why we need to intervene, and so in a waythat that’s just been, and also why capitalismis flawed and free trade is flawed. And sowe need all this interventionism. It’s almostbecome the norm, right?[00:20:14] Tuur Demeester: It’s, we, we’veliterally been spoonfed this stuff ever sincewe went to school. And, and you don’t evenhave to have studied economics like it’sin the newspapers. It’s, and, and everytime something goes wrong Yeah. Like the sourcerapprentice has to, has to come up with somekind of big intervention. And, and I thinknow, interestingly enough, that paradigm isrunning, running on fumes.[00:20:37] Tuur Demeester: It’s kind oflike at a dead end and, and it’s going tostart deteriorating. And you know, in placeslike Argentina, like people have been like,yeah, but I already voted for the interventionist.Like even young people, they’re like, Ivoted for Christina. Five years ago, 10 yearsago, but like everything got worse and worse.[00:20:52] Tuur Demeester: So what’s thealternative? And so I think that’s the beautifulthing, is that Bitcoin is such a constructiveproject. Like it doesn’t, it’s not, itembodies very naturally all these, all theseprinciples that I think people will, throughosmosis and, and just by handling it, theywill start learning.[00:21:08] Tuur Demeester: Learning a, a differentway of thinking, like kind of like integratingsome of the thinking that engineers naturallyhave into people’s everyday life when theythink about economics and finance and maybeeven moral things like that.[00:21:23] Preston Pysh: One final questionon this. At what point would you say maybewe need to look at a change on the base layer?[00:21:30] Preston Pysh: Would it be somethinglike the fees associated with conducting atransaction exceed that of Fed Wire and they’vebeen like this for four or five years? Isthat when we have to maybe as a community,take a closer look at what’s actually happening?Or do you think that even raising the issueis, you know, not appropriate?[00:21:51] Tuur Demeester: I once was likeflipping on Twitter and I said like one daythe cost of broadcasting a Bitcoin transactionon the, on the Bitcoin blockchain is goingto be the same as leasing a shipping container.I know that’s probably, that’s probablyout there, like that’s probably excessive.Still the principle is there, like there arecertain things that are done in the real worldon a daily basis by people who are just verydeep into a certain market, like, you know,moving a ton of physical gold, for example.[00:22:21] Tuur Demeester: That happens allthe time. And it’s just a very specializedthing, and it’s handled mostly by corporationsand those kind of things. And so if he, youknow Gregory Maxwell had a great way of, ofexplaining what the blockchain really is froma principal point of view. He said it’s,it’s basically a court system.[00:22:40] Tuur Demeester: You know, it’sa going to court to resolve disputes and courtsare expensive, you know, and, and there aremany other ways to prevent disputes, to mediatedisputes by technology or by using mediators,et cetera. And that’s the stuff that happensin the higher layers. But if, if you wantto go to the highest court, that’s goingto be the blockchain.[00:23:01] Tuur Demeester: And so, yeah, it’s,it’s, I don’t think that would be a goodenough reason. The cost of the court are toohigh. It’s like, no, no, no. We capped theamount of disputes that can be resolved every10 minutes at this. This is the cap. And soif you cannot afford to get in that pool yougot, or, or to wait long enough to get it,you know, integrated in one of the blocks,then you going to find another way.[00:23:23] Tuur Demeester: But I mean, ifyou, you, your question was like, is thereany role to maybe, you know, tinker with theblockchain, I think, or, or with the rules,the consensus rules. The only thing over theyears that I’ve encountered that I, thatwould give me pause, is if there was someif SHA-256 was somehow compromised and, and,you know, the basic cryptography was compromisedbecause of quantum computing or somethinglike that.[00:23:47] Tuur Demeester: But even then,some people I’ve talked to said that youcould probably solve it with a soft fork,which makes sense. It would. It would meanthat people who want their, it’s almostlike there’s this biblical flood, right?All of a sudden the land that we thought wassafe is not safe and we have to move to higherground.[00:24:05] Tuur Demeester: So you could dothat with a soft fork is you create a certaintype of Bitcoin UTXO that is more protectedagainst this aggressive form of computing.Something like that, or a different form ofmining, or, I’m probably not explainingit right, but it’s, it’s in that directionso that a lot of people would have to takeaction, but you would still not hard forkthe the protocol.[00:24:25] Tuur Demeester: Yeah. So, so justto be, to give a short answer, no. I haven’tfound a reason why anyone would have to hardfork Bitcoin ever.[00:24:34] Preston Pysh: You have been writingepic profound pieces for quite a while. I’mjust going to name a couple. You have an articlecalled the Bitcoin Reformation one calledBitcoin and Heavy Accumulation.[00:24:46] Preston Pysh: These were both in2017. You have another one. How to positionfor the rally in Bitcoin. This was back in2015 when the price was $200 a Bitcoin. I’mgoing to have links in the show notes to allthree of these articles so people can go backand, and read them. They are very robust.They go into a ton of detail.[00:25:04] Preston Pysh: Some of the themesthat you were writing about back then wasscalability, which we discussed on the firstpart of the show user experience, which wealso talked about with the cash app and otherwallets that are just way like insanely profoundcompared to what we were looking at back inthis period of time.[00:25:24] Preston Pysh: Regulatory issues,disrupting power structures, commitment tothis long-term vision. When you look backand you audit yourself in what you were writingabout, is there anything that you feel likeyou missed or something that you feel likeyou got really right? And I bring this upbecause we’re about to talk about your latestbehemoth of a report that just came out.[00:25:45] Preston Pysh: That’s phenomenal.And so I’m, I’m trying to kind of highlightthat to the reader as you’re just kind ofassessing and auditing yourself.[00:25:52] Tuur Demeester: When I read throughthese old reports, it’s easy to kind ofbe like, oh, I could have, you know, tweakedthis or tweaked that. But overall, I am reallyproud. I, I am, you know, I feel good aboutthe general content if I have to think aboutthat particular report.[00:26:06] Tuur Demeester: I would say I wasa bit overly optimistic about the liquid network,about how that fast that was going to be developedor side chains in general. Which is basicallysomewhere in the middle between the main chainand the Lightning network. It’s like theidea that you have a faster settlement andmore flexible settlement network.[00:26:26] Tuur Demeester: I do think thatthe conclusion was talking about the nextfive years, so we’re still within that range.Like five years from the portably, 2024. Sosome of those things could really happen.Yeah, and the financialization actually happened,like options and futures have become an importantpart of the Bitcoin project.[00:26:43] Tuur Demeester: And then I’mglad I didn’t venture too far into speculatingabout what all coins could do and the thingsthat we could see there because it’s, itis kind of by nature, such an unpredictablespace, and a lot of it plays on the what isalive at the moment, you know? Yeah. Likethese fads that come and go.[00:26:59] Tuur Demeester: And so I’m gladI did. I didn’t really pay much attentionto that.[00:27:03] Preston Pysh: Total clown wear.[00:27:06] Tuur Demeester: A lot of it, anda lot of it is, is kind of showing us whatdoesn’t work. So maybe we should be grateful.[00:27:11] Preston Pysh: Yeah, no, that’sa great point. It really is showing you whatdoesn’t work, and I think some of the technologyis, things that people can think about is,is how can you incorporate maybe some of theseideas into the base layer.[00:27:22] Preston Pysh: So that’s a greatway to look at it. Okay, so let’s talk aboutyour newest report. How many pages was this?This is like 20 pages or 25 pages or somethinglike that. So some of the themes you havein this that we can just kind of go one byone here. You say Bitcoin is on the brinkof decoupling with stocks and crypto.[00:27:42] Preston Pysh: What are you gettingat here?[00:27:45] Tuur Demeester: That’s a goodquestion. I think that the year 2021 was aculmination of, I don’t know, somethingin the air that was like peak irrationalityor something like that, or peak animal spirits,or whatever you want to call it. There wasthe, what was it called again? For marketsat large, you’re saying?[00:28:04] Tuur Demeester: Yeah, markets atlarge. So like the Wall Street bets were goingnuts, and they were going, you know, buyingshort-term options on a M C and all thesecrappy companies. And then real estate justtotally boomed and peaked. And then in the,you know, I think NFTs were also such a bigpart of that huge rally, and Bitcoin was kindof caught up in that, in that slip stream.[00:28:25] Tuur Demeester: And then what we’veseen since, like we’re only two years later,is that both those markets like crypto. Andthe stock markets, but also the bond marketsand housing, they’re all deteriorating.It’s all kind of coming down and, and itmakes sense because we had a huge rise ininflation followed by that.[00:28:44] Tuur Demeester: I think MichaelSailor had a great metaphor of like, it’slike a fighter jet that like, you know, goesdown to the earth and then goes up straightinto the air and, you know, and then the,and then the pilot loses consciousness, youknow. It’s like that’s kind of what theFed is doing to the markets kind of –[00:28:58] Preston Pysh: And the wings getripped off. Don’t forget the wings gettingripped off. He, he also included that, right?[00:29:04] Tuur Demeester: Yeah. And so thenit’s like, all right, well, so this is theeconomy, this is the 500 trillion economy,so where do we go, right? And so Bitcoin tome, is a huge part of the answer. It’s,it’s like we’ve been stuck in this theaterthat’s now actually on fire and a lot ofthe exits are starting to look really bad.[00:29:21] Tuur Demeester: You know, peopleused to flee in bonds and they used to fleein real estate and, and maybe even, you know,some of the utility stocks are not lookingso good anymore. So anyway, so that, that’smy general framework for why do I think Bitcoinis going to decouple? Basically because, andthis has been my thesis since 12 years ago,is like, if you want to position.[00:29:40] Tuur Demeester: For an economicdepression, you want to have assets that havehigh liquidity and low counterparty risk,and of course scarcity because that that speaksfor itself. And that was the big aha momentwhen I found Bitcoin is like, oh my God, thisis a depression instrument. Mm-hmm. If, ifwe’re going to have a giant wealth transferwhere the economy needs to recalibrate, becauseit’s been overinvesting and, and overextending,Bitcoin is going to be the funnel throughwhich a lot of that is going to happen.[00:30:09] Preston Pysh: One of the othermain things that you talked about in thisnew report is Bitcoin Nation State adoptionis set to become a big theme. I think everybody’swell familiar with the El Salvador, but Ithink a lot of people were looking aroundand saying, okay, so there’s one country.There’s really nobody else that’s donethis.[00:30:26] Preston Pysh: And you’re sayingat this moment in time, you think moving forward,what in the next two years that we’re goingto see a lot of other nation states startto do something similar?[00:30:36] Tuur Demeester: Yes, I think theprice will speak volumes. I think the reasonwhy there’s been a delay in adoption, becauseyou think like, oh, El Salvador is first,but they kind of announced pretty close tothe top of the market.[00:30:47] Tuur Demeester: And so then it’slike once the, the market goes sideways andit goes down a bit and there’s more skepticism.Politicians are pretty whimsical. Like they’renot going to risk their whole career on, on,you know, some high volatility, that it couldbe a bubble. They don’t really understandit. And so I think in a way it’s good thatwe had this consultation period even thoughfor some people it was brutal financiallyspeaking.[00:31:08] Tuur Demeester: Yeah, I think it’sreally good. I do think based on what I’ve,the conversations I’ve had with people thatknow a lot more about this, because they’reworking on, you know, Chivo wallet, they’reworking, they’re talking to politiciansall the time. Is that there’s still a lotof hesitation when it comes to like boldlydoing something so boldly as El Salvador.[00:31:29] Tuur Demeester: You know, he isa bit of a maverick and he is seen that way.But it, it is possible that we’ll have newmavericks being elected. You know, that’spossible. People that run on a Bitcoin ticketthat are not in power now. And then also centralbanks are starting to get really uncomfortablebecause like they’re claim to fame.[00:31:48] Tuur Demeester: The reason whythey have supposedly a strong currency ora strong position, is they have that balancesheet that has all kinds of fancy assets andit has gold and this and that. And now thoseassets, those balance sheets are deterioratinglike the bonds and, and the four x reserves,they’re all kind of declining and, and lookingvery, very shaky.[00:32:08] Tuur Demeester: And so, and thenthey’ve been investing in tech stocks, someof these, you know, central banks and I don’tknow. And so I think it makes total sensethat in the next two years we’ll have somecentral banks start putting some money inBitcoin. And also interesting, there’s alsokind of a game theoretical element at playwhere of course if you’re the first centralbank to buy, you’re going to get a lot cheaper.[00:32:30] Tuur Demeester: Bitcoins of obviously,but there’s also like politically speaking,People have noticed that the IMF has gottenreally uncomfortable about El Salvador. Yes.El Salvador being so bold and being like goingagainst IMF and, and no longer being so subservient.And so even to like, let up a little balloon,it’s like, hey, we’re thinking about adoptingBitcoin.[00:32:51] Tuur Demeester: You know, you’retalking to the IMF. It’s like, you know,maybe if we don’t like your terms, we’rejust going to switch and we’re just goingto follow El Salvador. So it doesn’t meanthey’ll do it right away, but, you know,this is starting to become like a politicalbargaining chip potentially. And the sameas with mining, right?[00:33:04] Tuur Demeester: If, if you’recut off from the world. You can be like, let’sjust build a bunch of Bitcoin mines or just,you know, have low taxes and we want to fosterBitcoin, a Bitcoin economy in our countrybecause we’re a brick, one of the brickcountries. Or you know, like, I mean it does,I don’t think it’s a coincidence thatEl Salvador adopted Bitcoin because they’relandlocked and they have huge amounts of volcanoes.[00:33:25] Tuur Demeester: I think there’sover a hundred. So there is that long-termpotential of becoming a kind of a mining powerhouse.And there’s many other countries that havethe same problem of energy. Rich, but, butkind of constrained in terms of energy transportation.[00:33:41] Preston Pysh: Speaking of countryadoption in Argentina, there’s a politicalcandidate right now who looks like he couldbe a member of the, of the Beatles, and he’spro Bitcoin.[00:33:50] Preston Pysh: I know you’re familiarwith Argentina, so what are your thoughtshere?[00:33:53] Tuur Demeester: Yeah, Javier. Yeah.Yeah. I, I am familiar, although I haven’tbeen in a long time, I, I really want to goback. I actually learned about Bitcoin in,in Buenos Air for the first time. Yeah. JavierMelay, from what I’ve seen so far is heis a economics professor.[00:34:09] Tuur Demeester: He is been teachingeconomics for over 20 years. When he was akid in the early, I think it was in the earlyeighties, he was 12 years old and there washyperinflation raging through Argentina, andhe said that when he was 12 is when he decidedhe’s going to become an economist. And andactually his, his his sideburns are probablya, a nudge to I forget his name now, but afamous general in Latin American history whokicked the Spanish out kind of likes and equivalentof Peru and Argentina and Brazil, I believe.[00:34:43] Tuur Demeester: And so young people,they, they grew up with these stories aboutthis general, and all of a sudden there’sa guy who very much looks like him. Apparentlyhe’s pulling tremendously well among theyoung people. People are saying that, youknow, likely they don’t agree with all hiseconomic ideas, because everybody’s beenraised very much in the interventionist mindset,but at least they understand that he standsfor something different.[00:35:06] Tuur Demeester: He’s been advocatingfor competing currencies. So he wants to put,allow for the dollar to just circulate freelyagain and so basically re dollarize the economyand then he’s not been critical of Bitcoinat all. When people ask him about it, he,he explains that it’s very important thatwe have private currencies and that centralbanking is a scam because it robs people the,the populace of money by means of the inflationtax.[00:35:29] Tuur Demeester: And it’s very,very interesting how millennials are so galvanizedby this new person and new movement.[00:35:35] Preston Pysh: And for people thataren’t familiar with Argentina, their inflationfor their local currency is a hundred percentannual. Right now. Bitcoin has already madenew highs in that country, in their localcurrency terms, and I recently read that theyhave cut off citizen’s ability to use appsto buy Bitcoin and basically accumulate itthrough like traditional exchanges like wehave here in the US and and abroad.[00:36:03] Preston Pysh: Yeah, I mean, it’sgetting really interesting. One of my mainconcerns on this one Tuur, if I just haveto be quite frank, is I’ve been talkinga lot about this idea that if you’re nota net producer, it’s near impossible foryou to store your savings or your retainedearnings in Bitcoin because you’re a netconsumer, right?[00:36:22] Preston Pysh: And all of thosebills and all those expenses for net consumersare often in the local currency that they’reliving in. And so why introduce the insaneamount of volatility that you get with Bitcoinwhen you’re a net consumer and you haveall these bills that need to be paid. By introducingthat volatility, sometimes you’re makingit way harder for yourself in order to completethe obligations that you’re already accumulatingliabilities on your personal balance sheet.[00:36:51] Preston Pysh: So this applies forthe individual. This applies for the business,this applies for the country. And so whenI look at a lot of these countries where theyhave really poor currencies, Argentina, youname it, like just go around the world. I’m,most countries are dealing with insane issueswith their local currencies.[00:37:09] Preston Pysh: A lot of these samecountries are net consumers. They’re notnet producers. Not all but, but a lot. Andso where I think it’s hard for these, andyou also look at these same countries andthey’re heavily influenced by the IMF andthe World Bank that just snow continues tosnowball and roll their debt so that in nominalterms, the debt just keeps getting largerand larger and literally impossible to repayas they roll into the next loan, which isan even larger amount that they have to borrowjust to have liquidity in their system.[00:37:41] Preston Pysh: And so when I lookat what’s happened in El Salvador, and heabsolutely is a maverick because they fitthat complete description that I just explained,right? And so many other countries are inthat same situation, and they’re lookingat the IMF and they’re like, okay, I canget liquidity, which will solve my short termissue.[00:37:59] Preston Pysh: I understand Bitcoinis the solution, but there’s no way forme to actually save and store this thing becauseI’m a net consumer. I’m not a net producer.So there’s kind of this quandary that’splaying out where maybe the citizens are gettingit and maybe the, the, some of those citizensare net producers and they can store theirsavings in Bitcoin, but as you go up the architectureto the business, to the country, It’s reallyhard for that to flow up just because of thesheer overreach that has occurred with theIMF and the World Bank for a lot of thesedomains that we’re talking about.[00:38:33] Preston Pysh: So I’m curiousto hear kind of not that I disagree with your,with your thesis. I think your thesis is true,and I think we are going to see more of thisin the coming years. But that’s the hurdleI guess, that I see as we’re, as we’relooking at it.[00:38:47] Tuur Demeester: I definitely thinkthat it would be wrong to completely to kindof impose Bitcoin or something like that,right?[00:38:56] Tuur Demeester: I think that whatwe want is let a thousand flowers blossomand we all speak our minds freely, and wehave competing currencies in the world, orthat the artificial tax on Bitcoin is removed,which we totally have, right? If, if you savein Bitcoin, in, in the us, you’re goingto pay capital gains tax whenever you sellyour money.[00:39:14] Tuur Demeester: It’s kind ofweird, right? You spend money, but the reasonwhy, because it’s treated as an investmentin many places. So that’s basically theonly thing you would need to do is just removethat tax and then let the economy slowly viaosmosis and, and kind of like, you know, Bitcoinis going to flow where the resistance is leasedand, and people that have low time preferenceand who have the luxury of being able to savewill be able to save some in Bitcoin.[00:39:37] Tuur Demeester: And then when there’sa big bull market, then they have the moneyto build, to build out some infrastructureand start a business. I mean, it’s. You,you’re probably familiar, the the littlerichest man in Babylon book, right? I mean,the Bitcoin is that kind of money. Well, youcan, that was the advice of the wealthiestman in Babylon is like, you just save a littlebit of your money over the long run, and thenwhen the opportunity comes around, you investedin a business.[00:39:57] Tuur Demeester: But with fiat thatis taken from you. That opportunity to builda nest egg, is it, is rug pulled from you?And, and also there’s that, you know, I,I don’t know if it’s a fair analogy, butI, I do, you know, when I, the Bitcoin reformation,I drew some analogies between organized religionand, and and money and Bitcoin.[00:40:15] Tuur Demeester: Today there issome example, right where there was a newmovement, the Protestantism was first justkind of rebelling against the church, butthen they did certain things their own way.And in continental Europe, a lot of Protestantismbecame almost like that imposed version, likewe’re going to impose the Bitcoin standardand then you’ve got a lot of conflict becauseit was either or, either you were Catholicor you were Protestant and they kind of bothbecame calcified and, and just the sourceof incredibly bloody conflicts and, and poverty.[00:40:45] Tuur Demeester: Whereas, you know,the, the, I think the stellar example of theother way was New York new you know, new Amsterdam,and then New York City, which had freedomof religion from the get-go. And it just kepton flourishing and flourishing because themarket just adjusted. And there was this generaltolerance where individuals could make theirown choices.[00:41:05] Tuur Demeester: And that’s whatI would like, let these technologies coexist.And it’s way too complicated for you andI individually to figure out what technologyneeds to be used were. I mean, that’s whatthe Soviets tried to do, right? How many tractorsdo we need in this area? I’m like, thisis impossible. We need markets to figure thosekind of things out.[00:41:24] Tuur Demeester: Amen.[00:41:25] Preston Pysh: Amen to that. Hey,this was a powerful quote in your new report,you said, generally speaking, we can expectfor economic activity to switch from emphasizingthe production of consumer goods and servicestowards goods at the very beginning of thevalue chain. Explain what you mean by this.I think this is a really profound commentand I think it can help guide people as they’retrying to navigate the chaos in these markets.[00:41:51] Preston Pysh: Kind of as a guidestoneto how to think about things from a very firstprinciples kind of way.[00:41:57] Tuur Demeester: Yeah. I’m goingto draw an analogy and it’s a very simpleone and I know a lot of people are going tosay, that’s too simplistic and it’s not.So let, let’s try and go there. Basically,we know that many economies have been livingabove their means.[00:42:12] Tuur Demeester: They’ve been,you know, getting into debt way too much becausethe interest rates were artificially low forso long. And so this is the equivalent ofhaving a family living. And they are, theyhave the opportunity to borrow as much asthey want at a half a percent interest peryear for however long they want, unlimitedtime to pay it back.[00:42:33] Tuur Demeester: So what are theygoing to do? They’re going to borrow lotsof money. On average, of course. They’regoing to borrow lots of money. They’re goingto build a pool in the backyard, all kind.They’re going to really have a lot of theirspending be focused on consuming consumerproducts, clothing, and all these nice things.And then imagine the same situation.[00:42:51] Tuur Demeester: The debt staysthe same, whatever they, they’ve accumulatedin debt. And then you’re like, oh, sorryguys. We’re changing the rules. The debtis now to be paid at 20% interest per year.Like that kind of shock is all of a suddenhappening. So how’s the spending going tochange within that family? Well, I mean, it’sgoing to be focused on just having enoughheat.[00:43:11] Tuur Demeester: Having some foodon the table, very basic foods, maybe havingsome gas for the car. They’re probably goingto sell some of their cars. They’re probablygoing to downside live in a smaller house.So I imagine that happening on almost a globalscale, like that’s what we’re talkingabout. And that’s that shift, and that’swhat Austrian econ economists talk about.[00:43:30] Tuur Demeester: When they talkabout credit expansion during the, the bullphase of the bubble, right? We, we’ve seena huge bubble accumulate over 40 years ofcredit expansion and, and all this spendingabove your means. And now the piper’s goingto be paid. And so, so just think, keep thatin the back of your head when you’re thinkingabout investing like Apple.[00:43:48] Tuur Demeester: Yeah. But it’sa great company. Yeah. Yeah. But they sellconsumer products. A lot of the NASDAQ companies,great companies, but it won’t matter ifthe consumer doesn’t have the funds to keepconsuming those products. So it’s very simple.And so then what you go back to is basicallythe market realizes we’ve been underinvestingin just simple things like pulling oil outof the ground and, and, and, you know, growinggrain and having like a store of value foryour family.[00:44:14] Tuur Demeester: Like because allof a sudden my pension fund blew up. All ofa sudden, my insurance company apparentlywas invested for 75% in bonds that are evaporating.So my insurance is not going to be worth anything.I need to self-insure. How do I do that? Hardmoney, gold, Bitcoin, those kind of basicthings. So that’s my framework going intothis depression.[00:44:34] Tuur Demeester: I think it, honestly,I think it started with the pandemic. I thinkthat’s 2020 is is kind of my marker. Andin my mind it’s like this is going to bea 10 year period where we’re going to havesome flareups and things going to look betterfor a while, and then they’ll kind of lookworse and we’ll try and muddle through.[00:44:50] Preston Pysh: You know, I thinkit’s really profound because you’re talkingabout in your example, these, these familiesat locked in rates at 0%, but it’s evenmore profound than that term because if you’re60, 65 years old or younger, all you knowis that the rates have continued to go downfor your entire life, and so there’s a cognitiveconditioning bias that everybody has thatthey can roll their debt.[00:45:17] Preston Pysh: Like let’s sayyou took out a loan for 10 years and you didn’treally pay back the principle on it. You weremaking interest payments and you need to rollit. It was always easier. To roll it at alower rate for everybody under the age of60 or 65 years old that are alive today. Thatwas their experience is I could just overconsume.[00:45:38] Preston Pysh: I don’t actuallyeven have to pay back the principle. I canjust roll it at a lower rate. And so they’vebeen totally conditioned into thinking thatthey can live in exuberance and just kindof expand their debt load for their wholelife. And then at the very, the, the icingon the cake is what you’re saying, whichis then it got down to literally like a halfa percent interest and they really loadedup and they really went out on the risk curveat the absolute worst time possible.[00:46:07] Tuur Demeester: Often at the adviceof their parents who knew the same thing,who knew the exact same thing.[00:46:11] Tuur Demeester: My parents boughttheir first house in their early twentiesin, in 1982. 14% interest rate and they’veonly ever seen it decline. Yeah. It’s exactlywhat you’re talking about. And so, yeah,you’re right. I mean we millennials, I dunnoif you’re still part of it or not, but Barely.Barely. Oh, it’s kind of like.[00:46:28] Tuur Demeester: It’s going tomean incredible, incredibly difficult adjustment.You’re totally right. There’s that mentalcost of, of making that switch. And it’salso what we’ve seen is that people whodouble down on the rolling over, they’vegotten the rewards, like all the books abouthow to get rich. We’re always about getone apartment, buy one apartment, and thenuse that as collateral to get more, and then use that as collateral.[00:46:51] Tuur Demeester: It’s like the,the sky’s the limit. And then meanwhile,if you’re like the, the prudent saver, youkind of look like a schmuck.[00:46:58] Preston Pysh: Well, yeah, therewas no way for you to, to outperform somebodywho was levered like that in a system where,you know, rolling debt just got easier and easier to to play. So, yeah.[00:47:07] Tuur Demeester: Until Bitcoin. [00:47:08] Preston Pysh: Until Bitcoin, yeah.Yeah. What an exciting time.",
