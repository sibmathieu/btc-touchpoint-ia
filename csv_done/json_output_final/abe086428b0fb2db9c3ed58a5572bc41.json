Guest today is Professor Richardlindsen Professor lindsen is anatmospheric physicist known for his workin the Dynamics of the middle atmosphereatmospheric tides and ozonephotochemistry he's published more than200 scientific papers and books onHadley circulation Monsoon meteorologyplanetary atmospheres hydrodynamicinstability mid-latitude weather Globalheat transport the water cycle ice agesand seasonal atmospheric effects from1983 Professor lindsen has been theAlfred Sloan professor of meteorology atthe Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology Professor Elizabeth joins ustoday to discuss climate alarms and hisviews on why this has become such amajor issue and why as a scientist hebelieves that this Panic is massivelyoverratedso Professor Richard thank you so muchfor joining usokay glad to be here let's begin bytalking a little bit about yourbackground in Sciences your career andhow it led you to an interest in climateand the climate debate so tell us moreabout your background and and yourscientific career really and how it gotyou here how it's a fairly long story inmany ways uh I got into this field byaccident I meanI was interested in physicsIrealized I was more interested inclassical physics than modern physicsfluid dynamics seemed like a good choiceand at the time at Harvard the peopleworking on fluid dynamics were workingon what is called geophysical fluiddynamics dynamics of the atmosphere theocean and so onand so I ended up working on that mythesis was on the interactions ofphotochemistry ozone photochemistryradiative transfer and Dynamicsso that got me into a variety of thingsand uhwhen I finished I decided that's what Ireally enjoyed the atmosphere is full ofreally good problemsand they were fun to solveand so I I stuck with that I stuck withit since 1960 butyou know the problems were cute at thattime you know you had thequasi-biennial oscillationwhich was interesting I mean above thetropics around 16 kilometers to about30.the wind blows from east to west for ayear and then turns around goes to westto east for another year roughly on theaverage 60 months 26 month periodicityand it's much stronger than the annualcycle or this semiannual the question iswhat caused that and that occupied mefor quite a while and I think we foundwhat was considered the solution to thatand then there were old problems uh LordKelvin actually uh pointed to onecuriosity with tidesthat we understood why the ocean tideswere lunar semi-diurnaland then we looked at the tides in theatmosphere and the surface pressure atthe ground and they were alsosemi-diurnal but solarbut the solar uhhorsinggravitationally is very weak it's uhthermal and the diurnal component ismuch stronger why is it semi-diurnal andKelvin suggested maybe the atmospherewas resonantand that thatcarried through the 1950s 60s and thenpeople realized that uh there had to besomething else at issue and theyrealized that forcing by ozone and so onwas very important it could account forthe semi-diurnal and then mycontribution was just to show that the24-hour component was trapped andcouldn't make it to the ground veryeffectively so it was sort of fun wecontinued working you know how doesinstability workwhy do we have these waves that uhconstitute weather in mid-latitude andso on academically you know it was agood careerI mean I started uh as a postdoc at theUniversity of Washington and Universityof OsloI went to work for the national Centerfor atmospheric research and I decidedwatching my colleagues my contemporariesthat being an assistant professor wasBad scene we've got a lot of work and uhratheruncertain futureso I you know tried to wait until I gota tenure offer and I did from theUniversity of Chicagospent about four years there came toHarvard for about another 10 11 yearssince a professorand then uh moved to MIT where I've beensinceformerly retired since uh 2013.but you know I still have an office anda secretary and occasionally see peopleso keep busy more or less there wereAwards and so on however you asked abouthow did I get involved in the climateissueand in a funny waythat was never separated from the otherthings I was doingyou know in 1990 uh at MIT no one calledthemselves a climate scientistuh you know all of us worked in aspectsof climateindeed a lot of the books or some of thebooks anyway that dealt with climatewere referring to it as the generalcirculation of the atmosphere how doesit work period to get climate per se thebooks that focused on climate focused ondifferent climate regimes in the currentEarthand there are dozensit's not as though there's a simpleclimate for the whole earth we eachworked on our specialty oceanographyMarine geochemistry meteorology so onand all of a sudden uh this became aserious issue quote politicallyand the government showed its hands soto speak it said it was all inlike a lot of things you know the Marchthrough the institutions and suddenlyfound the National Science Foundationwas all in on it the professionalsocieties were all in on it none ofthese actually represented theyrepresented large numbers but you knowlike all such organizations there's asmall groupoften hired as the executiveofficialsand they speak for the group withoutsampling itsuddenly discovered this was an issueand Ifelt there was no basis for it and it'sfunny I I wrote a pieceuh mentioning this and probablyaround 1990 sent it to Science magazinethey said they rejected it withoutreview saying uh the the essentiallythere was no interest in that Ipublished it then in the bulletin of theAmerican Meteorological Society and thatgave me the first clue that there was aproblem the editor inspired immediatelyand uhanyways there were a number of people atthat time the early 90s I would saythe bulk of meteorologistsobjected to this Mark Mills actually dida survey of people in the Americangeophysical Union AmericanMeteorological Society and a majoritydidn't go along with itbut the the pressure is built thefunding uh played a big role of coursein1992 uh you know whenClinton Gore were elected the fundingincreased substantially and it wasconditioned on accepting this as aproblem nothing was presented that uhsuggested that it was serious and indeedin the first U.N reportsand indeed in the last U.N report nobodyever spoke of it as an existentialthreat the existential threat issuearoseI would suppose largely because you knowfor the first 10 12 years of this issueit was always said you know this will besomething we will see in the future theyrealize that that had very little salespotential so they kept cranking up theuh Hysteriauntil they were telling kids it's anexistential threat you won't live foranother 12 years and so on none of thiscame from the science I meanso you know what are you going to do goalong well some people did mostscientists I would say that yeahI you know it's a tricky issue uh forinstance uh at MIT now everyone who haseven marginal uh association with thisspeaks of themselves as climatescientistsuh the work itself often doesn't supportit and a lot of young people just avoidthe topicand they've asked you know do you goalong it's possible yeah I go along ifyou look at what they go along with it'ssomething like you know adding CO2 willgive you warming and there'll be somewarming it's rarely that I think it's anexistential threat and we should dropeverything in take care of this nomatter what the ruination isso uh you know you have this unfortunatemix of uh politics and scienceuh Eisenhower warned about this long agothat you know eventually grantsuh would be more important thanachievementand you know in general the governmenthas a monopoly on the funding of sciencewhich is okay if the government doesn'thave the position the government has aposition it's devastating yeah this isuh this is a very uh common theme in mywork I'm an economist and you know youmight be curious about why is it thatpeople who are interested in Bitcoin areinterested in the climate and you knowmost guests I get in here have no ideaabout Bitcoin and no interest in it butI think it's uh it's it's entirelyrelated because the way that I see itum the current monetary system as wehave it wherein the governmentessentially gets to create money at willis at the root of the dysfunction ofplenty of scientific Fields uh climateis one of them I believe nutrition isanother I believe economics itself isanother andum these are the topics that I'd like todiscuss and the constant theme that isbrought up by people like you from manyfields is the same idea that youmentioned which isum suddenly the there was a point atwhich the funding came predominantlyfrom government and then you had to goalong or go away basically you had to asyou said these bodies becomepredominantly dominated by bureaucratsrather than the scientists and then theyno longer have to follow the scientificmethod they no longer have to engage indebate their ideas don't have to win onthe free Marketplace of ideas becausetheir funding is not dependent on beingright or being wrong their funding isdependent onsimply you know having access to thepeople who control the money printer soin a free Marketplace of ideas auniversity that promotes ideas thatdon't Concord with reality willWitnesses graduates go out and beuseless for society and they won't getpaid well and then others won't want togo to that University and then thegraduates won't want to donate to theuniversity and so the university will beat a disadvantage but when the fundingcomes from above you know when thefunding is essentially astroturfedrather than Grassroots then it doesn'tmatter how insane your conclusions areas long as you go along with what thepeople up top the people who control themoney printer the government bureaucratsthe people who control the money fundingthe NIH and the NSF and all thesegoverning bodies as long as you go alongwith their agendas then you don't haveto answer to anybody and so this is Ithink the this is at the heart of thisand so I think it's it's veryinteresting what you say that when youstarted this field you know it wasphysics and chemistry and meteorologyand all these rigorous scientific fieldsand climate on its own was not really ascience and thenum it started to be discussed as ascience as a field on its own whenum Government funding came along andwhen there was this agenda to come upwith this conclusion which is we're in acrisis and it's a disastrousexistential crisis for Humanity andunless you're taking this crisisseriously you know we can't wasteresearch funding on youyeah it's it's not quite as direct asthat but almostI mean you know there are plenty ofpeople working on things thatpotentially are reasonableimproving models and so onbut uh yeah you're right the conclusionhas to be that lots of people actuallywere interested in climate it's not asthough it was not a field it isthe reason it was not a field is it wasso interdisciplinary that nobody had allthe knowledge to deal with it I mean myfield was dynamics of the atmospheremostlyand the other people worked on radiativetransfer and other people worked onchemistry and so onand it was very difficult to coordinatethem all because nobody had all theinformation all the understandinguh if we get into the nitty-gritty Imean one of the things I mentioned toyou and the thing I suggested you readthe whole narrative was pretty bizarrewhen you considered it uh you know itwas based on a one-dimensional modelthat could not account for the varietyof climates it ignored the generalcirculation of the atmosphere where thetropics and the extra Tropics have veryseparate physicsand the interaction is pretty subtleuh there were assumptions in it I meanone question I'd ask anyone I mean youknow when you look at these graphs andthey're talking about the Earth haswarmed one degree in a centuryand if it's another half degree it'scurtainsand you know you look at it and you saythat's a very small temperature it's youknow I experience between breakfast andlunch how is this catastrophicand uh part of the answer isa very peculiar one this polaramplification and although this is verysmall it really represents very bigchanges some placesand then they say well you know usingthis metricuh ice ages and the ear scene when youhad radically different climate actuallydidn't involve more than a few degreeschange in this metricbut you knowthe metric was not due to the greenhouseeffectand so they were confusing factors andthat confusion persists through thefield they established a narrative rightoff the bat and and they did somethingthat was very subtle and it took me along time to appreciate itnamely it is true in modern discourseestablishing the narrative is veryimportantit's a major goalquestion is how do you do itand it never occurred to me untilrecently that you do it by stating thenarrative and including lots of dubiouselements in it lots of things that areobviously wrongwhy would you do that well so thatwhoever is watching it starts attackingthese thingsbut in attacking them they endorse thenarrativeand they don't discuss why the wholething is absurdthat's where we're stuck with it's amoment and you know I find that evenwith people who are in agreement with methey thought that they'd have to learnabout the Dynamics of the atmosphereis a little bit off-putting becausethat's a hard subjectI mean I don't know if you're familiarwith it but you know there's still a bigprize outmillion bucks or so for anyone who canprove that a numerical approximation tothe fluid mechanical equations Thenavier Stokes equationsactually converges to the actual answeruh it's it's that uncertain in some waysand anyone who's worked in fluidmechanics or in physics of it knows thisis a tough subject I meanthen a Heisenberg you know is saying youknow this is comparably hard to quantummechanics and we still quite how thingslike turbulence twerk yeah uh in my bookthe Fiat standard I uh I make the casethat the important thing in Fiat scienceis who gets to set the null hypothesisand then how they deter the bird toprove and this is the thing like onceyou once somebody has the ability tofinance the science then they get to setthe null hypothesis and the nullhypothesis is that we are in a climatecrisis and then the owners of proof theburden of proof is on you to try andpresent all kind ofum essentially unwinnable uh all kindsof evidence to try and win thisunwinnable war I've convincing somebodyof something where their paycheckdepends on it uh or not believing it sothe burden of proof is just the deck isstacked against you you everybody youknow there's this term everybody agreeseverybody knowsum all the the scientists degree the 97and then once you once you start withthat then that that's it likethey've decked the cards against you andthere's uh it's it's very difficult tobe able to convince them of thealternative even in 1988 when the it wasthe Senate hearing on this Al Gore andJim Hansen newsweek's covershowed the Earth on fire and thelabeling was all scientists agree thisis before most scientists working inthis area even thought about itI mean you get to choose whichscientists you include and then you saywell all the scientists that matteragree and then you just Define the onesthat matter are the ones that agree andthen there you go 100 consensus I don'tthink they bothered to do even thatthey certainly did later on you know the97uh consensus yeah you know there was apiece in the Wall Street Journal at thattimeshowing the methodology that this guycook used to come up with that numberand it was absurdmade no sense but it didn't matteruh the line was what was quoted all thetimeyeahand of course I mean the you know thethe the implication of this has justbeen now88 is a long time ago but here we are 35years later 34 years laterit's astounding the majority of youngchildren believe they are in not justyoung children young adults well youngchildren I guess for most adults todayuh they believe they're in a they're ina crisis they believe they have nofuture they believe the Earth is goingto be gone by the time they're old anduh it's it's succeeded in reallycreating this there's no other word forit hysteria where people are just soafraidyeah I you know I wonder about thatI think quote ordinary people don't takeit terribly seriouslybut you're right by indoctrinatinglittle kids who have no defensemechanism against this uh they're makingmuch more progresspolling still shows more people mostpeople do not rate this High among theirconcernsbut uh in the political sphere they actas though it does and I think it's evenworse than the EUyou have peoplewho is it is making the statement uhthat we owned the sciencewithout recognizing the peculiarity asI've often mentioned that the science isthe opposite of scienceyeah this is this is one of my favoriteuh catch phrases I always use the termthe science with a trademark sign nextto it because it's like uh it's atrademarked set of proprietaryinformation that you're not privy tobut yeah no science by definition is notbuff scienceuh it's a mode of inquiry exactly it's away of asking questions it's not a setof conclusions yeahnow it's a sad situationuh I my personal fear is the only thingthat will end it is the disastrousconsequences of the policiesand Europe is looking at that at themoment and the US will be too maybe whenthey realize it's just unviableuh they'll consider whether it was worthit yeah uh I think this is the uh thisis the sad reality of it uh but thequestion then is just how much is itgoing to take I think you look atGermany you know already you see theeconomic impact of their energy uhcrisis it's devastating but they'regetting away with blaming it on theRussian Ukrainian War as if that youknow as as if that's the real issuewhich of course it isn't because theproblem is why is Germany so reliant onRussian gas yeah and the reason for thatis that they've had 50 years of uh it'sinsane to even think of the number but500 billion dollars of investment inwind energy it's an insane insane number500 billion dollars of investment inwind energy that produces zero megawattson a day in which it's not windy whichis insane you could have doubled youcould have produced double the capacityof gas plants in Germany for that amountof money could haveyeah no we've seen this before actuallyfairly recentlyI remember some years ago I was talkingto a group of Republican congressmenand they entered the room and they saidguess what we've just doneand I said whatwe've banned the incandescent light bulbisn't that wasn't that great I saidthat's the stupidest thing I've heard along time they banned it when the onlyalternative was the compact fluorescentwhich people hatedif they had just forgotten about it andLEDs had come along you wouldn't have toban the incandescents they would competein the marketplace and be preferable formany peopleuh we did the same thing with energyeven if there were a basis for worryingabout fossil fuelswe had no alternativewe had the equivalent of the compactfluorescence or Worse the windmills andthe solar panelsand uhsince that's all we had we said that'swhat we'll useand uh you're stuck with something thatdoesn't workyeah it's it's it's amazing and um Imean eventually I think the lesson isgoing to be learned but it doesn't looklike it's going to happen soon I justsaw a couple of days ago the German uh Ithink it's the minister of economy I'mnot sure he's from the green party andhe was given a speech in which he wassaying well it was fossil fuels andnuclear power that got us into thisproblem and they're not going to get usout of this problem and we're going tocontinue toum look for the Solutions in thesustainable green renewableI like to call them swings and slidesyou have to think there's anothermotivation behind this one of theproblems of course is the size of theenergy sector it's it immense it'sfundamental foundationaland uh so anything you do there is goingto involve as you've mentioned alreadyhundreds of billions and even trillionsof dollarsanytime there's that sort ofaction going on somebody's going toprofit immensely even if it's at thecost of societyso The Temptations will be great I'veseen this at organizationsyou know I won't mention the institutionbut it's a conservativefree market uhorganization uh libertarian and theirdonors had a uh session very luxuriousveryhushand uh the donors wanted to know whythey were worrying about the climatechange issuebecause they were invested in it andthat organization quickly got out of itI think I know the organization uhyou're mentioning and um we've hadsimilar run-ins with them on monetaryissues because it's a very similar kindof dynamicum you knowI mean they they generally talk aboutmonetary Alternatives and the need forfinding alternatives to the dollar andnow that with Bitcoin we have an actualworking alternative used by millions ofpeople around the world that has savedpeople from hyperinflation uh my myselfI saved my family by using Bitcoin andgetting out of Lebanese hyperinflationso it is an alternative and it works andyou'd think they'd be all over it butyou know they've got donors who are wellinto the dollar system and soum their main focus has been on poopooing the only alternative to thedollar rather than presenting uh but youasked an interesting question before Imean you know whyare you interested in this and so on uhand it's a question that I askedbecause early in this game around 1990uh a lot of investment firms wereinviting people like me uh to discussthis issueand I was puzzled as to what they wereafterand I eventually figured out what theywere after which wasn't to find out howthe climate behavedwhat they wanted to know I think waswere the arguments against this issuesufficiently comprehensible by OrdinaryPeoplewho interfere with this issue theywanted to know where to place theirmoneyand I think they concluded they couldplace the money on the issue it was itwas not going to be overturned by peopleunderstanding the scienceforeignyeah I think the you know the um theremarkable bait and switch here is uhwas another recurring theme in ourpodcast uh you know the the theadvertising for science over the pastcouple of centuries was hey let's getout of the Dark Ages where people usedto listen to these priests and you knowthese priests would claim to be speakingto God and then they would tell you whatGod says and then you had to followbecause you're an ignorant peasant wellwe're going to snap out of that we'regoing to enter the Enlightenment and inthe enlightenment we're going to replacethat with rational thinking and we'regoing to do the scientific method whichis all experimentation well that soundsgreat and you go to school you learnabout that and you think wow that's soamazing you know those evil priests it'sso much better now that we have scienceand experimentation and then you youknow if you go along with what you learnin school in University you think that'show it works but then if you just digslightly under the surface or you knowyou move the curtain a little bit behindyou see that ultimately you're not outthere carrying out experimentationsyou're not asking scientific questionsand conclude the answer all that you'redoing is trusting Authorityum to tell you what they did on theirsigns this is true in the field ofpharmaceuticals it's true in the fieldof sciencebiological sciences it's true in climatescience it's true in economics it's truenutrition it's true in so many fieldswherein people haveum just gone back full circle totrusting what the priest says about thescience and they think that's what's thescience is this is not recentI mean you know in the 19th centuryAmerica established the Civil Serviceand the idea was that politicianscouldn't be trusted you needed expertsand uh this was the search for authorityand of course that is exactly almost theopposite of sciencethen what happened I think is sciencewas very successfulin producing all sorts of interestingthingsand so people trusted sciencethe politicians saw this as sciencehaving Authorityand that's something they desperatelywanted so there was an essential need toco-opt science so that the politicianscould share its Authority and Trustbut that was a complete misuse ofscienceyeah and I think the the Baton switchhere is the idea that it was signs thatproduced it in people's mind it's thescientific authorities that produced itso when people look at increases inliving standards and in life expectancyand reduction of diseases they think youknow a bunch of scientific authoritiessat down in a lab conducted experimentsfigured out how to think how to improvethings and then pass these edicts downto politicians who implemented them andthen we got sewage and engines and allthe Improvement in the quality of lifebut if you actually look at all of theinventions that matter that really didmake our life better primarily they'reabout the utilization of energyprimarily it's engines the steam enginethe internal combustion engine and thenyou look at how these things wereinvented they were not invented byauthorities of science they wereinvented by in many cases illiterate andsemi-literate workmen in workshopsgetting their and dirty we're workinglike the my favorite example is thesteam engine it was centuries of peopletinkering with pumps that turned pumpsinto engines and then revolutionized theworld and then had the scientistsum tried to co-opt these things that saythat they were developing them and thenI think you're being too cynical aboutit I think scientists which is trying toexplain it yeah but they explained itand then they tried to take credit forit but it was reallyum you know like the the people who weredoing the engines were workersum but you know the Greeks had a steamengine Heroes theme engineand the only application they couldthink of was to open and close heavydoorsand they decided that slaves werecheaperyeah I mean it's obviously you knowmaterial science materials engineering Ishould say improved enormously over thepast couple of thousand years so thatallowed the engines to do much moreum but I think another another aspect ofthis is modern medicine basically took alot of the credits for the improvementsthat were produced by improving livingstandards and sanitation yeah yeah thenthey they use that to basically selltheir drugs and sell their expertiserather than just admit well you know thereason is because the engineers aremaking sure that you're not drinkingyour own feces in your water that's whyyou're living longer that doesn't quitesell as well as saying hey take thismagic pill that we haveyeah no I mean medicine and medicaladvances are an interesting areaI'm no expert on it but it's clearpublic health and certain interventionsI mean you know40 50 years ago a heart attack killedyou today they can intervene put anextent do this to do thatso those are almost mechanical skillsuh they weren't based on sciencephysiology knew where you had to do thisand Engineers figured out how to do ityeah trial and error and that's that'sreally the scientific method I mean it'snot to denigrate uh these people thatwhen I say that it's not scientificAuthority that is the scientific methodyou know the guy in the workshop workingon a pump and trying to make it betterthe way they do that is experimentationyou ask the question what if we do thiswhat's going to happen well we look ohwell it's become more efficient this wayso let's try it again let's try morelet's do more of this let's do less ofthat let's take this part out that'swhat the scientific method is butinstead of course it gets co-opted intoinstitutional science where it stopswhere it's no no you don't mess aroundwith the pumps you don't think you don'tcarry out experiments you just listen tothe authorities that tell you what's theright thing as you know the institutionsthemselves have changedI mean uh the growth of theadministrative staff at universities isimmense uh I once some years ago Chuckvest was president of MIT I Iurged him to fire the facultythat we were only getting the way of theinteraction of Administrators andstudents I meanyeah now this is this is a pet peeve ofmine it's I used to be a universityprofessor and this was one of the mainreasons why I decided to leave and now Iteach online in my own University my ownonline learning platform I teach manymany more students and I get toinfluence many more people and I don'thave to deal with bureaucrats and Ithink it's it's frustrating just howmuch of the University experience forprofessors and students is all aboutjumping through the Hoops of people whoare not teaching you they're not outthere teaching you physics or math orany of the skills that you're out thereto get but they call the shotsyepwhat can we say I mean it is trueI I occasionally wonder I mean you mayhave better insights than I do but youknow the number of young people childrenis decreasingand so the demand forcollege education has to be decreasingas welland uh how is the system going tocontractdoesn't seem to have planned on that inany waybut uhI think it's inevitableyeah I mean I guess the way that mostuniversities in the world in thecountries of whereum population growth is slowing down theway that they're remaining sustainablesby getting in a lot of foreign studentsthere's always foreigners that arewilling to come in and that's kind oflocal population is going to bedecreasing in a few decadesyeah but you can always get foreignstudents and like you can Leverage ThePrestige but I think you're absolutelycorrect that it is unsustainableyeah yeah and I think um this is againanother uh point that I focus on in mybook which isum once you it's true you find that inschooling you find it in healthcare youfind it in universities and in many manyof these fields once the financing stopscoming from the customers once it's nolonger out there competing for customersand you see that inum as medicine becomes more governmentcontrolled and as universities becomemore government financed and controlledthen you see always this massive growthin the bureaucrats because thebureaucrats are how you get money it'sno longer out there to compete on themarket by providing better schoolingbetter University degrees Better HealthCare that stuff doesn't get youcustomers anymore what gets or it doesget you customers but it doesn't get youfunding what gets you the funding whatgets you the big bucks are bureaucratswho know how totalk to the other bureaucrats who cangive you the fundingsso you look at the Modern University youknowtentatively youum ostensibly you could say they'reprivate institutions but really the vastmajority of the modern Universityfunding comes from the government eitherin the form of research grantswhich is a major major contributor totheir budgets or in the form ofgovernment loans to students so you needthe government to be happy with yourUniversity in order for it to givestudents loans or else students won'tcome to your University and you need thegovernment to be happy with your facultyto give them research grants becauseotherwise they you wouldn't get thatmoney those are the two major sources offinancing for uh universities andthey're both reliant on governmentbureaucrats soyou don't win these by going out thereand teaching useful things you don't winthese by doing actual scientific methodstuff you win these by politics byhaving bureaucrats who know how tosecure those grants and how to get moreand more uh Finance credityeah it's a curiosity actuallycolleagues of mine uh you know who areoften supportive of the climate alongoften complain about the difficulty ofgetting grantsand uhI sometimes suspect thatalthough the funding in this area hasincreased immensely it probably hasn'tkept up with the number of people whojumped into the pond to collect thegoodiesand so uh the people actually doingscience are finding it harder to getfunding absolutely this wasn't this waskind of uh one of the I I got a PhD fromColumbia University in sustainabledevelopment and um this is one thingthat I notice in why I just gotalienated from the entire field I neverpublished I never wrote a research Grantin my life becauseum the way that I saw it is you're notdoing anything productive for theseresearch grants in a sense that you'rehaving to conform to an ideology youhave it to conform to conclusions you'rehaving to take in some you know someunquestionable assumptions as a startingpoint and then now you have to includeDeiwhat's thatdiversity equity and inclusion oh yeahyeah I left before that stuff became abig deal so I I didn't even yeah butlike uh for me as an economist the waythat I think about it is I'd rather bedoing something productive where I getpaid from Happy customers who say thankyou and that's what I do with my websiteyou know I teach courses people downloadit everybody who's joining us in theseminar today is a member of my websitethey pay 300 a year and they get toattend all these seminars and get totake my five online courses and the vastmajority of them are very happy with itthey tell me thank you because you knowthey enjoy it they learn and they spendlike a less than one percent of whatthey'd be spending at a uh at a FiatUniversity as I like to call them I'drather be dealing with customers becausein that way you're producing somethingof value to others and then that'sthat's something that can scale andthat's something that can grow and themore feedback you get the better you canmake your product and then the more youcould grow it on the other hand ifyou're doing the kind of if you're goingafter the AstroTurf fund it's comingfrom top and there's no limit on howmany people can come in and compete withthis so then you're competing in writingbetter research grants which nobody'sgoing to read to then get the rightpapers to publish an academic journalsthat nobody's also going to read andlike even if you become the best at thisit's not real in any sense so anybodycan copy you and do what you're doingand it's a it's it's fighting over a astatic pie even if the pie grows it'snot really growing as much as it wouldbe growing if you were actually bakingbecause this is just a pie that's handedfrom up above and you're fighting withfor it rather than actually spendingyour time baking bigger pies well I'mwondering as an economisthow you look at something that's oftenfascinated methere's a photograph from 1929 of aSolvay conferencewhich was a conference of the world'sphysiciststhe interesting thing about thatphotograph is it's you know has maybe ahundred people in the photographthat was the physics world of that timealmost all of them were remarkablyoutstandinguh this was a golden age for physicsum did it really get betterwhen after Sputnik we we worked veryhard in the U.S to increase the numbersof peoplein scienceuh I don't know I don't think so I don'tthink so either I think it got muchworse I think it's uh I think it's uhit's the difference between a freemarket system wherein these scientistsare out there putting their ideas outthere and having to win the their youknow having to earn their keep byproving their value to other scientistsand to students and to Industry at largeyou know here here's an here's how I canhelp you make better airplanes here'show I can help you build better engineshere's what we know about fluid dynamicsthat will make your engines go faster inthat kind of world you're you know thinkabout it like an in athletics if you'reconstantly putting athletes up againsteach other in a competitive environmentthey Excel they get better on the otherhand if you have athletes that are notcompeting in terms of athleticperformance or in other words scientiststhat are not competing in terms ofactually making useful sciencescientific contributions as their fieldbutyou're producing an enormous amount offunding from up above you're just goingto cause an overproduction of thequantity with a collapse in the qualityand it's just Central planning hashappens everywhere you know it's a it'sthink about it like what happens whenthe government handles the potatoindustry in the Soviet Union well eitheryou're going to get a shortage ofpotatoes or you're going to get a floodand surplus of potatoes but in eithercase it's going to be not optimal forthe people involved it could becatastrophic it could lead to a famineand I think that's what's happened withscience and I discussed this in thefiance standard in my bookthe metriconce you've removed the free marketaspect of it once the scientists and theuniversities are no longer funded byvoluntary contributions of students andIndustry thenyou've removed the competition thatforces them to become better and youflooded them with money so what they'regoing to do is they now need to optimizefor the metrics that get them more moneyand this is this is basically theaustrian's school of Economics I don'tknow if you're familiar with Ludovic Vonmises yeah yeah the libertarian they'repretty converter yeah and some Peteryeah their critique schumpeter was atMIT as well where you wereum the the critique of social essentialplanning is that the only way that wecan coordinate economic production theonly way that we can have sophisticateduh markets is through people carryingout economic calculation using marketprices so the entrepreneur that needs tofigure out how to bake bread they lookat the prices of the inputs and theylook at the prices of the outputs andthey try and figure out only with pricescan they figure out how to best make thedecisions for how to make your bread andhow to sell your bread you take away theprices and you make uh you nationalizethe bread industry so you take away theprices from the bread industry and thenit doesn't matter how well-intentionedthe central planners are they aregroping in the dark without prices theycan't perform calculation and that'smises critique who he wrote this in abook called socialism 100 years ago 1922and it was the absolute kill shot forsocialism and it's why socialism reallydeveloped Parts it doesn't matter howsmart how intelligent how many computersand how well intentionedyou have as a central planner if you ownif the government and the centralplanner own all of the supply chain ifthey own all the inputs into the bakeryand they own all of the outputs and theyget to decide who gets the output youdon't have prices so you don't have arational way of calculating how toproduce the bread most efficientlybecause there's no Market to show youthe different opportunity costs ofdifferent decisions and so as soon asthis happens you know you can go byprevious past decisions in previous pastprices but then eventually that's goingto break down and that's why economicproduction breaks down everywhere and Ithink it's the same thing that hashappened with scientific production howdoes the NIH and the NSF and all thesegovernment financing boards how do theydecide which scientists should get moneyeven assuming all the best intentionseven assuming all of the the smartestpeople are and and all of the most uhhonest people in the smartest people arein charge of those things without a freemarket in the scientific output there'sno way for them to decide what deservesmoney or not so what do they do they goby metrics and these metrics arePublicationsso what has resulted from this and Idiscussed this in the Fiat standard isthat you created a system whereeverybody's incentives are to producemore Publicationsand we have an avalanche of PublicationsI mean it's it's impossible for anybodyin any field to even just keep up withthe cursory readings of all the journalsin a single field like I know ineconomics there's thousands of journalsbeing published every year I would nothave time to sleep and eat if I decidedthat I wanted to read all of these and Iprobably wouldn't even finish them evenif I give up on sleep and food it's soenormous nobody keeps up with it so it'sjust an enormous output of papers butthe incentives are there becauseum the funders they want to see youpublish in order to give youum research and they're always lookingto give more funding to the people whopublished more on the other hand theacademics they have an incentive topublish more and the universities theyhave an incentive to publish morebecause they want to go up in therankings so the result is everybody overproduces in the papers but then thesepapers are unreadablewellit's it's worse than that I think insome waysuh you know not only are the journalsproliferatingbut the distractions are proliferatingI mean when I was starting my career wedidn't have emailI now start out the day with 400 emailsto delete or answer or do something withuhso that gets in the way yeah there isproliferationpeer review is another sort of jokeit is enforcing conformityuh the public is called itscertification of correctness that that'simpossible yeah it's ridiculous thequarterly Journal of the royalMeteorological Society years ago hadsome very good instructions forreviewersand that the instructions were thefollowing that there were only two basesfor rejecting a paperone was an overt mathematical eraand the second was lack of originalityand otherwise the paper could not berejectedinstead the paper would be read at themonthly meeting of the royalMeteorological Societyand the comments of two experts quotewould be included with the paperand so you had the paper and some otherpeople's take on it and you could makewhat you wished of itnow it's also should be recalled thatthe peer review is not ancientit is largely a post-world War IIphenomenon yeah absolutelyyeah and I think it's uh it's veryinteresting where to tell people but youknow uh Isaac Newton and all thegreatest scientists that have ever livednever published in peer-reviewedjournals all the most importantscientific discoveries came for peoplewho were peer-reviewedyeah only one German Journal I forgetwas a side trip or something physics hadreview but that was reviewed by theeditor who was Max Planckuh okay fair enoughhe's kind of earned uh not with hiscontributions I mean I think the conceptobviously uh you know um the newspapershave peer review of A Sort there's aneditor that's going to read your paperand he's going to reject it and he'sgoing to tell you obviously that you'reputting out somethingum as a publisher and you want to haveyour name behind it so there is therehas to be some form of reviewum I think what's the problem is thatum because again these journals are nolonger uhare no longer out there competing in thereal world for people's attention theydon't have an incentive to improve thequality of what they publish theirincentive is toum just churn out as much papers aspossible in fact you know from thisDynamic that I was describing earlierthe professors want to publish theuniversities want more publishing andthe funding bodies want to show morePublications so the end result of thisdance and the real winner for from thisis the academic publication industrywhich really is a cartel I mean it'sit's it's a it's it's a trulyuhtruly horrible institution that hascaptured the fruits of the labor ofthousands of intelligent people who arejust basically slaving away for free youtook all over the world all thesescientists are working for theseacademic Publications and these journalsthey make enormous amounts of money youknow these companies make enormousamounts of money from these journalsbecause they get the scientists and theacademics working for them for freeand then they sell the same universitieswhere those scientists and academicswork they sell them those journals forenormous exorbitant absurd criminalamounts of money I mean MIT pays you asalary and then you go and you write forthe journal and then you go and youreview for the journal and then thatjournal in order to send these pieces ofpaper to the MIT uh Library they'llcharge them thousands and thousands ofdollars for these pieces of paper whenall that the journal did was justbasicallyuh have a secretary coordinate betweendifferent professors who work at MIT andall these other universities which thenhave to turn around and pay theseexorbitant amounts of money because thejournals have captured the economiccalculation problem that I had mentionedearlier so the financing of the journalscomes the financing of the academicscomes from up above and then it ends upin the academic Journal industry becausethe academic Journal industryum you know if you want to get promotedyou need to get into the good journalsand also if your University wants to geta good ranking it needs to have accessto all the best journals sobasically the academics uh thebureaucrats at the universities HaveEnded up selling out the universitiesselling out the students and theprofessors to the benefit of theacademic publishing industry which is atruly truly abhorrent industry if youlook at it this way they make billionsof dollars in profits over whatwellactually our library is beginning todrop journals they can't afford it andthat's MIT yeah yeah and of coursenobody even has needs any access for itand then you know it's absurd that ifyou want to buy an article from anacademic Journal you pay forty dollarsto have one-time accessit's insane it doesn't cost the journalanything they're just putting up a PDFthey do some editing and they put up thePDF and you know all of the all of thework is done by essentially academicslave laboryeah it's funny I mean with publishing Ihad a uh bookuh Dynamics and atmospheric physicsthe Cambridge University uh published itnow they asked for a tech file this is akind of scientific word processing filesoI sent them thatand a few years later I wanted to revisethe textand they said they couldn't do it and II said why I mean you know you have thetech file I can send you a new one theysaid what they did was photocopy thetech file and use Photo offset to printit and therefore they couldn't modify itokaytechnology uh was used entirelyinappropriatelyyeah and like you know 40 years ago youcould sort of tell you could kind ofstrain and make a case for why thesejournals had to be expensive becausethey print them on fancy paper and thenthey'd send them to the universitiesmaybe but then over the past 40 yearsprinting just got cheaper and then theinternet came along and now it'sbasically the marginal cost is close tozero for them to take the five andconvert it to a digital file and thenlet MIT have it but their prices justcontinue to go up and they still don'tpay the writers and the editors and theycontinue to make billions and billionsof dollars out of it and it's the onlyway that you can get a career inAcademia and it's why you know it's it'sa big part of the reason why I leftAcademia and why I published I'veself-published my second book after Ileft Academia now I have my ownpublishing in print I publish my ownbooks and I sell directly to my readersand it's uh I sleep much better at nightknowing that academic Publishers aren'tmaking money from my slave laboroh hopefully you get paid I dothankfully enough you know more morethan I did as a university Professorwhich is what really mattersum because I don't work for free anymoreyeahno I mean uh I wonder I haven't studiedit in detail butI suspect the spreadin salary between professors andadministrators has probably grown prettyapprecially over time yes it and it'sabsurd because you know the the uh ifyou look at a university today you knowthe professors have to work harder andharder to get published in increasinglyarcade journals that nobody reads andit's just a life of really hard workwhereas if you're an academic and youjustum decide you know what screw all thisphysics or math or nutrition oreconomics nonsense I'm going to go intoAdministrationit's maybe 10 of the work and then fivetimes the pay it's absurdwell incentives work rightyeah well I mean they were they work notfor what their advertised to do I meanit's I think it's a massively massivelycorrupt system and um the reason why Ithink Bitcoin is so important and sointeresting is because it solves all ofthese problems at the root and the rootcause of these problems comes back tothe issue of the fact that some peoplewe live in a world in which most of ushave to work for our money most of ushave to get out of bed in the morningand slave away in order to make enoughmoney to feed ourselves but there's asmall group of people government and allof their Associated institutions whodon't have to work for their money andso the laws of Economics don't apply tothem it's almost like they it's like agroup of people that get to opt out ofgravity and then they can just flyaround everywhere and do whatever theywant they're separated from economicreality and soum you know we have this massive amountof Administrators the massive amount ofacademic journals all of these peopleare making an enormous amount of moneywithout having to work hard withouthaving to provide any value for othersbecause they've managed to positionthemselves in the right place to benefitfrom the money printing under a bunch offalse pretenses like oh well we needFinance science so that we get more andbetter science or we need to have ajournals Publications that are of a highquality so I'm going to you know whereour Journal is going to be the one thatdoes this and then they end up justbasically making money without having towork and it's at the expense of thestudents who get into lifelong debt forexorbitant amounts of money to learnfrom professors that are getting intoessentially a lot of hard work toproduce things that don'tum matter to the mass majority of peopleI think another sad aspect of this isthe vast majority of professors don'teven care about teaching anymore itdoesn't matter how good you are atteaching because it doesn't matter ifthe students learn or not what mattersis can you get us published can you getthe university listed in the topPublications in your field and soprofessors are heavily incentivized notto care about their teaching I rememberwhen I was at University one of our bestprofessors in teaching he was so good atthe teaching part of his job and he gavesuch detailed notes and every all thestudents love them but it came at theexpense of Publications and he didn'tget tenure and he had to leave theuniversity and it's a very very commonstory The Universities aren't optimizedfor teaching and for the studentexperience they're optimized for gettingresearch grantswell you know at The Graduate level I'mnot sure the picture should be that wayI mean graduate school in some waysis very traditional sort of uhyou know you have peopleuh working as graduate students learningin order to work in a field rather thanto Simply learn about itand so it'sa more traditional sort of mentoringthan undergraduate studies whereyou knowit's hard to tell I mean how you relatescience for instance which involvesdoing thingsuh with the humanitiesuh where it's learning about thingsdeveloping expertise but it's a verydifferent worldand then you know you have courses forundergraduates that are essentiallyappreciation courseshow to appreciate literature how toappreciate poetry how to appreciate artI don't know I meanclearly those things are not I would sayessential roles for a university peoplecan do it on their ownuhI don't know where we go on that I meanuniversities are primarily credentialingorganizationsand they say HR departments the work ofevaluating things they just look at yourcredentialsbut uhI think we probably agree this systemis not likely to perform welland the question is uh when do you paythe piperyeah I mean I thinkum I think I think the reality is thesystem is not sustainable already forthe majority of people involvedum like particularly you know mostpeople have resigned themselves to thefact that all right I'm not going toUniversity to learn I'm going toUniversity to get the credentials butcredentials are becoming less and lessimportant in today's world you can learnanything online and employers arebecoming more and more concerned aboutactual skills rather than credentials sowould you rather get the graphicdesigner who spent four years at auniversity paying getting into twohundred thousand dollars of debt inorder to learn graphic design or wouldyou just test somebody based on theirportfolio that they have up on theirwebsite where they've not gone toUniversity and they spent those fouryears actually working in graphic designmeeting the needs of clients like you sothat gives them specific experience thatyou're looking for more and more it'sbecoming for it's becoming a clear toemployees that you know with theinternet and the ability of people tolearn everything online you can look forthe actual skills that you want and saveyourself and the student a lot of moneyin fact many people tell me that goingto University for them as an employer isa negative Mark like if you spent 250000 on learning to do graphic designwhen you could have done it online forfree all of the courses are availableonline all the material is online so Ithink it's not working out well for manystudents who get into a lot of debt overthese things it's not working out wellfor a lot of professorsum but it's it's the mental prison thatchanged them to this thing like no youknow you grow up thinking you want to goto Harvard and MIT and so you spend yourlife working for that and then onceyou've got your PhD and then you want togo into MIT and you want to teach thereand a lot of these people break out ofthis at some point you know they leavetheir academic jobs and they go and workin the real world where they have anactual productive joband they feel much happier and much moresatisfied certainly was the example formebut you knowwasn't always that wayin the 50sI workedSummers as a technicianat the radio Corporation of Americawhich is one time no longer exists butone time dominated consumer electronicsin the U.Sand at that timeuha very significant portion of theengineersit did not become engineers through adegree at an engineering school they hadworked their way up to engineer fromtechnicianand that has virtually disappeared Ithink it's it it it's uh it's verycommon today in uh online it's it's verycommon online it's I think it's ratherthe norm like if you look at themajority of startup Foundersumdropouts dropouts or not even went tocollege and none of them just learned tocode on their own and then they learnthose skills and I think it's the thefree market is emerging much more onlinebecause it's much harder to havegovernment controls and distortionsonline because information is very easyto travel around online and that'swith social media what you're saying iscorrectI mean I think so I think it is I thinkyou knowum for instance one example is Bitcoinanother example is nutrition so for manymany years universities uh particularlyHarvard have told the world that youknow you need to eat a balanced dietthat includes all kinds of differenttoxic uh poisonous things that are notgood for you and you look online now youlook at the world of Fitness influencersonlinethey are giving people advice that is indirect contradiction to that no youshould not be eating six to ten portionsof grains every day no you should notworry about eating animal saturated fatsyou're actually better off eating animalfat than you are eating sugars andstarches you need to reduce your sugarsugars and starches and you need to getanimal protein and animal fat and thisis I'm oversimplifying here but you knowthere's thousands of different diets andthousands of different influencersonline that are telling people all kindsof different variations on this oneGeneral message which is basically don'tlisten to Harvard Harvard is out thereto poison you to benefit their sponsorsand it works and a lot more people areyou know improving their health they'regetting much better they're gettingfitter they're reversing some uhsupposedly irreversible medicalconditionsum by following the stuff the internetis allowing for people to do that and Ithink a lot of the um a lot of the kindof hate that the internet gets aboutthis is essentially the credentialedguilds being upset about the fact thatpeople aren't listening to them anymoreyeah people don't care if you have a PhDin nutrition from Harvard anymore a lotless people care today than they did 30years ago because a lot more people havemanaged to change their lives you knowyou know diabetics who are no longer onDiabetes medication because they stoppedeating sugars and Grains it's such aninsanely simple idea but yeah ifdiabetes is problem of glucosemetabolism if you start metab if youcan't metabolize glucose maybe don't eatall the foods that are full of glucoseit sounds so outlandish but it's notsomething that they teach you at Harvardbecause they're sponsored by the glucosemanufacturers and they're sponsored bythe insulin manufacturers and so they'reout there telling you yeah not just havea balanced diet that includes all kindsof different insulin spiking things sothat you can keep all of our sponsorshappy so that's destroyed thecredibility of a lot of these scientificinstitutions and I think it's a goodthing uh sure not everybody online isgiving away good advice but I think manymore people are giving good adviceonline because online you know you liveand die by the results of yourumadvice you know if you go out there andyou tell people to eat something thatmakes them sickthey're not going to come back and posttestimonials saying hey this guyimproved my life they're gonna say thisguy told me to eat like this and now Ifeel terriblehopefullyall right so I wanted to ask you aboutthe ipcc this is an important topic soyou've worked at the ipcc you publishedyou were the lead author of the chapteron physical climate processes andfeedbacks which was in the thirdassessment report that was published in2001 and at that point uh you know itwas a I would say it was probably alittle bit different from what it isright now they had people like you onboardwell you know initially and I thinksubsequentlyuh governments uh used to ask people toparticipate you know they tried to getas many people as they couldparticipateI don't think inselecting people for the working groupsthat's something you have to understanda littlethe ipcc has three working groups one isscience one is uh impacts one ismitigationonly one deals with scienceall three groupsconsist quote in experts in these areasand they write these unintelligiblereports the Thousand Pages no indexum the review is perfunctoryuh you know you get reviews you they getread to you and you're asked do you wantto accept it or not and you say no andthey throw it awayso it's not a real review but on theother handuh people don't want to say anythingtotally stupid in the review in theworking group reportsso for instance working group one on thescience you'll never see them uhsay it's an existential threat I meanthey'll come out with a scenario and sayyou know this might reduce GDP by threepercent in 50 yearswhen assuming that GDP has increased 300percent by then and so on so none ofthis sounds very ominous the sex each ofus was responsible for only about threepages of these thousandsand I remember I was working with twocolleagues uh we differed on things butwe came to an agreement that howeverbiased it might be we wouldn't writeanything that was overtly wrongit's a prettyhow should limit its restriction butnonetheless you know writing on thefeedbacks and so on it was openlyacknowledged we didn't know how to do ituh that we had the models didn't knowcould not handle clouds they couldn'thandle all sorts of things that werevitalthere's nothing I felt ashamed of on itum there was a kind of monitor who camearound and said you know why aren't youmaking it more ominous and I rememberone of the people who was working withme who is an ardent greenybroke into tears and said you know howhow dare you accuse me of not being anEnthusiast for this uh but you know allthree of us decided we would neverparticipate againand so each subsequent uh ipcc reporthas more and more trouble finding anyonewho will participate and of course thequality decreases but it doesn't muchmatterbecause uh you know you have this funnyprocedureyou have this thousand page report it'sunreadableand then you have a summary for policymakersthe summary for policy makers is notwritten by the authorsif you have should backtrack a littlethe people who participate in it arechosen by a scientific unit quotewhich is was at that time located in theUK metal officebut there is a coordinating lead authorwho is uh money you know moderating thewhole procedure he's chosen by thepolitical unitand so at the end the summary for policymakersdoes have the coordinating lead authorsfrom each of the chapters plus a muchlarger group of government officialsthey then decide on a summaryand the summary comes out six monthsbefore the reportin order to allow the differences in thesummaries to be reflected in the reportlet's say if the summary is inconsistentwith the first version of the reportthey want to have time to change thescienceuh but that that's the first step and itgoes onand you know the summary for policymakers might be 20 pages but I thinkthey understand nobody reads 20 Pageseven certainly nobody needs a thousandpagesso it eventually ends up that you have apress releasethat comes out with an iconic statementnow it happens for the third report andsubsequent reports the iconic statementis something like uh we are now 90 surethat most of the warming in the last 50years is due to man's activities thisstatement might be totally bogusbut the interesting thing about it isit's also perfectly innocuousbecause even if it were trueit doesn't imply a big problembecause you know it hasn't worked butand so everyone is sort of be coveredthe rear endbecause uh you know for instance withthat statement which meant nothinguh you had Senators Lieberman and McCainrespond that now we have the Smoking Gunand we must do somethingand so at each stage it's like a game oftelephone orsomething elseand the message gets Amplified andAmplifiedand eventually uh it sounds seriousuh but you know the impact is toincrease funding so the scientists don'tcomplain uh they've covered themselvesthey haven't said anything bad it's notthem who've said itand so you have this peculiar chain ofuh amplificationwhich eventually Bears no relation tothe original science yeah and I thinkthe bait and switch here is that they'vethey use these kind of fantastic claimsthat arrive in thisum executive summary reports but theywant them to have the same veneer ofscience that of course of course yeahand that's uh that's what's kind of veryfrustrating about talking to a lot ofthe climateum uh faithful really the the crisisfaithful the people who think we reallyare in a climate crisis is look allthese scientists agree well no all thesescientists were told to write a reportand they got paid well to do it and thenthey wrote the report actually nobodygets paid well yeah but I mean they theyget paid to get if you get into thatreport it helps you keep your job and ituh it's good for your tenure and it'sgood for your uhyou have to be published in these kindof things in order to keep your academicjobI I think there's actually somethingelse going on you're partly rightI mean remember this was a very smallfield in a senseand nobody was calling themselves pilotscientists and yet at the end of the dayyou speak of the ipccas thousands of the world's leadingclimate scientists and suddenly it's abig field what happens is it's a unorganizationso you have to have scientists quotefrom every place from Zimbabwe fromKenya fromSri Lanka from this from there for mostof them you know they really are notprofessionally active but it soundsgreat back home that they are nowconsidered among the world's thousandsof leading scientistsand so they benefit reputationally fromit I don't think that's true in thestates I don't think anyone reputationincreases with itbut I think I think it's very true I'veseen a lot of people brag about the factthat oh my advisor is on the ipcc and ohyeah we all were listed as uhcontributing to the Nobel Peace Prizeyes I even have my certificate for thatyeah so there's there's quite a bit ofprestige that comes with thatit's possible in the public domain I I Icertainly don't think it's true inAcademiaor at least not at MIT nobody reallygets claudits for certainly I've got TCCokay I mean I remember in Colombia itwas uh it was a pretty big deal peoplewere pretty goodbut I guess when you were in Colombiabecause they have that climate Centerwhich is pretty bizarreI was there 2004 to 2009. yeah so it wasalready there the Earth Institute rightyeah that's that's where I got my PhD inthe earth Institute and the School ofInternational public affairs one thingI'll tell you is um I when I was there Iwas a card carry member of the uhclimate hysteria uh Association and Ione thing that I remember is your namealways came up as this kind of uhOddball uh awkward uncle that annoyedpeople and it was always you know allthe science degree except for this oneguy in MIT who's you know they couldn'tjust dismiss you entirely because youhad impeccable credentials and so ifthey said well this guy is from MIT andhe's uh he's just a crank well then thatputs it to question all of thecredentials that all the rest of theseguys have so well how could you you knowhow can you at once say listen to theauthorities and listen to the sciencewho was the head of the earth Institutewhat was his name he was an economistyep Jeffrey sacks Jeffrey Sachs Iremember himyeah he was the one who'd alwaysmentioned you as I haven't that's thisguy at MIT and I I didn't give muchthought to it at that time because youknow obviously oh well so just one guyat MIT who cares but then uh you knowthen I uh started thinking morecritically and that I came across yourwork you've tried your best no matterwhat happens you know I hopeone favor I'd ask you know I mentioned apaper that I was suggesting people lookatand a problem I have with thatis trying to explain how the systemworksand it's true I mean it's taken you knowprofessors and grad students and so ondecadesto get these Notions straight and uhvery much Dynamic meteorology it was awork in progressand so it's not surprising to me thatpeople can't absorb it very readilybut if anyone reads it and could suggesthow to make it more communicable I wouldlove to hear from themabsolutely which paper is that this isthe one that the global warming policyFoundation put out you know I gave youthe link yeah the 2018 uh transcript noit's uh very recently so when you submit it to the SECno no the SEC thingis is see with the SEC uh Amicus briefthe problem we dealt with we recognizethere's no one there who is going tounderstand the scienceand so we emphasize the fact that theinformation they were working with wasnot derived on the basis of scienceand you know that was the emphasis therebutthe science itself gets left outyeah I gave you a link to something atthe global warming policy Foundationyeah the other one you sent me that wasin 2022 from an assessment of theconventional global warming right insidethe comment by Nicholas yeah yeah we'llpost that definitely post that and ifanyone could suggest how to clarify thatuh I'd appreciate that because I findthat a very difficult concept toexplainuh there are two figures I may have sentyou that's helpfulI mean the idea here isthe extra Tropics outside the tropicsdetermines the equator to pulltemperature differencethe one-dimensional picture plays a rolein what determines the tropicaltemperaturebut the ipcc and the common narrativesay the tropics control the whole thingand that is not true and as a result thegreenhouse picture is not the picture ofhow climate works and um communicatingthat if anyone except someone who's beenworking on it and there are a fewuh has been a very difficult issuenow I don't know if it would help atthis stage because you know when you'reindoctrinating children you're notcounting on the sciencebut uh would pay if more peopleunderstood how the system workedyeah I think uh I I hope a lot of mylisteners will uh look into it and umcontact me and I'll be happy to pass anyof the feedback uh over to you or do youhave your email uh available in publicso they can contact you directlyfor better of course it's just MITalways you know has it available so it'sr-l-i-n-d-c-e-n R Lynx in one word atmit.edu yes so I'll tell you this andbasically my listeners are predominantlypeople who are into Bitcoin and ifyou're into Bitcoin then you've alreadygone through one kind of uh ego deathwhere you had to come to terms with thefact that uh things that you learned atschool and University are nonsense andso bitcoiners have this very strongknack for what we call Trust verifydon't trustum because uh the way that Bitcoin worksis that it's a system built by paranoidpeople for paranoid people wherein youdon't have to trust anybody for anythingso the way Bitcoin works is it doesEurope explain blockchain technology yesthat's basically it blockchaintechnology is is a word that peopledon't really who don't really understandBitcoin use to explain what's going onit's kind of like calling carsum fuel injection technology it's it's apart of what makes the car function butthe important thing about it is thatit's an automobile it's a car it's athing you get into and it moves you fromA to B so uh the important thing thatblockchain technology does is Bitcoinand all the other digital currencies inmy opinion and all the otherapplications for blockchain in myopinion and in the opinion of mosthardcore bitcoiners are essentially adistractionum they're a little bit like uh yeswe've invented the car and there's thesepeople that are telling us oh we can usethe car to make horse carriages morecomfortable so they're about putting anengine on a horse carriage and tying theor tying horses to cars and thinkingthat that's going to be an improvementand what we're trying to say is no thewhole point of this thing is to get ridof the horse in other words the wholepoint of this thing is to get rid ofhaving a central Authority controllingthe moneyso in order to make it the point I'mtrying to get to is that in order tomake it toum our level of Bitcoin you've alreadygone througha process of questioning a lot ofbeliefs and analyzing them from thebeginning so maybe there isn't thesingle group of people anywhere in theworld that is as less trusting ofauthority as bitcoiners and they'll justverify anything rather than trust it sothat's why you know the thing that I wasmentioning about diet is pretty hereticfor pretty much anybody outside ofBitcoin but within Bitcoin this hasbecome basically common knowledgeeverybody understands that yeah Harvardnutrition is uh garbage and they tellyou nonsense because you know peoplestudy these things people experiment ontheir own so I think hopefully we'regoing to get some people who are willingto look into this and study it in detailand give you good feedback on itum this is this is I believe how we'regoing torevitalize these corrupt institutions ofscienceum it's gonna have to happen from akernel of Bitcoin really because uh it'sgonna have have to come from a placewhere that is independent of governmentmoney and government financing becausegovernment money is uh comes with apreset agenda and preset conclusion aswe discussed earlier and bitcoiners aredeveloping the freedom to be able tooperate outside of that system and to beable to uh analyze things without havingto trust Authority so I hope many of mylisteners will go through this paperwhich will post the link to in my uh inthe show notes and always the show notesare on safety.com podcast you'll findthe episode and then you'll find all theshow notes thereokay greatexcellent look forward to it thank youthank you do any of the attendees havequestions for professor lindsenyeah please go ahead Nathanyeah sir uhvery enjoyable thank you muchI have recently uhseen the claim that oil is not a fossilbaseduh occurrence and I've I chase thataround and the arguments they seemreasonable on the surface but I haven'treallyI don't have an opinion on that Iwondered if you uhhad any comment on that claimthe answer is nouh that'ssomething I have no expertise inTommy gold who I I admired greatly waspushing this many years agothat there are other possibilities fornatural gas and oilin the earth'sI I don't know I mean uhI'm not sureI mean his point was it may be that ourestimates of the amount availablewere greatly understated and that wouldhave some implicationsbut I have no assessment of it thanksyeah it's one thing that's alsofascinating me I'm beginning to look atAtomic Gold's work I think it's prettycompelling I think that the evidencethat they muster on this is is quitestrong because there'suh there's a there'sa lot of oil out there it's difficult toimagine that it's all uh being produceduhfrom dinosaurs yeah that's a lot ofdinosaurs will just keep burning throughthem and also there's uh there arefossil fuels in meteors and in otherplanets so it's it's quiteum no Tommy gold was a very bright andimaginative guyI knew him anduh he taught at Harvard brieflyand then moved on to Cornelland uh had a number of protegewho however uh did not follow him in hisadventurousnessyeah do you know any of his uh anypeople who would uh um today defend thatproposition I'd like to discuss this inmore detail with them I don't knowumI was a high school classmate of one ofhis Protege is Peter goldwrightbut I don't think Peter ever ultimatelyagreed with TommyI seeit's a fascinating question that I findreally interestingyeah I mean it has implicationsbut you know even for the people whoregarded as purely a fossil fuel theamount available is huge all thesepolicies are designed to waste aplentiful resourceforeignyeah I think yeah I think I agree and Ithink it's it's it's kind of uh you knowwhether you whatever you think of theorigin of it I think it's just uh it'svery obvious that it just keeps gettingcheaper in real terms we keep findingmore and the reserves continue to growour proven reserves of oil just to growevery year we're not draining a limitedresources by definitionyou know proven reserves is veryfungibleI mean it doesn't mean quite what itsaysYeah the more we look the more we proveyeahabsolutelyall rightum Dr lindsden is there uh tell us moreabout where people can find you and yourwork online so you mentioned this paperwhich will post anything else uh you'dlike to mention yeah there are a fewitems in the website of the CO2coalitionand uh other than that I have nospecific web presence uh why don't youjoin Twitterit's a lot of fun uh how should I put itit actually the internet occupies toomuch of my time already there's an ageissue also I find my contemporariesavoid social media like the plaguethe whole notion of social media seemsstrange to us yeah but I think you mightwant to consider Twitter Twitter is Ilove Twitter because it's it's notsocial media in the sense where you goand hang out with your friends and keepup with your cousin's uh children andwhat they're doingum it's a place where you just exchangeideas and you boil ideas down to 280characters so you have to the best thingabout it is that you have to get to thepoint and so people who just waffle onand make endless noises rather thangetting to the point they can't Thrivethe old statement uh I didn't have timeto reduce this so you have to accept thelogo version yeah that's that's whatTwitter is it's actually I would sayTwitter has made me a much better writerbecause it's forced me to uh really andthat's the hardest thing in writing it'sjust get your idea down to the uh corethat you want to communicate and Twitteris excellent for that and it's also it'sa great place for you to get ideas outand get feedback on them because you canjust simply ignore anybody who's wastingyour time you can block anybody who'sbothering you and you can interact onlywith the people that you findinteresting but you know I was thinkingof a friend of mine a mathematicianSergio clendermanit's a professor at Princetonvery distinguished uh you know uhfield prize medalist and so on which isthe Nobel Prize in mathematicsessentiallyand he recently published a proof ofan important theorem the proof took 800Pages what would it mean for him tocondense it into 280 some odd charactersno he wouldn't condenses them to 280characters he'd write in one sentencehe'd say I I've come up with the proofof X and then he just posts the link tothe 800 pages and then the people whowere assessing itthey're not going to read the 800 pageproofof it well the thing is like all thepeople I mean you're going to get morepeople assessing it if you're posting iton Twitter you're going to reach manymore mathematicians than if uh whateverwhatever form absolutely there's 300million people on Twitter I'm sure manyof them are mathematicians there aremathematicians on Twitter there'sTwitter math and there are people doingproblems and discussing proofs and youknow obviously you don't have to put allthe discussion in the Tweet because youjust put a link to the Tweet so you canput the link to this paper people willread it and then they'll give youfeedback maybe in 280 characters ormaybe they'll write a blog post about itbut it it amplifies your reach massivelyand then in your case with the topic ofclimate you're going to find a much muchbigger audience I would say thanmathematicians because this is somethingthat's becoming very topical now and Ithink the current energy crisis inEurope and you know the grid failures inCalifornia and Texas they're reallymaking people question this up until afew years ago so you know in politeSociety you wouldn't question thesethings you even if you had your doubtsabout it you know and you wanted to beinvited to the right dinner party so youwouldn't make any noises about it but Ithink people are now realizing now youknow what I like a 24-hour electricitymore than I like impressing uh idiotsand so I'm going to start questioningthis and I'm going to start askingquestions and I'm going to be publicabout it so you'll find a much biggeraudience I think if you go on Twitterfor this oh thank Godexcellent that's good excellent you'llbe a big big prize if uh yeah I tell youa lot of people will be happy about itokay a lot of people will be upsetactually that's the surreal sellingpoint you're going to upset a lot ofpeople if you enjoyed Twitter the rightpeople to upsetI manage that anywaybut amplify itwell Professor Linda thank you so muchfor joining us this has been a pleasureand an honor and thank you so much foreverything that you do it's it's it'struly heartening and encouraging to seepeople like youum where you could very easily just goalong with the tide but you stick yourneck out in spite of all of theum antagonism that you get thank you yesI should mention one thing if you havethe moment as you say it's not liveI'm a theoreticianand that isit sounds slightly irrelevant but itmeans I never had a great deal of Needfor moneyuh especially when personal computersbecame powerful and cheapuh and so you know I could do thecalculation so I could do the thingswith minimal assistance I needed moneyto pay grad students that's the way itwas at MITuh but one of the things that haschanged theory used to be the centerof studies of atmospheric physics and soonuh it was the way of taking acomplicated systembreaking it into components in arational way and understanding them inan analytic fashionand so this was the heart of progress inmeteorologyfrom I would say1914 through 1990.and it was always the hardest coursethat students tookand now it's been completelysupplanted by modelingwhich is much easier the students takesomeone else's model they run it andtreat it as though it were dataand that absence of the theoreticalstructure in the field is reallydamagingit meant there's no conceptual frameworkany longerother than the narrative that ispresented that you know allows an AlGore to show the cycles of ice agesas proof even thoughcause follows effect instead of thereverseI mean one that is reduced to that levelof misunderstandingand umone of the things that is crucial Ithink for progress in the field is areturn to developing Theoryby Theory I mean simplyquantitatively isolating components ofthe systemand uh using them to work out how itworksbecause we can't integrate the fullequations and sothings like linearization or order ofmagnitude analysis played a major rolehey right for your people who like tothink about such things it's probablyworth doing a little thought of whytheory is disappeared from this subjectyeah I think it's uh my my idea is thatit's uh it's much more adaptableum modeling is much more flexible andpliable for arriving at the conclusionthat you want also you don't have to doanythingyou just run ityeah I find it absolutely amazing howmodels are treated as if they're sciencewhen really it's sock puppetry becauseyou could get a model to say anythingthat you want you know you put inwhatever assumptions you wanted you canget whatever result you want and yetmedia reports them or media reports onthese models if they're conclusions likethe scientists have concluded that in2050 uh the ice poles are going to meltand we're all going to die well no youjust ran a boring version of SimCity theirony is you know even the ipcc modelsdon't predict any such things yeah ofcourseso it becomes irrelevant what the modelssay it's what the the interpreters saythe models sayabsolutely okayokay thanks thank you so much thank youlikewise take care bye[Music][Music]thank you",
