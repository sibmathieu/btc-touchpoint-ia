about ahell of a lot fewer of you[Music]thank youhello everyone watching and listening onYouTube or the associated podcastplatforms I have with me todayAlex Epstein I'm looking forward to thisdiscussion he's a philosopher and energyexpert who argues that human flourishingshould be the guiding principle and theappropriate metric for our energy andenvironmental policy and ourdetermination of its progress he's theauthor of the new book fossil futureas well as the New York Times bestsellerthe moral case for fossil fuels whichwas published in 2014. he's also thecreator of energytalkingpoints.coma source of powerful well-referencedtalking points on energy environmentaland climate issuesEpstein began his work in 2011 with thefounding of the center for industrialprogress a for-profit think tankoffering insights into the world offossil fuelsand fighting back against the mainstreamNarrative of so-called environmentalismwidely recognized as a master ofpersuasion and debate on energy issuesAlex has spoken to dozens of Fortune 500companies and at dozens of prominentuniversities including Harvard YaleStanford and Duke his alma materhe's also a highly sought afterconsultant on messaging working withdozens of major political offices onpro-energy Pro Freedom messagingwe're here todayto talk about the moral necessity of anenergy-rich future one that both mustand should rely on the Abundantprovision of the petro-based fuels socarelessly currently demonized sowelcome to all of you who arewatching or listening and welcome toAlexso maybe we could just start byhaving you walk through the book one ofthe things I found interesting to beginwith was your discussion of themotivations let's sayof some of the more radical people thatare pushingwhat is purported to be apro-environment stance people like PaulEhrlich who clearly have an agenda thatcould be more accurately conceptualizedas anti-human certainly anti-industrialrather than pro-environment and and uh Ithink that's something that's worthwhilealerting everyone too especially giventhe current state ofenergy price increase in Europe let'ssay and the consequences that's going tohave for the poor around the world let'sstart with that though you you wrotethis book in 2014. let's talk about whyyou wrote it and and how you think yourprognostications have fared in what'salmost an intervening decadewell I think one thing that's relevantI'm not sure if you know this butthere's a new book 2022 called fossilfuture which is the successor orreplacement to the moral case for fossilfuelsum so I talk a bunch in that about whathow the moral case for fossil fuels hasfared and I think in terms of apredictive book it's not primarily apredictive book but it has beenextremely accurate because if you lookat what people have said in the lasteight or so years the main narrativeshave been we're not going to need fossilfuels as much as we used to they'regoing to be rapidly replaced by solarand wind primarily and that climateimpact the climate impact of fossilfuels is going to be increasinglycatastrophic so we're going to see moreand more suffering and death uh fromclimate related disasters and in thebook I talk about that's not going tohappen because one fossil fuels willremain uniquely cost effectiveparticularly in a world that needs farmore energy which is something that wasnot stressed in the past and is notstressed enough today people arestarting to realize most of the worlddoesn't have enough energy so replacingfossil fuels is almost impossible giventhat you're not talking about justreplacing it for the people who use itbut for the people who need it so I'vebeen very Vindicated on the continuingcost effectiveness of fossil fuels andthen on the climate disaster point wehave documented that climate-relateddisaster deaths are down 98 percent inthe last 100 years and they've continuedto decline and the basic reason isbecause whatever impact we have onclimate that is negative it is faroutweighed by our ability to masterclimate to neutralize all sorts ofclimate dangers and so we're much betteroff overall climate wise than we were 50years ago and certainly 100 years agoso so with regards to let's start withthe second one there the climatedisaster so the biophilic types and sothose would be people like Ehrlichthey seem to make the case that metricsthat involve human flourishing or evenhuman death aren't relevant because theprimary issue is to restore thebiosphere to something approximatingwhat it hypothetically was before therewere human beings which is a ratherstrange notion All Things Considered andso they might object to the fact thatyou're using the mere decrease in numberof deaths say associated with climatetrouble with weather events as a metricbecause the metric should be somethinglike the purity of the planet and sowhat do you think aboutwhat do you think about that argumentwhat metric should we be using todetermine whether or not a climateemergency actually existswell I definitely think we should beusing a human flourishing metric but ina broad sense so the climate disasterdeaths are not the only aspect of thatbut they're a very important aspect wecan also see that damages are flat ordown we can see that life overall ismuch better and actually our ability topreserve the most valuable parts ofnature is better generally when you'renot dependent on the land and dependenton wood depending on your localenvironment for your fuel and you'rewealthy you can be much better atpreserving the parts of nature that youwant to preserve if you look at placesin Africa and Asia and even now Europebecause they're now energy poor likecutting down their forests it's becausethey don't have better sources of fuelso but I would I would challenge theidea that Ehrlich is really using this Ithink you called it biophilic standardbecause if you look at his publicrhetoric he's always appealing to ahuman flourishing standard so how didEhrlich become famous he became famousthrough the 1968 book the populationbomb where he's telling human beings nothey the planet is going to become moreimpacted and that's intrinsically badhe's saying you're all going to starveand his close colleague Sean holdren whowas Obama's Chief science advisor no hepredicted in the 80s that we'd have upto a billion climate related disasterdeaths from famine by 2020 which hascome and gone and the world is betterfed than ever so what I find is thatpeople who I think it internally theydon't really care about humanflourishing and they're reallyoptimizing for eliminating our impact asmuch as possible but they appeal tohuman flourishing to win over convertsbecause if they really said the bestpossible Earth is the one that wouldexist had we never existed and our goalis to eliminate as much human impact aspossible as an end in itself they wouldnot win many converts well the lack of ared wave during the midterms lead tomore Reckless

behind thescenes sort of voce I suppose theargument is made that the planet wouldbe better off it was returned to somenatural and unspoiled condition and butthen public facing the arguments areessentiallypredicated on the argument that if wedon't do something drastic about let'ssay climate change we're going to causea radical radical increase in actualhuman suffering okay so that all has tobe straightened out conceptually beforewe as a species let's say can moveforward intelligently on this front Ithink the mostpowerful point you made however and Ithink this is where the rubber reallyhits the road in more modern times isthateven if you use the metrics that are putforward by those who let's say opposethe continuing use of fossil fuel sothose would be metrics associated withclimate change remediation andenvironmental Improvement the policiesthat are designed to drive energy costsupward do nothing at all that isn'tcounterproductive by their ownmeasurementsso you pointed out for example and thisis something that people really need tobe alerted to is thatbecause the because Europe has takenthis absolutely foolish route to rely onso on wind and solar which isintermittent at bestumone of the things that's happeningbecause of the pressure on liquidnatural gas suppliesprimarily is that there's tremendousamount of deforestation occurring inEurope at the moment because people haveto turn to sources of energy that areactually at hand so that they don'tfreeze in the dark in the middle of thewinter and so the thing that I find soappalling about what's happening on theenvironmental front at the moment isthat even by the metrics of the peoplewho are pro-environmental these policiesthat are driving energy costs upward areutterly counterproductive and you knowhuman progress.org has a lovely graphshowing the relationship betweenattention paid to True medium tolong-term environmental sustainabilityand overall wealth and what you see isthat if you can get as you make peoplewealthier so as you remove them fromabsolute poverty their ability andwillingness to attend to longer-termenvironmental issues starts to increaserather than decreasing and so this hasstruck me for it I've known this for atleast 10 years that the best pathwayforward to a truly sustainable Planeteven by the definitions of theenvironmentalists themselves is to driveenergy costs downward to the point wherewe can remediate absolute poverty sothat people aren't driven to use upum damaging and polluting immediatelyavailable bio resources instead ofturning to more efficient sources ofenergy and you are certainly making thatcase in that in the 2014 book which asyou pointed out you've updated soso that's the critical issue right evenby the metrics of the environmentaliststhemselves the policies that werepresently pursuing on the energy frontare not only counterproductiveenvironmentally but they're driving poorpeople into abject poverty we're goingto see a lot of that in Europe I thinkitI think I think it depends so I think ifyou if you take the quoteenvironmentalists as having a kind ofpro-human interest in nature andpro-human interest in lack of pollutionthis is true but my belief is that thecore of it is the belief that humanimpact is inherently bad it'sintrinsically immoral and and also thebelief is it's inevitablyself-destructive so nature is viewed asthis God that if we offend it throughour impact is going to punish us and itreally has this character where it'swrong and doing the wrong thing is goingto destroy us and if you really thinkabout it that way all their policiesmake sense because their policies arereally aimed at making human life worseand ultimately reducing the humanpopulation so it is true you can saywell yeah aren't you cutting down moretrees aren't you doing this but theywould say well if you use let's say wehad sheep free nuclear energy whichthey've actually commented onhypothetically when they thought Fusionwas possible I talk about this in moralcase and in fossil future the leadingenvironmentalist said this would be theworst thing ever a totally clean cheapabundant source of energy would be theworst thing ever because of what wewould do with it and one of the leaderscalled it like giving an idiot child amachine gun and what they recognized isthat energy is really our ability to dowork which means our ability to impactthe Earth and when we use a lot ofenergy we impact the earth a lot now weimpact it in a way that's beneficial tous including we preserve the mostvaluable parts of Nature and we giveourselves an ability to enjoy naturenevertheless it is a very humanizedEarth and to the anti-humanenvironmental movement that is offensiveso that movement is not about a cleanenvironment for us or for us to be ableto contemplate polar bears or go onsafaris or any of this it's about adehumanized earth it's the believerright we are uniquely bad and we need toget eliminated right right well but theproblem with that argument even if youattempt to give the devil his due let'ssay is that it's predicated on the ideathat if we pursued policies to decreaseour overall energy use and if one of theconsequences of those policies was therelatively radical depopulation of theearth perhaps by radically loweringbirth rates that while thattransformation was occurringdepopulation and de-industrializationthings would remain stable enough sothatin our new poverty and our hopelessnesswith regards to the future we wouldn'tbe devouring the planet while we weredying and I think that's a Preposterousclaim I don't see any peaceful WayForward that's based on compulsion andpoverty to reduce the population of theworld that isn't going to be absolutelydestructive on the energy on theenvironment on the environment frontand and that the idea that if we hadmore energy we would actually be worsefor the planet flies in the face of whatwe've been discussing already which isthe fact that if people can't turn tocheap and efficient and relatively cleansources of energy and perhaps liquidnatural gas and nuclear would be at thetop of that list then they're going toabsolutely 100 percent turn to muchdirtier Replacements and we've alreadyseen that happening and well everywhereI mean China is building coal-firedplants at a rate that's so rapid thateverything the West is doing on theclimate amelioration front is absolutelyirrelevant and what has the UK in thelast week has already pledged to doubleits coal Imports and Germany has had toturn to its coal-fired plants to providebackup power because wind and solar hasproved not only hyper expensive but sounreliable thatwell that when there's no power so whenthe sun isn't shining and the wind isn'tblowing you have to have backup and it'sbeen cold that's it's been brought in asa as a as a stop Gap so I just can't seeany way even if you accept the argumentsthat you just laid forward you know thatthere should be fewer people and thatthe right planet is one that'scharacterized by minimal Human Action Ican't see any way forward to that on theenergy poverty front that's not going tobe positively counterproductiveI mean I I agree I agree I agree withyou in terms of how it plays out and Ithink it's important in general this isnot a scientific movement and part of itnot being a scientific movement is itdoesn't really have a long-term strategyfor achieving its anti-human goals it'smuch more it has a lot of ritual in itthere's a lot of just hostility towardkind of hostility toward anything thathas impact and you just oppose that andthen you assume things are going to getbetter and so people didn't thinkthrough what's going to happen when youmake energy more expensive what's goingto happen to the forest they didn'tthink that through at all or when youoppose nuclear what are you going to usein its stead or when you make energyexpensive what's going to happen interms of riots it's just it's not at allthought through and I think this mightbe a lesson for us to have when wecontemplate these so-called plans fornet zero this is a movement that's verymuch it has this hostility toward humanimpact it opposes it wherever it sees itand it just it has a quality of nihilismto it and it's not thinking through it'snot thinking through either adehumanized earth or a human friendlyEarth it's sort of going after anythingthat has impact but but my argument iswe need to switch our hostility towardimpact this view that human impact isbad needs to be challenged human

CD[Music]so yeah well it's a strange it's justvery strange issue philosophicallybecauseone of the things I wonder about is whythis idea that human beings are in somesense in their activity antagonistic tothe Earth it's a very peculiarmetaphysicalassumption especially for people who arehypothetically biologically mindedbecause if we're living creatures whichwe clearly are and if we if we'veevolved in the same manner that otherliving creatures have evolved whichseems relatively indisputable then howis it that our very existence is somehowantithetical to the flourishing of thebiosphere given that we're clearly partof the biosphere and you and you seethis sort of thing with this idiotassumption for example that bears someof the same Hallmarks of this kind ofquasi-philosophical thinking that beforethe Europeans came to North America thatthe nativists were living somehow inharmony with nature and that the entirebiosphere was three of the scars ofhuman interaction and that's utterlypreposterous I mean the Native Americanswere incredibly sophisticatedagriculturalists and the Western PlainsIndians burned the Prairies with con inconstantly to ensure that there is aplentiful supply of the Buffalo thatthey depended on and so human beingshave beenaffecting the structure of the biosphereever since we've been around and that'sfor a very long period of time and theidea that there was somehow somepristine state of nature before weemerged on the landscape and thatthere's some moral imperative to returnto thatit strikes me it's so incoherent thatit's barely comprehensible and there issomething like a hatred for Humanity asfar as I can tell that's lurkingunderneath this hatred for Humanitycertainly a hatred for industrializationand those actually turn out to be thesame thing I mean one of the thingsthat's really struck me asincomprehensibleover the last few years is thatespecially on the left is that you havethese joint claims being put forwardsimultaneously on the left and one isthat we're radically pro-environmentaland we're also the uh philosophicaldoctrine that is standing up for thepoor and oppressed and I think okay wellwhat happens when those two things arepitted against each other and when arethey pitted well they're pitted when itcomes to discussions about cheap energybecause it's clearly the case and yououtline this in your book quite nicelythat the most effective way ofremediating absolute poverty so liftingpeople out of the privation that'sassociated at least with lack ofeducation but also with starvationitself is to provide them withcheap energy because as you pointed outthere's no difference between energy andwork and there's no difference betweenwork and productivity there's nodifference between productivity and theeradication of poverty and so we arepursuing these expensive energy policiesand hypothetically we're supposed tobenefit the planet although we're notbut we are definitely dooming people whoare already poor to a much moretruncated Horizon of opportunity and towell to Absolute privation andstarvation in many cases yes I thinkit's really I mean there are at leasttwo really interesting issues raisedhere so this tension between the allegedconcern for poverty and then the quoteconcern for the environment and thenthis question of how this bizarre viewuh evolved you know because this was notthe view of our environment and ourimpact 100 years ago and interestinglyit's not the view of our environmentthat anyone who lives near Nature haspeople who live in nature don't worshipnature as the superior God that can't beimpacted and I think it's my ownunderstanding of the history and Ireally enjoy there's a book by um by EinRand called the the new left theanti-industrial Revolution and it waswritten at the time that this washappening and one of the analyzes isbasically there's a transition betweenthe old left and the new Left where theold left claimed to be for industry forproductivity for prosperity and whathappened is that was clearly notachieved by their pulse these communismled to the devastation of Industry themalfunction of Industry widespreadpoverty and Rand said well you know theleft basically had a choice are yougoing to stay with your anti-capitalismor are you going to embrace capitalismbecause you really care about industryand productivity right right andactually what they did was they theykept their anti-capitalism and theylooked for new reasons to supportanti-capitalism and in the 60s theydecided on this issue of environment andit was a convenient issue in a number ofways one is the pro-capitalism sidedidn't do a very good job with itparticularly rhetorically it didn't makethe point that well good environmentsare made possible by Prosperity so theidea of a good environment in ahumanistic way was co-opted by Theanti-capitalists Who had no right to itwhatsoever I mean look at the SovietUnion and an environment but they theyowned that value issue but then theypackaged it with this hostility towardhuman impact as such and what theyreally did brilliantly was they tookover the schools so they put in theschools this idea that human impact isbad and especially the idea that it'sinevitably self-destructive because theplanet is this delicate nurturer thatour impact ruins and that has permeatedthe whole educational system wherepeople think that we inherently aredestroyers of the planet and it haspermeated the scientific Community whatI call this delicate nurture or Dogma isunfortunately pervasive in EarthSciences today it's a very primitive andbizarre view it has nothing to do withreality that our impact is inevitablyself-destructive actually our impact hasmade the Earth much better overallincluding safer from climate butnevertheless I think it's really therewas initially a real politicalmotivation to spread this but now wehave this irrationalist philosophy thathas a mind of its ownyeah well that's okay so let's delveinto that a little bit because the otherthing that I've come to understand moreclearly in the last 15 years let's sayas the data has also become more clearis thatso we lifted more people out of povertyin absolute terms and also in relativeterms between 2000 and 2015 then we hadlifted people out of poverty in the sumtotal of human endeavor before that andit's quite clear that the reason forthat was thatfewer countries pursued absolutelycounterproductive economic policies ofthe type that were put forward let's sayby the Communists when the Cold War wasraging and so you saw all over the worldincluding in places likecommunist China thatthere was a radical move towardssomething approximating free market andfree trade between individuals and insome countries that was implemented moreeffectively than others but wherever itwas implemented at leastquasi-effectively people immediatelystopped starvingand soand I'm I'm trying to make a case inrelationship to the anti-capitalism solet's say that you are a genuine classicleftist and you are actually concernedwith the poor especially remediation ofabsolute poverty and you're looking atthe data and you see that after theSoviet Union collapsed and there werefewer countries turning to communistDogma to formulate their economicpolicies and more countries started todevelop started to participate in thebroad free market that we drove povertydown to its lowest levelum in absolute numbers or in in relativenumbers certainly than we'd ever seenbefore in history and so then againwe're back to the same issue if thespread of free marketuh policiesremediates absolute poverty which itclearly does and in a staggeringly rapidmanner then what in the world is drivingthe anti-capitalist ethos you know youyou said that there's this there's thisunderlying metaphor of nature assomething like fragile virgin rightcontinually yeah what renderedsusceptible to our rat to our raping andpillaging so there's a weird metaphorlurking at the bottom of all that butgiven the overwhelming data thatsomething approximating free marketfreeze people from absolute poverty andthen conjoining that with theobservation that richer people actuallycare more about the environment you'releft again with this question of what inthe world is motivating this there'ssome deep hatred it's like a deep hatredfor Humanity itself but even at theexpense of the planet and so I stillstruggle with trying to comprehend thatit's there's a kind of existential guiltthere for the for the crime of existenceitself it's something like thatI mean I think one there's one reallypowerful uh fact about the increase inprosperity that I draw attention to alot in fossil future because I thinkit's very notable so I I point out I wasborn in 1980 since 1980 we've had we'vegone from more than four in ten peopleliving on less than two dollars a dayand this is adjusted for inflation toone intent so as you said this is thegreatest alleviation of poverty in humanhistory now what's really interesting isif you survey and this was done in theUK you might have seen this before butif there's a survey of college-educatedadults in the UK about what has happenedto extreme poverty over the past 30 or40 years and this is just you know anobjective documented thing there's noquestion and so what happened is only 12percent of people thought it got betterright 55 of people thought it got worseand the rest thought it stayed the sameand it just shows you the level ofmiseducation about this issue and I dothink a lot of it is the modernanti-human environmental movementbecause what they've done is they'vetaught us that our impact ruins theplanet and so we just assumed thatbecause the world used a lot more fossilfuels particularly China and India didwhich drive with which drove much of theincrease in prosperity they just assumethat the world is worse and and what Icall I don't use this term in moral casebut I use it in fossil future ourknowledge system so the institutions werely on for expert knowledge andguidance they've done a they've totallyfailed at educating us about how muchthe world has improved from a humanperspective and this goes back to myargument that the anti-humanenvironmental movement they're trying topretend to be pro-human so they don'twant us to know that the Earth is a muchbetter place than ever to live theydon't want us to know that climatedisaster deaths are way down they don'twant us to know about the decline inextreme poverty because it totallychallenges their narrative that impactin general and fossil fuels inparticular are bad and if we recognizedhow vital fossil fuels are then we wouldbe really afraid of these proposals toget rid of fossil fuels in the next 27years in a world that needs far moreenergy and unfortunately we're startingto realize this involuntarily becausethese policies just implemented onepercent these anti-fossil fuel policiesjust implemented a one percent successrate

saidthat the planet is getting better let'ssay from a human perspective and sowe've looked at metrics like the radicaldecrease in absolute privation but letwe can turn our attention momentarily tothe evidence that in many ways andsomewhat paradoxically and perverselythe planet actually seems to be doingbetter from the natural perspective toonow you know I have been concerned aboutI have believed for a long time that oneof our focal concerns might beon the environmental front mightappropriately be something likeremediation of of misuse of oceanicresources because I think we've done apretty cataclysmic jobof protecting our our especially our ourour Coastal our Coastal lands and theand the Shelf environments just offshoreof the continents where pretty much allthe fish are I think we've done acatastrophic job of managing that andthere are genuine environmental problemsum that I think sensible people shouldtake into account but you know I waslooking at a graph this week and I'veI've known about this phenomena forquite a while phenomenon for quite awhilethat again in the last 15 yearsa surface areatotaling 15 of the entire planet hasgreenedI mean that is that's an area that'slarger than the continental UnitedStates and it's so let's let's walkthrough that for a minute so just soeveryone who's listening is clear in thelast 15 yearsthe planet has not got less greenit's got more green and not only alittle bit more greenstunningly more green 15 percent inessentially in 15 years and that's anarea bigger than the continental UnitedStates and that's happened pretty mucheverywhere in the world and then youmight say well where is that happeningand perversely and contrary to allpredictions it's happening in the drierareas of the planet especially insemi-arid areas and here's the reasonum soplants have to breathe and to breathethey have to open pores on their surfaceand the problem for plants when theybreathe with these pores is that theyalso allow water to evaporate from theirinternal structures and so the lesscarbon dioxide in the air the more theplants have to open their pores and thatmeans the more susceptible they are todrying out and that means that theystruggle to exist in semi-arid areas nowwhat's happened as a consequence ofincreased carbon dioxide production isthat plants can breathe easier and sothey don't have to open their pores tothe same degree and what's that whatthat has meant is that the very desertareas at least the semi-arid areas thatthe climate apocalypse were claimingwould expand and spread so thedesertification of the world the exactopposite has happened and the SaharaDesert for example has shrunk to quite astunning degree and not only is theplanet 15 greener than it was in 2000but but there are more trees in thenorthern hemisphere than there were ahundred years ago and as well as theplanet Greeningand and so you can think about that as avictoryon the objective front for the naturalworld at the same time the planet hasgreen because it's easier for plants tosurvive our food crops have become muchmore productivefor exactly the same reasons and so ascarbon dioxide output has increased theplanet has got not only has the planetgot Greener it's got greener in thedriest areas which is absolutelystunning and remarkable and one of theconsequences of that increased screeningis that are agriculture production hasbecome not less efficient but much moreefficient and so I'm really wrestlingwith how to conceptualize thatparticular I just thought of an idea Ijust thought of an idea I've neverthought of this before so we're justtrying it right now but I think I thinkmaybe we can think of three conceptionsof the earth which capture everythingwe're talking about so my primaryconception is is evaluating the Earthfrom the perspective of humanflourishing how how hospitable to humanbeings is it and this includes like alush green beautiful world for us toenjoy for many reasons you've talkedabout but then the second one could belooking at the Earth in terms of justpure biological productivity so just noteven focusing on humans just how muchlife is on the planet and this is thiscaptures what you just mentioned withRising CO2 levels making a GreenerPlanet but then the third one and Ithink this is really the core of themodern environmental movement is a is anunimpacted Planet so you're notoptimizing for biological productivityyou're optimizing for minimum symbolimpact and I think that is really thecore of the modern environmentalmovement it's not this just blanketCollective desire for as much life aspossible and we're somehow getting inthe way of that it's specificallyagainst us and I think you brought upthe perfect example which is the climatecatastrophe movements total non-interestin kind of the obvious biologicalproductivity benefits of more CO2 andthis was not shocking or stunning thisis exactly what was predicted by thepeople who discovered the greenhouseeffect when they discovered thegreenhouse effect they said this isgoing to on its own make the earth amuch more Lush a much more Lush placethey you know they speculated like thefruits are going to be bigger andeverything is going to be Lush becausewe're going to have more farmland andmore biological and it's kind of obviousif you have a warmer world with more CO2it's a more Tropical World with morelife it's a more green world in the Lifesense of Korean and yet the greenmovement hates it because we caused itso they can see no good in anythingthing we caused even when it leads tomore biological productivity so I thinkwhat you're bringing up really showsit's fundamentally an anti-humanmovement not a pro life of any kindright right okay but let's let's talkabout that idea of impact it's like wellwhat is this hypothetical perfect worldthat exists statically that would bepristine and morally valuable in theabsence of human beings I mean the thebiosphere is a dynamic Place obviouslyover any time scale and there's shift inwhat constitutes quote the environmentthere seems to be this presumption thatat some point in the pastwhen there was minimal human activitythe Earth was somehow optimized in thebiological but also the moral sense andthat any change in that whatsoever inany direction hence climate change let'ssay rather than global warming anychange in that whatsoever is to beregarded axiomatically as evil but whatthat essentially means as far as I cantell the ineluctableconclusion that has to be drawn fromthat proposition is that any humanactivity whatsoever is to be regarded asevilon on the face of it it doesn't matterwhat it doeseven if it increases bio even if itincreases total biological flourishingin terms of like let's say the netmetric tonnage of of biological life onthe planet and so that's also perversebecause that is definitely a game thatnone of us can win if the a prior ruleis no matter what you do you're evilthen the only solution to that is wellhow about a hell of a lot fewer of youbut then you say well what's thatsupposed to serve because if what we'redoing now is actually making the planetmore green and I'm saying that verycarefully because I know that that's nota sufficient metric I am very concernedwithissues let's say or conscious of issuesthat are relevant like the potentialloss of a diver of biodiversity and alsothe overfishing of the oceans let's sayso even although the planet is becomingGreener that doesn't mean there thatthere are no mistakes we're making onthe environmental front but thosemistakes have to be differentiated outand they're all addressable and you knowas we get richer too and we can do morewith less and our agriculture becomesmore efficient if we can manage thatthat also means even by the standards ofthe environmentalists themselves thatwe'll be able to set aside reasonablylarge tracts of land and water tomaintain them in something approximatinga pristine and untouched State I meanthat's certainly something that shouldbe done on the uh on the oceanicmanagement front I mean the data that Iknow suggests that if weset aside a certain percentage of thecoastal area as Marine protected areasand that might not be the most efficientway to manage the oceans but it's notbad that we'll reap the benefits ofhaving untouched nature so to speakwhich is a an aesthetic and economic andenvironmental good but will alsobe able to replenish the oceans in amanner that would be economicallyproductive and so well like why can'twhy the hell can't we have our cake andeat it too that is we can help peoplebecome rich with the provision of ofplentiful energy and then we can putaside tracks of the world so thatthey're relatively untouched so thatbiology can do its thing and like whatthe hell is the problem with thatprecisely well it's it's so I thinkyou're pointing to something really goodand something really bad somethingreally good is why my my new book iscalled fossil future why Global humanflourishing requires more oil coal andnatural gas not less but part of it itdoes talk about we can you know we canincrease all of these biological thingswe can have a much more lush world wecan enjoy nature much more this isfundamentally good news the more energywe have the more control we have overEarth and the more we can makeeverything about it better for ourpurposes including aesthetic things thatpoor people can't possibly be confusedby but the bad thing here is it's areally highlighting the nihilism of thisview that human impact is bad and againI I really think it's the view is notthat we want a lush environment andhuman beings are getting in the way ofthat we want biological productivity andhuman beings are getting away because asyou're pointing out they are opposingall human impact including obviousthings that make the world better and soit really is the view that if we did itit's bad and you ask something like whatis it serving but it's a nihilistic viewso it's not really serving anything evenwhen you think when you think aboutunimpacted nature it's not thisbeautiful thing for us to enjoy it'ssupposed to be protected from us sothat's really the view including ourenjoy with this evil of course orangeour enjoyment is of no consequencewhatsoever and and in fossil future andin moral case I have a lot of quotesfrom the leaders where they'lloccasionally let this slip out where oneguy for example who was reviewing Billmckibben's book the end of nature talksabout you know like a flourishing biossphere is more important me moreimportant to me than one human or abillion of them yeah yeah let me readthat let me read that I've got it righthere so this is something that you citein your 2014 book I'm going to just readit so everybody can hear it and I wouldI wouldask everyone who's listening to reallythink about this because this gets tothe strikes to the core of the issue asfar as I can tell sofor example this is from your book in aLos Angeles Times reviewof the end of natureKevin's influential book of 25 years agopredicting catastrophic climate changeDavid M Graber research biologist forthe National Park Service wrote thissummary of mckibben's messageMcKibben is a biocentristand so am Iwe are not interested in the utility ofa particular species or a free-flowingriver or ecosystemto mankindthey have intrinsic value more value tome than another human being that's avery interesting thing to say or abillion of them which is also a veryinteresting thing to say human happinessand certainly human fecundity are not asimportant as a wild and Healthy Planetare no social scientists who remind methat people are part of naturebut that isn't truesomewhere along the line at about abillion years ago maybe half that wequit the contractand became a cancerwe had become a plague upon ourselvesand upon the Earthit is cosmically unlikely that thedeveloped world will choose to end itsorgy of fossil fuel consumptionand the third world it's suicidalconsumption of landscapeuntil such time as Homo sapiens shouldDesi decide to rejoin naturesome of us can only hopefor the right virus to come along youknow I cannot understand how anybody whoispositively predisposed to Children let'smight we might say could read somethinglike that and not be absolutely shockedto their core I mean so let's walkthrough the claims the first claim isa an untouched natural landscape of anysizewhatever untouched means is morevaluable in and of itself than anyindividual human being or any group ofpeople no matter how large the numberokay so the implication there isany number of human beings could besacrificed in order to preserve anygeographically demarcated natural zoneof any size so that's a yes a standardof comparative value and thenthe cancer metaphor well human beingshave deviated from the natural orderwhatever that natural order is whateverour deviation consists of and we'vedeviated the same way a cancer deviateso now the metaphor is human beingsequal cancerand that's that's a hell of a metaphorbecausewhat we do with cancer is Strive toeradicate it so these metaphors havedeep motivational significance so that'sa little bit on the appalling side let'ssay and it's grounded in a very narrowmalthusian view of the world which isthat we're something like yeastcancer let's say and left to our owndevices will multiply unchecked until wedevour everything and perish which is apretty dismal and only vaguelybiologicallyum centered view of how human beingsconduct themselves because we're notyeast in a bloody petri dish we're notyeast and the world isn't a petri dishlet's put it that way and then you addto that though the closing statementwhich is something like those of us whoare properly oriented in our moralEndeavor in relationship to thenon-human world can only sit and praythat the right virus comes along so thatwhat so that we're we're radicallydepopulated to to what to what degreedown to the half a billion people thatthe world can hypothetically sustainit's like every single bit of that to mereeks of aun underlying and barely veiledbrutal genocidal impulseI I agree and what I want to drawattention to is that this mentalitydiluted or not to various degrees isleading our thinking about what to doabout fossil fuels which is anexistential issue for the world becausethe reason I go into this particularlyin fossil future is the point I'm makingis that the people and institutions weretrusting to evaluate what to do aboutthis source of energy that powers theworld that also emits CO2 and impactsthe climate those people are not makingthat evaluation by anything resemblingthe goal of advancing human flourishingon Earth they are pursuing to asignificant degree this goal ofeliminating human impact on earth andthe economist George riesman had thisarticle a long time ago called thetoxicity of environmentalism and onepoint he made that I never forgot is hesaid listening to a modernenvironmentalist is like listening to adoctor who's on the side of the germssomebody who doesn't have your bestinterests at heart and as an example uhone of the people I pick on verydeservedly in fossil future is MichaelMann who's a climate scientist andactivist who is one of the leadingadvisors and if you look at Michael Mannstatements one thing he has said is theideal population for Earth is a billionpeople yeah yeah how can you possiblysay that there are eight billion peoplelike how can you possibly look at Earthand say oh yeah it's too many peoplethat has a murderous impulse to it ifyou just look at the Earth and you sayoh yeah seven billion people should goand what I point out with Michael Mannis that if you look at how he'sevaluating the issue he's totallyindifferent to the benefits of fossilfuels he has a whole book people canlook it up called the madhouse effectabout fossil fuels and climate and hedoesn't mention any benefits of fossilfuels for example he talks aboutagriculture and fossil fuels he onlytalks about negatives he doesn't oncemention diesel-powered uh agriculturalequipment or natural gas derivedfertilizer even though those make itpossible for us to feed need 8 billionpeople so what we have is an anti-humanmentalityso so some of those who are listeninglikely don't know thatthe the very survival of about fourbillion people so half the world'spopulationdepends in no small part on theprovision of ammonia as fertilizer andammonia is primarily derived fromnatural gas and so what that means isthe not just on the energy front let'spoint this out is that the the very foodthat is provisioning half the world'spopulation is a direct consequence ofthe cheap and easy accessibility ofnatural gas and soand so what what's the idea here thatwe're supposed to reduce our provisionof fossil fuels and what are we going todo on the ammonia on the ammonia frontwe're going to drive the price offertilizer ever more Skyward well if wedo that because that would be theconsequence of reducing the plentifulsupply of natural gas if we do that thenwhat will happen is clearly food willget more expensive and soil energy butfood will definitely get more expensiveand so what that will mean is that hugeswath of the world's population that'sliving on the edge where they can justright now afford enough food to feedthemselves so they don't suffer theconsequences of nutritional privation oreven die a huge proportion of thosepeople are going to be tipped back intoabsolute poverty their children aregoing to be intellectually stunted as aconsequence and they might well starveand then you think well why would we dothat and if the answer is well you knowsome of us really believe that theplanet should only have a billion peopleon it if that if we have to have anypeople at all then well maybe this isall part of the unconscious drivetowardsand and conscious drive to some degreetowardsreducing the planet's population nomatter what the price may be and thenyou see how people justify this they saythings like well you know if we don'ttake emergency action right now whichmeans let's make the poor even poorerthen the poor are really going to suffera hundred years from now and I thinklook I don't have a lot of confidence inyour ability to predict even a decadeout much less a hundred years with yourunstable economic models that arepredicated on an equally unstableclimate model so we can forget aboutyour capacity to prognosticate 100 yearsdown the road but what you're sayingessentially is that the hypotheticalpoor that occupy my utopian imaginationare much more important than the actualpoor right now who will definitely dieif we Implement our higher energyprice inducing hypotheticalenvironmental policies you know and oneof the things that strikes me is soutterly absurdives partly why I foundyour book so interesting is that somehowthe people who are making such argumentshave gained the moral upper hand eventhough you don't have to scrape beneaththe surface very far to see not only thegenocidal metaphor and the genocidalintent but the actual genocidal impactof these policies because we'redefinitely tipping people back intoabsolute privationwe'll be right back to our conversationwith Alex Epstein in just a moment firstwe wanted to give you a sneak peek atJordan's new documentary logos andliteracyI was very much struck by how thetranslation of the biblical writingsjump started the development of literacyacross the entire world illiteracy wasthe norm the pastor's home was the firstschool and every morning it would beginwith singing the Christian faith is asinging religion probably 80 percent ofscripture memorization today exists onlybecause of what is sung this is amazinghere we have a Gutenberg Bible printedon the Press of Johannscience and religion are opposing forcesin the world but historically that hasnot been the case now the book isavailable to everyone from Shakespeareto modern education and medicine andscience to to civilization itself it isthe most influential book in all historyand hopefully people can walk away withat least a sense of thatyeah there's a lot of there's a lot ofreally interesting stuff going on I meanI think one thing why do they have themoral High ground and this is somethingas is really a core mission of mine tocorrect is that as I mentioned beforethey really owned the issue of a goodenvironment starting in the 60sincluding loving nature including caringabout clean air and clean water and morerecently caring about safety fromclimate and that the pro-capitalism sidereally didn't concern them to concernthemselves too much with thisrhetorically at least and so theanti-capitalist side was able to ownthis issue and when you own something asimportant as our environment and ourplanet you do get the moral High groundand then they supplemented this withthis false alternative of you are eithera climate change believer who hatesfossil fuels or you're a climate changedenier who thinks fossil fuels are okayso they created this total falsealternative which made no sense becausewhat makes sense with climate impact isto weigh it along with the benefits offossil fuels you cannot judge aprescription drug by only looking at notnegative side effects and you can'tjudge fossil fuels by only looking atnegative side effects or exaggeratingnegative side effects you have to lookcarefully at our climate impactsnegative and positive and then weighthem against the benefits that come withfossil fuels including all the benefitsthat protect us from climate so there'sthis false alternative so what they didis they owned the morality of caringabout our environment and they owned theclaim to science because the climatechange denial thing so-called didn'tmake much sense because it's prettyobvious we impact climate at least somebut so doing those two things they theyowned this issue so people think well ifI want to be a good person if I want agood planet and I want to be pro-sciencethen I have to hate fossil fuels and alot of what I've tried to do and I thinkMichael schellenberger and Bjornlombborg and Steve Cooney I think whatwe've tried to do is look at climate ina humanistic full context way and we'rebreaking this false alternative which isa lot of the reason we get a lot ofhostility so you said something therethat's very psychologically interestingso you said said if I want to be a goodpersonbecause the environmentalists havecaptured this pro-planet narrative if Iwant to be a good person then I have tobuy the human beings are bad for theplanet narrative but I'd like to takethat apart a little bit toobecause it's not exactly true what yousaidthe truth of the matter is somethinglike if I want to take a shortcut to agood personwithout having to being a good personwithout having to put into the processany real time and effort so that wouldmean actually understanding the issuesthat are associated with EnvironmentalManagement and economicsustainability which is unbelievablycomplicated I mean Bjorn well in you tooschellenberger spent their whole livesdevoted to that endeavor trying to Wadethrough the complexities it's actuallyreally difficult todevelop a sophisticated and genuinelymoral stance on the environment and theeconomy it takes years and years of workand it's also extremely difficult to bea good person and merely feeling sorryfor the planet does not make you a goodperson in fact what it makes you is ashallow narcissist who's using the easyidentification with a genocidal ideologyto elevate yourself in the moralhierarchy and we we see people who arepeddling this this Dreadfulstory to young people and offering theman easy shortcut to somethingapproximating easily trumpeted moralvirtue and that's the sort of moralvirtue that you can post on yourFacebook page when you claim that whileyou're anti-capitalist and you're infavor of the planet and therefore all ofa sudden you're actually a moral actorand someone to be regarded withadmiration and none of that's truebecause it's actually it's verydifficult to be a good personbut it's very powerful that I agreeentirely but it is very powerful and onething I talk about in fossil future andthis is a big mission of mine is themoral Monopoly of what I call the moralcase for eliminating fossil fuels has tobe broken and yeah when you have what Icall a moral Monopoly you basically geta halo over your head for saying I hatefossil fuels I care about the climate Icare about the plant you don't need todo anything you just need to expressthis sentiment it doesn't matter if wesee you can fly on private jets you canlive any lifestyle you want as long asyou say this you get this Halo and theother side gets devil horns on theirhead but part of what's happened withwhat I call the energy humanistsincluding me and Bjorn and Michael andSteve is that we have now shown thatactually quote saving the planet intheir false view is hurting billions ofpeople and dooming them to poverty andactually making our our environmentworse and hurting biology and so nowthey hate that that's why there's suchvicious attacks because their racket iscoming to a close you you want it to bea controversial the first thing beforewinning a debate is actually creating adebate there hasn't even been a debateover the morality of fossil fuels Intelfairly recently and once the debate iscreated that that easy claim to Virtuewill disappear and those people willjust go pick the the next easy thing tojoin yeah well you said that all youhave to do is Express the sentiment thatyou care for the planet so that'ssomething approximating a feeling or asubjective state of mind let's say yesI'm a good person because I feel empathyfor the planet which is a pretty damnlow resolution definition ofimplementable morality but you know it'stied in with something else too soimagine you're trying desperately tomake that case that the reason I'm goodis because I feel sorry for thingsincluding the planetwell then you have to alsobuttress that claim with the insistencethat sentiment subjective sentimentitself is the only valid Arbiter ofreality and so that's something like Ifeel therefore I am and I see that thisin this entire modern movement thatinsists that identity is nothing otherthan subjective feeling is actuallyassociated in a perverse manner withthis ability to justify a claim to moralsuperiority by appeal to sentiment it'slike it's people see a picture of a likea bedraggled kitten on on on theinternet and they go ah and they thinkthat because they have that reflexiveresponse which you know has a certainmoral virtue that all of a suddenthey're morally admirable people andthat's a lovely thing to believe and youcan extend that to something like wellI'm so concerned about the planet that Ican barely sleep at night it's like wellfair enough that might be an indicatorof your moral virtue although I suspectnot but the real question is do youactually know anything about the problemhave you spent any work real work indifferentiating your knowledge of theproblem are you taking any concretesteps whatsoever to solve it apart fromhand waving sentimentally and do youhave metrics in place that actually helpyou measure whether or not what you'redoing has a beneficial impact and that'salso complex that if you bring twopeople's attention the necessity ofthinking it through all they do is getirritated at you like they get irritatedwith Bloomberg's a classic examplebecause he's the person I think and I'dlike your opinion on this you know Idon't think there is anybody who's amore effective advocate for genuineprogress on the environmental front thanBjorn Lombard he's thought it through asfar as I can tell more deeply thananyone else perhaps in the world andit's stunning to me the degree to whichhis ideals fail to gain traction and Ithink partly it's because he makes theissue complicated right he says well wedon't have just one problem too muchcarbon we have like20 problems or a hundred andand they all need to be attended to butwe need to rank order them and we haveto do that in a methodologicallyrigorous manner it's like well we don'twant to do any of that we just want tofeel good about what we feel good aboutand we want to make claim that thatmakes us morally virtuous and it'scertainly the case as far as I can tellthat our Educational Systems areenticing young people to adopt exactlythat attitude and then to also engage inthis demonization that you describedso I think one one powerful Dynamic withthis this free virtue that you get byjust saying I care about this issue Icare about the planet is that it's beengiven the stamp of science because it'sconsidered scientific to just say heythe planet is being destroyed by fossilfuels we need to do something about itand it's really as long as you feel someway or you vote some way that isconsidered totally sufficient there'snothing to think about but so it'sreally sad and shameful that science hasbeen has been stamped on this incrediblyirresponsible way of thinking and onething I've tried to do and I think Bjorndoes this but I I think I do it probablymost explicitly and I think it's veryvery important to do it explicitly is Ikeep talking about the benefits offossil fuels and how how the other sideis ignoring the benefits of fossil fuelso I go as far as to call the other sidefossil fuel benefit deniers I also callthem climate Mastery deniers becausethey deny our ability to master climatedanger and I think people can really getthat we're thinking about this issue ina way that makes no sense because iswe're only looking at the negative sideeffects of fossil fuels we're notlooking at the benefits and if you lookat my work the moral case for fossilfuels fossil future it's reallystressing the goodness of fossil fuelsnot just fossil fuels aren't as bad asyou think but they're an actual positivegood and I've seen you make this case aswell I think it's very very powerfulit's imagine my book had been calledfossil fuels aren't quite as bad as youthink it would have made no impactwhat's really needed we've had thisinverted morality that said that thatsays that food is poison and poison isfood and I think it's not enough to justto say oh they go too far it's say nothey are attacking something good andonce you are right positive case forfossil fuels the other side goes on thedefensive if you watch what happens whenI debate when people will debate me theydon't really have an answer to lookingat the full picture their answer is callme a climate change denier try to smearme but they can't answer the argument ofif you look at the full context benefitsand side effects of what's good forhuman flourishing fossil fuels areincred incredibly good and will remaingood for the foreseeable future and it'sa pretty simple that that climate changedenier phrase is a real interesting onetoo because that's a phrase that's somanipulatively propagandistic that it'salmost incomprehensible I mean thereason that that phrase emerged isbecause there's been we've developed auniversal consensus that denying thereality of the Holocaust was a moralcrimeand so the propagandists took a leapfrom that page and said well the peoplewho are denying the cataclysmic realityof climate change are as morallyculpable as those who deny the Holocaustwhich implies that they're as culpableas the Nazis who run the death camps andthat's a pretty decent smear and thenyou might say well what's the moraladvantage to doing that and so the firstthing you might point out is well youget to have all the unearned moralvirtue that goes along with saying thatjust because you're sentimental aboutthe planet in some vague way that you'renow a moral Paragon and that solves allyour moral problems and thenconveniently at the same time you get toidentify a group of people who areessentially satanic in their motivationsand so that would be the climate changedeniers and so that entire problem ofevil which you no longer contend with inyour own life because you're on the sideof the moral is dumped at the feet ofthe people that you deem as enemiesthat's that form of skate skatescapegoating that Renee Gerard talkedabout and so young people are beingenticed to do two things is one is to toadopt it three things to adopt anextremely simple-minded view of theproblems and opportunities that confrontussecond to claim a completely unearnedmoral virtue merely on the basis of avague sentimentand third and more dangerously tolocalize the problem of evil in theminds and Souls of the people who arehypothetically opposed to theirself-aggrandizing sentiment and thecombination of those three moral errorsis really dangerously toxic and thatdangerous toxicity I would say ismanifesting itself in such things asthese this idiot insistence let's say inthe UKbecause they're suffering from this morethan any other place now maybe exceptGermany on the moral benefits of animpossible net zero right the the rubberis really starting to hit the road inthe last couple of years as Energyprices have spiked out of Out Of Reachof many peopleand the unreliability of thesehypothetically benevolent Renewables hasbecome more and more self-evidentand so we're walking a very dangerousmoral path here right easy moral virtuethe the our inability to point out thata lot of this moral virtue is driven byan unthinking ignorance combined withthis temptation to demonize those whowell like lomberg shellenberger youyou're a good example as well who arestanding up and saying hey wait a minuteeveryoneum we've lifted billions of people outof absolute privation and starvationas a consequence of the utilization offossil fuels and they're so fundamentalthat we can't shift away from themrapidly that's actually practicallyimpossible without tilting people intothe kind of abject poverty that's goingto cause widespread starvation it's likethat doesn't sound like a case beingmade by Satan to meno it's uh I mean I do think that theenergy crisis is an enormous EducationalOpportunity it's obviously a tragedy andit's as somebody who's been talkingabout this for 15 years and Advising inthe opposite direction it's very sad tosee be myself being right in terms of ifyou artificially restrict the supply offossil fuels in a world that needs moreenergy and you don't have a viablenear-term replacement then prices aregoing to Skyrocket including food pricesand the price of everything else likethis this was obvious that this wasgoing to happen and it's hard to see itbut at least the benefit is that peoplecan see that the establishment hasfailed that's the benefit of a crisispeople see the establishment has failedand the key is in my view two things oneis the right people need to beimplicated and the right people need tobe Vindicated and I say the right peopleneed to be implicated not as avindictive person at all but it's veryimportant when you have a crisis andthis happened with 9 11 happened withthe financial crisis you know you needto have some idea of who is responsibleand then who was right and gave usbetter advice if you look at today'senergy crisis the number one thing thatis scary about it is that it is a crisisthat has come from the from the Net Zeromovement not even only achieving onepercent of their goals so they have noteven reduced the supply of fossil fuelsI want to stress that again they haven'teven reduced the supply they just slowedits rate of growth they already wantedto dramatically reduce the supply thatwas their goal we were supposed to beusing way less fossil fuel by now theyjust slowed the growth and that wasenough to cause a global energy crisisin a world that needs far more energy sothat should really wake us up what if weactually start on their path of gettingrid of fossil fuels and again we have 27years now 27 years and less than a monthas we record this to achieve Net Zerowhich in effect means getting rid offossil fuels we could talk about offsetsand stuff but that doesn't work at anyscale that there's any evidence of soit's really this this homicidal movementin its in its consequences and I dothink people are waking up up andthey're particularly waking up to theidea that hey we ignored the benefits offossil fuels or what I call ourdesignated experts did this and thesepeople need to be jettisoned you cannotlisten to anybody about energy andclimate who ignores the benefits offossil fuels to billions of peoplebecause if you do you get an energycrisis and if we keep listening to themit's going to get a lot worsewell the other thing that you see beingthe drum being beaten on the side of theradical left for example is theanti-colonialumlet's say this continual trumpeting ofthe anti-colonial interference messageand so then I look at that and I thinkwell you give the devil is due and thefact that the world's cultures have comeinto contact with one another in adramatic way in the last 300 years hasproduced all sorts of consequences somepositive and some negativebut umon the anti-colonial front theenvironmental proposition and this ismostly coming from the radical left isthatthere's no possible way that the thirdworldinhabitants can be allowed much lessencouraged to develop a standard ofliving that in any manner approximatesthe profligate West is that we're richand you know maybe we should suffer fromthat a bit and maybe we should payreparations let's say but all those poorpeople who are desperately trying toclamber up the socioeconomic hierarchyso they don't die let's let's make thatperfectly clear they can't be allowed todo that because their environmentalfootprint will immediately become solarge that the planet itself will bedestroyed and so okay what's theconsequence of that well theconsequences of that is that they shouldbe poor and stay that way and shouldshut the hell up about it and should behappy about it and perhaps there shouldbe a hell of a lot fewer of them and ifthat doesn't trigger youranti-colonialist morality then you'vegot some serious thinking to do becauseI just don't understand at all how it isthat those of us in the wealthy West andthis would certainly include those inthe chattering environmental glitteratiElite Class I have no sense whatsoeverhow they're in a moral position to belecturing the developing World about howthey should accept limits to growthwhich means for example that theirchildren won't have access to enoughnutrition to even optimize their theirbrain development as they mature it'slike oh that's the price those peopleget to pay a those people those poorpeople in developing countries who don'tget to be wealthy and and by wealthymeans have enough to eat and haveschools to send their children and we inthe Western World we can sit on our highhorse and say well we used fossil fuelsand oops sorry about that and all thecarbon but you bastards you can justyou can just accept your lot and if youstop breeding so God damn much thatwould be a good thing too now how thatis it's Colonial to a degree that'soverwhelming is beyond mewell it's it is and I think it's a veryvery powerful argument it's been one ofthese things that has been ignoredbecause the priorities of the modernenvironmental movement are not what theysay and I would say more broadly theanti-capitalist movement they claim tobe concerned about the poor but ifyou're concerned about the poor and youknow that fossil fueled productivity hasbrought an unprecedented number ofpeople out of poverty in recent decadesyou would think about how do we expandthat how do we replicate what happenedin China what happened in India you knowsome changes to it obviously but how dowe how do we you know they use seventimes more fossil fuels compared to four40 years ago like it's it's obviouslyfueled their productivity and theirprosperity why don't we do more of thatand yet there's been no attention paidin the culture to the energy poorthere's no attention paid to the factthat we have three billion people whouse less electricity than one of ourrefrigerators uses we have a third ofthe world using wood and animal dog toeat their homes and to cook their foodand in terms of you're mentioningwealthy peoplethree quarters of the world uses anamount of energy that that we wouldconsider totally unacceptable in the U.Sor Canada or anything resembling that soonce these facts are pointed out it isobvious that there is a moral imperativeto do at least nothing to get in the wayof peopleat least that and it's clear that theanti-fossil fuel movement is absolutelygetting in the way they're trying todestroy all loans to fossil fuels therethey're trying to encourage them to usethings that will not actually work forthem they're trying to for examplethroughout Africa limit oil and gasdevelopment even though that's a hugepotential source of prosperity butthey're not winning this argument oncesunlight has been exposed and I had apersonal experience I don't know if youheard about this but the Washington Posttried to basically cancel my book fossilfuture uh back before it came out theygot a copy of the book they didn't readthe book which that I thought that wastheir job as journalists a report on abook from a major author instead whatthey tried to do is dig up what I hadwritten in college where I had said veryspecifically the poor world needs morecapitalism and more individualism whichI stand by but they somehow tried toportray that as colonialism but here'sthe key their whole argument was AlexEpstein doesn't really care about thepoor so you don't have to listen to hisarguments about the poor needing fossilfuels this is a bizarre ad hominem onits face it's completely the opposite ofthe truth but it was notable to me howthey had no answer to this argument thatpoor people need fossil fuels and thatthe anti-fossil fuel movement hurts thepoor people most so I think that reallyshows the power of this argumentlet's delve into that issue of caringabout the poor because I don't thinkthat it is really all that wise for anyof us to jump up and down about how muchwe care for the poor because if youcared for the poor you'd be out theredoing something with your life todirectly benefit the poor and that turnsout to be extremely high I have to Idon't mean I don't mean you I don't meanyou oh okay and speaking more generallyit's not that easy to care about thepoor and so I think that any of us whoTrump at the idea that we truly careabout the poor should be very carefulabout that but having said that I wouldalso say we could though say even if wedon't care about the poor any more thanthe typical somewhat selfish human beingwe could at least get the hell out oftheir way when they're trying to clambertheir way up to socioeconomic hierarchyand that was the case that you made justa few minutes ago is that we could atleast in the west not Implement policiesthat actuallyinterfere in a serious manner with theattempts of the developing world to liftthemselves out of absolute privation wecould at least get the hell out of theroad and we wouldn't have to do that byhand waving about how moral we are inour care for the poor we can say wellwe're relatively disinterested atminimum but we won't go out of our wayto make your lives more miserable thanthey have to be well you use your ownefforts to acquire for yourself some ofthe things that we've managed to acquirewe can't even do thatI think it's a great point and so for meyeah I don't want to act like I'm justministering to every poor person of theworld or this kind of thing I mean lookI I live in a free country I love doingwork that I find really interesting andI love that it benefits a lot of peopleincluding some of the poorest people inthe world and one the particular way inwhich I identify with the poorest peoplein the world is with the lack of freedombecause I really think about what whatwould it like be like to not be born inthe U.S whatever advantages I had beingborn in the U.S is by far the greatestand I really think about you know howcan more people be born into that andreally the number one thing we need todo to do is spread good ideas and notspread bad ideas and and this is wherethe anti-fossil fuel movement is sodestructive particularly you've probablyseen this recent climate reparationsthing yeah which is saying hey we owethe poor world and I I wrote about thisrecently people can see it atenergytalkingpoints.com which is where Ipost my new stuff but the there'sthere's the the idea yeah that we shouldfeel guilty for ruining the world and Ibelieve we've made the world better foreveryone including the poor but theother element that is obviously wrong iswhat is happening is we are payingpeople off usually dictators off to notuse fossil fuels so we are paying themto deprive people of the crucial freedomto get prosperity and that is justtotally shameful and that is absolutelyinterfering in the lives of the world'spoorest peopleright so with our so-called climatereparations that are going to be devotedto the the governments of third worldcountries primarily we're going to bepropping up frequently brutalquasi-dictatorships and bribing them tokeep their populations poor yes so thatwe don't save the planetthat's our planthat is that is that is the plan I meanagain it's it's not a movement thatactually has any kind of goal andstrategy long term it's really justhostility toward any impact and at themoment it's CO2 emission so anythingthat has CO2 missions you hate butobserve look there's no enthusiasm fornuclear right which you would expectthem to love because it doesn't emit CO2there's hatred for nuclear there'shatred for hydro and there's hatred formining which is necessary for solar andwind which require way more mindmaterials than anything else there's soit's really an anti-impact movementthat's just hostile to any human impactand just nihilistically and randomlypursues that with no strategy and nothinking about the future and thismentality is leading the world this iswhat I call our knowledge system it isblindly pursuing this destructiveanti-human path with no strategy okay solet's let's delve into that a little bitthat motivation for that so I'm gonnaplay devil's advocate here a bit and andlet you you respond to it sothe first thing we might point out isthat the the human proclivity forsomething approximating unspoilednatural Vistas actually seems to have amoral element and a biologically rootedmoral element so for example our ouraesthetic preferences seem to beassociatedwith something like preference fornatural landscapes that are verdant andgreen and potentially productive inrelationship to Agriculture and and theflourishing of let's say edible animalswith enough water we like Landscapesthat look like that we think they'rebeautiful and the idea that we mightprefer those if they wereunspoiled is also worth delving into tosome degree becausewe do need to live inbalanced Harmonywith such environments so that we don'tdestroy the very virtue that they theyimplicitly contain and so in ouraesthetic preferences tilt Us in thatdirection and so we have a bit of abiological tilt towards not wanting togum up and pollute the worksokay so so there's that and then we alsohave this moral sense thatwe have a moral obligation right and sothe moral obligation isto be gratefulto be cognizant of our unearnedprivilege and so for you that would bethe fact that you were born in theUnited States and that you were aaccidental beneficiary of all the workthat had gone into that Great Societybefore you made your appearance on thescene and that there's a moralobligation on your part in some sense todo something about that right and so andthat can both of those can be warped thewarping of the first one is to push thatmoral and aesthetic sensibility to thepoint where we claim that any humaninteraction with that pristineenvironment whatsoever is tantamount toto to to to immoralityand on the second front it is thatthe way to atone for our privilege is bybeing guilty and stopping all activityso those things dovetail we might sayinstead that if we wanted togenuinely contend with the problem ofour unearned privilege and the fact thatyou know we walk on blood that is beingwe walk on land that is being soaked bythe blood of conflict for Generationsright there's a certain guilt in that acertain sense you might say even oforiginal sin is that we do have to atonebut the proper proposition on thesophisticated front would be somethinglike well we should atone by puttinginto place thoughtful and intelligentand genuinely pro-human environmentalslash economic policiesand we should atone in our private livesfor our unearned privilege by beingpeople whose moral striving is soadmirable that we've Justified theexistence of our privilegesand we shouldn't be taking the easy wayout and saying just because we'resentimental about Gaia means that we'vesomehow fulfilled our moral obligationwe're doing a very bad job of teachingyoung people this as far as I can tellso like the guilts there right the senseof original sin is there the sense thatwe're responsible for the atrocity ofhistory in some sense is there thatneeds to be contended with what we'reconstantly looking for easy ways out ofthe problem instead of actually tryingto address it head onwell let's start out with the the firstpart in terms of this this like sense ofwhat we like in natural landscapes andwe like life and so I certainly have aversion of this myself I mean I'm veryobsessed with the ocean and I spend waymore time Outdoors than most people andI just like I think people under ratebeing outdoors a lot and and you know Ilove seeing different kinds of animalsand their natural habitat so like Idefinitely experienced this but when Iwhen I think of it then what I thinkabout is in impacting the Earth we wantto make sure we impact the Earth in away that allows us to really enjoy thisand in fact have more of it there's alot of things we can do to make theEarth more beautiful and to enhance itwith respect to our aestheticsensibilities and I think the the bestthinker ever in this regard was FrankLloyd Wright because if you look at hisbuildings and how he approached it heloved nature but he also thought that wecould improve nature and that's reallywhat you're doing as a human being isyou're saying I can improve nature soyou're not hostile to nature but youview it as what I call Wild potential ithas the potential to be an amazing placefor us it has all these differentbuilding blocks and all these startingthings and some of them we want topreserve some of them we want to changea lot and even the things we want topreserve we want to make a lot moreaccessible to everyone which requireschanging a lot so I think of it as wecan do an even better job at making theEarth an amazing place to live but partof that is recognizing we've done areally good job in a lot of ways theEarth is so much of a better place tolive than it was 500 years ago 200 yearsago the world is is is you know it'snaturally it's naturally Dynamic it'sdeficient and it's dangerous it's likethose are three attributes that's why Icall it wild potential and so humanbeings have had to contend with that andto bring up fossil fuels our basic wayof contending with that is to try toproduce a lot of value that naturedoesn't produce for us nature producesnot very much value that we can use andit produces a lot of threats so we needproductive ability to create resourcesnature doesn't including to createresources that neutralize the differentthreats like creating irrigation toneutralize drought and what we do thatwith our productive ability but we'renaturally very physically weak beingsand so the key step is using machines toproduce far more value than our meagerphysical bodies can and that's whatwe've done with fossil fuels we've hadcost effective energy that has allowedsay the average American to have 75machine servants producing value so thatwe can do far more than we ever couldand we can do types of things that wenever could like no number of humanbeings can fly no number of human beingscan be an incubator which you know saveMillions incubators save millions oflives so we've made the Earth so much ofa better place and I think we can makeit even more beautiful and I think a lotof the specific things we create areugly and that's a shame but I think ofit as we've done a good job and we cando even better not that we're theseSinners who have ruined who ruineverything by touching it that is a thatis a hostile View and it's anunjustified view so I think we can bemore like Frank Lloyd Wright but weshould be proud of what we've done sofar in terms of obligation I mean I feelgratitude for it I don't feel likeanyone has really sinned or I've sinnedor but I feel like the obligation is tois to keep going is to keep trying tomake it better and better and I thinkjust by being a productive person that'sreally what you're doing but because Ithink about global issues I try toadvise people globallyso let me ask you about thispsychologically so obviously peoplethere are a lot of people particularlyyoung people perhaps who are bearing aheavy load of existential guilt for thefact of their very existence and so youjust made something approximating apro-human case and so I would ask you apsychological questionhow do you think you've conductedyourself in your own lifeeffectivelyso that that sense of existential guiltthat potential hostility towards humanendeavor itself or even human existencehas been ameliorated like what have youdone that you believe is sufficientlyvaluable to justify the cost of your ownexistencebut I guess why would I I don'tunderstand why I would feel it in thefirst place because the people who feelit have a very warped at least theenvironmental version we can talk aboutother versions but the environmentalslash climate version is this verywarped delicate nurture view of theearth that the Earth is stablesufficient and safe and our impact ruinsit and if you believe that and you hearall this propaganda then you think yeahwe're all we're all ruining the delicatenurturer but if if you have that viewit's a very damaging view but I don'thave the view so I don't I don'tunderstand why I would feel so bad yeahbut people that's the thing is that andI think we need to contend with thisright because people do have that viewand lots of people have it and it's easylet's say for educators who are pushingthis ideological agenda to capitalize onthe prevalence of that view that's whyI'm pointing to something like anintrinsic sense of original sin is thatwe have this sense as human beings ormany people do that in some real sensewe have to atone for the crime of ourexistence and I think there's somethingto that I think that we have to bear amoral burden that justifies the thecrime of our existence so to speak andthat would mean that we have to begenuinely well in your terminology wehave to be genuinely productive peoplelet's say we have to be genuinelyproductive people that are aiming upmaybe in relationship to such things asworking for the amelioration of absolutepoverty like there is a moral callingthere and I think that part I think ofit differently okay I think of itdifferently so I think of existence asan opportunity so I think of it as it'sjust this amazingly special thing thatyou know any of us exist in the firstplace I mean probably you think aboutthe probabilistic nature of it and Ifeel like being on Earth is just thisamazing opportunity and you can look athow different people have handled thatthroughout history and how they handleit today and I think a lot of peopletragically haven't made the most of itbut I think you can see certain thingsthat people do who have made the most ofit and find it fulfilling and for me oneof the observations is people who choosea certain kind of creative work it it ismakes a huge difference I'm guessingyou've experienced I've certainlyexperienced this in terms of justfinding something that creates value inthe world that really really works withhow you like to use your mind thethought process hopefully you get towork with certain kinds of people I meanthat's just part of it there are allkinds of other opportunities of beingalive so I don't think of it at all asoh it's we're guilty and this is bad Ithink the only guilt is wasting theopportunity that's that's where my kindof fear and guilt come in is like Iworry about oh did I waste theopportunity of being alive and part ofthat is of course you don't want to liveat the expense of others and ruin that'sanother way of wasting it but so I thinkof life as opportunity not as not asatonementwell right and we should also we canaddress there too the issue that if youconduct yourself successfully so let'ssay that you are as a consequenceprosperous there is also this underlyingpresumption that's generally unexaminedthat you had to do that at someoneelse's expense right it's something likea zero-sum game and that ties into thiswhole malthusian view that we're yeastin a Petri dish with finite resourcesand the truth of the matter I think isthatif you conduct yourselfin the highest manner properly then youend up being creatively productive in amanner that doesn't just benefit youselfishly but simultaneously benefitsmany other people and also facilitatestheir ability to do the same thing andso that's a vision that's a kind ofHarmony that's a high order ethicalcalling is you don't have to pursue yourcreative exploitation of possibility atthe cost of the possibility or at thecost of other people quite the contraryyou could increase the possibility whichwe could do on the natural front and youcould increase the ability of others toflourish simultaneouslyyes and I want to really highlightbecause earlier you responded you saidall these people have been have been uhimmersed in this what I call this Dogmathis delicate nurture dogma and I wouldadd a piece to this dog by it's it's theview that the Earth is delicate nurturethat's stable sufficient and safe andthen it goes along with what I call theparasite polluter view of human beingswhich you're getting at with themalthusian view so the view that all wedo with our impact is we take from theearth and we destroy it we make it uglywe disrupt it and this kind of thing andinsofar as you view the world this wayyou are going to have a bad life andyou're going to be really unhappybecause you're going to feel reallyguilty and you're going to feel reallypessimistic and you're going to believein all of these apocalyptic scenarios soit's it's why it's a fundamental thingthat needs to be done to re-educatepeople about the basic nature of Earthand the basic nature of human beings andreplace so delicate nurture with what Icall Wild potential and this parasitepolluter view with what I call theproducer improve overview we actuallyproduce value and we can improve theEarth and we can do even more and infossil future I talk about this is partof the human flourishing framework a keypart of how we have to think about thisissue is change our view of human beingsin Earth from an anti-human View to apro-human view and if once you changethat in people it is life-changingbecause it's their their whole view ofhow the world Works changes from thisterribly sad and destructive View to avery optimistic View and that that's oneof the things I'm grateful for is earlyon I learned pro-human environmentalphilosophy and that was a huge gift thatI got when I was 18. how did you learnthat why were you fortunate enough tolearn that well maybe we'll leave thatlook we we have to stop we have to stopthis part of we'll get into that in thenext part of our discussion so foreverybody who's watching and listening Ido an extra half an hourwith my guests on The Daily wire plusplatform as part of the arrangement thatI've made with them to increase theprofessional appearance and quality ofmy podcasts for example which as you arenoticing are still availableum on YouTube free for wide distributionI do an extra half an hour with people Iwould be interested and I'm going tocontinue to talkum to to Alexon The Daily wire plus platform abouthis philosophical Journey because you'vedefinitely taken an unpopular stance anda minority unpopular stance and you didthat pretty early 2014 is pretty earlygiven all things considered and and youdid it quite successfully you haven'tbeenparticularly effectively canceledinterestingly enough and I'd like tofind outwhat your pathway was to yourrealizations and how you managed thathello everyone I would
