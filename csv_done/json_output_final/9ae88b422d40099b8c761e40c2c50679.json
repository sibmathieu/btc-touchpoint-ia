guest today is dr kate shanahan afamily medicine md a new york timesbest-selling author a speaker and aconsultant she is well known for herrevolutionary approach to nutrition andher exposure to flaws in scientificstudies used in support of governmentdietary guidelinesdr shanahan is the author of food rules2021 deep nutrition from 2017 and adoctor's guide to healthy eating from2010.she joins us today for a discussion ofnutrition traditional diets and theimpact of seed oils on human healthon a personal notedr shanahan's second book deep nutritionwas enormously influential for meum my wife and i read it when my wifewas pregnant with our first child and itreallyshaped the way that i think aboutnutrition very significantly and it'shelped me i think and my wife make amuch better healthy choicesand i think the very interesting thingthatmy listeners will i find in her work isthe approach to nutrition as a long-termthing and nutrition is not just abouteating something that gets you throughthe daynutritionthe way dr shanahan explains it issomething that shapes your future andnot just your own future but also thefuture of your progeny and your childrenand so um as bitcoiners and as peoplewho listen to this podcast are usuallyum fond of thinking of the long term ithought it would be very valuable for usto uh listen to dr shanahan so thank youso much for joining us dr shanahanthanks so much it's exciting to be onyour showso um why don't you please uh begin withtelling us a little bit about yourpersonal background how you got intonutrition science andwhat brought you to that as a doctormost doctors don't really care aboutfood why are you one of the weird onesthat careswell i was born weird i'll tell you thatumbut uh when uh you know when i was a kidi wanted to go to medical school justbecause i thought it was really powerfulto be able toalleviate people's fear my dad was adoctor and i was the oldest my youngerbrother was sick you know fairfrequently and my mom would be soworried and i would just see that my dadumwanted to uh my dad was able to justalleviate her fear so i always wanted tobe a doctor but i also for some reasonalways wanted to get to the underlyingproblem of of whatever was causingsomebody's condition like noti thought that medical school wouldteach you that and um it didn't andso uh once i had graduated from medicalschool i had already been dated becausei i kind of had to let go of that dreamof getting to the root cause of what wasmaking my patients sick and myself likethe driving factor for me my own healthwasi had a really a major health setbackin my early 30s andicouldn't walk it was a mystery conditionso it was a medical mystery and ii even my boss was like giving me a hardtime about not walking and literallymaking fun of me it was horrible and soi had noi tried everything i had surgery noanswers so my husband umwho likes to cookuh and i mentioned that because i feellike a lot of people who really like tocook think this way they think foodmatters more than people who just don'tyou know on average uh if you don't liketo cook you don't always maybe thinkfood matters quite as much but it seemslike there's that correlation so heloves cooking andhe told me that my diet of basically alot of sugar was probably not good forme andthen when i got so sick i couldn't walki couldn't exercise i was bored out ofmy mind so i actually read some of thebooks that he was telling me i shouldhave read a long time ago and it openedmy eyes tothis concept of essential fatty acidswhichreally blew my mind becausei uh essential fatty acids are thingslike the omega-3 and the omega-6 thateveryone is now knows about but this was2001 andit was something that i had not heard ofin medical school sothat was where it started for me wastrying to like understandwhat are these essential fatty acidshealthy or not becausei was reading opposite things about themright the standard medical literaturewas saying that um omega-3 and omega-6that are like the polyunsaturated fattyacids are these essential things and wejust need to eat more of them thansaturated fat and then i had run intoscientists who were saying well wait asecond really there was never anyevidence against saturated fat and sothat for me was thethe question i needed to answer i neededto resolve that argument in my mindit what is really what is the type offatthatisyou know causing heart attacks is therea type does even fat have anything to dowith heart attacks becausethe whole argument against saturated fatrested on the idea that saturated fatclogs your arteries like pipe like youknow grease hot grease and a cold pipeandthat is the whole foundation of modernnutrition scienceand sowhen i got tothe answer to the questionof actually no saturated fat was neverproven to cause heart attacks andthese polyunsaturates that we are nowconsuming in solarge quantities they seem to be theactual thing that is causing heartattacks these daysand so it was a complete paradigm shiftand i i just had to then so so that waslike okay everything i learned inmedical school was wrong and i wasstarting to find that the not just theissue of fats were wrong and this wasall just intofor me to try to figure out okay what isa healthy diet what should i myself beeatingand and then of coursethe tantalizingrevival of my original dream going tomedical school to be able to understandwhat people's root causes were right soi was like maybe this is it maybe thisis what i've been looking for my wholelifeand so uhyou know that's why i was so driventoto just keep researching and reading andwilling to like explode everything i hadlearned about nutrition in medicalschool it turned out the otherprinciples were also wrong right there'slikefour things that doctors learn that arewrong we learn cholesterol causes heartattacks saturated fat clogs yourarteries um salt causes hypertension andyou know fat makes you fat in general ohthere's a fifth thing that your yourbrain needs sugar and if you don't getsugar in your diet your brain is goingto run out of energyso all of those things are wrong andand sothat kind ofblew everything up and then so fromthere i was like okay well the obviousquestion what should we be eating and sothen that's the other part of it that'sthe other side of the storyum so so tell us a little bit first ofall about umwhat are the things what are the thingsthat you read that changed your mindwhat are the books that uh changed yourmind on thiswell what changed my mindis different than what opened my mind soum i'll answer the question first whatchanged my mind was actually a phdthesisuh that like it was hard to find onlinebecause this was really before googlewas very efficient umit was by an author uh who had studiedsomething called lipid peroxidation invivo that means umwhat type of fatty acidsspontaneously react with oxygenin living systemsand turn into toxins and sobecause i had a biochemistry backgroundi went tocornell forbiochemistryi was able to understand the diagrams ofthe moleculesthat are in her phd thesis and so thatconvinced me once i saw that i was likeoh cedaws are bad they're the reasoneveryone is sick they're the thingthat's destroying our brains when we getalzheimer's they're the thing thatcauses most likely causes cancerthey're the thing that causesinflammation there the seed oils arewhat suppresses your immune system seedoils drive inflammation and everydisease every chronic disease peoplestruggle with is related to inflammationbut it's a way it's a it's akind of inflammationthat umisis associated with just cellularcomplete mayhem complete likenot it's it's different than omega-3 andomega-6 and so there's there's a lot inin that that um that that articletaught me because a lot of people in thespace ofum yes saturated fat's not bad it'sseed oils that are bad they focus on theomega-3 omega-6 ratio and and that islikeprobably a non-issue or a minimal veryminimal issueum it's really about this essentialchemistry of the polyunsaturated fattyacids that makes them toxic in a waythatumlike our body fat they build up in ourbody fat and our body fat thenbecomes thissource of additional toxinsright so it's a deterioration in ourbody of polyunsaturated fatty acidswhich isjust a disaster it's just a desi weshouldn't eat molecules that thatdeteriorate inside us and theydeteriorate into toxinsthey deteriorate intothe deterioration process is itselftoxic the way that radiation is toxicbecause it involves free radicals thesehigh energy particles that fly aroundand damage our dna and just damage somany things inside ourselves sothat one paper changed my life it was aphd thesis 60 pagesyeah i mean i thinkonce you start once you figure this outyou look back and you think let's seeall throughout human history all ofthese modern you know diseases they werebasically a non-issue for most of humansthat have ever existed and then we starteating this industrial waste andsuddenly these things become an issueandi meanthe level of really brainwashing whichis what education in most universitiestoday is that is required for you toignore this fact that you know humanshad always eaten animal fatsfor all of their lives and now they'reeating industrial waste and now they'regetting sickbutit's the animal fat that's making themsick it's not the industrial waste imean it's it's so obvious once youfigure it out butreally it the amount of um effort thatgoes into making this appear to bescientific there you know well oh nosaturated fats they're bad and they'recorrelated with heart disease and youknow the science is settled on this anduh we already know and all of thesegovernment agencies and uh the americanheart association and all of theseorganizations just so set on it and it'struly astounding and i thinkum you know my listeners will see a lotof familiarities with that witheconomics i think you know nutrition andeconomics are two fields i've studiedclosely enough to know that basicallywhat you learn in a university is a lotof nonsense it's very similar ineconomics likewe moved to this world where governmentsget to print unlimited amounts of moneyand in that world we have unlimitedinflationand somehowthat these you have to go to universityto figure out to be taught that thesethings are not related and thatinflation is just you know it happensbecause of all kinds of crazy things uhtaking placeso okay so uh the seed oils umthat is basically like the uhthe the the entrance of the rabbit holeand then you start questioning the restof the stuff so it turns out saturatedfats themselves are not badwhy what makes you think that i mean thescience is settled saturated fats arebad for you why why won't you justlisten to the sciencewell what you said about universityeducation isvery true sadly for a whole lot of stuffbut the one thing that they can't takeaway from us ismath right like two plus two equals fourand algebra and calculus and related tothe that kind of like hard sciencechemistry and biochemistry umnutrition science is a soft science andand but biochemistry is a hard scienceand the biochemistry says that saturatedfatis stable to umto free radical cascades to it it doesnot get attacked by oxygen and thatchemical fact about saturated fat meansthat it is essentially anti-inflammatoryand it should be the bulk ofwhat's in our body fat should besaturated or other stable fats likemonounsaturated which is relativelystable compared to polyunsaturated thisthe stuff that's that's the most commonthe highest concentration type of fattyacid in the seed oils the hateful eightseed oils that i talk aboutbecause it rhymes with dr kate soum dr kate's hateful eight seed oilsum so so saturate so that's thechemistry i mean the chemical fact isthat oxygen will attack polyunsaturatedfatty acids and if you have too muchpolyunsaturated fatty acid in your bodyfat then your body fat becomes asource of inflammation when your cellstry and burn it that makes in otherwords your body fat becomes this thingthat when you try to burn it makes youfeel sick and tiredthen of course you're going to whenwhen you try to burn your body fatto lose weight you're going to feel badwhen you try to burn your body fatbetween meals even you might feel bad soit makes people overeatit makes them feel bad in a specific waythat umthat makes you insanely hungryso so but saturated fat is is stable andit's like the antidote to all of thoseproblems with oxygenit's really oxygen that causes theproblem with toxicitybecause oxygen as much as we need it tobreathewe have to be able to control it when webreathe it in our bodies and we have allthese things all these systems in placeto make sure that oxygen stays undercontrolit's like if you have a stove in akitchen you don't just want the entirekitchen to be flames you wantthe stove top to be flames and you wantto be able to turn that thing on and offand up and down exactly when you need itbut when you have so much pufa in yourbody fat little fires can start anywhereand it is very similar toyou know an explosion a miniatureexplosion oxygen reacting withpolyunsaturated fatty acidoxidizing oxygen oxygen is what causesfires right so we need to be able tocontrol oxygen in our kitchen in thestoves we need to be able to controloxygen in our bodies in our bloodstreamand our body fat and we have systems inplace for thatand the the name of these systems isantioxidant enzyme systems so if you'veheard of antioxidantsthen that's part of the systembut when you have so much poof on yourbody fat you actually deplete your bodywell sorry when you when you say pufajust uh sorry to interrupt when you saypufa you mean polyunsaturated fattyacids right pufa is polyunsaturatedfatty acid and yes it comes from seedoils exactly um thank youso yeah when you have so muchpolyunsaturated fatty acid in your inyour body fat uh you end updepletingyour body's ability to control oxygenyou lose control of oxygen and when thathappens your sub your your tissues willbe subject to inflammationuhyou know seemingly randomly from time totime and that is disease that is chronicdiseasethat's how we get cancer that's how weget degenerative brain diseases that'show we get autoimmune disease that's howwe get all of the modern chronicdiseasesisoxygen getting out of control and thefastest route to that sickly state iseating seed oils there are other routesright like if you're extremelymalnourished if you don't get anywherenear enough protein anywhere near enoughumvitamins and minerals and all sorts ofthings like that sothat's how there have been some of thesediseases throughout history right peoplehave alwaysoccasionally been malnourished anddevelopedsimilar diseases but the reason we havethis epidemic now is because the fastestroute to chronic diseases is throughseed oils and they'rethey've taken overas the dominant fat in our food supplynow over the past 70 years sinceharvard and the american heartassociation started telling us to avoidsaturated fatso whether you know it or not yeah imean i i travel a lot all over the worldand it's truly astonishing for me when iuh find just howhow pervasive this belief that you haveto eat these industrial waste productsand that the fats that all of yourancestors have been eating for thousandsof years are bad for you it'sastonishing you know you'd go to peopleum in the wilds of the most isolatedplaces where you would think you knowtheytheythey wouldn't be up to date on thelatest science but nope the science ofseed oils is good for youhas penetrated everywhere i meangrandma's today you know people thinkhe'll eat like your grandmamostpeople unfortunately your grandma hasbeen psyopped and you shouldn't eat likeyour grandma you should eatlikely like her grandma if she's aroundjust and you know if sea dwellershaven't fried her brains yet ask herwhat her grandma ate um because ifyou're you know if your grandma's aroundtoday most likely she grew up eatingseed oils as well it's it's astonishingand and you'd think you know maybe itwould be just in the us that this is thecase but no it's it's it's all over theworld these things continue to spreadumand yeah you mentioned harvard and ofcourse harvard's uh really umprobably the biggest villain when itcomes to fake fiat science uh in the20th century so how did thiselaborate prankof seed oils uh make its way into thehuman diet over the 20th century can youtell us a little bit about the story ofhow this stuff has been normalizedthere's a man who is uhnotoriousinthe real nutrition world his name isansel keys andwhat hediduh he worked back in the 1930s and 40sand he was by all accounts andan egomaniac and he just wanted his nameto get out there and he wanted his nameto get out there asthe man whosolved the mystery of heart attacksbecauseat this time in the late 30s and early40sheart attacks werereally exceedingly rare anddoctors could go their entire careerswithout seeing one without seeing asingle oneand sothe problem was wasthat doctors had already kind of figuredout that it was cigarette smoking butansel keyes wanted everybody to forgetthat and listen to him instead and hisideawas more captivating because he he waslike a better a great marketer he hecreated this imageof i was when i said earlier hot greaseand a cold pipe like congealing that's aquote from ansel keys and whenso what he says is saturated fatcongeals in your arteries like hotgrease and a cold pipe and it justcreates this image that sticks with youandis unfortunately a very effective memethat hasinfected everybody'snutritionuhperception these daysbut it was all just made up and uh heactuallyuhknew he had to know it was a lie becausehe was collecting data so he was veryinfluential person he was an extremelygood social engineer he uhbecame friendswiththeuh president eisenhower's personalcardiologist named paul dudley white andconvinced this physicianthatsaturated fat was the cause of heartattacks not cigarettes uh and pauldudley white never really let go of thecigarette thing because he did continueto sort of nag rose of uheisenhower oh shoot eisenhower thank youeisenhower um he did continue to nag himabout like not smoking but he was a fourpack per day smoker by the way and hehad had a heart attack inthe in like 1940in the 1940s andthat his heart attack was what broughtthe fearofheart attacks to national attention likenobody really had heard of one until butthe president had once and and he waslike in a hospital and basicallyinaccessible for six weeks it wasterrifying he was a beloved presidentpeople feared for his lifeand and so people just became terrifiedof heart attacks and so this is whyansel keyes wanted to be the the guy onthe white uh the white knight on thehorse rushing to the rescue with hislike saturated fat was a problemso heinfluenced paul dudley white who was atharvardwhich is basically the pinnacle ofmedical education if you're at harvardand you sayuh that do you say anything aboutdiet or nutrition people are very likelyto believe you because you're at harvardyeahand and so umso that's how he got harvard on boardand then the other thing that he did wasum he was really good at raising moneyand so he got proctor and gamble todonate 1.7 or 1.8 milliondollarsthis is 1948. to the american heartassociation um and the and proctor andgamblewerethey sold seed oil they sold cottonseedoil um in the form of crisco mostly andsosoand keys also had some relationship tothe cigarette industry yeah um and so solike in this man keys you have all theproblems with nutrition because hedidn't want to just admit that cigarettesmoking was what was causing heartattacks had nothing to do with diet endof story he wanted to make it a lot morecomplicated and make us all afraid ofsaturated fat because he wanted to bethe father of the diet heart hypothesisand he had his way because he is stilllauded as this genius byuh by harvard and by you know tufts andall of our most respected educationalinstitutionsthat doctors sort of blindly followbecause it seems to make sense andbesides we all grow up hearing it has tobe trueyes um in my uh book the fiat standardmy latest book i draw analogy betweenancel keys andjohn maynard keynes their names soundthe same and i think they uh they playeda very very similar role in economics uhin their respective pseudosciences ishould say they both popularized theseideas and they're both treated asgeniuses today and i thinkthis world isn't going to be fixed untilpeople come to terms with the fact thatboth of those people are crooks um toput it mildly um you could also saycriminals i think umi think you could argue ansel keys haskilled more people than anybody elseoh yes i i absolutely argue that all thetime because uh he has i mean there'snobody who could possibly have killed asmany people as him because forgenerations he's been giving peopleheart attacksi think karl marx comes close but ithink yeah karl marx comes close but ithink ansel keys probably uhpips him to that titlewell he's got a transgenerational effectso like i mean it depends on how youcount like he did it right like i sawlike it if you count like all the warsthat maybe were started because of thisis karl marx's way of thinking yeahmaybe you could get close but i i meanyeah he's in numbers in the billions imean he's still killing people todaybillions billionsand this is it's been for since 1995so not to mention the fact that for 30years he hid the data that he had ididn't bring this up yet but ancel keysactually had data linking cigarettesmoking to heart attacks that he hid andthe american heart association neverpublished anythingnegative about cigarettes until 1988which was 30 years after he had the datacollected soall of thatyou can lay on uh keith's feet tooyeah absolutely and um this is one ofthose things you know whether it's keysor canes or uh i think in climatescience there's a there's a very largenumber of people that umbelieve in the official story becausethey think of themselves as beingscientific and yet it only takes veryvery minimal digging you know once youjust gobeyond the press releases in the newyork times and the harvard pressreleases that tell you what you shouldknow you know all thesesummarizing science for the public onceyou scratch under the surface of thatimmediately you see hang on a second wecan't even look at the data it's true ineconomics in many cases it's true inin nutrition and it's definitely true inclimate in many casesand umin in in keys case uh he did this thingcalled the seven countries study whichis you know seven countries and he justdrew a graph with seven countries hepicked the seven countries that hewanted he eliminated i think he hadanother 10 countries what was itthat he just didn't include in the graphyeah so that there's there's two studieswith similar names and umevery it's very hard to sort them out sothe first study where he hand-picked itwas six it was called the first studythat he did was much smaller it wascalled the sixth country study it waskind of a preliminary study laying thegroundwork for the next huge study whichwas then called the seven countriesstudy that that one was huge had a lotof a lot of data points but so with thesix countries study he visited 22countries and plotted the data for sixof the 22 because those were the sixthat sat nicely on the line of moresaturated fatmore heart attacksand so um so he'd already likehand-picked he already kind of knew whatcountries to go toand then he went to you know these sevencountries and he still couldn't actuallyprove that there was a link between hereven though he kind of hand-picked theseven countries and and spent 30 yearstrying to massage the datawhen the the book there's a book calledthe seven country studya study that um when that was publishedand you read thatyou see all over the place that uh wellit was more cigarettes than anythingelse and um you know cholesterol andsaturated fat didn't really seem to playa role all over the place but in theintro and the very end where you knowpeople are more likely to skim and readyou will see the hand of ansel keysthere are multiple authors on this thingso that's how you can have one bookdisagreeing with itself soit you know in some places that bookdoes say oh yeah it's of course it'ssaturated fat but they never cite anydata they never show any tables rightlike you would think thateither side would be showingtables but there's no tables in thatbook it's all just statisticalmumbo-jumbo that is extremely confusingfor even you know a scientist i'm not astatistician but like i'm a doctor andthey these statistical uhlike type of studies are created for docfor doctors benefits so we know what'smore you know truein quotes aboutnutrition i mean statistics is the worstway to try and figure out nutrition butanyway so i mean the the reason i'mbringing it up is because they couldmake it really simplethey could just show graphsbecause if something is really truegenerally you don't need sophisticatedstatistics you could just use a simplegraphbut they didn't do that they didn't showany that they just do all thislike all as controlling for thisvariable and you know age adjusted andeverything else where you just cannotpossibly figure out what that what thereal truth is you don't you just need tosee the raw data which they never showyouyeah and i think uh today uh most uhsciencesessentially are just statistics likea lot of you know subject experts innutrition or all kinds of fields theylike to pretend that you know there'sthis secret uh esoteric knowledge thatyou need to get when you go and youspend five years in a grad school butreally it's just a bunch of statisticsyou're most of these sciencesit's it's all the same they dostatistics and then once you actuallystudy statisticsum you realize it'soptimized as a method of knowledge foruh being misrepresented it's optimizedfor being able to basically lie withnumbers and so uhthe way that i see it is that and what iwhat i mentioned in my book the fiatstandard is that with the fiatscientific methodwhoever gets to define the nullhypothesis gets to define get the answerthat they want and so you start with thenull hypothesis that saturated fats arebad for youit's basically impossible to make astatistical study that will disprovethis um in in nutrition almost becauseuh you know you can always make the datasay what you want you know justeliminate numbers or introduceconfounding valuables or take outthings that you call confoundingvariables and then you'll get the resultthat you want but then of course youknow the people who pay the scientiststhe people who decide who gets fundedare the ones who call the shots and sothat's why you can't be a nutritionscientist i mean it's astonishing whenyou think about it today it's we're in2022 this stuff has been going on for 70yearsyou'd think some nutritionistwould get a clue you know one of allthese tens of thousands of nutritionphds all over the planet that are outthere telling their poorpatientstoeat more industrial waste you think oneof them you know would look at the dataand figure out maybe industrial waste isnot goodi'm sure many of them havebut they don't get financed they don'tget funded they don't get published theydon't get promoted they don't get intothe universities thatget to have their press releases uhfeatured in the new york times andit's it's astonishing whenwhen you look at where it's gone and ofcourseit leads to this umcultishbehavior where people think no well thisis what the science says you can't beright you know okay well you're an mdbut you know what do you know aboutnutrition you should stick to justtalking to your patients and listeningto what the nutrition scientists say andthat's it as long as you get to call theshots of who gets to be an authoritythen you can makeanything sound scientific even eatingindustrial wasteand doctors have ummore knowledge than they're generallygiven credit for about nutrition scienceand you know i i just want to point thisout because a lot of dietitians say thatdoctors don't learn anything aboutnutrition and they say oh yeah well atmost you have a one hour course onnutritionbutbut the reality is that everything thata dietitian learns about nutrition youcan learn in a weekend what the most ofwhat they are learning isjust some basic physiology and then youknowwhatever else they they need to to dolike which calculation they're going todo to calculate exactly how manycalories and a lot of stuff that youknow now we have apps for so you don'treally need it anyway and i'm not sayingthat dietitians don't have any you knowaren't intelligent people i i'm sayingthatdoctors should not accept thispremise that they didn't learn anythingabout nutrition because here's what wedo learn and let me just lay this out wenutrition includes thethe physiolog the physiology involved inconverting the food that you eat intoyour bodyand that we learn a great deal of thosethat's all the basic science like cellphysiology and organ physiology and wedo learn a great deal ofhow protein is metabolized howcarbohydrates are metabolized even howfats are metabolized and distributedthroughout the body and you know whatorgans you know need fat or how we fuelwe do learn a lotandyet we still allow ourselvesto be led by the nose by thestatisticianswho run the diet studies right so weknow we don't really understandstatistics we also have a course onstatistics but you can take a lot ofstatistics and you still can be confusedby on purpose by bystatistical based papers because likeyou saidstatistics is almost a science thatseems to be created to hide reality andsoi agree entirelyso that's why i just like saying hey ifsomething seemslike ityou you can't figure out like that it'snot that obvious that you that youreally need statistics to figure it outit's probably not trueand that's why in the fat burn fix ishow the onepiece of statistics that i think all ofus need to pay attention to which is agraphof how much seed oil we used to eat 100years ago and how much seed oil we eatnowthatcorrelates completely withour rates of type 2 diabetes andpre-diabetes it court is a perfectcorrelation and there is no suchcorrelation with any other nutritionvariable including carbohydrates andsugarsso um you know including red meatincluding saturated fat it all comesdown to the seed oils which is to saypolyunsaturated fatty acids becausethat's the you know that's mostly whatthey arethat's the onepiece of data that we need and it's notsophisticated statistics you can be fiveand you can understand that something'sgoing on there with those parallel linesbut this is the thing if you studystatistics if you study nutrition if yougo to graduate schoolit's essentially an indoctrination campwhere they make you look at this and sayoh no correlation is not causation andit can't be that simple and here's awhole bunch of other data and a wholebunch of other graphs for why actuallyit's really the butter and the saturatedfat that's making you sick and youshould continue to buy industrial wastefrom our sponsorsi wanted to get a degree in a publichealth a master's in public health butat least half of all the courses that iwould have to take was statistics and ijust i couldn't do that because youdon't need statistics to know what youshould be eatingyou just need to open your eyes andreally you just need to open your mindright like is that there's a saying fromthe new pope i love that that's sayingthis one this one right here it says umgod is an is a mind that opens[Laughter]because that's where all possibilitybeginsum and if you don't have an open mindnothing can be done you can't learnanything but soso really wewe already knoweverything we need to know aboutnutrition we have the science we haveboatloads ofscientificumbooksthat tell us exactly what to eat exceptthat we don't call them science book wecall them cookbooksand if you look at cookbooks fromyou know before cancel keysyou are finding everything you need toknow you're finding the instructions forbuilding a healthy human body you justwill naturallyyou know chefs naturallyuh people who like to cook they we havetastesfor fat and salt and protein andbitterness and sour and sweet for areason because when you're working withreal food you will want a balance of allof those things and that willguide you toto food that tastes good when you'reworking with no real food it will guideyou to nutrition the more flavora food has the more nutrition it hasand we are so used to not havingnutrition in this countrythat we are disgusted by flavor andnutritionin the form of liver right likeif you grew up eating liveryou developed a more sophisticatedpalette your brainthat is more able to recognize nutritionthan if you didn't grow up eating liverand if you grew up eating liver and youyou know it was introduced to you in anice way a proper wayyoucrave liverif it was forced fed down you just likeanything you probably don't have such agreat relationship with it but um but mypoint isweare creatures of nature and we need toknow that nature is science and ifright that nature issciencewhen we are doing science we areinvestigating natureand any only the real sciences do thisright status statistics not doesn'tcount butbotany and ecology and meteorology yeahyour favorites probably and certainlyphysiology and nutritionwell not really nutrition but chemistrythat's those are all investigations ofthe workings of nature an attempt tobetter understandnaturewhich is our parentand when we do something like say wellfood that tastes good is never good foryouwe need to realize that we are sayingnaturemakes made a big mistake in making uslikesalty buttery steakand with uh you know bone stock gravy orcaramelized onionswhich are saltyand butterywe are saying that weare smarter than nature which is to saywe are smarter than actual scienceit is astatement that should never be madeit you should blow up if you ever say ityeah i think you know if you look atmost of these sciences so it'sdefinitely true in economics and innutrition there was a long humantradition for thousands of years wherepeople had studied this question andtried to come at answers of what is itthat we need to do in order to make thisthing betterand then the 20th century comes alongand we throw all of that away and wereplace it with a bunch of statisticsand you know statistics that arefinanced by corporate sponsors who wantspecific answers and it's true ineconomics it's true nutrition it's truein all kinds of things it doesn't matterall the thousands of years of wisdomthat had been accumulatedthey all get thrown down the wind or outthe window because some severelymalnourished nutrition statisticiansusuallyyou know they have the data and they runthe numbers and they do all kinds ofwizardry and then they uh conclude thatyeah you're all of the ancestors thathad um tobe healthy enough tohaveeach other and then bring you intoexistence they were all wrongand you need to eatour corporate sponsors industrial wastein order for you to be healthyright and and ignore all those thousandsof cookbooks that people have beenpublishing that are you know that eachrecipe actually is an instructiona little piece of the instruction manualfor building a healthy humanand if you don't want to read thousandsof cookbooks i i compiled like thethe base um base recipe of what is ahealthy diet look like in deep nutritionand came up with four foundationalprinciples which are the strategies thatpeople all around the worldused to convert the resources of naturethe nutrition from their environmentintofood that they could eat to inform theirdna how to build a healthy human so wehave like the science of whycookbooksfrom before 1948are actually a wonderful resource ofnutrition these are these are nutritiontextbooks this is what nutritionistsshould be studying or forget that theyshould just be chefsright we should really nutritionists andwere chefs chefs were the originalnutritionists the people who could cookbecausethe foods that they made tasted good ourdna came to expect that same combinationof chemicals the same combination ofnutrients our dna came to expect thatand so that informs the dna inside eachone of our cells and how to run the cellproperly and if that you don't get thatblend of chemical instructions on how torun a cell properly that's when you getdisease that's the deficiency angle ofdisease there's two ways to get diseasenutritional deficiency and toxicityand so seed oilsare convenient handy packages containingboth they have almost no nutritionum right that most of the vitamins havebeen stripped out all of the mineralshave been stripped out and when theycome out of the factory they have toxinsin the bottleand then when you cook with them thetoxins multiply because of thoseinteractions with oxygen that i wastalking about earlier and i do explainall this in both of my books if you'recurious about how like this isthis is like the math of the body rightthis this this understandingthepolyunsaturated fatty acids and howoxygen destroys themand turns them into an enemy of thestate when they're in your bodyum isthe the mathematics that you need tounderstandnutrition science that right there is soso important so that's the toxicity partof it and then the nutrient deficiencypart of it you know we get that toobecause we're told not to we're told toeat so much you know uh processed foodof course uh butstarchy stuff we're told to eat a lot offruit well we always they always sayfruit and vegetables right well what'seasier peeling a banana or taking kaleand de-stemming it and giving it a nicelittle massage to do in restaurants tomake that's how they make kale salads inrestaurants they actually massage it andit releases some enzymes and softens itit's kind of cool um but anyway it's alot harder than peeling a banana so mypointpeople eat a lot more fruit which is wayless nutritious than vegetablesso there's all kinds of ways in whichournutritional paradigmturns us towards toxins and away fromnutrition andall we need to do is open our minds tothe possibility that that is wrongthrow that outand then you know then where do you gofrom there wellyou know what i mean that can be adifficult journey for a lot of peoplebecause i i do i tell you i get uhletters every day from people who arelikewell okay i i buy it that seed oils arebad but then this guy over here says weshould never eat fruit or that we needto eat a lot of honey orwe need toavoid lectins and you know then you haveall the noise and the chatter about okaywell so if if saturated fat isn't badthenyou know and everything that my doctortells me is wrong then what's true nowwe have no foundational principleum and that's wherethat's where western price comes in soum you know we draw the analogy betweenancel keys and john maynard keynes and ialso make the analogy in my fiatstandard book betweenwestern price and ludwig von mises idon't know if you've ever heard ofludwig von mises buthe's like the western price of economicsso you go to university you never hearabout western price in your nutritiondepartment or in your medical schoolsimilarly you never hear about ludwigvon mises and the austrian school andwhat they have is just it's it's almostlike a parallel realitythese books that exist out there with anenormous amount of sense where you readthem and it just blows your mind and youunderstand how the world actually worksand um everybody in the university isjust snickering at uh well this guy'salready is too old and it's already beendiscredited so tell us a little bit moreabout uh western price i'm personally abig western prize fan boyi am too and i you know i i borrowed hisbook from the library was a 1948 copy ofhis book called nutrition and physicaldegenerationand i fell in love with him as soon as isaw the lineumin the bookwhere he saidhealth in its fullness is nature obeyedand he was what he was what thatsentence does is i have a fan blowing onme sorry so it keeps getting my eyesumwhat that sentence does health in itsfullness is nature obeyed is it tellsyou what is his core value and his corevalue is exactly my core value which isnature is science science is nature youcan't separate the two and so to obeynatureis toeat what's good for us andthat means to obey your human nature andto trust it when something tastes goodthat it's probably good for you if itcame from nature right problem now is wehave so much food that does not comefrom nature everything in the middleaisles of your grocery storedoes not come from nature and even thestuff on the edges isn't so greatanymore but what weston price the reasoni love him is because he made thatstatement and that clear foundationalprinciple which i think is the basis forthe rest of nutrition science if youcan't agree with that you shouldn't betalking about nutrition you should goawayblowup i'm going to pull up a lot of peopleso westin price was actually a dentistand back in the day dentists weresurgeons right they they um they didmassive oral facial surgery and it was abig deal to get a tooth pulled becausewhen he was working there was really noanesthesia except for chloroform andether which would kill people sometimesum so you know just simply getting atooth pulled was an extremelypainful or dangerous process and he tookit seriouslyum that you know he washe was distraught about how on howcrooked people's teeth wereand he had this super important thoughtwhich is like wait a second i've beenhuntingand i've seen other animals teeth youknow he was hunting in the backwoods ofcanada for an extended period of timeand he saw the teeth of a lot ofdifferent animals everything that hekilled that had teeth and he observedthat they were all straight and didn'tsee any cavities eitherand he was like why would people beprone to these problems when no otheranimalin natureeating its preferred natural environmenteating its preferred natural diet i meanuhgets crooked teeth and serious cavitiesand so that his null hypothesis wasthis stuff that i'm seeing as a dentistand all this suffering that i'm puttingpeople through with pulling teeth anddoing surgery uh to you know to dealwith bone infections and stuff thatwould happen from small with they didn'thave antibiotics either so there was alot of infectious disease in dentistryand all the suffering that he wasputting people through and you knowdeath and losseshis null hypothesis wasthis can all be prevented and all i needto do is figure out uh what is i need acontrol group right so what he wassaying is thatthe same exact thing that i say in uh mytalk at the future of fat summit which ii hope that you can link to that becausei think it's a it's a great summitthere's a lot of great information therebut um my talks about it uh are i thinkimportantum to understand and and because i'msaying the same thing in that talk thatright now we are in the midst of amassive experiment and that'sessentially what weston price was sayingis that all this stuff and what hecalled the foods of modern commerce ilove his like buddy daddy way of talkingmeaning umtherefined flowers and sugars and cannedmeats and stuff like that those foods ofmodern commerce were bringing us diseasesomehow andhis hypothesis was if i find a group ofhealthy humans somewherethen i can start to understandwhat a healthy diet really looks likeand so he set out like in his middle agekind of like hefty not in super shapeperson set outto take a globalworld touryou know before airplanes were reallymuch of a thing this was in the 30s and40sto all the most remote places of theworld to find people who hadnot been their diets had not beendisturbed by the foods of moderncommerce that were still living the waypeople had lived for thousands of yearsandwhat he found wasthat his he basically proved hishypothesis correct when you go to theseplaces so he went to places like heactually went to hawaii where i wasliving when i heard about himum he went toalaska he went to the maasai in africahe went to somewhere in europe uhswitzerlandand uh but he went to a total of 11places and in all of these placesperu yes uh-huh in all of these placeshe found uh thatthe people had straight teeth and that'swhat he was looking for and oh by thewayso here's where it gets really cool andum you knowone of the chapters that i'm the mostproud of in deep nutrition um isthathaving straight teethisn't just a convenienceit it means that you grewin harmony with the physics of theuniverse isn't that cool and how does itmean that well it has to do with thefibonaccisequence and this uh constant unit ofthe universe calledphispelled ph iumthathelpsgrowth occurin a way called that's called thatenables me and you probably understandthis better than i do because it helpslike people create fractals and stuffit's recursive growthand it it's essential to normal growthbecause we don't think about this asbeing so like complicated but your handhas to be the same proportionat your at every size right so whenyou're a baby you have to be able tocreate a fistlike this so that your fingers are alljust about equal so you don't have onethat's 10 you know super much longer andyou create an inefficient fistright you won't have any strengthumso just the growth of a handis kind of a miracle and it'snot entirely directed by your dna infact very little of it is directed byyour dna most of it is the physics ofthe universe the fabric of space-timeand all that cool stuff um that you knowthat creates ripples in the water and uhsand dunes and all these patternsthat we receive in nature over and overagain spirals and stuff like this umwhen you'rewhen price was looking at these folkswho had straight teeth he also and hemade note of thiswas looking at people with beautifulfacesthat had high cheekbones and you knowbroad foreheads and oh by the way theyalso hadperfect visionand oh by the way they didn't get umsinus infections or ear infectionsbecause there are passages and theselittle thingsthat drain your sinuses and drain yourearsgrew properly and they drained properlyso they weren't prone to infections andthey were physically strong andphysically attractiveand this is one of the mostcontroversial things they talk about indeep nutrition about about beautyit isn'tit just in the eye of the beholder surewe have tastes gentlemen apparentlyprefer blondesbut umbut actual realreal beauty is all the same in everyculture because every whether you're youknow african-american or native americanorcaucasian-american or eskimo or whereveryour face has this same geometrywhen you are healthy when you havestraight teeth you didn't need any teethpulled to be straight and you don't needglasses and your ear canals are straightand everything you have the same facialgeometryyour skin color might be different theremight be like slight different size ofyour nose but you're just tweaking theformula you're tweaking the same formulaand this formula was discovered bythe formula for a perfect face is whati'm talking about was discovered byanother maxillofacial surgeon dentistjust like pricewhocreated a formula for the perfect facebased on fibonaccium and you can look him up his name isstefan marquattand his work is fascinating but i meanto methat's that's wherelike a healthy dietborders on the miraculous you know likeso sure we're just talking about likebutter is good for you and and youshould save the bones scraps and makesoup butthat's wherelike we're we're turningwe're creating the building blocks forlife and you know i think it's really uhan amazing thingso just beyond that it's good for you itmakes you live longer itit's somehow more important seems moreimportant than not all that to mei agree i just want to add a couple ofuh interesting notes about western pricewhich is i think it was what he did isprobably a unique and unrepeatableexperiment that's never going to be doneagain becausehe did this at the time when theairplane was first inventedand at the time where there were stillplaces in the world that were stillisolated where the airplane had notinvadedsignificantly and so people in thoseparts of the world were extremelyisolated from the rest of the worldbut the amazing thing about it and thisis why it's really proper science youknow not like the current numbermolesters that call themselvesscientistshe would go to say eskimo populations orinward populations in the north ofcanadaand he would visitan inward population that is completelyisolated or almost entirely isolatedthat they would you know they'd be verygenetically similar to a population thatlives a few hundred kilometers away fromthembut the other population is integratedintomodern trade and so you have two verygenetically similar populations one ofthem is isolated and still eating thethings that they've been eating forthousands of years and the other one istrading with europeans and thereforethey've for the last 20 or 30 or 50years they've been eatingflour sugar and grains andgrains that are prepared in umthe modern industrial way and he wouldto show you pictures of the two and hetook a camera with him and he tooksamples of their food and he sent it tohis lab back in i think it was in ohioand uh he analyzed the content of thefood the nutrients and content in thefood and he would analyze thedifferences in the picture he'd countyou know he'd go to the population he'dcount how many rotten teeth are there inthe entire population and it's justastounding like you look at the picturesin the book and the book is amazing andyou can find the whole book online forfreeif you google it nutrition and physicaldegeneration it's an incredible book ihighly recommend it and you can see thepictures and they're just mind-blowingimmediately you tell the difference youknow um inuit populations you'd thinkyou know um you wouldn't be able to seemuch of a difference between two similartribes that are living in the north ofcanadaand yet you look at the pictures and oneof them is just you know they look likethey're from um magazine photo shootthey look glamorous almost their face isshiny their teeth are nice their smilesare big their jaws are wide andthe other populationthey've beenuhinvaded with all of this food and sothey have all these health problemstheir teeth are bad andlabor is bad for their women andall kinds of things that you think of asjust a normal part of lifeonly appear in the population that waseating all of this uh bad foodum well we've lowered the bar on healthright it'snow we've we've normalized like wearingglasses and kids needing braces andteeth pulled i needed teeth pulled andwe've normalized cesarean sections whichyou know somewhere around 25 percent to30 percent of all births now or by onyou know unnatural births are bycesarean section section because the thewoman's body does not properly respondto hormones or her pelvis isn't wideenough thenthat that is a that would have killedyou know a species right i mean that'show species go extinct so we're kind ofin that phase right now wherewe're watching ourselvesgo extinct i mean this is what happensthat's what these chronic diseases areand these fundamental changes to ourphysiology that interfere with basicfunctions like vision right like i ineed glasses without glasses ii wouldn't be able to you know functionso uhyou know like the thetojust because we have created aaccommodationforahealth problemdoesn't mean we should be accepting thathealth problemas unpreventableand what i'm saying and i say this indeep nutrition is we shouldlikethink of a healthy baby as a lot morethan just 10 fingers and 10 toes we wantthat child to be able to excel in lifeand at sports and you need goodconnective tissue you need to haveeverything built rightand we don't even know what built rightmeans anymore because just the very ideaof suggesting that it's going to changethe way you look is controversial andpolitically incorrectyeah and this is this is a fascinatingpart of your book which i hadi had not even considered before readingyour book deep nutrition um you you lookat umessentially nutrition as amulti-generational thing and you seethat when people eat well their kidslook attractive it's it's an extremelycontroversial thing to say in this worldwhere everybody uh is beautiful and getsa participation trophy um butthe reality is nowe're not all equally beautiful somepeople are more beautiful than othersand um it does seem like uhfood plays a big part in it sogive us give us your lowdown on how tomake your kids beautifulso well the uh we'll start with the fourpillars of the human diet so uh theseare strategies that that people use toextract nutrition from their you knowedible resources in their environment sothe first is fresh food right so whenpeople eat fish a lot of times theydon't even cook itwhen peopledairying culturesdrink milk it's definitely notpasteurizedthese days we think of fresh food onlyin the vegetable world but of course weshould also be thinking of it in the theanimal world tooand then if you have too much fresh foodyou got to preserve it so you what doyou do well you ferment itum and fermented foods are a way ofpreserving the fresh so that's whatcheese is so you want to havefermented foods that uh that arebasically fast foods right that is yourhealthy fast food cheese umwhat is this pastrami you know all thosesalted cured meatsthose are the original fast foodsand all you have to do is take a sliceor two and that's a meal and that's youknow that's so easy if you can get stuffthat you like that tastes good so that'sone aspect of fermentation there'sanother that benefits your you know theliving aspect of it like yogurt whereyou have the live bacteria in there thatuh help support your microbiomeand then fermented also comes along withthe second pillaris sprouted to you both of those arethings that work with nature sosprouting will you'll sprout like beansbefore you cook them right and sproutingdoesn't mean turning them into a sproutit means soaking them for long enoughfor a little rootlet to start to formand the germination process begins andthat enables you to cook itfor faster and you lose less vitaminsthat way and it also enhances thenutrition of itso that's the second one the third ismeat on the bone so you want to have umyou want to save the bones and you wantto use the skinand all the joint materialafter you eat like say a turkey dinneror chickenanything with bones in it save thosebones in your freezer and make stock outof them because you extract nutrientswhen you make stockthat don't exist anywhere else in theanimal world and that are good for yourconnective tissue and your jointsand if you don't want to feel your agewhen you're 75 you need good connectivetissueand so uh these things are essential forthat and then the lastpillar iseverybody's everybody goes oh this onewhich is organ meats right soliver and like everythingeverything people see everything if youlook at the original joy of cookingshe's got recipes in there that includelike lung and uh you knowthymus glandand brain and you know things tripestomachthings that people don't even know whatthey are anymore and each individualanimal organ is a little repository of asliver of the rainbow of nutrition thatwe need to eat one little color on thespectrumit is packed into each organit's just got a whole different blend ofnutrients that we needthatmuscle meat which is what we mostly eatnow uh doesn't have like muscle meat isgood for you but it's just mostlyprotein and some minerals and a fewvitamins but all we need all these otherorgans so that's like the big picture ofit and how do you get that well look atsome um look at some either oldcookbooks or just uhgo to tiktok andyou can type in old chinese ladyand you'll seethis lady that uh like she isbasically squatting in front of a streammaking this gourmet dinnerso cultures around the worldstill everywhere but america basicallythere you will find little you will findlittle ladies mostly now who areupholding this like sacred flame ofnutritionalknowledge of culinary knowledge and howto use the whole animalso just watch cooking shows watchingwatch cooking shows like umuh regional eats that's a really goodone that's all over europe uh and thenthere's one in china calledflavorful origins and it's amazing youyou will just it'll blow your mind whatpeople eatin different regions of china yeah i'mi'm a big fan of organ meat i eat a lotof organ meat and i don't i used to eatthis even when i used to eat garbagefoodi used to enjoy organ meat my favoritedish has always been raw lamb liver it'sit's absolutely deliciousdid you grow up eating that stuff or howdid that happen but not quite grow upbut around the time when i got intocollege i uh did my college in lebanonand it's a huge thing in lebanon theyeat a lot of raw uh organ meats inlebanon and this is why you knowon top of the tips that you gave thelebanese are spread out all over theworld and so wherever you are youprobably have a lebanese butcher withindriving distance from you so look him upgo to him become his friend and tell himyou know i want you to teach me the darkarts of lebaneseoregon means because i think thelebanese butchers have an incredibletalent for preparing it and not just thelebanese like from all over the middleeast syrian palestinian jordanian theythey have an excellent talent forpreparing those organs really well soorganliver is greatraw one problem with it is that it comeswrapped in that membrane and many peoplewhen they try and eat it raw they eatthe membrane in the membrane isnot ideal to eat but you have to knowhow to peel it your lebanese butcherwill peel it for you perfectly and thencut it into small pieces and then put insomechunks of tiny fat with it which is justsomething elsevery very highly recommendedthe thymus gland as well is is anincredible delicacy i think it's it'sthe most expensive part of the uhlamb i think hereum i was talking to a butcher that theytold me it would cost about 70 to get akilogram of that it's the most expensivepart of thesheep because uh you know there's onlytiny bits of it and umyou have to collect them from many sheepin order to make a kilogram and it'ssomething that you knowit's always been like they call it youknow the royal food it's something thatthe kings would eat it's like thesaffron of organ meats i guessyeah exactly yeah yeahbut yeah most people uh get disgusted bythis and i think uh generallythis is not gonna be very popular thingfor me to say but i think if you findyourself disgusted from the idea ofeating organ meatsyou're probably malnourishedyeah i mean no doubt really and um butthe thing is that once the seed oilsplay so many roles in making usunhealthy one of them is that they numbthe our taste a little bit and they theydrive us towards sugar they make usmetabolically dependent on sugar whichhas a devastating uh impact on yourrelationship with food like i'm talkingabout not just taste but like youremotional relationship with food youbecomea you know metabolically addicted tosugar and that is what the fat burn fixis really all about is trying how do wefix that metabolic addiction to sugarbecause it's very hard tolose weight without being able you can'tlose weight without burning your bodyfat butwhen you've been on a seed oil diet yourbody fat makes you feel sick and tiredwhen you try to burn it so you're kindof stuck right and so you you need uh toknowhow what where's the escape button hereand so that's what the fat burn fix doesit gives you that escape button but partof it isyourealizing that you are uh you knowaddicted to sugar if you don't have asweet tooth you probably are acarbaholicum you know if you have a major weightproblemprobably one of those two apply umand it's notyour natural taste it's not your naturalinclination it's not you're not destinedto always be struggling tonot eat the sugar that you crave all thetimethat was me i was i was aterrible sugarholic i would eat anentire bag of uh those pound bags ofpeanut m ms i would go on a 10 mile runjust so i could do that right and um iwas a major sugarholic souhi never thought i would beyou can't outrun a bad diet that's avery important no you cannot i didn'tknow what was happening you know ididn't know that it wasn't just aboutthe caloriesbut um but youi never i like i had a skinny roommatefrom the philippines interestingly umwho you know grew up eating verydifferently than me uh she didn't craveshe said like i had a conversation withher where she was like well i'd muchrather have anotherserving of steak than have likechocolate and to me that was like you'renot even human i'm sorry like i cannotrelate my kind of gal[Laughter]but now i i kind of like i understandlike i like i i can not eat every pieceof chocolate in the house now and inever thought i would be that way andthat's because i got myself unaddictedto carbs by getting seed oils out of mydiet and healthy fats in and you know afew other things that uh that reallyhelp you recover from your uhfrom the seed oilwhat it does to you and your metabolismi really think it is the most impactfulfat change that you could do i've had mymother-in-law come stay with us once andshe didn't change anything in her dietit's just that she when she came here wedidn't have seed oil so she had to cookwith ourghee and she just felt like a totallydifferent human beingand she lost weight and she startedfeeling great the only thing that shechanged was that she just startedcooking with ghee instead of seed oilsandthen she changed that yeahnow one very important pointgoing back to western pricei think when he first went on this hishypothesiswas that he he thought that ideal healthhe's going to find this kind of you knownoble savages who are eating the idealgarden of eden diet and in his mindbecause he was you know raised on early20th century uh american propaganda thatideal diet would be umvegetarian or veganand then ithis own experience showed him theopposite he found the most importantconclusion i take from that book which ithinklike people like the western prizefoundation don't emphasize this enough ifindis meat it's all of those cultureseverywhere in the worldall of their diet was based around meatand to the extent that they ate plantsthey ate plants as primarily a mechanismfor um ingesting animal fatsumwhat are your thoughts on this umhow important is meat and how harmful isabsence of meatwell meat is essential and so like imean that's what we we need a lot ofprotein and it's very difficult to getenough protein without meat and there'salso nutrients in animals that justdon't exist in plants like actual realvitamin a vitamin b12long chainomega-3 fatty acidsbut it's just it's the intensity ofnutrition that is easily digested by ourdigestive system it's just our digestivesystem was designedtobelike minimalrightthat's why of you know that's why carcarnivores have slim wastesgorillas havebelly like pot belly waste but they sitaround eating vegetables all the timeyou need a massive digestive tractto extractnutrition from plants you have to beeating all the time and you need a verysophisticateddigestive process cows have six stomachswith different types of organisms andevery single one each one doinga different job butbut even you know i like to say thatthat we all are uh you know really allof us even herbivores are our carnivoresbecause your digestive system isis is taking plants as the raw materialand fermenting it fermenting plants intomore nutritious byproducts oftiny animalsbacteriaum you know they're they're we'reactually when wewhen you digest when the cow absorbs youknow eats grassall the nutrition that it's getting iscoming from basically dead bacterialbodies rightbecause you've the the the grass and thethe cud that the cows chewedasthe slurry that bacteria live on and thebacteria is what's really nourishing thecow the bacteria have the capacity tocreate a lot more different types ofnutrients and vitamins and everythingthey need and sobiology smart we don't have the capacityto make a lot of vitamins because we eatbacteria or we eat foods thatumwe eat foods that did right or cows ifyou're an herbivore you just cr you justare basically eating the bacteria thatknow how to make all these importantvitamins so there really is no suchthing as an herbivoreyeah no i agree umwhat are your thoughts on the carnivorediet i've been eating meat only for sixand a half years and this is a growingtrend i presume you're not a carnivoreyou still eat plants what do you thinkof thatwell i just i like a taste of like i gotlike garlic and ium i like i mean even oils right likesesame oil right i mean that's outcarnivores a little boringfor me you know i mean i just i lovefood i like all different kinds of foodsi like carrots i like crunchy things andi do though like i think of vegetablesas a thing to make your meat moreinteresting really i mean that's reallyhowi think of it and um and that includeslike spices right like i love all theindian spices and um asian spices andstuff like that umand uh so like to methat'sa logical way for for other people to tothink of likeyour diet could could really honestly bemostly animal products like i include ihave a lot of dairy too right soi don't know some carnivore includesdairy some carnivore doesn't but i lovecheese don't take away my cheese and uhyou know so i i need that but umbut ilikeso cheese dairy products eggs and meatare kind of the foundation of what i eatevery day and then for a variety i usedifferent plantstothat because they have different flavorsand different cooking techniques too butumi actually read uh i have a copy of theoxford world encyclopedia of food and itoccurred to me one day to look up whatare the origin of spices like where didwhere did that originate fromwhat was the first spice and andbasically i i wasa little disillusioned but this makessense to find that umspices were really like they thinkoriginally created to to make like meatthat didn't taste good that like sataround too longpalatableso i'm still i guess using it the sameway to make meat taste better but umi thought that would be a more likeexotic beginning of spices but it wasreally justso we could eat garbageyeah ii'll make the case for carnivore i thinkuh i think putting vegetables with meatis an insult to meat uhand i think umi i get the idea of boring but here'sthe thing here's the trap if you try anddo carnivore for one month initially itmight feel a little bit weird but aftera month or two months or sothenyou you completely shift your mentalityaround food from food beingentertainment and food being aboutflavor and about enjoymentand you justrelish and enjoy the idea that you canget your fooddone prepared and cookedyou do your shopping very quickly you doyour cooking very quickly you eat andyou get full and then the entertainmentand the fun is what you can do with yourbody because you are healthy enough tobe constantly on meat and i thinki thinkfeeling like you need your entertainmentfrom your food is probably an indicationthat you'renot getting good enough food and you'renot getting good enough entertainmentthat's definitely one way to look at iti mean there's definitely a lot ofvalidity to that but i think you'reyou're the carnivore diet you're doing adisservice but i'm sure it can be verydelicious it's just that you know youhave togrow up withlike um well you have to have morevariety that i mean honestly where ilive in florida i just cannot get thevariety andit's just easier to get plants and iwould love to be able to try it it'sjust i can't get it i can't get the goodquality grass-fed stuff and umand then i just thought i also can'treally like get recipes i wanted to getlike traditional recipes and that's whyi've been watching some of these showslike flavorful origins and all the weirdstuff that they eat in china and um howthey basically just use a cleaver and[Laughter]chop anything upand put it in like a wok with some oiland then stir fry for a few seconds andadd water that's basicallymost of the cooking in one entire regionof chinatake anything with a cleaver to anythingandum but and you'll be eating the wholeanimalright and then they put in like a lot ofthey put in peppers is one of the likemost commonly used things some redpepper some salt and maybe a little bitof panko and that's like they'll put anykind of animal product into that andthen all the kids will gather aroundwith chopsticks and everybody smilesyeah um i've had the dr sean baker onthe show and i'm good friends with seanfor a very long time and he's uhhis brand of carnivore consists ofeating steaks only all the time andreally ribeye is the best food that youcan haveandit almost feels like you're reallycheating in life when somebody tells youyou can have ribeye all the timewhenever you want as much as you wantand you don't have to have anything elseand it really is like cheating and it'sthe healthiest thing that you can do anda lot of people a lot of carnivoresreally swear by it and that's that'swhen you kind of snap out of the ideathat you need the variety and theentertainment and all that stuff no youdon't know if once you've tried the bestthing you don't need tosupplement it with inferior thingsi see i my natural inclination is wellnobody in history did just limit it thatmuch soit could be a little bit dangerousthat you could be missing something andit might be that you have to go like twogenerations before you find out what solike that's just where i just you knowbased on the science of it but we don'thave anything to prove it wrong it couldbe could be correct it could be justfine we have thousands of people onfacebook groups that are doing it andhave been thriving for many years youknow we've got people who've been doingit for decades whole familiesso it'si think you knowthe idea that there's something missingis something that i've asked a lot ofpeople over the years you know all rightso i'm not eating people tell me you'recrazy how can you not eat plants allright what am i missing you know carrotskalenobody's ever had a kale deficiencywell i mean it's important to point outand this this is like a yes and it'simportant to point out that our umuh rda like the the recommended dailyallowance of all vitamins it it wasn'tcrea it was just created bystatisticians it was just they did asurvey of what are people eating and onaverage so it was just like they justsaid okay well let's let's take the twostandard deviations andlet's just call that the the requirementwe really don't know if you i meanyou're not going to get a lot of vitaminc right if you just eat ribeye but wereally don't know if you need vitamin cif maybe you only need it if you'reeating a lot of fruit i mean we we don'tknowsoyeah i mean so so i'm not against it ijust don't i just don't like stronglyrecommend it just because i have thathesitation of well like i mean you knowvegans make the same argument i've beenon vegan and i have some kind of unusualmetabolism they don't say that part thatthat enables me tofeel great on a vegan diet for 40 yearsor 70 years or whatever but i i'll i'llbelieve it when it's been going on forthree generations and your children areyou know getting healthier as they go sothat that's kind of like the for for mewhat i'm gonna need yeah but but i thinki think the key difference here is thatthere's never been a record of a thirdgeneration vegan anywhere where youdon't have any records of any personbeing a third generation vegan but wehave many records of hundreds hundredsof generations of carnivores you know uhthe the thepeople that uh the healthiest peoplethat western price ran into were theinuits who were living on only meat youknow they live in the north of canadathey have a growing season of about 15minutesand so they don't get any plants andthey're massage i'm sorry yeah i was iwasn't talking about the carnivore dietwhere you're inclusive of all the organstotally that makes perfect sense like ifpeople can do that yeah go for that'sgreat um but uh don't forget to you knowuse make some bone stock save the bonesand stuff like that but um but uh i wasonly talking about the the part of itwhere it's just eat steak right youdon't need any lipstick that part makesme worry but i am not at all worriedabout just like a full-on nose-to-tailbone marrow included uhyou knowmulti-floriferousmulti-organumcar version of carnivores already cutyou off i just wanted to make sure thatyou know that that's what i was talkingabout when i was saying i i'm a littlecautious was just the steak only versionyeah absolutely um okay so uh i want toshift gears now you know we're enjoyingtalking about all the funmeat and bones stuff but let's let's getback to the darker side of nutrition andmodern 20th century uhstatistics based stuff what are yourthoughts on money in medicine andhow this is organizedyeah um there are no checks and balancesin the medical system and we thereshould be umthat we routinelyuh sell people on the idea of gettingcoronary bypasses whenthere is very little evidence for thatpractice a coronary bypass involvescracking open your chest putting you ondiverting your bloodthrough a machine you're a machine pumpsyour blood instead of your heart puttingyour hearton ice literally don't put ice cubes inthere so it'll stop beating and andstripping out um veins from your legs uhor or the memory uh vein from your chestand you know sewing it into your heartlike aplumbing bypass or like some sort of badhvac jobum to just bypass the artery that isclogged and the only people that we haveevidence that that actuallysaves lives in is people who have heartfailure who are you know on veryunhealthy their heart is failing theirit their heart doesn't squeeze properlybut yetumevery day around the world nowprobably on tens of thousands hundredsof thousands of these procedures areperformed on people who don't need itbecause how are you gonna know what ifthat little shadow there really is whatyour doctor is saying and you don't knowall the you don't know all therequirements or you don't know all theliterature on who really benefits from abypass if you're if youhave any kind of anything wrong withyour body like anything scary likeyou're feeling heart palpitations oryou're getting chest painyou can be in a state of terror becausewe all know nowadays what heart attacksare and we're worried we're going tohave one and drop dead any minute nowespecially if we've been eating steaksright so um so there's a lot of fear andif some doctor adds to your fear bysaying oh you have a bypass oh and getthis they don't i'm sorry you have abypass you have a blockage they say oh isee a blockage on this you know mushhere this shadow this two-dimensionalrepresentation of a three-dimendimensional artery i'm seeing a littlekink herethat alone is like you can see a kinkthere and you can have plenty of bloodespecially if you have collateral uhflow anyway but um so they theythey add to your fear by sayingyou're a ticking time bomb they theyhave another way of adding to your fearthey use this phrase all the time wecall this a widow maker right that oneworks really well on guys umit's it's a90 blockage of one of the arteries inyour heart called the left anteriordescending they they've branded that tosell their bypasses to people andthat is a high risk blockage but if yourheart is otherwise healthy we don't haveany evidence that that uh that majorsurgeryis going to save your lifeand which is what you're supposedlyhaving it for and we don'tyou might be thinking i mean if you'relistening to this you might be thinkingwell how could having a blockage in yourartery how could that not be a problemhere's how one word it's calledcollateralscollateral blood flowwhat that means is your body basicallybypasses itself it creates new ways forblood to get toyour the area of your heartthatthe artery that's partly blocked orcompletely blocked is going to the otherarteries step up and widen it's justlike if you have alike a traffic flow through a city andthere's one road is blocked well there'smore cars going to go through the otherthe other roads but unlike a city yourheart can grow new roads and it does itdoes all the timeand here's how we know that the practiceof cardiology is really corrupt there'sa way that they could test forcollateralsuh but it that testis very complicatedto do costs a lot of resources costs alot of timeand the reimbursementis like 20but and this is 20 out of an angiogramthat can cost five thousand dollarsthey get an x they would get an extra 20bucks for doing this test forcollaterals which isreally how you would know if if a hasany chance whatsoeverofof helping you if if it's reallyindicated if you actually have ablockage because if you have collateralflow even though one artery might beblocked or you know look kinked onangiogramyouyou have blood going to every part ofyour heart so you don't have a problemand so so you're doing a bypass on anon-problem it's only giving you riskthe intervention is only giving you riskand that is just one of many manyexamples of because there are no checksand balances the cardiologist needs topay off his debt and so you know you'rehelping contribute to that problem yesyou're taking on massive risk that youmight die during the bypass buthismedical school loan and yacht aren'tgoing to pay for themselves are theyyeah i'm not going to let them off thehook that easily i i paid off uh my debtand i didn't do it by doing unnecessarysurgeries cardiologists make more than amillion dollars a year on average theydon't have that much debt i'm sorry soyou don't need to do that yep so i meanyes i understand yeah no really it'sbecause they can and most cardiologistsit's because everyone else does it rightthey're not thinking about it it's easyand cardiologists don't only do bypassesthey also do other things i mean they'renot all bad they all they also do otherthings that actually will save your lifebut this practice of bypassing iscorrupt and and um should not you knowit should be questioned it should belike there should be like a a vice on itor a 60 minutes or something it needs tobe exposed asa uh a way that the the hospitals dependon it the hospital the mostthe best source of income for mosthospitals is their cardiologists and allthe bypassing and stents that they dothat is the that is usually what keepshospitals afloatum they need that they need thosecardiologists to do all thoseunnecessary surgeries soyou know that's that's very reinforcinguh the cardiologists really feel likethey are heroes right because they'resaving the hospitals they may not besaving lives but they're saving thehospital systemyeah you knowthe more you learn about this and themore you learn about diet you realizemodern medicine is just in many cases anextremely elaborateexercise in doing extremely insanetoavoid telling people to just eat likegoddamn human beings i mean it's it'sincredible like you could are youthinking of bypass surgery like astomach a stomach gastric bypass surgeryshe's like that's an example of some ofthe most ridiculous surgery there is iremember there was somebody posted acouple of years ago on twitter umsomebody posted this new machine whereum youeat the stuff and then you pump it outof your stomach immediately after youeat itandlike thatit's incredible like why don't you justnot eat instead of actually pumping out of your stomach all day it'sit's incredible that doctors don'tmention this and not only do they notmention itthey encourage you to eat the thatmakes youwant to get this stuffyeah i mean it's hard to i had to godown a big rabbit hole to getcomfortable with um even just saying theword lard i mean the first timeone of the first times i did apresentation on this four other doctorsuh somebody asked me like okay so if weshouldn't eat these seed oils and we caneat butter what about lard and iremember i was like well i can't quitego there yet because i i was like soindoctrinated right i mean you reallyhave to go down the rabbit hole and thenhere's the other thing your life ismiserable as a doctor in the regularmedical system when you know what realnutrition can do because you will alwaysbe behind schedule you will always havethe nurses telling you oh there's like10 people in the waiting room you're twohours behind because once peopleunderstand that you know how to helpthem with nutrition they won't leaveyour office and you're still supposed tobe seeing them every you know 15 minutesso you can't possibly it's just it's soit's such an inconvenience to yourcareeryeah that's like it made my lifemiserable it was really hard i mean iwanted to do it but that's why i wrotebooks i was like please just read thebook it's in the book i try to make thebook as comprehensive as possible that'swhy it's 600 pagesyeah i mean the the the thethe model of a doctor is um much moreprofitable because you know you just gothere for 15 minutes essentially mostdoctors are prescription bots i meanthey can be replaced with a few lines ofcode they learn a whole bunch ofsymptoms in a college and then you walkin you give them the symptoms and theyneed to try and remember which onethis was before the internet came aboutandcomputer apps you need to just matchthose symptoms with the prescription andthen give them the drug and of coursethe more drugs you give the more moneyyou're making for the pharmaceuticalcompanies the more money you make themore money your hospital makes the moreeverybody's happy so you want thatindustrialassembly line production where thepatient patient comes inyou don't even look them in the eye youhear their symptoms and then you knowbecause you studied so hard in medicalschool you immediately know which drugto give them and then they leave andthen 15 minutes and you're churning themout but if you're trying to explain tothem all the things that we're talkingabout here you're going to need a lotmore timeand pharmaceutical companies can't makeany money from you not only will theynot make money also food companies can'tmake money sothis is why this message is so unpopularunfortunatelyabsolutely i mean i think one of the bigreasons that the hospital systems getaway with all the corruption is becausenobody's actually paying for it no oneactually sees themselves as paying forit right like they don't knowyou know their taxesmost of their you know medica so much oftheir medicare all of their medicarelike how much they're paying in medicaretaxesthat's like money that they say thegovernment has that someone else ispaying for all this corruption and a lotof it is the government right likehalf of all births now in this countryor nearly half are paid for by thegovernment in medicare because uhmedicaid i mean because there's so manypeople who just don't afford healthinsurance in that age group and that areyoung and having babies and then thebabies are there all their you knowproblems are covered by the governmentsowe're not paying for the consequences ofour unhealthy diet someone else isandemployers now our you know employers formany years have been requiredtopay health insurance for their employeesand employers aren't specialists in thebusiness of health insurancebut yet they pack it into their budgetand they they act you know just likeit's any otherbudgetary line item even when they haveno idealikewhat is going on and what they'reactually paying for you know unlikeevery other line item of their budgetthey know exactly who you know whatthey're paying for in every other realmthey have no idea what they're gettingwith health insurance and they andand nobody is you know nobody has theknowledge to questionto question it and so it's because wehave this weird insurance system that wehave where other people are paying forfor uh you know someone else is alwayspaying for your problem if you had topay for your own bypass i guaranteeyou'd think twice about it like youmight say hmm well i don't have anychest pain right now so at least i knowi have a few minutes to can i just get asecond opinion um can i look it up can igoogle it uh you know if you had to paythat 20 upwards of 20 000 bill yourselfyou might but when you have healthinsurance you're just like well that'swhat i'm getting that's what i'm payingall this money for my health insurancefor rightso so it uhit's just that's part of why there areno checks and balances because it's notyour own personal finances that are hitwith thisyeah well this is this is where um youknow this leads very nicely into themain topic of this podcast money inbitcoin because the reality is that youare paying for everybody's bypasssurgery through inflation all of this isbecause of fiat money all this isessentiallyonce the government is able to takecharge of the money money supply oncethe government can inflate the moneysupply and print itthengovernment is essentially destroying theconcept of opportunity costand soyou don't think of the cost of thebypass you don't think of anythingpeople don't think of the cost ofpolicies you know people want to votefor politicians that want to give themhospitals and bridges and roads and youknow democracy in iraq and all kinds ofinsane and they think nobodythinks that there's any trade-offnobody's ever said you know we can'thave a hospitalif we want to giveiraqis democracy we're going to have tochoose there's never a trade-off becausethe government can just keep printingmore and more and more money and so therational strategy in this kind of worldis to try and get yourshare of it by trying to get as much ofthat printed money and so the medicalindustry has turned all these thingsinto you know issues and again it's allfear and it's manipulation and we sawall this insanity with you know with thecoronavirus but of course it's beengoing on in the medical system fordecades um once you get people to beafraid oh no you know presidenteisenhower has a heart attack and nowheart attacks are becoming a seriousproblem well then you want to get intooffice you run on a platform of we'regoing to give everybody a free bypassbasically or we're going to include thisin healthcare reform we're going to havemedicare cover it and of course you cando that becausemoney is fake money is um youknow there's no cost to making moredollars anybody can make it so we'reconstantly devaluing the dollarand that's on the one hand you knowfinancing all of this enormous growthwithout accountability you know you saidthere's no checks and balancesthe real check and balance in a marketis money you knowif youif you were in a free market and you'rejust making all of your customers spendenormous amounts of money on hard bypasssurgeries well you're just going to endup with all the people who go to you toyour hospital being broke eventuallywhereas the people who go to otherhospitals that don't do this insanitythey keep their money and they stayhealthy so that's the check and balancebut ifall the hospitals are subject to policyby one government with a magic moneyprinterthenthere's no sense of thinking about hangon a second maybe those people don'treally need this have we tried noteating first before we startputting their hearts on ice and pumpingtheir blood through a machine like maybejust give it a couple of months of noteating industrial waste before you trythis there's no incentive to think aboutthat and we see this in all manner ofthings in in sciencein medicine in all kinds of umfacets of modern life and thatuh you know this is how i try andbasically end every one of thosepodcasts with this this is this isreally why bitcoin fixes this bitcoinfixes everything i don't know howfamiliar you are with bitcoin butbitcoin is the solution to all of theworld's problems approximatelyand uh it's because you know it bringsback the concept of opportunity cost ina world in which government can't printmoney and money is real money has a hasa cost to make and nobody has a magicprinter to make moneypeople are going to be a lot smarterabout their decisions and i think we'regoing to have a completely differentmedical system from theinsane um one that we have right nowyeah it can't come too soon because it'sit's uhthe medical system is unfortunatelyyou know hurting people just with somany prescriptions like one of the worstoffenders is the statin drugs becauseeverybody believes having a high bloodcholesterol level is is harmfuland so they get terrorized into i meanit is terrorism it's medical terrorismtelling people that your high ldl levelisgoing to hurt you right i mean that'slike well we got to get that down we gotto do something about that and oh andhere's this pillit itthe cholesterol pillshow many of our presidents have we seentheir like mental healthdecline as they were in the presidencyafter they had a heart attack well imean bill clinton is one i don't knowwhat's going on with biden and whathappened with him or when it happenedbut um most adults over the age of 60are now on statins and statin drugsblock your brain's ability tomanufacture cholesterol your brain needsto manufacture cholesterol or you can'tbuild new memories new synapses youcan't build the physical structures youneed to be able to learnand sostatin drugsthey bring you down like a fewcue points satin drugs combined withvegetable oilsis a recipe for dementia and soand i've just i've seen it over and overso common that it's rare for me to runinto a 70-something year old that canreallythat really is cognitively intactanymore i meanwe've got an epidemic of mild cognitiveimpairment and uh and nobody's reallytalking about that but it'sit's uh it's really sad because ourolder generationswe're supposed to have some wisdom tohelp us out we're supposed to havepeople who have seen this all before totell us oh this has all happened beforeit'll all happen again and be smart andwise and have like the answer right butour older generations aren't there forus anymore because we've damaged they'vedamaged their brains unknowingly and youknow i mean that may be completelypolitically incorrect thing to say buti'm sorry i have just seen so manypeople in like over age age 70 justthey can't learn the way i know peopleused to be able to learn in that agegroup because i've been in medicine foralmost 30 years now soaging and memory loss are not synonymouswhat happens is our our brain changesour brain is constantly changingthroughout our entire lifespan and sothere are some little details of thingsthat maybe we don't remember so well wecan't recall certain things so quicklybut we have longer connectionsthroughout our brainso it's not supposed to be dementia it'snot supposed to be that oh i just mybrain just doesn't work anymore we aretruly supposed to be fonts of wisdom aswe age because we make longerconnections across areas of our brainthat are not interconnected when we areyounger so just i mean imagine what thatmeansyou know our brain is amazing it's anamazing computer and as we get olderit's supposed to become interconnectedacross different realms of cognitionthat means that we should really be likeable to come up with different ideas anddifferent thoughts we have a wholedifferent way of thinking as we age andthat's normal that's like what we reallythat's where we're supposed to beand we don't see that our generation hasbeen deprived of the wisdom of ourelders and i mean of course they've beendeprived too but umbut that that's a whole other aspect ofthis the seed oil diet but you combinethat with the statins and it's just it'sjust devastatingabsolutely and you know one of the sadthings is um you know president biden umlike it it's treated as this cute uhthing about old people that he's helikes his ice creamandumso you know sorry but alzheimer's istype 3 diabetes it's just a form ofdiabetes it's your brain being fried byall the sugar and vegetable oils thatyou're eating and it's it's sodevastating to see this man being youknowfed all of this stuff instead of havingpeople around him to tell him this andto watch uh watch this being normalizedthat you knowa man in his 70s should be eating icecream in all of these enormousquantitiesit's it's really sad but you knowworth remarking here that statins arethe biggest grossing drug in the historyof the pharmaceutical industrymaybe though maybe i think they mighthave been overtaken in the last coupleof years bysome of these products that related tothe recent pandemic which i will notname because that'll probably get ourpodcast cancelled umbut uh that'sthat's there's an enormous amount ofmoney to be made from statins and it allcomes from the insane hysteria around uhsaturated fats and cholesterol and allthiscity of pseudoscience but as a goodcounter example we have one of ourregularattendees who wants to ask you aquestion right now nathan he's i thinkyou're 70 year old70 years old nathan wright and he'slost a lot of weight and fixed hishealth byswitching to a sane human diet and hehas a question for you nathanyeah i actually have about 10 000questions you've been an interestingguest thank you very muchuh butbut i'll limit it to this i i'm i grewup on a wheat and cattle farm in thecentral u.sand now in retirementjust just culturally i love growingplants it's something i like doing andit's what i do in retirementand i work with a lot of local farmersthey growmainly vegetables but some poultry andpork that type of thingso i've been exposed to all of thatstuffand i'veheard you commentthatraising beef is actuallyeasierthan growing vegetablesand that most people don'tunderstand or realize thatand the difference is actually extremelyhighi think there's a big misconceptionabout that and about the storage of meatumbeef really isn't that difficult tohandle we're not having massive peoplearen't falling over dead from rottenbeetuh but they've jammed that notion intoour headand ifrom a just an economic perspectivei'm i'm really anxious to spend sometime personally digging into that and iwonderuhif if you can comment on any resourcesaboutthat uh uh so about that i don't knowmuch about the economics of it but um iwasn't sure that question is for me orfor safewell i'm i'm thinking about if you walkpast the produce sectionpeople don't understand the chemicalbath that's sitting therethe problem isn't necessarily that theproducer wants a chemical bathit's not a desirebut to ship a cabbage from california tokansasrequires a chemical bathfor forgetting all the ideologyso yes absolutely it's it's a lot moreexpensive to avoid meat and nourish yourbody than it is toget nutritionyou know from meat i mean perper unit nutrition or per you know unitprotein meat is a bargaineconomically and at the grocery storelevel absolutely yes i mean you canif you are willing to uh you know tocook meatuh you can do so much better for yourfamily on the same budgetcompared to if you avoid meat i i thinkright because i mean you can you canavoid people say meat is expensive butit's less expensive than vegetablesvegetables are quite expensive andthey're they're not good once you freezethem right they lose a lot of theirnutrition in the freezing processwhere meat doesn't so you can store meatso vegetables are perishable so if youdon't eat every vegetable that you buyyou've wasted your moneyand vegetables now the nutrition tablesoverestimate how much nutrition is invegetables anyway because our soil haschanged and the nutrition of ourvegetables has changed and the the datahas not been recollected right so a lotof the nutrition tables that we wererelying on are from vegetables that weregrown on soil from 1970 in 1980 and someeven going farther back than that sothere's a lot less nutrition now invegetables than there used to beand that's the the otherpart of it ispeople go to the store and expect apepper with no wormswith no blemisheswell that's not a pepper that's if youseevegetables with no blemishes it'sunedibleyeah because they've been bred for likeendurance right they've not been they'venot they're not grown for nutritionalvalue or flavor at all they're grown sothat they look like vegetables and guesswhat when you grow vegetables to looklike vegetables that is exactly what youget something that looks like avegetable and isn't exactly a vegetablebecause it doesn't have all the thingsthat it's supposed to have in there andit really doesn't taste good i mean ii gripe to my husband all the time abouthow like i can't even get cashews cashewnuts that taste like real cashews when iwas a kid my mom took me to this co-opin the basement of a church it was dirtydown there but the food was so good outyou would bite into a raw cashew and itwould explode with flavor in your mouthand now cashews are likestarchy they they mostly have starch andthey've got like a small cashew flavorand the same with almonds and it's justa food just does not taste right anymoreanduh you know that's horrible so yeah youcan grow it yourself and yada yada andall that hard work and stuff that yes ithink you know we really should do ishould have a garden more of a gardenmyself but umit'sthe this is a big problem that ourvegetables don't taste like vegetablesandyou knownobody's doing anything about it becauseno you know why why becausenobody um nathan wants to wear afarmer's hat anymore i mean nobody didyouhave you heard of any of your neighborswho are farmers who are raising theirkids and they're like you need to be afarmeror are they saying you gotta go tocollege and get out of this business i'mreally asking because i i don't see alot of young people young people eventalking about agricultureyeah i well i'm i'm kind of unique inthat i'mseeking them out and i'm around them[Laughter]one last comment uh my wife overheardyou earlier and you said something aboutold cookbooks when we were first marriedback in the 70s we attempted to make piecrustuh like her grandmotherand we tried and tried and tried andthrewbuckets of pie crust awayand fine and also my motherwe tried to emulateuh so i asked my mother what i was doingwrong and she said well you're trying tomake it like i used to and i said yeahshe goes well you got to useorgan lardand fresh butterand i said well why don't you do thatanymore she goes well it's unhealthyexactlyexactlyi know it's so sad i mean it's reallya dangerous idea that ansel keys came upwith it back in the 1950s because itit that was abad idea was like an atom bomb explodingin our dna because it severed us fromall culinary traditions there is notruly traditional cuisinethatyou can follow without animal fatwithout some kind of you know buttertallow lard some kind of animal fatthere isn't one and so what happens thenis that piece of pie you only eat onebecause of the taste of the you don'tthe sugar load doesn't overcome youexactly yeah i know there's a yeahthere's a lot to be gained byum you know just going back uh a ahundred yearsyou know i would you shows about moneybut you know i i wevalueour we don't value our connection withnature we don't have even a word forthat and umthat's really wealth like that's that'swhat the message of deep nutrition is isthat real wealth is your connection tonature and so even though childrenaren't you knowraised anymore to to be farmers like theway they used toi don't know maybe it would help to talkabout it that way and that is a jobwhere you are studying nature and you'reworking with nature and i think childrenare suffering from a nature deficitthese days you know and and they it'schanging our psychology and and justgoing outside and being in nature andlooking at it and studying it andlearning from it and what's going onthere looking at the dirt like there'sthat's an experience that is anexperience that you get to have everyday when you workin nature but we don't raise ourchildren to do that we raise them to goto college and get you knowdegrees that then they can't get jobs touse the degreesfake degrees to get fake jobs to eatfake foodthat's the fiat world[Laughter]yeah we want the deep nutrition worldthe antigen the antidote is the deepnutrition world bring that back yesyesthank you save um and thank you drshanahan it's a pleasure to listen toyou liveum i loved your book and it's probablythe only book i recommended by nutritionto whoever asked me for thatso my question is the following umone of the common pushback from themedical profession aboutthe idea of eating a higher protein dietparticularly animal protein seems to bethat high proteinpromotes igf-1 hormone which in turnpromotes growth and therefore mayactually promote cancer in addition tobeingnot very beneficial for kidney functionis there any any truth to that what isyour opinion on thisum the that is a baselessuhmedicalbelief there's no foundation in realityumif there are any studies that supportthe idea that eating more protein isunhealthy in any biological measure it'snot whole food protein that's being usedin the studies like you know like therelet me give you an example so the forksover knivesi'm sorry the china study we've allprobably heard of that it's a verypro-vegan anti-meat um the whole thingisthat against animal fati'm sorry against animal protein thewhole thing their claim that soy proteinis healthier than animal protein is allcomes down to one study now let me tellyou the study it was not on animalprotein it was oncasein which is adehydrated fraction of milk proteinand it was dehydrated and processed youknow of course during that process youdamage the amino acidsand it wasn't in humans it was inanimalsand it wasn't in healthy animals it wasin animals that were sick with liverfailureso your liver is required to processprotein properly and yes if you'remissing a liver you have all kinds ofdietary restrictions butbut that's like i'mthat is like eight degrees of separationaway from the claim that he makesrightand he's got to know that it's not trueso i like i i really i have a beef punintended with those those kinds ofmedical doctors that spew thatmisinformationand scare people away from you knownormal foodbut how do they getuh how does it become sowidespreadif there is no real scientificstudies well you like my stud my my talki did a talk on uh that's sort ofexplained a lot of this for the futureof fat summit on their youtube channel idid a talk called the um feed the massesvegetable oil the umresults of the 70-year experiment thatharvardhasbeen perpetrating on almost the entirehuman race long title anyway um so intherei talk about umhowi grew upbelieving the magazine ad propagandathat butter was unhealthy because i sawa picturethat showed a happy family and the wordsum you know mrs wilson ispolyunsaturating her family fleischman'smargarine and i remember picking up thatuh well picking up that magazine seeingthat picture in one of my dad's medicaljournals so it had to be trueand then putting it down and going tothe fridge and going oh thank goodnesswe don't have butter we have margarineso it'sit's just we it's a generation we'vegrown up we were indoctrinated it ispropaganda so we've been doctors haveall been indoctrinated with thispropaganda it's very powerful but theamerican heart association and this isthe point uh this is like one of thethings that i say in that that umlecture is the american heartassociation should not be seen asanything other than a propaganda machinefor the processed food industryand and that doctors don't of courseknow that but hopefully now they will soif youif you go to the channel and like it andshare it and all that sort of thing umyou know hopefully your doctor willwatch it and hopefully we'll have a tinysliver of an open mind that will allowhim to consider gee maybe everything ilearned about nutrition in school iswrong and maybe that's whythere's a cardiologist right now who's areally conscientious cardiologist hisname isnadiror nadir ali lu anyway umyeah i don't know first names and lastnamesum i think it's ollie nadir so he's areally great cardiologist because heis an interventional cardiologistmeaning he puts in stents he does thebypasses and hetells a story about how he gave upgiving dietary advice because it neverworked and then when he learned aboutthe keto diet which you know cuts carbsand i don't know that that's superimportant what the keto diet really doesis it gets you off seed oils and ontohealthy fats so when you learned aboutthat he became very fanatic fanaticalabout you know how much that helpspeople not have heart attacksand umso my my point with that was that umit's dr nadir ali yes somebody correctedme thank youumthat my point with that was that doctorscan learn but it will change ourpracticeit will radically changethe number of doctors needed in thiscountryso don't tell your children to go tomedical school because they won't beneeded if you tell your children to goto agronomy school or something likethatgood advice thank you drvery helpful
