is kind of whatyou can expect to see in the rest of the world.Whoever is Satoshi Nakamoto,good job for making Bitcoin.Africa has one of the most fragmented bankingpayment and currency systems in the whole world.This makes simple financial taskslike the payment of a bill,sending money or accepting money extremely hard.More than half of Africa doesn't haveaccess to any form of bank account.As a result, people hold and save everything in cash,which is frequently stolen,and the value of the savingsis eroded by inflation.Also, it's very difficult to get the moneyinto and out of many African countries.Because only about 40% of peoplehave active internet access,they must rely on financial institutionsto receive money from abroad.But there is a silent revolutionwhich is creating an alternative,and a new form of moneyis resolving all of those issues,and it's known as Bitcoin.While you might know Bitcoinprimarily as an investment tool,Bitcoin is actually used differently in Africa.Today is a very special day.I am in Mossel Bay,and I'm gonna show you guys Bitcoin Ekasi,a South African education centerwhich gives children from underdevelopedareas the opportunity for education.The kids learn what Bitcoin is,how it works and why it is so important.We know about Bitcoin.I think Bitcoin can change a lot.For example, it changed my life,because when I was living in a Townshipand working for the Surfer Kids as a junior coach,I was being paid in fiat,but then things changed,and then I got paid in Bitcoinbecause sometimes my familyused to take all my money in fiat.But then Herman decided to like\"okay, we're gonna change things\",and he created Bitcoin Ekasi,and I started getting paid in Bitcoin.So now what happens is thatno one can take Bitcoin away from me,and I'm very happy about it.It's really good.The kids learn from the veryfirst step how Bitcoin works,which means they are being taught howthey are able to send money across the worldand own their first bank account.Those kids finally have access to serviceswhich they haven't been able toaccess for generations over generations,and this gives them a lot of hope.Whoever is Satoshi Nakamoto,good job for making Bitcoin.The next stop was right in the townships.The older students learnedhow to self-custody their Bitcoin.This is very very important to ensurethat you have a good system in placeto back up your private keys.A lot of people are intimidatedby the technical side of Bitcoin,but actually, it's quite simple.12 simple words can representyour access to your Bitcoin,and anybody who knows those wordsbasically owns the Bitcoin.So the students learn how touse do-it-yourself steel devicesto safely store these words.And as I said, this can be donein a very non-technical way.You basically just need some steel plates,letters and a hammer.And there you have it: you successfullybacked up your Bitcoin wallet.Coin is life!Bitcoin is life!That's the way!But are you able to use it in your daily life?That's what I wanted to see next.I scanned it.So, I have the sets here now.Gonna pay.I paid it, and now I can get my stuff.As you can see, the communitycenter is doing a tremendous jobin helping the people to understand Bitcoin.But is this feasible for the rest of the country?This is Ricki.He's gonna tell us a little bitabout the problems in South Africa.Our government has followed policies for so longthat are centralizing.So the decay of South Africais kind of what you can expectto see in the rest of the world.We're like leading the trend.And what I mean by that is likewe don't even have enough electricity.We have a single load shedding.Yo!So, one thing about South Africa,which I  didn't know andwhich is pretty f*cked up,is that the power gridis f*cked already.Every house which doesn't havea generator is basically...black right now.Basically, there's not enough power because thegovernment has a monopoly on producing electricity.Which means that if there'snot enough energy available,they simply shut down whole parts of Cape Town.This is crazy, guys.I can't work, there's no internet, there's nothing.So, I'm having issues usingthe internet in Cape Town.So how in the world should people withoutthe internet and without a smartphone use Bitcoin?There's one person who'strying to make that happen.My name is Kgothatso Ngako,and I'm a catalyst from South Africa.I'm working on a service that basically allowspeople without internet-connecteddevices to send and receive Bitcoin.And yeah, so the project ultimately aimsto give even people on such devicesthe ability to send and receive Bitcoin.The internet penetration levels on South Africaare sitting at 80% of the entire populationwith access to the internet.Just so you guys understandwhat this guy is doing, right?You can send Bitcoin with your Nokia phone,that he was just showing,to another one. So you don't need a smartphone.It's the break that you had a couple of years ago,this one,and this guy is implementing it.I'm bullish, man.Okay guys, today I am meetinga very very special pleb.His name is Carel and I see him already.- There he is. Hey man, how are you doing?- Good as hell.- Good to see you.- Likewise, welcome.Where exactly are we here?Yeah, we are at the headquarters of PicknPay.Okay.It's the second largest retailer in Africa.My mission is very simple: it's to wire upSouth Africa to the Lightning network.South Africa has always been at the kindof the forefront of Bitcoin adoption,and I feel like what we did previouslywas just get people onboarded,get people access to the Bitcoin,get them to start stacking it.But I do believe we're now at the pointwhere we need to start spending it as well,and I know the hardcore hodlers,they don't like that message.We need to start bootstrap these circular economies,which I believe is crucial for the long-termadoption and success of Bitcoin.So we had this opportunity torun a pilot with PicknPay,and essentially it's paying with Lightningat the point of sale.This is straight: you go scan your item,the cashier says \"okay, you can pay\", and thenyou scan a QR code, which is a QR payment code,you pay with Lightning, and you're freeto leave with the goods.And since November 2022, this is the reality.You're able to walk into a PickndPay store,and pay your goods with Bitcoin.And all of the kids who learn about Bitcoin,all of the people who understand it,are now being able to use it in their daily life.This silent revolution is getting bigger every day.Many Africans now enjoythe benefits of using Bitcoin,such as accessible and easy payments,cheaper and faster money transfer,or simply as an investment.People also use Bitcoin to protect the moneyfrom painful effects of inflation, among other things.With all the projects you saw,Africa resembles this silent revolution,which gives the whole continenta hope for a better future.I hope you learned something aboutthe silent revolution which Bitcoin is,and I'm part of this revolution,and I'm funding everything that I'm doing on my own.And therefore, if you want to help me make moreand more of those videos, which I'm planning to do,I highly appreciate any help that you can give me,so either being donating sets,subscribing down below, giving me a like,or just tell me in the commentswhat you liked or what you disliked.This really helps me to give youthe best content I can.That's my goal,and therefore, see you in the next video.Bye bye!Africa is currently undergoing a silent revolution.I
