to mymy own playback in this podcast andi'm thrilled to finally have you on thepodcastwe are going to run out of time beforewe run out of materialand yeahthat would be and i want to startin maybe an odd placeand that is asking if you coulddescribe to my audience who sandy notleywasoh well i grew up in a small town innorthern albertai heard you and my producer talkingabout cold in minnesota and i was sortof smirking in the background i thoughtyou guys don't know what cold is uh wheni went to college thereabout 60 miles away we had 30 days in arow one winter where it didn't get aboveminus 40.so anyhow i grew up in this small townandin the province of alberta so that's thecanadian equivalent of a stateand we had a provincial government theequivalent of a state government and itwas all conservativesprogressive conservative party everyseat in in the house was progressiveconservative exceptone new democratic party membersocialistuh grant notley who was the leader ofthe ndp andhe wasn't elected so much because he wasa socialist i don't think because mostof the people in my small town wereconservative but because he was a reallygood mananyways he was the only opposition inthe entire province forlike decade a decade or more umhis wife sandy naughtly was a newenglanderand uh somewhatof an anomaly in our small town and sheshe was quite outspokenuh new england intellectual umand she was our librarian in our juniorhigh schooland all the delinquents and me as welland maybe i was in that category hungout in the library weirdly enoughbecause she treated us like adultsand i started to work for the ndp when iwas 14.i ran for vice president of the partywhen i was 14. that was my first sort ofpublic exposure butshe was a good guide for me sheintroduced me to a lot ofbooks i was an omnivorous reader butmostly i read science fiction i didn'tknow what the hell to readi used to spend all you know i'd hide mythe books i was reading behind atextbook in class and read away duringschoolbut i was reading mostly science fictionand shestarted to hand mebooks that she thought would be good forme um she introduced me to anne randum interestingly enough despite the factthat she was a socialistuh not and rand obviously but sandynotleyshe said she thought i would be smartenough to see through rand umuh huxley orwell solzhenitsynuh a lot of serious material and ideveloped a real friendship with her andher husband and i workedwith ndp for four years soshe was a pronounced influence on meand uh that's sandy naughtley oh and herdaughterrachel notley who was a friend of mine agirlfriend of one of my close friendsat one point became premier of albertamany years later she was defeated in thelast election which was only aboutthree years ago but she followed in herfather's footsteps andand became premier of the province sothat's that storyon your website you have an extensivelist of recommended books i've looked atitlooked at it multiple years it's closeto 100 i would sayand they're they're put into differentcategories different genresare there any books on that listor can you think of books that wereintroduced relatively early in your lifesome of the early exposures that havestood the test of time for youno huxley and orwell i would saysolzhenitsyn as well i read one day inthe life of van dijkovich when i was13 or 14 that was one of the booksnatalie recommendedand so they they certainly had an impacton me uhwhat was that impact if uh if you if youdon't mind mefollowing up well you know i started tothink in broader terms as a consequenceof being introduced to books like thatand started to think more seriously froma political perspfrom a political perspective andpsychological perspective i i supposeit was my first introduction intoserious thoughtand so and it was extremely exciting imean i ii read a lot of english literaturefrom until i was about 25 and then istarted reading nonfiction more once istarted my graduate studiesbut it opens up a world of ideas andthat was really exciting to meincredibly exciting to me so and thereason i'm asking so much about books isis i'm i i am really fascinateduh by you and i'm fascinated by everyonei have on the show but theformation of yourwell that sort of decreases my mypleasure at being the object of currentfascination wellright now you are the most fascinatingperson in the world to meand i uhi find that books are asort of a wellspring ofvalue for listeners because it'ssomething they can model very wellsomething that they can reach out for uhso so let'syeah well people can get a wholeeducation if they read those hundredbooks that i have on my websitei mean you're not going to get aneducation in every every discipline butthere's a whole education there underrecommended booksthat's been fun because lots of peoplehave that that's been an unbelievablypopular listit sells hundreds of books a month ibelieve itand people email me constantly and saywell you know you introduced me todostoyevsky thanks a loti'm i've been they're so enthralled ifyou're psychologically mindedand you like dark the darkness to somedegree you know if you likegothic imagery and and film noir andthat sort of thingdostoevsky is an unbelievable treat andhe'sso incredibly deep psychologicallyenthralling crime and punishment is anabsolutely engrossing novelas well as being a stunning work ofphilosophyanother name that shows up not once butseveral times in that listis nietzsche if i'm pronouncing thatremotely correctly i've always wonderedi never know i pronounce it likenorthern albertan nietzschei know that's wrong it's nietzsche ibelieve but i never get it righti've i've read you highlight in a senseor at least mention that nietzschepointed out that most morality iscowardice so for making the leapfrom sort of this list of books tospecific ideascould you please elaborate on thatwell if you don't have the courage ifyou don't have the courage to commit acrime it doesn't mean you're moral fornot doing itit just means you're afraid you can seethis i suppose to some degree inin mob violence people will riot becausethey don't think they'll get caughtand so they're not law abiding undernormal circumstances because they'remoral they're law abiding becausethey're afraid of punishmentand so nietzsche was veryuh careful to distinguish mereobedience from morality andhe thought of obedience not always as aform of cowardice because it can also bea source of disciplinebutnot committing a crime because you'retoo afraid toi mean it's probably better thancommitting a crime but it doesn't speakto the essence of moralityyou know and i've talked a fair bitabout this is thatthere there's there's a certain utilityin being able to do virtually anythingand then to control yourselfand that's something i learned in partfrom nietzsche i supposeyou know the best people i've ever metare dangerous peoplebut they keep themselves in check i havea close friend who's been realrock to me over the last couple of yearshe was alsoborn in northern alberta he came from apretty poverty stricken backgroundtough guy worked in lead smelters andoil rigs andhe went to university which is where imet him and then he was a social workerfor a long time andhe's tough as nails you know he's workedwith delinquents all over canada andhe's a good disciplinarian but he'she's also a very compassionate personandhe's a he's a moral person as far as i'mconcerned because there's a real dangerto himbut he keeps it under control andit's he's not a coward he's not afraidhe's not weakhow do you how do you cultivate orsuggest people cultivate you canyou can tackle either both the abilityto keep yourself in check or undercontroland to be courageous and it's just toprovidea little context for the question when is when i see you inthe the many interviews that you've donethere are instances where people areveryadversarial and aggressive andone thing that has struck me is yourability tomaintain composure while stillstanding up for not rolling over withrespect to youryour arguments or your positions how doyou cultivate that or how have youcultivated thatwell i have an advantage i suppose inthat i'm a clinical psychologist andi've spent twenty thousand dollarsalthough i'm not practicing anymorei've spent twenty thousand dollarslistening to people and maintaining mycomposuresometimes under very stressfulcircumstances umand so i've had a lot of practice doingthatum and then i did do some tv workat a local station here for a couple ofyears andi had a good producer and he helped merealize that anger plays very badlyin a public forum like video andparticularlynow i didn't have a tendency then isupposed to fly off the handle eitherbut it's not usefulto lose your temper it's not useful imean i'm boilinginside i'm a very emotional person waytoo muchso it's not like it's not stressful it'sunbelievably stressfulbut i can detach myself from that tosome degreeand i'm really curious i suppose that'sanother part of it i like to watchand when people really go after me thisis where the clinicalpractice is handyi can snap into a different mode whichis okay i don't know what you're up toso i'm just going to watch you and theni'm going to figure out what you're uptobecause i can usually figure out whatpeople are up toif i want to i i don't do that all thetime becausei actually don't want to know sometimeswhat they're up toi mean look people lots of people havetreated me extraordinarily well don'tget me wrongbut um and normally you know when whenyou talk to someoneyou accept their persona you don't lookbehind but if people mistreat mein some way or or become adversarialthen i'm able to look behind the sceneand think and see what they're up toif i can remember to do that do you lookbehindthe the mask or see what is behindby deducing where they're trying toleavewhere they're trying to lead you withthe breadcrumbs i mean i see i've seenyoudo that very effectively yeah that'spart of itwhat other forms does that take or mightthat takeit's really hard to describe i i guess ii i think it's useful to draw adistinction between thinking and payingattentionif you if you're thinking you're kind ofwalking down aprogrammatic trail if you're payingattentionyou just open your eyes and let yourmindgo where it will and ideas will occur toyouthey'll pop up in your field ofconsciousness andfor me that's often informative i'll getinsightthat way i suppose i'm paying moreattention to non-verbal communicationand toyou know facial expression and postureandand and tone of voice and i can pick uppatternsi suppose you mentioned earlierthat at times you're you're boilinginside uh icertainly have experienced thatpersonally now angerhow would you distinguish and and i sortof intuitivelyknow these are different but i wouldstruggle to maybeon the spot separate the two anger andresentment becauseuh one of your quotes that ihave here in front of me with my notesis consult your resentmentit is revelatory and i'd love to unpacki'd love to unpack that uh but if youcouldwalk us through yeah well in my new booki have a chapterwhich is rule 11 do not allow yourselfto become resentfuldeceitful or arrogant it's kind of theevil triad as far as i've been able todetermineresentment in particular it's bad it's ait's a bad emotion it's usefulyou can learn a lot by noticing that itoccurs resentment tells you one of twothingsone is that you're that someone'streading on your territory andsomething needs to be done about it orthat you need to grow the hell up andstop complaining and it's hard it isn'tnecessarily obviouswhen you feel resentful which of thoseit isbut you need to figure it out you knowbecause you canyou can harbor resentment for forunlived lifefor for a very very long period of timeand all it does is corrupt you ithurts you hurts you physically becauseit's a stressful emotionanger is a stressful emotion um becauseyour bodyhyper prepares for action if you'reangry becauseyou might get into conflict so andthat's a highthat's a dangerous situation and so youburn off a lot ofpsychophysiological resources in angerif you're resentful there's probablysomething you need to saythere's certainly something you need tofigure outand so you can you can use it as a guideto further developmentit's very much useful to to aim at aresentment free existenceand that means i suppose that you'retaking up enough spaceyou know you're not there's always astruggle between your domain andthe domain of other people everyonecompetes for everyone else's attentioneveryone competes for everyone else'stime you compete for your own timeand if you're resentful it's highlyprobable that well as i said eitheryou're not standing up for yourselfsufficiently or someone is legitimatelyon your case in which case you well youneed to do something about thator you know live with the consequenceswhich is very unpleasant it's notoptimalsometimes i suppose it's unavoidable butyou know generally there's somethingthat can be done about itmaybe you need a new job it's easy forpeople to think that they're better thanthey areand it's not surprising that everybodywants to think thati probably want to think that about meso then you'll get angry about somethingyou know maybe your partner puts youdownin public doesn't show you the respectmaybe you're married saying husband andwife owe each othera certain amount of categorical respectsort of independent of the individualpersonalitiesyou know what if you have decided thatyou're going to devote your life tosomeone and vice versathey're now in a category that requiresa certain amount of respectand to maintain the relationship overtime that's good for your partner andit's alsogood for you maybe you've taken a shotin publicand you're really angry about it and butyou don't notice it because you want tothink that you're better than you arethat sort of thing doesn't upset you andso you don't say anything about it youdon't do anything about it andthen you don't fix it and that's amistake it's much better you could sayto your partner look you know we're outfor dinnertonight and you said something snarkywhich i didn't think was appropriate nowi might be a hypersensitive um i mightbe hypersensitive and touchy andimmature and maybe you hit me in a weakspotor maybe you're playing some power gamewhy don't we figure that outnow that's messy people don't likeconversations like thatand i think that's one of the thingsthat's peculiar about mefor one i don't know why exactly but idon'tlike that i i won't let those things goso the peculiarity is that you'll you'llopen those conversations you don't havean aversion to itwell i have a horrible adversion to itand i don't likeconflict but i've learned and i this ispartly i suppose clinical training butit's not just thatsome things if you don't address themthey just get worseand i've i've been able to see wherethings are going to go it's kind of likewhat imentioned to you earlier that if i watchsomeonei can generally figure out what they'reup toi also can see where things are goingandso you know if if if i walk intosomeone's house andthere are things out of order in aparticular wayif i pay attention to that that's inthat's often indicative of something notright in the relationshipyou know maybe the kitchen's a mess it'slikethere's no there's food that isn't freshin the fridge for example oror there's packages up in shelves thathaven't been opened for like two yearsor since the wedding let's say umthat's too much chaos in the kitchensomething's wrong well what's wrong wellthere's something wrong in the domesticrelationshipthere the bargaining about who does whatin the kitchen hasn't beenfought through and soyou have to have those fights to putthings in order andif you don't then you end up with aworse fight in the futureand so the reason that i call things outas far as i can tell the positive reasonwho knows what the negative reasons areis because i don'twant more conflict i'd rather havegenuine peace which is very very veryhard to obtainpeople generally obtain peace bysweeping things under the carpeti have another chapter in this new bookcalled don't hide things in the fogand it that's what it concentrates on ispay attention to your negative emotionsresentment particularly it's likeit's so it's so uhinformative you find out where you'reimmaturewell do you want to probably not whowants to find out thator you'll find out who's oppressing youand maybe then you can learn to stand upfor yourselfwell let's let's dig into the new book iwant to do it in a particular waywhich is starting with a quote of yoursthata close friend of mine has committed tomemory nowplease fact check me on this perhapsit's abraham lincoln or oscar wilde orone of the otherubiquitous attributions on the internetbut but here we goand i'm fond of this as well quote itseems to me that the purpose of life isto find a mode of being that is someaningful that the fact that life issuffering is no longerrelevant uh now i have a i have afollow-up just asegue from that but is that an accuratequotewell i don't know if it's an accuratequote but it sounds like something iprobably saidaccurate sentiment a a aattributed accurately attributed allright it seems to me that it's truei mean it isn't necessarily the casethat you can do itall right yeah it's right it's hard todo i meanand that of course it's hard i supposein proportion to the suffering thatyou're undergoingand it isn't necessarily the case thatyou can always manage it butbut but sometimes you can manage it andand it's good if you canso i want to uh useyour book as ai mean prop isn't the right word avehicle for exploring thisuh one of the books that you oftenreferenceis man search for meaning by viktorfranklsorry i'm gonna i'm gonna stop just fora sec because i thought about some otherthingsso this is partly whyi have a certainconservative bent i suppose seepeople need to search for meaningbecause they get corrupted by sufferingif their life isn't meaningfulthat's how it looks to me because youcan't torture an animalforever without it lashing outand so if your life is nothing ifthere's nothing in it that speaks to youthere's still going to be suffering youcan't talk yourselfout of that and so then i see peopletearingtearing down traditional structureslet's sayor they're casual about them anotherrule in this new book is uhdo not casually denigrate socialinstitutions or creative achievementwell why social institutions well i'vecounseled lots of people who were lostand so if you came to see me and i wasyour therapisti'm very practical i'd say to you okaywell let's look at your life for aminuteum do you have an intimate relationshipwhat about your family and that could beyou know married with kids or it couldbe the family of your birthyour siblings and your parents and so onhow's that functioning do you haveanyone theredo you have a job or maybe a career evenif you're fortunate at least a job thatkeeps body and soul together and maybewhere there's some chance of advancementand hopedo you know how to use your time outsideof work productivelydo you take care of your mental andphysical health do you managethe temptations drug and alcohol use andthat sort of thing do you manage thosetemptations effectivelyum are you educated asare you as educated as you areintelligent you know have youand those are standardthose are standard patterns of activityin the world do you have kids do youhave a wife do you or a husband do youhave a jobi mean it's mundane in some sense butand you can look beyond all thosestandard answers for meaningbut if you're overwhelmed by lifeanxious andand suffering that's a good place tostart put that togetherwhy well the answer to that is becausethat's what people dothat's what people do that's the bestwe've been able to manageand so and if you don't have thatbecause you're a human being like otherhuman beingsyou're going to suffer for itand so attacks on that assaults on thataren't that helpfulunless you have a better like i havethis friend he's an atheistand he's wavering about this he was borna communist he was raised in polandand he had objected at one point tothe christmas traditions of his familywho were also atheistic and uhyou know he objected on the grounds oflogical coherencewhy are we doing this welldon't do it well then what happens wellthen you have another weekdayyou lose christmas wellgreat it's like now you're logicallycoherent wonderfulbut you've lost christmas you don't wantto throw these things awayyou know when i see this sometimes withyoung people when they're talking aboutgetting marriedwe don't need to get married we don'tneed a piece of paper it's likereally that's your that's the depth ofthought you've put into thisit's like you're not going to mark thispermanencewith conscious awareness and socialcelebration and the sanction of yourcommunity anda beautiful ceremony that's just nothingyou let that go well what do youwhat are you going to replace it withnothing ohyou know you can say it's it's i don'twant to be married in a churchi don't believe in god fair enough butgood luck filling in the holeso what is the template for constructivecriticism of a social institution inother words if there is a wrong way todo itwhere you're creating a void and notoffering a better solutionwhat is the what is the betterapproach or what might be you know i gotwell known i suppose in part because ofmy injunction to peoplethat they clean up their room my closetby the way is a mess i haven't been ableto clean it up for like three yearsso um there's this english common lawprinciple with regards to thedistribution of poweri think it's english common lawthat there are certain responsibilitiesof the family andthe community in the town and the stateand the and thefederal government and the internationalorganizations andbut you want to have the most proximallevel possible take responsibility for agivenenterprise and i think that's a goodphilosophy personallyyou want to make changes start withwhat's under your controlstart with changing those things thatwill hurt you if the changes go wrongthere's a good one you know and it'sbetter i think to put your life togetherthan to go worry about parading aroundand being a social activist i thinkmost of that's fraudulent and i thinkit's appalling thatstudents learn or people learn to dothat mostly at universities i think it'sit's it's it's appallingfix up your own life and that doesn'tmean you shouldn't be involved in thecommunity buti believe that you you have to earn thatrightnot only not because there's somethingmore wrong with you than wrong withanyone elseit's just that you don't want toif you if you operate at a level that'sbeyond your competence all you're goingto do is make catastrophic mistakespractice locally till you're competentand thenif you dare well move out a little bityou know as you matureand you gain some when i when i used towork for the ndpthe socialists back when i was 14 or 15.one of the things i came to realize ithink i realized this when i was 16 andwent to universityit's like i woke up one day and ithought i had this ideology in my mindyou know about how the world should bestructured and i woke up one day and ithoughtwhat the hell do you knowyou don't have a family you don't haveany experience you don't have a joblike you're a pup i mean i was smartenough iverbally could hold my own and my headwas full of ideas i could defend thembut you know at the same time that i wasa socialistkid i was i sat on the board ofgovernors for the local collegeand almost all the people on that boardwere local businessmenmost of them immigrants because northernalberta was an immigrantlike it was only 50 years old everybodyhad moved there it was a new place itwas the end of the frontier literally wewere at the end of the railway thenorthernmost tip of thenorth american prairie and there was allthese conservativessitting on this board and me andwhat i found was i actually respectedthese peoplelike i didn't i wasn't my ideology myexplicit ideology was antithetical totheirs but when iinteracted with them one-on-one ithought hmmthese people have made something ofthemselves anduh when i talked to the activistsi never got that impression i thoughtyou guys are resentful as helland you don't know anything you've neverdone anything but you're noisy andself-righteous and so that put a lot ofcognitive dissonance that filled me withcognitive dissonanceso i was gonna go to victor frankelbut i'd like to pull a hard left oh it'sa dangerous thingit is a dangerous thing especiallydepending on the country you're inespeciallyuh and we'll come back to victor frankelbecause i would like to ask about itabout him but but first i'd like to gotouh aldous huxley and possibly hunter sthompsonoh yeah i was interested to seefear and loathing in las vegas by hunters thompsonon your on your list of suggested booksand uhisland or the island i don't know ifthere's athe in the title by aldous huxley andgoing into or down the rabbit holewith your videos and interviews inoticed that you seem to have quite afamiliarity withthe research done by rick strassmanwith intravenous nndmt and alsothe psilocybin research at johns hopkinswith roland griffiths matt johnson andand their entire team uh but in theclips that i've seenthere isn't really a lot of contextthere's snippets that i've foundwhat has been the context forintroducing those to your classes or inyour lectureswell i did my phd inalcoholism so psychopharmacology i meani've got a phd in clinical psychologybut my research wasfor years eight years nine yearswas all drug and alcohol abuse iconcentrated on alcohol but that wasokay becausealcohol is like water it it crosses theblood-brain barrierlike water it bathes every cell it haspolysystemic effects and so if you studyalcoholfrom the psychological and andpharmacological perspectiveyou have to learn the function of thesystems that all drugs affectyou know all drugs of abuse affectfundamental motivational or emotionalsystems that's why we take themalthough with the hallucinogens it'smore complex you know likebenzodiazepines and barbiturates andalcohol they'rethey're anxiolytics they reduce anxietyalcohol also has a dopaminergic effectfor some people kind of like cocaineor amphetamines um there's theanalgesics like heroin or cocainecocaine is also analgesic so well thepsychomotor stimulants are analgesic aswellbut the big categories are painrelieving anxiety relieving andand psychomotor stimulant and and mostdrugs of abuse fall into thosecategories and then there's thehallucinogens which are their wholewhole otheruniverse and so i'm well versed in inthe psychology of and the physiology ofdrug and alcoholuse and so that's the context that'spart of it anyways i'm also interestedinreligious experiences and for one reasonor anotherand it's a bottomless mystery umthere are agents that reliably producereligious experiencesand no one knows what in the world to doabout thatthat's for sure[Laughter]there are there's a there's a studyongoingat hopkins also that that's looking atthe effectsof uh serotonin 2a agonistslike psilocybin's effects onworld view of religious leaders ofdifferentfaiths which which uh oh is that rightand how are they doing thatwell they do they're doing it with as iunderstand it administrationuh probably 30 milligrams of syntheticpsilocybin wow that should definitely beillegalshould be illegal or illegal well it'sno wonder it was all made illegal i meanit's pandora's boxin in what in what respect what wouldyour what would your concerns bewith that particular pandora's box welllook what happened when psychedelicswere introduced into the culture in the1960syou know it was it was revolutionary noone knew whatno one knew how to regulate or controlit and i don't mean control by clampdown i just meantno one knew what to do with it i mean itknocked timothy leary off to the sidesideways you know and i had timothyleary's old position at harvardokay he had the same position as me yeahso that was kind of interestingyeah i think i think the i mean thesocial dynamics are very differentin the sense that yes there are a lot ofrisks psychologicaluh in rare cases physicalwith psychedelic use butum i'm very involved with the phasethreetrials both for psilocybin and mdmaassisted psychotherapy quiteseparately is griffiths running nowgriffiths isinvolved so they would be one site forthephase three trials yeah well he's thereal scientist he's great he's a he's aclosehe's a close friend uh and uh he's i methim at a conference onawe he's an excellent excellentscientist with a lot ofa lot of exposure to uhpsychoactives uh expert in caffeinemetabolism and all things caffeine amongother compoundsthe i mean you've spoken in in thevideos i've seen at least of the changesin openness yes they're pronouncedwould that not be a positive thing ifthat is a consequence of openingpandora's boxdepends on how neurotic you areno i mean technically this is thetechnical discussionopenness isn't much fun if you're highin neuroticism all rightbecause you continually undermineyourself like openness is creativity butlet's let's not be allpolyannish about this there wouldn't bevariation in creativity if it wasn'tdangerousthere's lots of people who are very lowin openness and there's a reason forthatnow it has advantages you know openpeopleoccupy a particular niche they're on theedgejordan would you mind defining opennessin this particularcontext sure well people people who areopenum there's creativity essentiallycreativity and verbal fluencytogether make up openness now it's alsoassociated withverbal iq so it's the one there's fivepersonality traitsextroversion it's positive emotionneuroticismthat's negative emotion agreeablenessthat's compassion versuspredatory aggression something like thatconscientiousnessthat's dutifulness orderliness umand then openness which is umintellect interest in ideas andcreativityand you know you might think the more ofthat the better butno that isn't how nature worksyou can undo yourself by being openpeople who are open have a hard timecatalyzing their identity becausethey're soprotein they shift shapes constantlythey're interested in everything itmakes it very hard for them to pursueone thing and it my observation is thatif people arehigh in negative emotion so they'reprone to anxiety for examplethen being open can be a curse becausealong when you expose yourself tosomething that's unknownyou know the extroversion and opennesscan drive you forwardas a function of of curiosity andengagement butthe uncertainty is also the uncertaintyyou pay a price for physiologicallybecause when you're when you facesomething uncertain your bodylike when you're angry your body has toprepare for anythingand that's expensive and physiologicallydemandingand so and open people they flip thingsupside down all the timeand that's dangerous like it isn't likeit's notnecessary don't get me wrong it'snecessarythis chapter i made allusion to i saiddon't casuallycriticize social institutions orcreative achievement i picked thosephrases very carefully we need socialinstitutionsbut they become corrupt and so we needcreative revolutionbut it can get out of hand and sothere's this constantwar between the strictures of traditionand the transformation of creativityand you can't say who's right you canjusttalk it out yeah butyou know what the psilocybin you takeone dose and have a mystical experienceand you'reyou move from 50th percentile opennessto 85th percentilewith one dose it's a major neurologicalrewiringit's it's stunning it's stunning and youknow you could say well thati'm sure there are things about thatthat are good but jung saidbeware of unearned wisdomit's a good quote it is a good quote youknow jungreally puzzles me because it's neverclear to me how he knew the things heknew andthat's one really good example of thatso on the on the openness just toexplore this a bit further you know itit also seemsagain i'm not a clinician but butspeaking just as aas a as someone at least involved onsomeon some level with the the the scienceand there's an open personi try yeah oh no there's no doubt aboutit given what you do you'reentrepreneurialand you're interested in ideas like youryour cardinal personality traitundoubtedly is openness andyou know if if you can manage it it's agreat traityeah so the on on one hand on the onehandyou have uh disqualifyingcriteria for becoming a subject in thepsilocybin studies schizophrenia beingone of them or a family historyof schizophrenia uh whichyou know seems to overlap with some ofwhat you were saying earlier right thereare risk factorsuh if if you are sort of swimming closerto thethe bank of the river that is chaos yeahif you're schizophrenic if you'reschizophrenic you should stay away fromamphetaminesit's pretty obvious that the um whateverthe hallucinogens doisn't the same as schizophrenia that'speople think that but you can induceparanoid schizophreniain normal people by overdosing themoment on amphetaminesyeah so not still it might not be a goodidea ifyou have a family history to you know tomess aroundyeah it seems it seems to possiblyaccelerate the onset not that they'rethe same thing although thesedrugs used to be referred to aspsychomimetics but that's since beensomewhat disproven in terms ofneurological correlates just looking atmri fmri scans and so on now on theother handyou have acute anxiety in some caseschronic but acute anxiety and sayterminal cancer patientswhich hopkins has also uh is apopulation hopkins has worked withyeah and in those cases the shiftopenness can belife-changingly positive well i don'tknow if it'sshift to openness exactly or if it's thereligious aspect of the experiencetrue yeah true absolutely if you haveego dissolution that can dosomething for fear of death oh yeah ithink i also think that'sthat's phenomenal research it'sunbelievably interestingum you know and it's certainly the casethat like ifirmly believe that the world is not theway we perceive it it'sdeeply it's deeply strangeand i do believe that the hallucinogensreveal thatum and i you know i don't think thatattempts to drive them underground havebeen particularly fruitfulone of the consequences of the war ondrugs is now we have like 500psychoactive chemicals instead of 20 or30 you know because chemists keepchasing the laws andso making it illegal isn't doesn't looklike a good solutioni wouldn't i wouldn't uh that doesn'tmean we have a good solutionyeah yeah 100 agreed i mean if you justlook also atblack market synthesis of something likemdma you have deforestation in cambodiaor you have chemicals being dumped inholland which is a real nexus forproductionif you legalize and regulate and taxthat as you would any other industrythen many of those problemscease to be problems not to make itsound easybut i agree with you as i suppose whati'm sayingi have to ask before we go to victorfrankel if if you're able to put wordsto itin what ways do you think reality isdeeply strangecan you elaborate on that in any waythere's a narrative aspect to it there'sa religiousaspect to it there's a meaningful aspectto itthat we don't understand we can'tunderstand it scientifically or wehaven't been able tothe scientific viewpoint excludes thatto some degreeand i think the best evidence for thatprobably does come from hallucinogenicexperiencenow people have clearly people havea biologically instantiated religiousinstinctnow it's possible that that only speaksof our peculiar biological naturethat it doesn't reflect broader realityas such butif you go deep enough into the psychewhat you it becomes increasinglydifficult toseparate what you discover from realitynow it's not people can clearly haveindividual subjective religiousexperiencesmost scientific phenomena are objectivemany people have to experience thephenomena at the same timeyou have these religious experiencesthat can be induced byhallucinogens let's say each person hastheir own particular experience buteveryone has an experience that'ssimilar and we don't know what to doabout thatcategory of experience and thenyou know we think in stories and we seethe world through a structure of valuei think that's i think that thathas been proven beyond a doubt byneuroscientists and psychologistsand the fact that we see the worldthrough a prism of valueseems to indicate that there's somethingabout value that's realand so that's partly why things aredeeply mysteriousi mean rick strassmann he terrifiedhimself right out of the dmt research asfar as i could tell becauseall his subjects came back and said wellyou know iwent somewhere else and saw aliens it'slike well it was a dreamno sorry wasn't a dream was way morereal than any dream in fact it wasactually more real thanlife well what do you do with thatwhat do you do especially when it's allwithin every subject or almost everysubjectone out of 30. yeah exactly no one knowswhat to do with thatwe don't know what to do with that atalland yeah and i mean it'sit's beyond comprehension it is deeplydeeply strange you know one of theimages thati uh i paused on in one of your lecturesonline there's an older lecture ibelieve wasa side-by-side comparison of twodrawings oneof or i should say a piece of artwork ofthe scandinaviantree of life and the peruvian amazoniantree of life and uhif you want if you don't mind taking amoment just to describe that or i couldtry to recall ituh it was it was really striking andthen you and then you shortly thereafterhad a drawing your son hadput together and the overlap was uhreally hard to wrap your head around inin some respectsno the drawing my son made yeah i haveit in my office he was about six when hemade itit's stunning on one side there's aforestfull of pine trees and then there's ariver running down the middlethen on the other side there's a townbut the town is all mushrooms likelike amanita muscaria mushrooms so allthe houses have mushroom capsand so there's an order there's order onone side and chaos on another and theriver runs between themand then out of the river grows abeanstalk and the beanstalkstretches up to heaven the clouds arethere and saint peter's there by thegateslike it's not like my son had anyparticular christian religious educationlike he didn't we didn't go to churchand i saw him draw that and i thoughtthat'sunbelievable i can't believe you drewthat because it'sit's a shamanic drawing it's chaos andorder those are the two subsets ofexistenceright at the point they meet out of theriver grows the tree of lifeit reaches up to heaven that and theshamanand they call they climb the tree oflife and they go to heavenand you know when merce elia people whostudied the shamanmany of them thought that if theexperience was drug induced that somehowit had been pathologized that wasn'tpart of theactual tradition but i think that'scompletely wrong is thatpeople have been using psychoactivedrugs totranscend their consciousness for godonly knows how longone of the most interesting hypotheses iever encountered i think that wasterence mckennahe thought that psilocybin mushrooms andhuman beings co-evolvedso who knows you know umthe stoned ape hypothesis yeah it'sa and what's what's further moreinteresting is that we are not the onlyspecieswho seeks altered states ofconsciousnessi have a little book about animals whoseek out psychoactive experiencesflies even that's why amanita muscariais called uh what is it the fly fly agarrickbecause flies stoned yeahyeah yeah even flies reindeereven flies yeah it's very strange it'svery very strange it is it is verysafe to say that we do not know what todo with that uhyeah well we don't we also don't what wealso don't know what to do with thingswe don't know what to do withyou know that's the problem with openingpandora's box is that ifyou have your life reasonably wellconceptualizedand then you have an experience thatindicates to you that you just don'tknow what the hell's going on at allit's likewell what do you do then yeah andin fairness this is uh maybe a subset ofwhat you're describing buta term i was introduced to by roland wasontological shockyeah and fewer though the betteryeah for that reason these are notcompounds to be taken casually wellontological shock producespost-traumatic stress disorder there's awhole literature on antolothey don't call it ontological shockit's generally termedsomething like disruption of fundamentalaxioms it's exactly the same ideayou know and one half of that's terrorand the other half is aweand that's why trips can go badbecause you can you can get the terrorside of the ontological shockwhich is also why the therapeuticwrapperthat is used by say hopkins or bymaps who is working with the mdmaassisted psychotherapy is so importantbecausethese compounds can re-traumatize ortraumatized if youor if used in an irresponsiblecontext or even if used responsiblyquite frankly that risk existswell because even the safety precautionsthat are put in placethey can certainly decrease theprobability that the trip will benegative but that doesn't mean theyalleviate the ontological shock they doitat the moment so it doesn't go astrayduring the trip butyou know there's still the long-termsequelae toto consider i need to use that word moresequelaethat is a great word you mentioned yourson was notuh these are not the exact words youused but brought up religiousyou've also described knowledge of thestories in the bible as quote vital toproper psychological healthand you have a lecture series called thepsychological significanceof the biblical stories so people candive in therebut for those who have not studied thebibleis this a study you recommend toeveryoneand if so why well i don't know if iwould recommend anything to everyoneum biblicalour culture grew out of the bible it'sgrounded in the bible for better orworseand so if you want to know who you areand why you think the wayyou think like you think you know theway you think you think youthink you don't or very rarelylike the thoughts thoughts are greaterthan you arein some sense i mean and it's very rarethat you don't thinkthat you think something that someoneelse hasn't thought you knowi can't remember who said it might havebeen alfred north whitehead thatyou know everyone's the unconsciousproponent of somephilosopher they don't everyone is theunconscious proponent of somephilosopherso nowthought exists in a hierarchy valueespecially in relationship to valueand the more profound the thought themore it deals withfundamental values and the fundamentalvalue is one upon which many othervaluesdepend that's that's that's like thetechnical definition of a hierarchy ican give you an example so for exampleimagine you're in a committedrelationshipand you're you know you and your wifehave an arrangement to do the dishes andit's her turn and she doesn't do themwell that's a minor league ontologicalshock becausewell it has implications possibly forher honesty you know and perhaps notmaybe she was tired that night god onlyknows butit's a deviation from what's expectedand you know generally those things areknitted up pretty quickly and whether ornot your wife does the disheswhen she's supposed to once reallydoesn't destabilize you that muchbecause not much else depends on it nowif she did it 10 times or something likethat well then you might start toquestion her commitment to youragreements and then you might questionher honesty and then you might questionyour relationshipand you know that you can go down arabbit hole pretty quicklybut if your partner has an affairthat tends to be quite a shock becauseyou'vemodeled your plans for behavior and evenforperception of the world on theassumption of fidelityand if that assumption is demolishedthen all those plansdis dissolve and then the uncertaintycomes rushing in and that'svery hard on you psychophysiologicallyand soanyways there's a hierarchy of valuesandthe deeper you go the more the valueslook religiousalmost by definition it's in fact youcould say that that's a definition isthatthe deepest values are religious this issomething i tried to impress upon samharris nowyou know he didn't like the terminologyreligious but it doesn't to me itdoesn't really matter becauseyou could replace it with okay deep thenyou know like have it your way we have aword for the deepest of values andthat'sreligious and so what happens when youencounter those values wellyou you trembleand you might think well not me it'slike well huhall that means is that you're protectedto a degree you cannot possibly imagineand one day maybe not maybe you'll belucky and you'll go through lifewithout being knocked pass over teakettle so to speakbut but perhaps not you run into someonemalevolent for exampleand then the scales will fall from youreyesso anyways the deepest values arereligious andour religious document is the bible andthe bible is an absolute mysteryso athei i don't care if you'reatheistic or not i mean and this lectureseries was for everyone and lots oflots of people have watched it weirdlyenough it packed the theaters that i waslecturing inof all the bizarre things and you knowit was mostly young men coming to listentosome half-baked psychologist talk aboutreligious matters for an hour and a halfthe deepest questions are religiousquestions and the bible is the bestanswer we have and if you don't likethat wellfine do better good luck i mean there'swisdom in that book that'sit's unbelievable the story of cain andabel i have a whole lecture on cain andabelthat story is one paragraph long and youcan think about that for the rest ofyour life you know it's the first twohuman beingsfratricidal murder with a genocidaltwistall packed up into a story one paragraphlongand it's all resentment it's like cainkane's sacrifices are rejected by godokay what does that meanthat's easy you make sacrifices toimprove your future and you do thaton the basis of faith you believe thatif you conduct yourself in a certain wayfate is likely to smile upon you becausewhy else would you make the sacrificesand sometimes that doesn't happen youmake the sacrifices andthe reward isn't forthcoming and willthat make you bitterwell in all probability how bitterhow about bitter enough to destroy theidealthat's all packed into that story it'sit's i don't understand iti don't understand how that's possible ihave a hypothesis you know thata scientific hypothesis is as the storyis transmitted across timeeverything that's superfluous getsstripped away because it's not memorableand then all that happensafter thousands of years of playingtelephone is thatwhat's absolutely not forgettable isretainedbut i don't think that's a comprehensivehypothesisit's partially true and i think thestory of cain and abel it's like when itopened itself up to meit just knocked i've never recoveredfrom that i don't thinkwhen you think of stories and you usestoriesand you tell stories very effectivelyand you talk about say pinocchioyou use biblical stories you're veryengagingsort of interpreter and transmitter ofstories when you're working on saybeyond order this new bookhow do you think of composing yourstoriesor your messages so that they are notlostso that they have some durability ortransmissibility well i'm alwaysmostly when i'm writing i'm trying tofigure something out although as i'vewrittenfor as the period of time over whichi've been writing has lengthenedi'm spending more time communicating theideas and less time figuring them outwhen i wrote my first book which wasmaps of meaningpretty much all i was doing was tryingto figure something out it wasjust an exercise in sustained thoughtand i worked on itfor from 1985 to 1999 about three hoursa day and i thought about itespecially when i was in my 20s all thetime i was thinking about it like13 hours a day and the ideas were justrunning through my mind ata rate far higher than i'm capable ofnowi was trying to figure something out iwas trying to figure out i was trying tounderstand malevolencei suppose among other things but when iwrotethe last two books i i was trying tocommunicate some of what i thought i hadlearnedand sobut it's still a lot of it's stilltrying to solve ato to answer a question when i lecturefor exampleand i usually do that without notes ihave a question in mind it's like okaywellwhen in the biblical lectures forexample the firstone is i think it's about two hours longon the first sentence of genesisthe question is well what does thissentence mean and so the lecture is anexploration of what it meansand i'm trying to think it through andat the same time i'm communicating thatprocess of thinking it through andthat's what i'm doing with my books andi the books are written to me you knowwhich is why i think i've gotten awaywith giving advicethe books aren't really advice or ifthey are i'm included in the populationof idiots who needs the adviceso you know these are things i haven'tthere's the last chapter is be gratefulin spite of your sufferingyou know i've had real struggle withthatso although i know perfectly well thatresentmentregardless of the cause is notproductiveit's certainly understandablegrabbing what you just said and maybegoing to a somewhatmetal level i am going to shoehorn invictor frankel because ii don't want to leave that loose end forfor listenersi frankel talks about the desire tofinish his book as one of the sources ofmeaningthat got him through the concentrationcampsuh did did your book and i don't knowthe timeline for having worked on itserved a similar purpose over the last18to 24 months absolutely absolutely itwas life rafti was i was devastated when i finisheditwhich is common experience you know bepeople and it speaks to the nature ofhuman motivation we often think wellonce i get to pointb that's where you're headed everythingwill be okay it's like no that's not thecase at all is that now you need a newpoint bso and that was really you know becausei don't work at the university anymoreand i don't have my clinical practiceanymore andum so that those are lossesto of structure for me and i had thebook toanchor myself while i was so ill andum it was invaluableand still is for that matteruh i want to ask you about the titlebeyond order but before i get to thati'm just planting the seedi'd love to ask you this is a questionthat a friend of mine several friends ofminewanted me to ask some version of and iwould like to hear your answerand that is how would you recommendsomeonethink about meaning or constructing orfinding meaningif they have reached the pinnacle ofcompetence or a high level of competencein a certain areai have a friend i won't name him becausei don't know if he would want thispublic but i i asked himsome version of this and he said well atsome point you have to either find godor have kids and having kids is easierso i had kidswell that speaks to what we discussedearlier it's like there's many domainsin which to obtain competence you canfind a new domainbut kids for sure that's like looklife is quite straightforward in someways find a partnerand stick with them you know that's hardtry to make yourself into better peopleif you canit's a challenge have kids havegrandkids thank god i have grandkidsthank god i have kidsyou know they they they're they'rethey'rethat's an they're of unquestionablevirtueand so then if you're lucky you haveother projectsand and you're healthy enough to toundertake themum with regards to how people shouldsearch for meaning well it'sthe first thing i do like i said with myclients as i do aon a scan of their lifeand we have you mentioned it at thebeginning when you introduced mei have a program a self authoring atselfauthoring.com that helps people withthis it helps you write an autobiographysort of figures out who you are it helpsyou assess yourpersonality traits positive and negativeand then it it helps you make a plan forthe futureand people have found that useful sobeyond order what is the genesis of thattitle how did you arrive at that titleas far as i can tell in the world ofvalueso let's think about value for a minuteif you move towards something you valueitotherwise you wouldn't move towards ityouthere's an old joke about the chicken iswhy did the chicken cross the roadand the answer that is well he thoughtthe other side was betterwell that's that's the case you know andin order we need a gradient of value toorganizeour action and what you have toprioritize because you can't doeverything at once and so you do thething that's mostimportant right now now and that meansyou're in a world of importanceand that's a value that that's a valueworld and the value worldas far as i can tell has two broadcomponents the taoists talked about itas yin and yang andbroadly speaking its order and chaosand order tends to be represented withmasculine symbols and chaostends to be represented for femininewith feminine symbolsthat doesn't mean order is male andchaos isfemale and you know i've been pilloriedfor this even though it's hardly myproposition but thatthe idea of the patriarchyis a symbolic it's it's use ofmasculine symbolism to represent orderso anyways orderis where what happens order isyou're in order when what you want tohappen happens when youact and so that's reassuring because notonly do you get what you want but thefact that you get what you wantindicates that yourtheory about how to get what you want istrueand every time you fail you don't getwhat you want but you alsoundermine the validity of the theorythat you're using to organize yourperceptions and your actions that'spartly why people don't like to failbecause you don't know how far back thatcanuh echo how far down your hierarchy ofpresuppositions that can echo if you'reclinically depressedevery minor failure means you'reworthless human beingand you never know when a failure isgoing to demonstrate that you know itcanin any case there's chaos and orderthey're the two great domains andyou have to contend with chaos becausetoo much of it overwhelms you you drownin itit's the flood and that happens whenyour life gets beyond you and you'resomewhere where no matter what you donothing you want happens it's a domainofterror and pain now it's also a domainof unlimited possibilitybecause outside of what you know iseverything you don't knowand there's untold riches to be gatheredfrom the domain of everything you don'tknowbut that doesn't mean it it still needsto be managed it'sdangerous now the domain of order is thesame way it's likeif if order becomes too extreme theneverythingbecomes cramped it becomes totalitarianand thenthat starts to pathologize that's thedying kingthe king who's dying for lack of thewater of life is the old tyrantwho can no longer see beyond his ownpresuppositionsand so my first book concentrated moreonpathologies of chaos andand the second book more on pathologiesof orderand they're they're a match set in inthat regarding so far as i wassuccessful at doing thatand you know the liberal types they'revery sensitive to pathologies of orderand the conservative types are verysensitive to pathologies of chaosbut they're both right it's just there'sno final solution to that problemyou're stuck with it it's an existentialuh it's an eternal existential concernthat's why mythological language isstandard across people is no matter whoyou are no matter when you liveyou always have to deal with the factthat some thingsescape your competence and no matterwhere you are no matterwho you are you have to you have toadapt to the fact ofthe existence of a value structurethat's shared across a socialgroup it's the fundamentals so those arefundamental constituent elements ofhuman experienceand we have symbols for them and we allunderstand the symbols so for example inpinocchiothis is i'm not going to go into thisbecause it's too complicated butno one balks at a puppet going to thebottom of the ocean and being swallowedby a whalewhy it makes no sensethere's nothing about that that makessenseright it's not it's obviously not anempirical descriptionof the objective world but it's soclearly real that a four-year-old canfollow it it's a mysteryyou know the whale breathes fire inpinocchioit's a dragonand whywhy is that well we face dragons foreverthat's what a human being is it'sit's a creature that faces the dragonthe dragon can burn you to a crisp butit hasit has what you need that's the worldit'll burn you up but it has what youneed and so then the question is how doyou stop from getting burned up and getwhat you needand the answer to that is that you moldyourself into the heroand that's a religious story and you saywell is it trueand the answer to that is it depends onwhat you mean by trueand you know that's a weasel answer insome ways but it's notit's because it's such a deep questionthat it can't be put forth withoutdiscussing the definition of trueso it's as deep a question as what istruenow you know it could be thatthe i would say that part of thecultural waris a criticism of the motif of the herothat's darada's fellow centrismwestern culture is fellow go-centric iwould say human culture as fellowfell logo-centric i think derek it waswrong about that it's human cultureit's it's man so to speak against naturealthough sometimes it's man againstculture and sometimes it's man againstmanit's man against nature and we triumphas the hero and maybe that story isn'ttrue or isn't correct but itthat's us and if it isn't correct wellthenwe're uh evolutionary abortionbecause that's who we are and i wouldsay well before you throw it aside maybeyou should try ityou don't have a better option anywaysand the law andthere there arewhat does it mean to try it mostly iwould say it meansit means two things it means topractice love and that meansassume that things are valuable and actaccording to that assumption and itrequires truth which isdon't say what you know to be untrueand you know when i tried to unpack thefirst sentence of genesisin the context of the broader biblicalnarrativewhat appears to be happening is thatthere's a proposition that god is guidedby love and uses truth to createit's something like that andmaybe love is something like the wishthat all being would flourishthere isn't a better story than thatwhat effect do you hope your new book tohavei know that's that might seem like alazy question but i'm going to keep itbroad i'd justbe interested to hear your thoughtswhat would what would be success asuccessful effectfor this book looking back 12 monthsfrom now 24 months from nowwell i would like it would be lovely ifit had the same effect on people as thelast book appeared to haveyou know i'm i mean it's comforting tome toread through my youtube comments oddlyenough because that isn't generally aplace people would go for comfortyou know untold numbers of peoplehave said to me in person butpublicly in in that way thatthey've put their lives together atleast in some waysandyou talked about victor frankl you knowwhen i wrote maps of meaning i said welli was interested in malevolencei was deeply affected by the accountsi'd read of what happened in the secondworld war andin germany and what happened in sovietunion and in chinathese horror showsthat characterize the 20th centuryconstrain malevolenceand so if you study malevolence youstart to understand what the opposite ofthat isthe opposite of malevolence is somethinglike the hero's journeyyou know and it's it's easy to becynical about that butwell it's not that easy because ifyou're cynical about that then youundermine your own lifeand everyone knows this this is theother thing that's so interestingeveryone knows thisyou never teach someone you love to lieyou're always appalled if you have a sonor daughteryou're always appalled if they don'ttell the truthyou know in the deepest part of yourheartthat if you don't tell the truththe world falls apartand that's actually true you know italked about unearned wisdomit's it's no trivial matterto understand that you know dostoevskysaideveryone is responsible for everythingthat happens tothem and everything that happens toeveryone else as welland you know that's an insane statementand he was a very extreme person butit's alsotrue and i think that's part of whatpeopleget a glimpse of when they have ahallucinogenic induced religiousexperience it's likethere's a lot more resting on you thanyou thinkand you know that you don't wake up inthe morningberating yourself for telling the truthyou wake up at four in the morningbraiding yourself for violating yourconscienceyou know and classically in in at leastin some strains of christian thinkingconscience is associated with christ orwith the holy spirit it's theit's the voice of god within andi'm aware of all the criticisms of ideaslike that but you know it's prettyit's really something that you can'tcontrolyour conscience so what is it exactlyit's not you you're responsible to itit holds you accountableit transcends you so what is itwell if you think it's nothing wellviolate it for a while and see whathappensso you know i hope what i wrote inbeyond order is trueyou know and if it's true it should dosome goodbecause what's true does good at leastthat's the hopejordan i think we'rerunning
