myheart be like hey guys here's the truthof what's going on like let's dosomething about it but maybe there'ssome confession of character that'scoming out of that too like things Ihaven't dealt with unresolved personalblemishes I think is Preston push put atone time yeah andbut going into Bitcoin this has all beenlike part of that Bitcoin Journey it'slike you see yourself differently overtime and you're likehopefully spiraling upward that's theego death yeah right that is that thatis what's ha that is what ends becauseit forces you to come to theseconclusions[Music]hey everybody Welcome to the

Michael Saylor andthousands of people have told me thatthis is the best podcast series they'veever heard hands down and that it wasinstrumental to their understanding ofmoney in Bitcoin so if you're looking tostart a deep dive into the nature ofmoney I don't think there's any placebetter that you can start other thanepisode one of this show now a littlebit about this show and how it makesmoney

JacksonHole Wyoming for the Bitcoin ski Summitand today we're having a real firesidechat awesome so for the audio listenersif you hear any snap crackle or pop thatis the fire beside usum You probably don't need anyintroduction you've been on this showI'd say almost if you count each episodeof the series we're at like 10 probablyepisodes togetherum you are a brilliant author thinkerand most recently the GP of ego deathcapitalum what are you guys doing at ego deathmaybe to start there before we jump intothe big stuffwe see an opportunity to build theecosystem on bitcoin and the rails ontop of Bitcoin that's just emerging andreally and and build that faster andcreateum tons of opportunity as Bitcoinaccelerates around the world and layertwo layer 3 solutions that now for along time you couldn't invest in Bitcoinand build uh applications on top that'schanged now but the world still thinksand the it hasn't and so it produces anasymmetric value immigrationum that you're we're literally we thinkwe're literally building into a newpeer-to-peer decentralized internet andwith more profound implications than theinternet itself and we're early in thatcycle so can't I actually cannot believewe get to and I also cannot believe thatum there aren't more more VCS or moremoney chasing this opportunity becausewhen you see the opportunity it'sstagger yeah I guess it's a testament tohow early we are right yeah so there'sso your Bitcoin focused VC that's rightright and there's only less than a dozenof those I think in the world rightthat's right yeah yeah wow that's supersuper cool why ego deathum a lot of people think you're justbecause they've seen me on podcasts andeverything else it was me coming up witha name it wasn't it was my co-foundersuh Andy and Nico okay who came up withthe name but it just describes it Ithink what happens in Bitcoin it just ithappens to people who really understandthat the protocol is bigger than themand and what this does for thetransition the phase transition thatHumanity's in from one system to anothersystemum so it it I think it perfectlydescribes that but again it wasn't me Iwish I could it wasn't me who came upwell you exemplify it well so that maybethat's why people think so andumwe're just going to go straight into thedeep end here as is kind of the stylewhen I talkum as we were just talking offline theI mean the entire current socioeconomicsystem right that's premised on Fiatum I think there's a good argument to bemade that it's a giant lie right it'sthe if I look at it from an economicstandpoint it seems to be premise onthis fallacy that you can consume beforeyou produceand like you know basic economics 101right you have to grow the plant or thetree before you can consume the berriesor grow the animal before you canconsume it production always precedesconsumptionyou have fiat currency tries to invertthe whole thing right it's we're takingon more and more debtto consume before we produce and thenwe're trying to print money to inflateaway that debt or externalize the costof itand um I mean you're making the greatpoint that even like it's one thing toidentify that and say okay this is a lieI don't think it worksbut you made a good point that eventhose that have identified that as a liecan perhaps mistakenly Empower that lieby you know quote unquote yelling at itwhatever that means attacking it ortrying to denigrate it call it outwhateverand umI guess you're advocating that we shouldinstead focus our energies and attentionon building the alternative rather thantrying to and this didn't BuckminsterFuller say something like this that youyou have to allocate your energiestoward building the new not destroyingan old yeah progress something like thatum I just wanted to hear your thoughtsbecause it was it's what struck me islike if that's true if we're right aboutthisthen we're like living through thisHumanitylevelself-deception right thatthe the theParadigm of the world is we can consumebefore we produce and just print moneyat infinitum and obviouslythat seems to be falling apart for oureyesyeah and let's justlet's attack that from a different waybut it's the same thing I I explored inthe book right the um but today there wesit on call it 400 trillion dollars ofglobal debtand if you paid back a trillion dollarsa dollar per second it'd take you 32 000odd years to pay backum a trillion dollars so the debt isalready insolvent all right and let'sjuststop there and if anybody so there's nopossible waythat the debt can be repaid that'smathematicalespecially if technology is makingthings cheaper right that would make thedebt more expensive in real terms rightso it has as things like the iPhonecamera eradicates the need for Kodak andfilmthings get cheaper as technology drivesthings cheaper that would technicallymake the debt more expensive and harderto pay back right right so it gets it itexplodes in real terms yeah so thatentire system that we live in and wemeasure entire not just social economicwe measure our lives in we our familiesor everything because we try to gainenough money to be able to live for ouruh with our families and we measureother people by it and everythingbecause the entire thingis unrepayableand andwe don't want to face that factright hard truth it's the the hard truthso we allow inside that system others tomanipulate money at an ever increasingrateto be able to pretend we live in a safesystem right and so and and and that hasto be it has to get exponentially worseyeah um just because we won't face thatthat fact and no government can facethat fact and actually no person canface that fact from that system itcannot be solved from the system noperson you could change faces on theother system but the system isunrepairable from the system rightand so and just think think through someof the implicationsum implications areyou will vote for somebody who tells youthat they can give you more money fornothingright right you will not if somebodytold you the truth that said your realwages are going to go real wages aregoing to go up but your Fiat wages aregoing to come down next year becauseyou're going to get a real gainbut your it means your wages are goingto come down because prices are going tofall faster and you're uh your uh yourwages and uh fallum you wouldn't vote for that personyou'd think they were crazy rightbecause we're so used to empowering Asystem that sayswe're gonna we'll give you more racewe'll give you more money to you we'llgive more money to you we'll give moreand that money comes with a massive costyeah that is actually making the entireworld more unstable yeah as as you asyou drive that and it's consolidatingit's it's transferring all of theproductivity gains that should beflowing to society into the hands ofvery few and so it ends in a verydystopian world right if he lived in aworld where where where because there itends in a dystopian world because youcan't have individual rights andfreedoms under a system that looks likethat right because the system has totake them to be able to perpetrate thatin an average right facing rate right soyou don't live so we believe we live ina democracy we believe we have rule oflaw but money is superordinate to it tothe rule of law so if money is brokenthe laws get changed to to the favor ofwho accesses the money yesand and so so that is the system we livein and and then what you were saying isbecause of our insecurity in that systemand the greater and greater insecurityin that systemwe we give it more power we yell at thatsystem we divide from each other we sayit must be that person's fault we wantto ascribe not a system problem we wantto describe a person problem right intothat system and we go in these smalllittle groups right that are all yellingand making the system stronger we marchon Wall Street we say 2008 everyoneMarches On Wall Street all the exactsame people at the top of the uhsocioeconomic bladder are still in powertoday right and we forget all right andit goes on and it gets worse and worsewe do we have proxy wars and we samepeople creating them and it getsstronger and stronger and stronger andwe we we constantly lean in and even forthose that understand Bitcoinand and have moved out of that systemthey spend too much time at their uhyelling at that system and andempowering that system only makes itstronger right because most people don'tknow that we're in a system change froma from a system that based that isalready insolventthey only exists because of our of ourour willingness to allow others tomanipulate moneythey'll and they get so mad at that withno fix they yell at itand so so in fact this ties into the egodeath and starting the The Venture uhcompany I realizedI control my time and I control all ofthem I can I can either spend my timetalking about what's bad in the worldand and or I can spend all of my timeum living in the world and and buildingto the people building the future of theworld that I want to see yeah and mytime matters yeah and as does everysingle other person listening to thispodcast your time matters too right andso so you just ask yourself if you'remeasuring your Fiat worldtrying to make more money in that worldyeah and 99 of your time is there andthen you've just taken a little bit ofBitcoin and said hopefully it goes upyeahwhat you're actually doing isreinforcing the world that you do notwant to seeyou're spending your time actually 99 ofyour time right is reinforcing the worldthat's actually going to have staggeringbad implications through your attentionand your energy and your worry energyand it'll make you mad it'll make youinside that world it's going to it'sgoing to drive you to the same thingthat is chaotic inside that world rightit's going to drive you apart from otherpeople and and inside this new worldthat's emergingthat's based on truthit's you'll if you spent more time ifyou actually move your time over to thisnew system and learn what's happeningand and see the opportunities and you'llspend your time with people who arebuilding on Truth hope and about rightright and and your world will change asa matter of of that in fact I thinkthat's actually also what createsum the dichotomy the the people sayBitcoin is almost like a religion uh-huhright because it's so profound once youstart to see to the people in this youwant to spend more time with reallygreat people who are building building areally great future yeah that mattersfor all of usand and that can feel to somebody whodoesn't know itcan look religious Oriental lookreligious or it can look like what arethese people and and and if you're ifyou're inside that world it's also easyto not have empathy sure for the peoplewho've not seen it yet yeah it's easierto say thank you it's easier to believethat you always knew it right when fiveyears ago six years or three years agoyou had no idea yeah right you wereexactly living in another world in inthe other reality and you had no idea100 asit is and so many things coming up fromhereum someone said this to me earlier onthis trip like the truth will set youfree but first it has to piss you offandum I feel like that's kind of been theexperience of getting into Bitcoin likewhich it's been a little strange becauseI read the creature from Jekyll Islandbefore Bitcoin so I got really pissedoff at that point I like saw essentialbanking through the lens of the authorbut it's a great book on Central BankingI was very pissed off but I didn't therewas no answer there was nothing to doabout it at that timeand thenfast forward like getting into Bitcoinsome like it it is inspiring changes inpeople's lives right like you can almosttell if someone's really into Bitcoin ornot just by kind of how they carrythemselves and so in that way I guess itis religious in a way like we do I couldsee how an outside Observer wouldperceive us as being part of a cultbecause we talk about this thing like itsolves all the problems you just don'tunderstand it yet you haven't seen thelight we all kind ofwe we Jive well I mean so when you sayit like that then it sounds like a couchright or when you say have fun sayingpoor turn tune out yeah then then itdoesand because people miss the depth of itactually does solve those problems rightthey don't know how they can't connectto how it solves the problem yes and soso so the how it does takes a long timeto understand right all of the wiringessentially if you just saidumthe emergent complex nature of behaviorand Society all of societywas based on theftor inflation which is theft and you youagreed we had a societal bond that saidit's okayright to have theft the base layer ofall money not only is it okay it'srequired required yeah and everybody itwas everybody in the world said okaythat's requiredthen the merchant nature to the complexnature of society would just be a merereflection right of that theft yeah andthen you have to ask yourself who wouldwinand who would lose as a result of thatand if you were better at itas hard as that is to say right nobecause we live in most people's time is99 or 100 inside this world it's hardyou can see the mirror reflection ofsociety yes just to just mirroring thatback and everybody yellingat different different images of thatreflection not get back at themum and then and conversely on bitcoinwhat would the mirror image of societylook like all it is it doesn't workit's an open decentralized Ledger thatnobody can stop right based on proof andwork so it's just truth it makes stuffedunprofitable and and so so and so whenyou remove that manipulation or theftfrom a systemyou have to consequently ask what wouldthe emergent complex behavior of societylook like based on truth yeah and andand and that's that's a profoundimplication because it changeseverything yeah literally changeseverything because it changes theincentives and it changes and and itallows the productivity gains fromsociety that we are all that we are allpart of yeah to flow to everybody and soto be concentrated and few rightum it it profoundly changes everythingso if we let me ask you this did we getourselves into this mess becauseit seems likeI think was the author Gary North whereI originally heard this but humans liketo try and get something for nothingnow this can be good or bad right bemoral or immoralgood would be the entrepreneurial pathright I've got a problemI want to solve it in a more efficientway and then once I figure that out thattool or that service I can sell that toother people and let them solve it in amore efficient way so it's kind of likebeing cleverly lazy almost likeobviously you're working to solve theproblem but you're doing it to scratchyour own Edge so to speak so you'regetting something for nothing rightyou're getting productivity gainsyou know you can dig a lot more holesper hour with a shovel than you can yourhands something like that the other paththough is getting something for nothingjust by takingso is it is it this Universal proclivityfor humans to seek something for nothingthat got us into this weird mess wherewe're likewe thought we could print money to solveeconomic crises like oh there's aproblem let's just print money itdoesn't require a lot of work and thenover time that becomes institutionalizedand now I think you see it in cultureright like peoplelike money and wealth is demonizedbecause they have a zero-sum mentalityabout it like for me to get money I haveto take money from someone but that'snot how economics works right yeah ifyou collaborate and you coordinate youractions you actually produce more wealthper person yeah it's positive some notzero some so I'm just is that kind ofthe the Cardinal economic sin that gotus into this myth I I don't think so Ithink uh what what I think it is is ourability to delude ourselves in the nameof helping others hmm I think it's ait's it's so one so if you said peopleon top of this system todaycould easily tell themselves a liesaying if we don't do this people aregoing to starve we how long to do it weso so I'm righteousto be able to do this and I'm the onethat should be able to help I think it'sour Collective ability to deludeourselves so you think even all the wayto the top it's like a pen it's like thePinnacle of self-deception then becausethese are people Pinnacle of selflessself-deception hurt even most peoplethinking of you even if you knew theroot cause of the problemand there's no way to solve it from yourexisting Paradigm yeah and all of yourwealth and power and influence comesfrom that paradigmthen then you would more easily deludeyourself to say I have to be the one whosolves this wowum it so it and it just reinforces andit reinforces because because peoplewant to matter to other peopleumultimately so I think it's just I thinkit's that but if you just if if you kindof play this forward throughout time andwhy Bitcoin is change uh changes thisyou probably talked about this manytimes probably with me too but uhbutif you actually had something thatbecause money is superordinate to lawsin fact and and but but we put in lawsin place Magna Carta Constitution Billof Rights different things laws in placeto essentially protect us ourindividuals from the state right yeahand by doing that the states that didthat had more productivity right andthat because now people could act rightproperty rights they could act and theycould create more wealth that would flowto society yeah and so and and typicallyauthoritarian governments that collectedit all and didn't allow that rightsuffered yes right so when you had ruleof lawum and and and rights to individuals youhad faster growth economiesand but over time because money issuperordinate to that processpeople with money change loss right andyou lose over time the same thing thatprotected those people because the onlyway that you can fight the law is haveenough money to right right everythingelse so those laws get whittled awayover time right and the laws don'tprotectthe people at the bottom right the lawsprotect the people at the top of courseyeah and so so what that says and if itdidn't look like thatthen then the areas with most brokenmoneywould have the strongest laws protectingpeople right right right but you can seethe Opposites in the world you can seethat so now you say in the U.S or whereare we on that axis of broken money andwe know it has to be more and morebroken over time and that means we knowlaws have to be eroded and we have toremove individual rates and freedomsover time it has to get worse out ofthat system what would that look likenow if you go back in timeum all through all of these cycles thathave changed changed we had to do thatand then what what it turned out is ifyou could control money whatever if youcould control the gold if you could tryto control my money if you couldcentralize money through gold oranything else if you could control moneythen you had a win at society's lossright and it was such a powerthat you went to war to control moneyright right you went to you changed myin in the new and and then when youreset it you re we promise we won'tabuse money again right right right andit just repeats over time yes yes yeahand so and and then you add to thatwinners rate the history booksso if what we're saying is true then allof the books you and I read and all ofthe history throughout time on all ofthese different standards around moneymust be fundamentally carry errors rightright because they were they weredesigned with that error code in themand winners write the history booksright right so we must be lookingthrough that error of what happened herewhat happened here what we didn't seebecause winners write the history booksyeah what we didn't see in that wholewhole thing and Bitcoin were movingthrough decentralization and and Trustso we don't need the institution yeahand putting it in our hands the firsttime in history that that actually canum can change the futurebrilliant it's it's a it's a unalterablehistory that can't be Rewritten by thepolitical winners proof of work and thelongest chain yeah um you have you havea forward from 2009 unalterable nothat's uh that gets stronger andstronger and more decentralized moresecure over time right and it the railsof future civilization will rely on onsomething that's based on truth wow nowI'd like to tell you about our sponsoricoin technology icoin has just releaseda Sleek new hardware wallet looks like amini iPhone a little touch screen andcamera on it uh the device has no Wi-fino Cellular Connection no GPS it's astrictly physically cold Hardware walletuh like I said it's got a high-res threeinch touchscreen it's got a camera forair gapping the wallet uh it's gotoptional Bluetooth compatibility andit's a really a brand new UI uxexperience for Hardware wallet making itvery accessible easy to use notintimidatingand as we always talk about on this showthe only way you can truly own yourBitcoin is by having it in self-custodyso you need a device like icon wallet totruly own your Bitcoingo toicointechnology.com today and use promocodebitcoin23 for 30 off of this new SleekHardware walletnow I'd like to tell you about oursponsor Ludden letting lets you do morewith your digital assetsfor instance Lenin offers a b2x loanproduct that lets you leverage yourexisting Bitcoin to buy even moreBitcoinor you can also get traditional Bitcoincollateralized US dollar loans throughLondon as wellleadin also offers both Bitcoin and usdcdenominated savings accounts letting yougenerate yield on your digital assetsrecently Ludden has launched a Bitcoinmortgage product as well that lets youuse Bitcoin to buy a home or Finance onethat you already ownso go to letin.io that's l e d n dot IOtoday to sign upit's amazing you know I I hear whatyou're saying the there are other peoplethat have shared their perspectives thatI think we're just saying is that wehave a tendency to delude ourselves thatour actions are for the greater goodwhatever it is and this could be at anylevel right yeah even at the level ofCentral Bank shareholder or Governorthey think they need to print money tohelp the world and maybe they actuallybelieve that in their heart of heartsdo you think there's any room though forI mean other people have strong viewsthe other way thinking that no there'slike there's a cohort of people in theworldthat intergenerationally want to controlother people like that's more of theglobalist elitist View and I know and Ihave to really thank you actually forwhen you in our series we talked aboutthe US versus them and this is not auseful dichotomy because ultimately weare just one species sharing one planetlike everything affects everything elseyou can't say Good Guys bad guys we'reall connected sois there any room in that in your viewthere for that intergenerationalsociopathy or whatever that is so ofcourse and and and and and andI haven't said this on a lot of podcastsbecause somehowum somepeople may think in my view of the worldthat I'mI'm pretending that that doesn't existit couldn't be further from the truthit's a strategy to make that irrelevantumbecause because they have no power overme zero if I don't believe and I don'tand if I give them power over me bysaying it's them right then that muchpower if the if you're talking aboutthose people and there are terriblepeople in this world that manipulateothers and terrible people sociopathsand there always has been it's a tinyfraction of the world but yes maybethere are maybe many of them are in thatbut it but if I if those people controlthe media waves let's just say theycontrol the information they control itthrough wef they control and all of thethe and and most of the people evengoing to the conferences were delusionalthemselves and they were helping throughthat Division and I talked about them asa conspiracy theory most people in theworld would tune me out or re-alienatedright right right yeah so I would givethem more power right and so so this isa conscious strategy for allocating yourattention your conscious strategy forallocating my attention right okay andand and and and and and and becausethey can't do anything about thisprotocol if there's a theythere's nothing that they can do aboutthis protocol and the and and the thelater that they're on the better thebetter yeah which is awesome yeah rightrightokay so back to the the truth will setyou free but first it has to piss youoff my own Journeyum I found myself with a lot of vitrioltoward statism right like the most evilEnterprise in the world I don't try tosingle out any individuals kind of likeyou I try to think a little bit deeperlikeas I said in the talk earlier I thinkhumans are kind of liketheir characters are the emergentproperties of the incentive structuresthey're in so people are going to dowhatever is profitable to them whetherthat's violence or whether that's likecharity work right whatever maybe notcharity work but something productiveand soI think Bitcoin like the big change isthat we're changing out the incentivelandscape and that's what gets moregoodness more productivity in the worldmore peacebut now like hearing you say this I'mlike oh well I think maybe I've aired inmy ways that I've pointednegative attention at the same yellingat the state or statismis that an absolute is that somethingyou think people should just like noteven call out because it's I I mean Iguess I see some benefit in it that somepeople don't understand the problem inthe world so you're like helping themclarifyyeah this is the problem and here's whattricks is it so I guess what I would sayis I hold no domain over some whatsomebody else should or shouldn't doyeah they should do whatever they shouldthink is right I hold domain over what II do right okay in my mere reflection ofMy reality is really great rightfriends family love connection businessit's just really great like I I'vealmost feel bad saying how great becauseit just is such a and so I choose what Iwant to do and then I measure back onwhat I'm doing is it producing thereturn in my life that I want periodsomebody else wants to choose adifferent return and it's giving themexactly what they want yeah they shoulddo it rightyeah but but what ends up happening whatends up happening if I tie furtherwith that delusional aspect and peopleactually don't typically see what'sblocking them from success right andthey're feeding back into a machine andthey think that they're they're uh theythey think they're having success andthey're they're moving further andfurther away from the very success thatthey want right and I feel like I don'tknow maybe this metamorphosis is stilltaking place in myself and I feltbasically angry after rating thecreature from Jekyll Island and thenthis work in Bitcoin has been kind of aan outlet for that anger it's likehelp people see the problems so we canresolve it but there does come a pointwhere maybe it crosses a threshold ofutility that it's no it's not as usefulas it once was if it ever was and angeris a prerequisite if you're at a lowerlevel of uh Consciousness if you're atapathy right then you just don't careright if you're at at resolution to theyeahum then then and anger is a level ofConsciousness that actually can inspireyou don't just stay there right caninspire you to move to a higher level ofConsciousness yesright right but if and and if you'rebelow that level if you're if you're anopposite your your apathy you won'tdo what you did read learn what is thiscircle wait I could create a podcast toteach others that can create a wholebunch of well and move to a higher levelyes along and on the way of you movingto a higher level of understandingAs you move past anger move past angerright okay I move into love moving tomove into acceptance moving to a wholebunch of other things that now you startto see the world and that view of YourWorld which was this exact same worldright that's just a different view rightfrom your level to someone else's levelyeah is actually your growth right andandin that number of people you could touchas a result of that growth no it's veryencouraging to hear that actuallyum I I've seen like recently Alex futskywho we both know he's kind of goingthrough something too he's likehey look I just I've seen how angry I'vebeen over the past few years and now I'mtrying to grow out of it or grow Beyondit andand I do want to work towards love likethis quote I think I shared with youearlier but it hit me like a ton ofbricks I'm gonna paraphrase this I don'teven know who said it someone can factcheck me butthis quote that few realize theiropinion of the world is also aconfession of their character yeahso when I'm out here liketalking about the evil the malevolenceof statism like I have good intentions Ithink in my heart be like hey guyshere's the truth of what's going on likelet's do something about itbut maybe there's some confession ofcharacter that's coming out of that toolike things I haven't dealt withumunresolved personal blemishes I think isprestonfish put at one time yeah andbut going into Bitcoin this has all beenlike part of that Bitcoin Journey it'slike you see yourself differently overtime and you're likehopefully spiraling upward that's theego death yeah right that is that thatis what's ha that it was when it'sbecause it forces you to come to theseconclusions by the way seeing it inmyself I've said this on numerouspodcasts probably yours too so sorry foranybody who has to hear this again butit is it's so it's been so profound inme that that I am hoping other peoplesee it but when I see people in theworld everyone I see I literally seethem walking around with a sign on theirforehead the sign on the foreheadeveryone else can read what's stoppingthem from success all right and becausebecause we can easily see what's what'sstopping side like in a two-minuteconversation we can see what's stoppingsomebody else from success they don'tsee the world like you see the world andthey're reinforcing that world view Imean they but they believe it and it'strue true for them and we can and I canpick upI I just become really attuned atpicking that up everywhere because I'vebeen attuned picking it up in myselfright and because and I had to askmyself and I use thisum before but it just and it's not justone archetype but just let's say thevictim okay the victim walks aroundwanting love attention or belongingright and what do they do theytry to get belonging by being a victimand the first time it works andeverybody says you matterand that that drug that dopamine rush toan eye matter the attention thatattention that I make a differencethey use the tool to try to create itand and that then more and more peoplemove awayand then they're left isolated they'repushing the very thing that was allaround themeverywhere love was all around them allthe time and they're pushing it away andthen they typically double down becausethey really believe in in their in theirversion it's true because everybody'smoving away and I don't have thatbelonging anymoreand they double down and try to createmore drama to try to bring people backright and as they do that that cyclepushes people further and further awayright and they are living in amanifestation of their reality that theycreated a hundred percent wow and so ifyou can see that in other people I hadto but but they can't and they reallycan'tum and worse than most people all oftheir friends that were talking theytalk behind their back and they don'tever tell them right and they spend allof their time wasting their time talkingabout other people right and and I I gotto thinking wait if that's happeningeverywhere and I can see these signsdifferent signs on different people andand they're doing this and they'rethey're pushing away the very thing thatthey want then I must be too rightwhat's on my side that nobody will tellme huh right and what is and and whatwould be my way to be able toto constantly hold it in Focus so I canfix it instead of myself and and that iswhen I saw that I realized that some ofthe things I was doing were about samething right ego attention matter yeahand everything else and I realize if Ido those less if I don't care aboutthose things yeah and or try to workthose out yeah that abundance is justnatural it's going to flow to you it'syeah exactly that's a great pointbecause you never it's not like I meanego death might be too strong of a termbecause it's always with you right likelet's say the tooth tiger jumps throughthe window we're probably gonna runbecause we I think that's different Ithink I I I think that's different thatfighter okay so you just you disentanglethen like self-preservation for me yeahtotally okay yeah to me to me ego is theselfneeding to matter when you look at uswhen you look at a photo of you and yourfriends you'll focus on yourself firstah like a social human setting exactlydo I look do I matter and and so ourattention is on us inside our mind weall these people all around us all thetime right are all inside their own mindwe're inside our own mind and we thinkabout ourselves 99 of telling ourselvesthese stories telling us how do we showup how do we gain more attention rightdid what I say on this podcast matterdid did those people am I getting moreviews and it's so and and we we loseourselves in that yes that we thinkwe're doing it and as more people let'suse anger for an exampleif I created a little communitywhere I yelled at those very same peoplewe just talked about and a whole bunchof people wouldcome into that community and tell me Iwas right and it would feel right loveright it would feel like belonging yeahif I never had that Community before andit would feel and I would want to domore and more with it and from doingthat I I might not necessarily but Imight push the things away that I wantmost rightall right there many people hepotentially even in Bitcoin yeah couldpush away many of their other friendsby making Bitcoinbecause it's such a priority in theirlife they can't allow somebody else tosee it aloneso they're no I'm not saying that's goodor bad everybody has their own choicebut I'm stillvery good friends with a lot of friendsof mine that I've been friends with forsince I was five that still don'tunderstand Bitcoin yeah right it doesn'tmake them bad people right right I justhave a different view I want them tounderstand so sothe more you de-emphasize the focus onyour own egoic selfthe richer or or more viewpoints orperspectives you're getting on yourselffrom authentic relations with otherslike seeing yourself Through The Eyes ofothers and gives you a higher resolutiondepiction of yourself in the world andif you do a really simple hack is isthis and and uh you know I'll say thisvirtually everyone listening yourpodcast will find it almost impossibleto do and if you do itum will will increase your increase yourtime and energy uh by by a factby a factor of a hundrednever talk about anyone behind theirback unless you're saying great thingsall right neverbecause you choose everybody in youryour relationship right you chooseeveryone so if you're going to talk ifyou're going to spend time with them andyou can't say the thing to them right noone elsedon't spend time with them okay that'sgood because me and my buddies like totalk smack to each other so as long as Ican say it to their face that's okay butbut that's it and you can and you canand you say but but and and and this andthe same thing but all of that wastedenergy yes because if it's true that wecan't see you with the sign on ourforehead right then our friends shouldturn around our sign yes that's whatfriendship can be defined that's whatfriendship should be defined yeah andwhen you do when you do that and youhave rich rich uh friendships when youhave when your friends are your familyand family of your friends and viceversa it's these deeper connections thattake you to a higher level too oh that'sbrilliant it's beautiful it reminds meof Peterson talks about Outsourcing yoursanity to those around you yeah it'slike you have blind spots so you needpeople to check you yeah when you'reveering off the path I feel compelled toask you about this so we've beentouching on anger on and off andum one ofperhaps The Guiding Light in my lifethat has been most useful isum and happened through Bitcoin actuallyis trying to discipline myself in theways of Christand I don't even exactly know what thatmeans yet I'm just trying to emulate I'mreally just trying to read a lot aboutChrist in his life and I'm trying toemulate what how he acted in the worldand it's been good for me in a lot ofwaysthere's one time in the Bible whereChrist uses anger I don't know if Idon't know if anger is the right wordbut he's his coercion uses Forceand that's when he drove the moneychangers out of the Templeandone of the pastors that I saw describedrighteous anger as that which isdirected at resolutionso I'm just I know anger is somethingyou clearly don't wantbut as you said earlier it is one stepabove apathy so I guess it's goodrelatively in that senseis there any righteous anger that youthink is necessary for resolving fromKings in the world for me you know but Ido recognize uh but I do recognize itspower over others because if you can ifyou can if you can harness that in awhole bunch of peopleyou can overthrow a different group ofpeople right so you can you can use thatand and many a lot of people in theworld would be stuck in in that and youcould use thatas as influenceI feel like maybe it's been moreof an Energizer to writing orit's like you see something in the worldyou're frustrated with and I'm afrustratable person so maybe this islike this might be a character flaw tooI don't know but I get frustrated bysomething and I'm like I want to movetowards that and help try to resolve itsomehow so for me I'm this I guess thatis influence over people though becausewhen you're trying to write you'retrying to yeah yeah and again why areyou trying to what is the real reasonyou're trying to write which is not thereason you're saying you're trying towriteI mean I hope it's to get closer totruth but probably what it really is atthe bottom of that whether and that'snot a bad thing is I want to matterhuhI want to matter for all these otherpeople who say you changed my lifeI love him belong I'm loving belongingyou have the highest order that's whyyou do it all rightum that's why we do everything that'swhy you do everything yeah that that issuperordinate Tale the other thing andyou're you're doing it to serve that anda full bunch of people reinforce you fordoing it if if everyone saidyou suck at this you're terrible you'reover and over that that was what it wasa response and you were making adifference you wouldn't write andbecause people say you make a differenceand you make it and a profounddifference in people's lives you writemore and now the question to you isum do I do it just for that and is itmoving me away from other things I wantbecause you could easily delude yourselfand sayI'm gonna do it all the timeand I'm going to take all that time awayfrom my family right and I'm doing itfor my family right right right rightright right right no actually exactlywhen you're actually not doing it foryour family you're doing it for yourselfyou're doing it for that love andbelonging and then when when your wifewould get mad at you for doing thatshe would not be showing you love andbelong right because she would movefurther away I gotcha and so and so andthat's why I mean we get trapped inthese and we delude ourselvesthat I'm doing it for a bigger reasonbecause our self-deception and we'redoing it to feed our Eco where does Fearfit into this because if we doeverything for love and belonging I'mconfused because people can also act outof fear I think Fiat is often acting outof fear right you're eithereither you're imposing Fiat on someonedo this or else I'll hurt you becauseyou're scared if they don't do the thingthat you're not going to get the thingyou want and then people that complywith Fiat do it out of fear all rightlike yeah it is so there's a lot ofpeople that don't leave their job rightbecauseum you could say fear but what is itunderneath that that fearthey don't matter to the found theydidn't they didn't deliver a good lifeor vacation or X to Y to uh their familyif you actually realize that how muchyou could actually dowait the the what your life could looklikefrom for me I I if I just lived in atent with people I loved or around meand I was camping all the time I had myguitar and I actually don't need verymuch I'm not saying I I choose to dothat but I don't actually need very muchto have everything I already I alreadyhave it I already uh and and thatgratitude every dayfor all the things I have you you end upwith more more of the things that you uhit just continues on so in inside thatfearoften is the same thing right is it lovehim is it the same the same reason andwhy do you write rightit's inside that and it's holding andpeople call it fearversus it but inside that it's probablysomething deeper is there an opposite tolove then always thought of fear is kindof an opposite to lovehateum but uh but uh but but I I reallybelieve and and be able to push back onthis or that when I see all of the kindof incentives around the world and thehighest level of incentive you knowbefore we were on this podcast we weretalking about two ways up the mountainright that spiritual journey up top themout or if you said quantum physics upthe mountain and everything else and andand at the top of the mountain it'stotally unified right I think actuallyat the base of all religions is is thatunification too it's such a high levelunderstanding ofof that but it could easily be ascribedto a person right right when becausewhen people show up like that in in yourlife they make you feel so good it'sjust this energy it's this connectiveconnection of energy and it's not aboutthem right it's a and and so if you havethat connection of energy with andsomebody made you you kind of made themfeel really good it would be easy toascribe that connection of energy yes tothem right instead of or or theirteaching of your interpretation of theirteaching rather than what it actuallywas it was in all of us right right yeahwell this reminds me of umI can't remember say this butSociety starts to fall apart when webegin confusing the principle ofsovereignty with the current Sovereignright right it's like the king orwhoever was whoever the leader is ismeant to embody that principle yep butwhen you start mistaking that embodimentfor like that's the guy that needs torun everything forever Bingo that'sthat's totalitarian so that's a reallygreat way to yeahwow now I'd like to tell you about

loveokay love we gotta go to love thenbecause that's what we that's the reasonwe're acting right it's the motivator ofall action love and belongingsowe say the word love in English and it'sjust lumped all together but I learnedthis through John viveki actually hasbeen on the showthe ancient Greeks had many words forloveuh I know three of them I think theyhave several more but one was Eros wherewe get words like erotic it'sconsumptive loveit's not just sexual in nature it couldalso be consumptive like I love thepotato chips or whatever the thing isum so you you want to consume the thingthat you have Eros foranother form of love is phylia which isreciprocal engagement so friendship andromantic partnership rightI want to get to know you more deeplysuch that you can know me more deeplyand then I can know you more and likeit's this ongoing reciprocal openingtype of love you don't want to eat yourfriends typically you want to get toknow them more deeply and you know bondwith themand then the third one which is umcaptured in largely in the Christianethos which is agape right and that isthe the total Selfless Love that aparent has for their child like when youyou first bring home the child from thehospital the infant there's not evenphylia there's not even reciprocityright they're basically an inertlumpsleeping and crying yeah crying andum yet the love you feel towards thatperson is overwhelmingum probably the strongest feeling Ithink humans can havewhen you say action is motivated by loveand belonging I I just want to likedecompose the word love a little bitlike what does it mean to you how do yousay that yeah what what which whichversion of Love Are you invo for me Ifeel like it's more of a spiritualconnection to toit to everything and and so it takessome of those things uh but it but itand maybe it's it's hard to describewhat that looks like because dependingon what your view of right let's saylet's say you were a victim okaywhat I'm saying hereyou wouldn't be able to to to see it onthe set you would it wouldn't mean thesame to you if you were angry right youwould probably reinforce what youthought you meant what I meant from yourpicture versus my picture it's hard toeven describe kind of that that picturebut what I'd just say is that energyconnection with people that when I'mwhen when I I literally I want the bestfor them how it shows up in in in inour our Venture fund and and I and Idon't want to make this about theVenture fund but how it shows up with aninventure fund isI would never invest in a companywell I didn't love the founder hmm Imight be wrong I might make a mistake Imight make a mistake on the business Imight make anything else but even if thebusiness had really great opportunityand I didn't have that connection that Icould have that relationship I wouldn'tinvest I would invest because I need tofeel like I could say anything and theycould say anything to me to get to aconnection where I actually could I canactually help instead of because theonly reason I would do it is to try toadvance it not for money right rightright for for because because when youwhen you try to advance it for your gainof moneyyou typically create attentionbetween the between an entrepreneur andand yourself that you're doing it for adifferent reason if you're actuallyaligned they now the entrepreneur canactually hear the things the same thingsthat you might have made a mistake on inyour life20 years ago and you'd made the say theycan hear it because they because it'sfrom here right well and when it's fromthere you can just like you're eitherwhat you say with your friends so thatyou'll tell them the truth yeah whenit's from there you can make incrediblechange right and it magnifies and youcollect more and more people around youright that are all like that here's ahere's a different I saw this throughYPO event uh one time uh and I thoughtthis describes in a different way someof the stuff that I see the world andand firstso the uh a pyramid right of of how doyou get to trust or how do you get tothat level in a relationship andtypically what you have to do is showvulnerability most people they're uphere all of these relationships areabout an inch deep a mile wide yeah andthey don't have depth of relationshipswhat how are you doing killing itkilling it and it's not like you'rewanting to walk by everybody on thestreet and tell them your deepest painsure but but for the people in your lifethat you want to actually develop youyou need to show vulnerability and theyhave a choice every time you showvulnerability somebody has to go firstyeah right they have a choice to go up alevel yeah and say I'm out or down thelevel and meet you yeah and as you godown to that level you were these peopleat the bottom of the pyramid that thatyou'd say and that's typically for somepeople it might be one it might be fiverelationships that even if 20 yearscould go by and and those people areRock Solid you know who they are foreverand and what what I superimposed on thatis kind of how Society works and you'llgo through that relationship in a inschool where a war in your military unitdivorce or some other unit or businessthat's fighting it out and you saw thepeople who stuckand then they um and then they stuckforeverand you saw the people that wereexpelled from that yeah and you you justknowand I thought could you just do that allthe timecould you create a world where it lookedlike that all the time and invert thepyramid by just going first always goingfor always going first and thenlistening yeah to who me too and who toand so what I find in my life and what'sgiven tremendous value is the number ofpeople from for me you're one of themwho's here all rightthat that I really careabout uh about you and if I think aboutsome of the other bitcoiners in thiscommunity I really care uh because we'rehere no and and and that builds a ton ofvalue because it's just an immense groupof people that get them bigger andbigger and bigger that are just reallybrilliant peopleyou're gonna make me cry Joeum yeah man the the feelingI guess first of all it seems like soyou're prioritizing authentic humanengagement above any worldly materialgain in your business in your life Etcbut that somehow is really relatedclosely to truth too right because youcan care less about money right and Ihave it feels like I have an abundanceof it because I could care less about itright right yeah yeah but yeah thatwhich you can do without you ownso I think knut told me thatumbut but it's that authentic humanengagement is there's ayou're able to gain closer proximity totruth through those relationships rightbecause you have people that will callyou on your own and you'll doit for them and together you canaccomplish more than you could alonesomething like that so love and truthseem really closely yeah and maybethat's why andI could easily delude myself too yeah soI'm constantly on the awareness andthese people around me I ask them tohold me yeah that I don't let it go tomy head I'm not bigger than sayingBitcoin I'm one voice in this in thisand when people say we are all Satoshithat's how I think yes I do not think Iam any better or any worse anything elsethan anybody in this ecosystem one notein the network one note in the networkno just one known uh Network that bringsthis abundance truth to society yeah soI'm very happy to be a node I'm veryhappy to be able to be a node with allof those other people and I'd love thatthat that's the world that's beingcreated I love it too uh I guess in thesense of phylia like I want to keep itlike Bitcoin draws you into thisengagement with the community and thepeople likethe quality of bitcoiners on likemultiple Dimensions is what makes me soI'm already unbelievably bullish onbitcoin doing my own self-study which iskind of how this whole thing started butnow getting integrated into thecommunity you're like oh wait these areother people that have approached itthrough their own perspectivethey're brilliant in their own way alldifferent walks of life all convergingon the same conclusion all gettingstronger more no centralized more peopleyes sir better to all truthful gettingthat's why this is literally unstop it'sUnstoppable because it's us right it isthe best in USdescribed into a network that brings thebest to all of us yes that's itokayand I feel that tremendously at theseBitcoin Live Events like this like it'sjust it's the most enjoyable culturalexperience I've ever had in my lifebeing a bitcoiner and maybe it's justfor us nerds that we're a little bit I'mnaturally introverted I've I have goodfriends pre-bitcoin they're still goodfriends Etc but there's something aboutthis cultural experience it's justeffortless to me I really appreciatethatwhat is it about Bitcoin Twitter that'sso opposite it's like we I don't thinkit is we we go well let's see like ifyou're outside looking in if you'venever been to a Bitcoin event and youlook at Bitcoin Twitter you're like ohmy God these people like really go outeach other and everyone else hard butthen you come to a Bitcoin eventeveryone's like it's a Love Fest sowhat's going on so for me my BitcoinTwitter doesn't look like that and andpeople have always ask how do you stayabove that noise it's because when itcomes at me I don't feed it um rightjust like you said earlier because whatsomebody says about meis their interpretation about me rightthe only nothing can hurt meum so it's either it's really simpleit's either rightand and I need to fix me right or it'ssome crazy person that's trying to gainattention from me right that I'm if Ifeed if I'm feeding it it's my egosaying you've hurt me right all rightokay it's it's me saying no here's who Iam I'm better than everybody else and Ineed to reach back and I need to tellyou why I'm better and I and by doing soI'd explode it right because it was allabout me right I just let it just okayif the and it just all just goes awaythis is so Bruce Lee if you're just likeyou're like water like it just passesthrough you yeahumokay I have to ask you about this thisisI don't even know if I can articulatethis wall butI told you I read the book flow yeahwhich I think you said you've read aswellum we had a long time ago but yeah thisis a book aboutthe nature of the flow state which isoften reported as the optimal HumanExperienceum optimal in two senses like Optimalthat not only is it one of the mostenjoyable experiences people reporthaving in a way that's distinct frompleasure because people do weird thingsto get into flow that aren't necessarilypleasurable like rock climbing and stufflike thatalso optimal in the sense that it's oneof the best performances they've evergiven like when you're in flow like alot of elite athletes almost all Eliteathletes that are giving gold medalperformances like they'll talk abouttheir experience after the fact like itwas just flow or I was just effortlesslydoing the thingum in that bookthere's one section I think in the lastchapter that talks about the meaning ofmeaningand I've been really into likedecomposing words lately like we didwith love earlier just to try and lookthroughwhat we mean if you say these thingssureuh obviously the meaning of meaning is abit of a meta thing so it's a littleconfusing but um the book lays out threedefinitions one would be like thesignificance or importance of a thingwhen we invoke the sentence what is themeaning of life we kind of mean thatfirst sense of meaningthe second one is intention related souh how someone expresses theirintentions through action you know theymight say like he means well or I didn'tmean to do that you know like your yourattention what you're really saying inthe in that one specifically we'll go tothe others too but what you're saying isI trust someoneand I'm going to forgive them for thething because they must not mean thatthat's right that's what that's whatyou're saying and you wouldn't give thatsame level to somebody you didn't knowright and treat the action what they didas the intention yes yesso yeah we so we measure ourselves byour actions or Sorry by our intentionsyes and we measure everyone else bytheir actions but we all hear but butbut are but our intent but because wecan forgive ourselves we didn't meanthat right we did and so it's almost thedefinition of error human intention andaction or divorce exactly we're andwe're delusional in that uh sorry youkeep going and then we'll okay just thethird one is um a meaning of meaning islike orderly information right so thiscould be like the definition of a wordwhat does that word mean or if you get atracking number on your package you knowif one character is off and the trackingnumber it has no meaning informationTheory exactly so it's a very pragmaticinstance of the word meaningokay so my question is thiswhat does it say about the nature ofourselves or Bitcoin perhaps thatthis phenomenon phenomenon that we callBitcoin is basically just perfectlyordered informationright it's just you can't argue likeit'sI don't know how to describe it's likeit's an inarguable set of data perhapsin controvertible set of dataso clearly it has strong meaning for thefor the first time in history for thefirst time in history I've never hadanything like it right an unalterabledatabaseso it's very strong in that third senselike orderly information well Bitcoin isthe most orderly information we've everhad yeah yet it seems to be invokingthis other sense of the word meaninglike giving people meaning there's a lotof significance like as we're describingright Bitcoin is well we're talkingabout love for taking this is a monetaryInnovation so how dowhat does it say about the nature ofBitcoin or us that orderly informationis creating this like significance orimportance and things that aren't dataor money related yeah so let's just solet's if you use the Dalai Lama or youuse any religion orsay at that level of enlightenmentdid they need Bitcoinno so it was there they were there allthe time yeah Bitcoin didn't do itBitcoin what it does through what youjust said is brings that level ofEnlightenment to way more of societywell that's what that uh that's that'sultimately what it does because becauseyou have to pre so today the world wouldlook if you just went dead though todaythe world would workaverage about 10 hours a week to have asuperior lifestyle than they have todayif you had a monetary standard thatcouldn't be manipulatedand instead you have a monetary standardthat's being manipulated that somepeople are working harder and harder andharder maybe 80 hours a week between ofuh familyumand getting harder and harder and uhharder to live in that and some peoplearen't working at all and they're kindof rent seeking on top top of that ortelling other people what to do on topof that it's top of that systemand and if you've advanced technologyeventually we will be working one hour aweek half an hour a week now no hours aweek for it Superiorum superior quality of life quality oflife than we have and as we do that aswe make this transition for the peoplethat really understand Bitcoin thatalready exists it's actually existingand it's it's accelerating and how thatis it's not bitcoin price going up itswhole price is falling I guess Bitcoinyeah in other words their time beingmore important yes their time to be ableto explore these things you're exploringright because you've had the time yes itwill explore themat a deeper fundamental uh uh basisbased on truth right and that's whatthat's what's up it's it'll it'll it'llbring the consciousness of the world upwhile by giving us more Freedom bygiving us more freedom wow that isbeautiful that ties so perfectly backinto how the author of flow defines flowit's like doing a thing for its own sakeso that's that's how I I remember thatwhen you just were talking about flow Iremember reading it and I read it afterI used to do uh triathlons competitivelyand would get to that flow State whetherit was running or swimming or biking andI could remember that flow say now thatflow state is is a prettyit's it's quite often whether it'smeditation really or or it's but it butmany times during the day it just itfeels like I can just turn that you getinto flow really like all the time wowit just feels like that that actually iswhat it feels that's what it feels likemy life is like that's beautiful yeahand actually that's come that's comingto everybody yes that's coming toeverybody I love how you said that it'salways been available to us as as wasthe case with the Dalai Lama or theBuddha anyone that achievedEnlightenment but somehow we've createda networked tool that's actuallyinstilling that in people yeah and theexisting one takes it away from itbecause it wants you to reach in so whatwhat you would say with all of thosepeople is they stepped out of thatsystem and they didn't give it powerright right right this is a system thatbrings that ability to everyone on theplanetI think that is a beautiful place tocall it a awesome call it a showJeff Booth I love you man this is anawesome conversationum where can people find you on theinternetuh now on Noster probably is the hellconfess so to find my uh public keythere it's on Twitter uh and if
