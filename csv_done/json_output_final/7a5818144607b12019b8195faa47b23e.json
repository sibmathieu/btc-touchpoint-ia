  "text": "[Question] Do you run your own node? I wonder if you run your own nodes and,  if you do, do you have a particular preference for its configuration?  [Answer] That's a great question, Antonio. Yes I do. I've run a node since the very first moment I  got involved in bitcoin. My first interaction was with a full node and I've been running  a full node since. In fact, for a variety of reasons I actually run several full nodes. Some  of them are pruned, as they call them, which means that those don't have a full historical  copy of the blockchain because those nodes are used to do validation of current transactions,  for example in an e-commerce environment. But I also do keep fully archival nodes that have  every single transaction from the genesis block and a full transaction index, and on top of that,  a full UTXO database that I use an electrum public server to run, so that i can interact with my own  wallets, and also interact with programmatically. When I need to do some kind of analysis of the  blockchain, or look at a specific transaction, etc, i always use my own authoritative  full node that I've configured myself. The configuration really isn't very  different from the defaults. The defaults actually work really well for most people.  I either use a cookie authentication mechanism or a much much stronger password than you might  anticipate for the RPC interfaces so I can ensure that those systems are secure. I also use some  basic packet filtering and port filtering to ensure that my node is only accessible on its  RPC interface from the correct places. But other than that not much different. And, of course, all  of my nodes are available both on IP as well as on TOR, the onion routed network. And they they serve  gigabytes of data out to nodes that are bootstrapping or wallets that are trying to  gain access to the bitcoin blockchain. At the last estimate, because of the number of nodes I run and  because of the amount of bandwidth I serve, it costs anywhere from three to five hundred dollars  a month in bandwidth costs and such. I run nodes both on popular cloud systems, like amazon cloud,  as well as on dedicated privately owned computers on their own dedicated  systems and internet connections. Thanks for watching.
