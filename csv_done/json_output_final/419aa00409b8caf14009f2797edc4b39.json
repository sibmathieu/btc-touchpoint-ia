end betweenthe end of the Revolutionary Warand the ratification nine years later ofthe Bill of Rights there were epidemicsin almost every city in our countrysmallpox epidemics cholera epidemicsyellow fever epidemics that killed tensof thousands of people and yetthe framers did not putan epidemic exception in theConstitution they wrote the Constitutionnot for Yeezy times but for Hard Timesandand during the Civil War when we lost659000 troops killed in battle on bothsidesit's the equivalent of 7.2 million todaymuch a much worse lossand happened in covid and our countrywas being torn apart and came this closeto being ripped apartand when Abraham Lincoln did the rightthing and tried to suspend habeas corpusto prevent Confederateinfiltratorsfrom inciting riots in the northerncitieshe was told by the Supreme Court youcan't do it it's in the Constitution itdoesn't matter how bad the crisis is youcannot suspend the Constitutionand yet we saw this very very dangerouspresidentthat we now have we as American citizensare now facing in our country ithappened during covid where thegovernment established a new presidentwhich is that if it has a good enoughexcuse the government can now take

toprosecute a waror to fight climate changebut all of these reasons can easily turninto pretextcontrol over the public starts perhapsas a means but it always becomes an endis part of the unstayed and seductiveideology of totalitarianism that Utopiawill come through exercising perfectcontrol over Societyand that works well as long as the goodguys are in control or your guys are incontrolBitcoinis a bulwark against precisely this kindof government and corporate expansionand intrusionin fact it has been used[Applause]it has been used to bypass oppressivegovernment controls over the monetarysystems

whole point ofBitcoin is that it's decentralizedanyone can run a note and it's importantnot only for Bitcoin but for a democracyto be decentralizedthird I will defend use neutral industryneutral regulation of energyPresident Biden'sPresident Biden's 30 percent tax onenergy for Bitcoin miners requires aninvasive surveillance apparatus tomonitor what is happening in individualcomputersit's as a terrible presidentin which everything that you do thatrequires electricity must now bemonitored by the governmentthat's why I also support people'srights to refuse smart meters in

Administrationwill consult with knowledgeable peoplelike yourselvesto establish sensible jurisdiction andgovernance for starters we mustrecognize that Bitcoin is not a securityand should[Music]and should not be regulated as suchBitcoin is in a class by itselfit's why decentralization I'm told nowthat there are forty thousand nodesprevents a lot of the insider tradingmanipulation and pump and

means to crack down on cryptoif they had been unjustly made anexampleI will consider pardoning them and Iwill act very quickly to do sobefore I concludeI'd like to say something about theenvironmental criticism at Bitcoinit may be unpopular to say here but eventhough those criticisms are exaggeratedif they have some degree of validityit's exaggerated because Bitcoin minerschase the cheapest energy they have todo that for economic reasonsand Bitcoin mining tends to go with theenergyis the least expensive drawing a lot ofidle base load as well as excess Peakgeneration of Renewable Powerbut I think Bitcoin miners can still doa lot betterand I encourage you in this industry toexpand your use of pro-environmentalenergy techniques such as capturingweights methane and using waste heatwhich I know many of you areexperimenting withwe environmentalists weenvironmentalists will continue topressure you to improvehoweverwhether or not the criticism is validI want to make one thing plainthe environmental argument should not beused as a smoke screen for an agenda ofsuppressing Bitcoinand let me repeat thatenergy you should not be used as apre-tax Furnitureof suppressing Bitcoin totalitarianshate anything that they can't controland they will use any pre-tax necessaryto control itI am aware of an eerie Parable to thecovet years when Public Health became apre-tax to obliterate our basic rightsand freedoms the covid public healthemergency is gone nowand we must not now replace it with somenew set of rationales the further thedecades-long erosion of our freedomsfinally I'd like to clarify a couple ofthings I am not an investorand I'm not here to give investmentadviceor to promote Bitcoin over othercryptocurrencies or other currenciesthat's the job of the free market notthe president of the United Statesmy interest my interest is oneI am an Ardent Defender and a lifelongdefender of civil libertiesand Bitcoin is both an exercise and aguarantee of those freedomstwo Bitcoin is a major generator of thekind of innovation our country now needsthree Bitcoin embodies two of my highestideals transparency and TrustAmericans have come to distrust thegovernmentincluding the way that it hasmanipulated our money supply to benefitthe very richand to prosecute endless WarsBitcoin is a neutral currency beyond theability of government or indeed anyauthority to manipulatein our current system nearly all of ourtransactions are transparent all rightthey're transparent to government andcorporationsbut their machinations and activitiesare not transparent to us they areopaquethe public Ledger of Bitcoin makes everytransaction transparent to everyoneit might therefore be a harbinger of afuture in which the governmentis transparent to the people and thatwould be democracy NowI'mI'm proud to make an historicannouncementbut first if you can please pull outyour cell phonesour campaign will be the firstpresidential campaign in historyto accept Bitcoin donations through[Applause]through the lightning Networkand today we move one step closer to theFuture today we show the world the powerand the durability and the flexibilityof BitcoinI want to click Loop by saying thisalmost everyone in this roomis aware of the link between Bitcoin anddemocracy and freedomand that'swhy almost everybody I had met that I'dmeetwho is involved in Bitcoin is passionateabout it it's they're not passionatebecause it's an interesting currencythey're passionate because of the deeprepresentation of a deep need that wehaveor Liberty and democracy and the promisethat this innovation hasto guarantee those virtuesohand we we are now living in this age ofturn ketotalitarianism with thisemerging technology which can Empowertotalitarian regimesand our job is to try to build andfortify Democratic institutionsat the same rate as that totalitarianinstruments are being expanded in theirpower things like AI which really aregoing to threaten democracy at its basewe need to not be chipping away at ourDemocratic institutionswe need to be fortifying the ones thatexist and building new ones and thebiggest most important one on thehorizon is Bitcoin because it can't bemanipulated all of you I know are hereagain not because you love a currencybut because you love our country youlove democracy you love freedom and inthat sense your support of Bitcoin putsyou in the same category as the framersthe Constitution that gave us that billof right that created these Democraticinstitutionsand you are the current manifestation ofthat impulse so thank you all very muchfor everything you doand thank you for being part of thismovementstartwelcome back to bitcoin 2023 on theBitcoin magazine live stage brought toyou by Marathon we just heard one of themost amazing talks I've ever heard aboutBitcoin at an event in my entire lifeand I've been doing this for many yearsand before I go to our panelists who arereturning I just got to thank JustinTrudeau one more time he called me andmy friends a terroristuh a little over a year ago and itreally hurt me and when I heard that itmade it all worth it because that wasthe orange pill for what we just heardand had Justin Trudeau not been thegreatest Bitcoin evangelist the worldhas ever seen we wouldn't be here rightnow listening to this and I you know oneday if it does happen what we saw thereand he promises to bring in your rightto hold Bitcoin uh self-custody run anodeum Justin Trudeau is going to go down inhistory as probably the biggest idiotthat ever ran a country but the goodnews is he lives in Canada and he canapply for maid so he won't really haveto live with it for too much uh but Iwant to turn to our panelists uh becauseI'm a little bit speechless hereum Jesse please uh get us started yeahum I think that first of all it was anincredible speech where uh RFK didJunior did a great job of framing thisin terms of what Bitcoin means for theworld and for Humanity and fundamentallythis is free speech and free money andhe equated those these two things asbeing on the same level in terms oftheir importance for human freedomand then he enumerated all the ways inwhich recent history has shown us howgovernment is looking for an excuse totake away that freedom and impinge onthat and we saw that with covid uh andand he made itquite a wise uh historical parallel tohowum the founders the framers of theConstitution were aware of how pandemicsplay out and how you know that preventedCanada from being part of the U.S andthey still made an emphasis that no nouh situationalum context could impinge upon the theLiberties that were enumerated in theConstitutionso you know I think there was a wideperspective and wisdom in how RFK Jr isrecognizing that Bitcoin represents thethe next St next wave of what the thefounders of the United States weretrying to ensconce in our foundingdocuments the freedoms of individualsfor free speech and free money and thatBitcoin is the next wave of the AmericanEndeavor and uh Matt even seeing Techthat he's leveraging for the operationwas that a surprise to you or a verypleasant surprise seeing how thecampaign is going to manage thesedonationsuh I mean it's it's definitely prettycool to see a uh U.S presidentialcandidate except Bitcoin for donationsum Bitcoin is uniquely well suited fordonationsum it's one of a I think one of the keycore use cases that we'll see kind ofunfold throughout the world and I wouldsay like you know a U.S presidentialcandidate usually does not have any kindof trouble raising donations to thetraditional Financial system but whereBitcoin really shines is Raisingdonations in situations where you mightbe cut off from banking you might be cutoff from the paypals of the world rightthose traditional Financial rails thatdo get censored and Dylan what whatspoke to you in that talk yeah I mean itwas just really powerful speech to see apresidential candidate that you know onethat if you look at you know traditionalpolls or you know Legacy websitesdoesn't have them anywhere close to therunning but if you look at kind of theseuh more offshore betting sites the oneswhere you know the market speaks truehe's he's second in the race for theDemocratic primaries and you know thethe first in the race is is quiteliterally a vegetable so so it isexciting I mean freedom rings trueBitcoin is freedom money and so uh youknow I think he's he's really gunningfor it anybody that's Pro Freedomum is is on the Democratic side is is inrfk's Camp now what what we almost sawthere was a love letter to bitcoin uhwas that something you expected Matt didyou did you think he'd get right intopoints that uh only folks like you hitconsistently I mean he's not a myunderstanding is he's not a it hasn'tbeen a bitcoiner for very long so I'mnot sure who he's talking to what he'sreading uh what he's watching uh but I'dlike to know because uh he seemed to hitall the key points of what makes Bitcoinspecial what makes Bitcoin uniqueum why Freedom Tech is important and howhow policy makers should consider thesethings in terms of the best future forour country well um we're gonna have afew more of these political talks thatone was incredible up next we have thegreat ordinal debate on the Nakamotostage please stay tuned for Pete Rizzoand a few others going over what shouldbe a pretty contentious event sochanging speeds a little bit see on themain stage[Applause]hello bitcoinersumthere's a lot of people who are not inthis roomfor whom Bitcoin may seem an issuethat's too trivial for a

impersonalmultinationals and authoritariantechnologies have usurped the Realms ofhuman activity that were once private orheld by a communitythey monitor our every movement ourCommunications our every transaction andthe Technologies they use to monitor uscan also be used to control usled by the United States liberaldemocracies across the globe suddenlypivoted during the pandemicand use that crisis as an excuse totrample a central constitutional rightsand freedomsgovernments suspended the rights to freeassembling the freedom of worshipproperty rights trial by juryand they censored free speech in thename of combating misinformation anddisinformationwe lost our freedom to travel themandates caused us even sovereignty ofour own bodiessome might say well those were justtemporary restrictions and temporarysuspensions of our rights but theConstitution has no pandemic exceptionandand by the waythe framers the Constitution knew allabout pandemicsthere was a malaria epidemicthat decimated the armies of Virginiaduring the Revolutionary War and asmallpox epidemic that froze the armiesof New Englandat the very time when Benedict Arnoldhad led the capture of the city ofMontrealand because smallpox haddecimated the at that Forcewe were not able to hold Montrealotherwise candidates that hey would bepart of the United Statesand the framers knew that at the timenot only that but after the end betweenthe end of the Revolutionary Warand the ratification nine years later ofthe Bill of Rights there were epidemicsin almost every city in our countrysmallpox epidemics cholera epidemicsyellow fever epidemics that killed tensof thousands of people and yetthe framers did not putan epidemic exception in theConstitution they wrote the Constitutionnot for Yeezy times but for Hard Timesandand during the Civil War when we lost659000 troops killed in battle on bothsidesit's the equivalent of 7.2 million todaymuch a much worse lossand happened in covid and our countrywas being torn apart and came this closeto being ripped apartand when Abraham Lincoln did the rightthing and tried to suspend habeas corpusto prevent Confederateinfiltratorsfrom inciting riots in the northerncitieshe was told by the Supreme Court youcan't do it it's in the Constitution itdoesn't matter how bad the crisis is youcannot suspend the Constitutionand yet we saw this very very dangerouspresidentthat we now have we as American citizensare now facing in our country ithappened during covid where thegovernment established a new presidentwhich is that if it has a good enoughexcuse the government can now take awayall of our freedoms and guess whatthere is always a good excuse whetherit's to stop a new disease the nextpandemic to protect us frommisinformation to prevent domesticterrorism to stop hate speech toprosecute a waror to fight climate changebut all of these reasons can easily turninto pretextcontrol over the public starts perhapsas a means but it always becomes an endis part of the unstayed and seductiveideology of totalitarianism that Utopiawill come through exercising perfectcontrol over Societyand that works well as long as the goodguys are in control or your guys are incontrolBitcoinis a bulwark against precisely this kindof government and corporate expansionand intrusionin fact it has been used[Applause]it has been used to bypass oppressivegovernment controls over the monetarysystems as in Canada and Myanmaras president I will make sure that yourright to hold and use Bitcoin isinviolablefirstI will defend the right of self-custodyof Bitcoin and other digital assetsyou should be able to own your ownprivate Keys the same as you own thekeys to your car or on your wallet[Applause]your wallet whether it's in your pocketor in your or in your computer is yourown I don't think the government has theright to demand access to your Bitcoinkey or indeed any of your passwords tosay otherwise is secede essentialterritory to the surveillance statesecondI will I will uphold the right to run anode at home[Applause]kyc requirements should be applied atthe level of Banks and exchanges not atthe level of nodesotherwiseotherwise it would be become impossibleto run the software the whole point ofBitcoin is that it's decentralizedanyone can run a note and it's importantnot only for Bitcoin but for a democracyto be decentralizedthird I will defend use neutral industryneutral regulation of energyPresident Biden'sPresident Biden's 30 percent tax onenergy for Bitcoin miners requires aninvasive surveillance apparatus tomonitor what is happening in individualcomputersit's as a terrible presidentin which everything that you do thatrequires electricity must now bemonitored by the governmentthat's why I also support people'srights to refuse smart meters in theirhomesfourthfourth I will make sure that the UnitedStates Remains the global of of Bitcoinand other cryptocurrenciesmajor established companies like PayPalFidelity and block are investing heavilyin Bitcoin related software developmentsome of the best engineers and coders inthe tech industry work in this field andwe want to keep them here in AmericaI will reverse the government's growinghostility toward this industry and keepInnovation at homethat leads to my fifth pointevents like the FDX Calamity prove thatsome kind of regulation of the cryptoindustry is needed my Administrationwill consult with knowledgeable peoplelike yourselvesto establish sensible jurisdiction andgovernance for starters we mustrecognize that Bitcoin is not a securityand should[Music]and should not be regulated as suchBitcoin is in a class by itselfit's why decentralization I'm told nowthat there are forty thousand nodesprevents a lot of the insider tradingmanipulation and pump and dump schemesthat plague other cryptocurrenciessixI will carefully considerwhether individuals like Ross Albrechtwere prosecutedI will consider whether they wereprosecuted for actual crimesor as a means to crack down on cryptoif they had been unjustly made anexampleI will consider pardoning them and Iwill act very quickly to do sobefore I concludeI'd like to say something about theenvironmental criticism at Bitcoinit may be unpopular to say here but eventhough those criticisms are exaggeratedif they have some degree of validityit's exaggerated because Bitcoin minerschase the cheapest energy they have todo that for economic reasonsand Bitcoin mining tends to go with theenergyis the least expensive drawing a lot ofidle base load as well as excess Peakgeneration of Renewable Powerbut I think Bitcoin miners can still doa lot betterand I encourage you in this industry toexpand your use of pro-environmentalenergy techniques such as capturingweights methane and using waste heatwhich I know many of you areexperimenting withwe environmentalists weenvironmentalists will continue topressure you to improvehoweverwhether or not the criticism is validI want to make one thing plainthe environmental argument should not beused as a smoke screen for an agenda ofsuppressing Bitcoinand let me repeat thatenergy you should not be used as apre-tax Furnitureof suppressing Bitcoin totalitarianshate anything that they can't controland they will use any pre-tax necessaryto control itI am aware of an eerie Parable to thecovet years when Public Health became apre-tax to obliterate our basic rightsand freedoms the covid public healthemergency is gone nowand we must not now replace it with somenew set of rationales the further thedecades-long erosion of our freedomsfinally I'd like to clarify a couple ofthings I am not an investorand I'm not here to give investmentadviceor to promote Bitcoin over othercryptocurrencies or other currenciesthat's the job of the free market notthe president of the United Statesmy interest my interest is oneI am an Ardent Defender and a lifelongdefender of civil libertiesand Bitcoin is both an exercise and aguarantee of those freedomstwo Bitcoin is a major generator of thekind of innovation our country now needsthree Bitcoin embodies two of my highestideals transparency and TrustAmericans have come to distrust thegovernmentincluding the way that it hasmanipulated our money supply to benefitthe very richand to prosecute endless WarsBitcoin is a neutral currency beyond theability of government or indeed anyauthority to manipulatein our current system nearly all of ourtransactions are transparent all rightthey're transparent to government andcorporationsbut their machinations and activitiesare not transparent to us they areopaquethe public Ledger of Bitcoin makes everytransaction transparent to everyoneit might therefore be a harbinger of afuture in which the governmentis transparent to the people and thatwould be democracy NowI'mI'm proud to make an historicannouncementbut first if you can please pull outyour cell phonesour campaign will be the firstpresidential campaign in historyto accept Bitcoin donations through[Applause]through the lightning Networkand today we move one step closer to theFuture today we show the world the powerand the durability and the flexibilityof BitcoinI want to click Loop by saying thisalmost everyone in this roomis aware of the link between Bitcoin anddemocracy and freedomand that'swhy almost everybody I had met that I'dmeetwho is involved in Bitcoin is passionateabout it it's they're not passionatebecause it's an interesting currencythey're passionate because of the deeprepresentation of a deep need that wehaveor Liberty and democracy and the promisethat this innovation hasto guarantee those virtuesohand we we are now living in this age ofturn ketotalitarianism with thisemerging technology which can Empowertotalitarian regimesand our job is to try to build andfortify Democratic institutionsat the same rate as that totalitarianinstruments are being expanded in theirpower things like AI which really aregoing to threaten democracy at its basewe need to not be chipping away at ourDemocratic institutionswe need to be fortifying the ones thatexist and building new ones and thebiggest most important one on thehorizon is Bitcoin because it can't bemanipulated all of you I know are hereagain not because you love a currencybut because you love our country youlove democracy you love freedom and inthat sense your support of Bitcoin putsyou in the same category as the framersthe Constitution that gave us that billof right that created these Democraticinstitutionsand you are the current manifestation ofthat impulse so thank you all very muchfor everything you doand thank you for being part of thismovementstartwelcome back to bitcoin 2023 on theBitcoin magazine live stage brought toyou by Marathon we just heard one of themost amazing talks I've ever heard aboutBitcoin at an event in my entire lifeand I've been doing this for many yearsand before I go to our panelists who arereturning I just got to thank JustinTrudeau one more time he called me andmy friends a terroristuh a little over a year ago and itreally hurt me and when I heard that itmade it all worth it because that wasthe orange pill for what we just heardand had Justin Trudeau not been thegreatest Bitcoin evangelist the worldhas ever seen we wouldn't be here rightnow listening to this and I you know oneday if it does happen what we saw thereand he promises to bring in your rightto hold Bitcoin uh self-custody run anodeum Justin Trudeau is going to go down inhistory as probably the biggest idiotthat ever ran a country but the goodnews is he lives in Canada and he canapply for maid so he won't really haveto live with it for too much uh but Iwant to turn to our panelists uh becauseI'm a little bit speechless hereum Jesse please uh get us started yeahum I think that first of all it was anincredible speech where uh RFK didJunior did a great job of framing thisin terms of what Bitcoin means for theworld and for Humanity and fundamentallythis is free speech and free money andhe equated those these two things asbeing on the same level in terms oftheir importance for human freedomand then he enumerated all the ways inwhich recent history has shown us howgovernment is looking for an excuse totake away that freedom and impinge onthat and we saw that with covid uh andand he made itquite a wise uh historical parallel tohowum the founders the framers of theConstitution were aware of how pandemicsplay out and how you know that preventedCanada from being part of the U.S andthey still made an emphasis that no nouh situationalum context could impinge upon the theLiberties that were enumerated in theConstitutionso you know I think there was a wideperspective and wisdom in how RFK Jr isrecognizing that Bitcoin represents thethe next St next wave of what the thefounders of the United States weretrying to ensconce in our foundingdocuments the freedoms of individualsfor free speech and free money and thatBitcoin is the next wave of the AmericanEndeavor and uh Matt even seeing Techthat he's leveraging for the operationwas that a surprise to you or a verypleasant surprise seeing how thecampaign is going to manage thesedonationsuh I mean it's it's definitely prettycool to see a uh U.S presidentialcandidate except Bitcoin for donationsum Bitcoin is uniquely well suited fordonationsum it's one of a I think one of the keycore use cases that we'll see kind ofunfold throughout the world and I wouldsay like you know a U.S presidentialcandidate usually does not have any kindof trouble raising donations to thetraditional Financial system but whereBitcoin really shines is Raisingdonations in situations where you mightbe cut off from banking you might be cutoff from the paypals of the world rightthose traditional Financial rails thatdo get censored and Dylan what whatspoke to you in that talk yeah I mean itwas just really powerful speech to see apresidential candidate that you know onethat if you look at you know traditionalpolls or you know Legacy websitesdoesn't have them anywhere close to therunning but if you look at kind of theseuh more offshore betting sites the oneswhere you know the market speaks truehe's he's second in the race for theDemocratic primaries and you know thethe first in the race is is quiteliterally a vegetable so so it isexciting I mean freedom rings trueBitcoin is freedom money and so uh youknow I think he's he's really gunningfor it anybody that's Pro Freedomum is is on the Democratic side is is inrfk's Camp now what what we almost sawthere was a love letter to bitcoin uhwas that something you expected Matt didyou did you think he'd get right intopoints that uh only folks like you hitconsistently I mean he's not a myunderstanding is he's not a it hasn'tbeen a bitcoiner for very long so I'mnot sure who he's talking to what he'sreading uh what he's watching uh but I'dlike to know because uh he seemed to hitall the key points of what makes Bitcoinspecial what makes Bitcoin uniqueum why Freedom Tech is important and howhow policy makers should consider thesethings in terms of the best future forour country well um we're gonna have afew more of these political talks thatone was incredible up next we have thegreat ordinal debate on the Nakamotostage please stay tuned for Pete Rizzoand a few others going over what shouldbe a pretty contentious event sochanging speeds a little bit see on themain stage",
