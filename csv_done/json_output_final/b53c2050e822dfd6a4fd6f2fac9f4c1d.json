Alex here.This is episode two of the DeSci podcastand it's a special one.Balaji Srinivasan is an angel investortech founder and author of The Network State.Formerly, he's the CTO of Coinbaseand general partner at Andreessen Horowitzand he's also an early investor in many successfultech companies and crypto protocols.Balaji was the co-founder of earn.comacquired by Coinbase.Council acquired by Myriad Teleport,acquired by Topia and Coin Center.He holds a B.S., M.S.and Ph.D.in electrical engineering and an MS in chemicalengineering from Stanford University.I'm also happy to be joined by Vincent Weisser,who's chief of product at Molecule and Vita DAO.Today we spoke about scientific progress,the future of human optimism,the helical theory of historyand how to make predictions.Hope you enjoy.Yeah, so why don't we do that?You know for many, I think you need no introductionbut for the sake of anyoneI guess I'd say on Indoctrinated.Why don't you give yourself a quick intro,plug the book before we get into all the allthe juicy stuff and we'll be off to the races.(Balaji) Sure.So how's my audio? Good. (Alex) Sounds great.(Balaji) Great. Okay, good.So I am.My name is Balaji Srinivasan.I am https://twitter.com/balajis and balajis.com .I am the former CTOof Coinbase, former general partnerat Andreessen Horowitz.In a prior life, I was a career academic.I taught computer science and stats at Stanfordcoming Ph.D at Stanford.I mentioned that much less nowadays simplybecause I'm so bearish on academiaand I kind of think that that era is endingand the new eraof decentralized academia, decentralized media,decentralized science is beginning.And we can get into that when we talk today.I have a new book that just came outcalled The Network State,and it's at thenetworkslate.com.It actually intersects with many of these thingsbecause the way that the nation statejustifies itself is it says that everythingit's doing because of science.Right? Quote unquote, science.And you know, as I get to,there's a huge difference between sciencein the sense of Maxwell's equationswhich are independently reproducedand quote unquote, science in the senseof just peer reviewed publicationswhich are often not independently reproducedor even reproducible.And mimics the form, the journal publication,the citation and the prestige and so on.Without the substance which is the abilityto do an independent replication.And this core differencebetween quote unquote science and actual science.And one of the things I actually think aboutand I talk about is it's actually only one thingIt's more prestigious than science.You know, that is.(Alex) No. (Balaji) Math.I know that sounds almost trivial,but we don't normally think of them as opposed.Right.You know, the king and the queen of like stem.The dark get our stem.Science and how could you have math? Butone way of thinkingabout it is cryptoeconomics is based fundamentally on math.It is based on the fact thatwe can go and download the Bitcoin blockchainand run a bunch of mathematical computationsto verify all the past transactions.Same with the Ethereum blockchain.And that's differentthan academic economicswhich claims to be based on science.Where it has got into this realmwhere you cannot verify everything.All right.And it's become the sort of priesthood,this prestigious priesthood.And as I'll get to,I think many of the concepts behind,you know, the difference in crypto economics and,you know, legacy economics or fiateconomics can be applied to, you know,crypto information versus fiat information.Are you taking some non reproducible thingon faith, on the assertion,the fiat, you know, like a stateor of some state associated institution?Or is it crypto in the sensethat the data set, the calculations,the code, everything can be downloadedand reproduced locally.And this, by the way, is areturn to these topics. Butit's a long running strand in Western culturethat when the centralized thing is ossifiedand it is unresponsive,you break the glass and you decentralize.That's what Martin Luther did when he penned the,you know,95 theses to the door of the church in 1517saying the Catholic Church from ossifiedactually faith through comes just through the Bibleand this wasyou think of as a theological thingbut it is also a political thing where he wasdecentralizing power awayfrom the church to individualsand of course, began a whole conflict overwho has authority or what have you.But that is what crypto is doing.It's decentralizing that power, that verificationwho has the authorityto say what's true away from the government,away from the Federal Reserve?And now I would argue away from academiaand to the individualwith their computer or their mobile phonewho can run the calculations for themselves.So the networks need actually, I have to add more.You know, I've got the V1 out there.That's how I think of it right?I have the director's cut comingwhere I've got a bunch of stuffon this kind of topic, like whatI call the Ledger of Record on Regulation and so on.And those are like 50 or 100 page chaptersthat I kept out.But by the time it's done it will be quite long.But I think it'll be of interest to a lot of people.All right.So let me pause there.That's a book.It's free online, thenetworkstate.comYou can also get a PDF in Latin if you want thatand you can get it on Kindle.We'll do a hardcover audible.But but you can go there.If you subscribe you'll get free chapters Biblelessons.It’s all free online.Okay. Go ahead.(Alex) Excited for the hardcover, by the way.Always a big fan.No, just excited for the hardcover.(Balaji) Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah.We're going to try and make it a work of art,I think.I think the online version is pretty decent,but we can improve if you have feedback.But we gonna try to make the hardcoverlook really like a mantelpiece kind of thing.(Alex) Love it.All right.So to start us off at sort of a macro levelhere, you know, given as you mentionedyou're pretty robust academic foundations that.Yes, MS Ph.D. trifecta from Stanford.(Balaji) I also have an MS in chemical engineeringfor what that's where it so like so I have a.So anyway so I just I've been actingyour way too long, so I know a little bit about it.Go ahead. (Alex) More than the trifecta, then.I think you'd have an interesting researchperspective here.What do you think are the key factorsholding back scientific progress globally?I think the entireVannevar Bush thing of centralizing research aroundand after the time of World War 2 has run it course.And so I think the fundamental thing holding backscientific progress globally is the choke point.That is, the U.S. government.And what I mean by that is, you know, you often seepeople say:Oh, basic research has to be federally funded.What about, you know, the Internetand the human genome and so on and so forth?And it is true that there's been some great stuffthat's come out of what I callthe centralized research establishment.But Basho has this concept of seen and unseen.And there's this concept also of crowding out.So all of these funds that were appropriatedand centralized with the federal government,all the research so centralized there,there's a certain school of thought that comes whereit's grants and it's papers.There's choke points that happen.And if you if you seen there's a graphthat Carlson has postedthat I've also posted a while ago which showsthat the same cohort that started receivingNIH grants has basically just agedlike roughly one year per.Do you know about the graph I'm talking about,you might be able to show it. Okay.it's, you know, NIH.See if I can find it.NIH grant recipients.Yeah, here it is. It's kind of like.It's this.This gets gives a concept.So if yougo into that and you scroll down a little bit,you see thatthe fiscal year, the blue in the red thingthere. Right.Basically, as the years go by.That, you know, mode of the bell curvejust shifts over roughly one year at a time.And so it's like the same cohort of peoplewho are on each others grant committeesthat are warning them stem cell stuff.And they're just sort of aging with it.It's very political centralized processthat is ossifying alongwith much of the rest of Western civilizationwhere you see, you know, Top Gun Infinity,you see, you know, like 70sometimes 80 year old politicians, you know.Patrick Carlson actually had thistweet just a little while agoand see if I could find it,which shows that this the case for movies.this is the case for... Oh, here we are.(Alex) We'll put these links in the show notesfor anyone to listening on audio.Yeah. Here you go.So take a look at that one. See that.Look at those two graphics.And the first oneshows that like, you know, movies with leads,you know, less than 30 yearsold were very common in the 90s and 2000.They are incredibly uncommon today.And now 60 year old.Why is that?Because people are like, oh, Marilyn, America.I was like better.And, you know, they want they want Tom Cruise.They want this this proven stars.But those guys are aging.You know, you go the next graphicand you can just see like the age of NIHinvestigators has dropped off.And you have that saying like which is,you know,it's like science advances one funeral at a time.If you've heard that like it's verylike obviously it'svery cynical, but it's also true in the sensethat often things are not,you know, people the old guard doesn'twant to retract something or want to give in.But when they're no longer there to fight it, thenlike there can be progress that's made, you know.And so to your question,that centralization, the one thing that happens isyou'll get people like, you know, MarianaMoscato or others who will say, oh,all innovation is due to the state.And, you know, what about DARPA?Why don't you givethanks the great glory of the state for,you know, taking and taxing all the money from youand then dribbling it back a little bit back to youin the form of research dollars.And the thing about this is,if you go a little further backobviously much of mathematicsand physics was discovered before NSF existed.You know, like Maxwell'sequations was not NSF funded.You know, and neither was Newton.There are if you go further back in time in fact.You know thermodynamics and fiscal mechanicscame out of experimentsand the empiricism of steam engineslike the engineering drove the science.And there, you know, there's these huge industriesof railroads and aviation and automobiles,which obviously involve quite a lot of science,but also a lot of engineering that managed to arisewithout something like the kind of federal researchestablishment that we have.I'm not saying there wasn't some federalfunding for railroads and stuff like that,but fundamentally the thing was more decentralized.The reputation system was decentralized.The funding system was decentralized.By the time the so-called gentleman sciencewhere people would get independently wealthyand tinker and putter around with stuffin the will publish sort of for each other.Right now today that actually sort of coming backwith open sourcewith the fact that people can putterand they can try things outand they can share the results onlineand they can even do so anonymouslyAnd it's not just gentlemanbut gentleman and gentle pseudonym science.Like the https://project-evidence.github.ioor Satoshi Nakamoto’s whitepaper.Those are things which, you know,they're now very highly cited at least certainly theyou know the Satoshi Nakamoto Bitcoin whitepaperwas very highly cited in traditional academia.It's probably not the kind of thingthat you could easily get publishedin traditional academiabecause it spans many disciplines.It is not thought of as a good concept.But he could put it out on the internet.And https://project-evidence.github.io/that's now almost conventional wisdom.I tweeted about thislike in March, April 2020which was basically evidencefor lab leak thesiswhen that was highly controversial.Oh, my God. Conspiracy theory.Now, it's almost conventional wisdom right nowthat basically it'spolitically useful is almost commercialism.But it's not so much that the facts have changed.The trail in some ways has gone colder.So to your question,the key factor is centralizationand that might have actuallyhad some benefits. Okay,in some senseduring that period, to me have also been in a senseinevitable.1950 was arguably peak centralization.I talk about this in the network book.You'll get one telephone company in two superpowersand three television stations.You know, AT&T, right?You know the U.S.and the USSR.So one telephone company, AT&T,two superpowers, the U.S.and USSR, three television stations, CBS, ABC, NBC.That was highly an apparently centralized.You had these massive empires, the Soviet empire,the Chinese, like everything, is just massivelycentralized into these Geiger statesand really under the U.S..And you saw that the third world was, you know,those parts that weren't, you know, like being wheresome of them were actually actively fought over,but they were not combatants themselves.And this degree of centralizationwas actually very atypical.If you go backwards and forwards in time.So this whole thing of the centralizedscientific infrastructure that we think ofas just a fact of natureactually arose within living memory.You know, it might be older people,you know, but it's if you're 80 something years old,you were aroundbefore this whole thing was basically set up.And so we need to actually not just get rid of that.We need to transition away from itgradually and transition into something else.And so then it gets to, I think your next question.(Alex) Right, which is, you know, in that same vein,let's suspend our disbelief for a minuteand pretend you had full control.Right. We're playing God here a little bit.How would you change that legacy researchand funding structure?So this is like,you know the NIH budget is actually pretty large.It's several billion dollars a year.You know, much of this is now startingto be taken over by people doing kill fellowshiplike things and getting academics out to kind ofjust go and dotech startups.So several different things.First isI think it's somewhat framed incorrectlyand I'll just kind of contest a little bitthe framing of the question which is,it's all about like“How would you allow India to flourishif you were in control of the BritishRaj in 1940 something?” Right nowmy answer is I free India, right?I let India be free and I'd let them you know, goand build up their own countryand do it independently, right?And so if given full control,I would give up full control.Okay. And how how would we do that?Essentially what you want to do is shatterthe entire thing into many differentfunding sources.You know likethe thing about this is.Are you going to be able to break NIH this way?You're not. Right?I don't actually.It's almost like not a very useful lecture.But I do think just like I don't believeyou can abolish the Fed like Ron Paul wanted that.I do believe you can exit the Fed. Okay?And NIH is a giant jobs program.And, you know,NSF is also basically like this but smaller.And the thing about it isall these people are paid uslab techs that are basically doing the jobthat a pipetting robot should be doing.You know,all of this stuff is almost like artisanal science.Where, why is it not reproducible?Lots of bench science should be a programthat is run by essentially something like,you know, digital or analog microfluidicsor a pipetting robot.And it should not be run by a human.There should be much much more efforton bringing downcost, increasing reproducibility,increasing automation.The fact that we have had this huge subsidyfor like the, you know, 40 something postdocwho is basically like a pipette, you know, ispart of which has inhibited laboratory automation.I would argue because the the imperative isn't therequite as much.You have these people who are sort ofpromised academic jobs and dangled in front of themthat status and independence payoff.And they basically never get there.And they're embittered and they're adjunctsor whatever for the rest of their life.And that whole thingwhere you're kind of dangling something at the endwhere the pipeline doesn't really fit is,I think something that's reaching end of life.And so what are the kinds of thingsthat you should fund?Not perhaps, you know,I don't think it'll be within academia.I think it's going to be outside of academia.I think it's going to be like crypto science,decentralized science where we pool capitaland fun things.What do you fund?You basically fund independent investigatorsand you fund relatively low cost.You know, maybe it's like one, two, three years.And unlike the traditional academia,you don't have to write a grantwhere basically everything is done beforehand,you know.Traditional academia,you know, when you write a grant about some receptorpeople are so skepticalthat unless you've actually done the science alreadyand you show it there, so you end up.Kind of saying: Oh, I'm going to do somethingthat you've already have done.And really the grant is for the stuffyou haven't done yet, right?And then that gets put forward.So instead of doing something like that,just go to a much more honest VC/startup model.You can do something like the Thiel Fellowshipwhere you fund somebody for anybody.I might be interested in doing this myself,you know,not too distant futureand we'll test it and see if it works.But the concept is you find somebody who's smartand young, they're interested in something.I funded somebody recentlywho's working on artificial wombs.I funded people,so a woman who is interested in doing thatbecause she’s passionate about infertility issues.And I think that's an importantthing to work on as well.I funded peoplewho are basically doing the sort of one off thingsthat you probablywouldn't get funding for an academicor to crazy or too innovative or what have you.And I think that what you dois you give people like maybe a 1to 3 years of funding, okay?And it's usually like one personor maybe like a very small group.And they're trying to do the basic scienceand prove it out.And then if it workstheir technological fire catches,then they start a companyor they turn that into a company, okay?And if it doesn't, then like you eitherfind somebody who wants to continue the fundingor they shut it downor they, you know, like figure out some wayof funding it from like sellingNFT is or something like that.These are new models that are now available, right?And every job at some pointhas some sales component.You just don't get money for free.In academia, it's a grants mechanism.But once you're in an open worldand you can get moneyfrom basically anybody, not just academia.Guys like Andrew Human or David Sinclair,they're kind of like pioneers here.They're starting to like monetize in public.The scientists influencerwho do you have to explain your work?This whole point of publication,if you also devote some of thatto making kind of cool videos online,explain the social importance of it.That's good.And people might say; oh my God.Well that’ll kill pure science.You have to make it all accessible and sort of likelook at vegetation, look at three blue, one brown.Look at some of these science channels on YouTube.There’s an audience for it.And actually, there’s a fairly well-heeled audiencethat wants to learn about this stuff.You could actually monetize your teaching now.For example use that to fund research.Basically, a lot of these openfunding models will probably write a wholeI just went through several of themright there. But just to recap,you can set up a company and get it funded.You can try to do crypto style funding,whether it's design, crowdfundingor it's NFT or some combination thereof.You can become like a science influencerand get subscriptions.And like Veritas, you and others are showingthis actually much larger market.You could even set up like job dashboardsand stuff on your page.If you're like a physicist,then you know, the kinds of people are readingyour blog or the reading your publicationsare going to disproportionately be peoplewho are have skillsthat others want to employ or others want to find.And so it separates.There is bunch of different waysof kind of doing science outside of academia.And so how do you change the funding structure?I would look for outside academiafunding, decentralized funding and fortunate.Those things are coming online. (Alex) Gotcha.As something of a follow upthere, you talk about legacy media outletssort of enablement of decentralized censorshipof cancel cultureof American empire, all of whichI think you'd reasonably take issue with.And we can impact that a bit.But the question I have hereis whether you think there'sa reasonable connection with academic journals,gating of open information.So more simply, are thereare there commonalities between the New York Timesand nature of the scientific journal, for instance?(Balaji) Yeah, absolutely.And the thing is, academia movesslower than legacy media.It hasyou know,the thing is that of the pre-internetpower centers of the US like DC,which is regulation.Harvard, which I'll use as a medium for academia.Hollywood which is film.New York, which is media.DC and academia and Hollywood,you've been take years to multiple yearsto turn something around.You know,a paper or a film or especially a ruleor regulationthat can take multiple years to transform around.Media had a 24/7 metabolism.You know, CNN and others like metas,used to shipping in newspaper every single day.So they were the only legacy,you know, institution that had the same metabolismand speed of people who are deploying on Internet.So they became sort of the point of the spearof the establishmentagainst these tech interloperswho were rising first in Silicon Valley.And now, I think a globalized. Okay. Andso legacy media basically hadthey're attacking everybody.They're attackingI mean every country, every movement within the U.S.everything that possibly could contest the U.S.,whether it'sFrance or Hungary or China or India or Russiaor conservatives or centrist liberalsor tech people or crypto people or whatever.But there's like a new enemy every single day.And when you start actually adding all this upbecause like: Oh yeah.I guess they have kind of denounceall them, you might agree with one or two of them.You might say okay, well.Look, China is actually gettingpretty ultranationalist here.That's a real thing.But when everybody is denounced, other than like,you know, the New York media establishment,everybody and even them, half of them are denouncinglike that's become saying we're okay.Well, everybody's bad.Maybe this guy is bad,you know, or maybe these people areactually just pointing the fingerat everybody themselves.And, you know, so legacy mediahas been more out in front in terms of pointingat some poor guy onlinewho's made a joke and driving them from their job.Academia hasn't you know, you don't have timeto publish a paper on the metabolism of Twitter.But the connection with academia is.Academia is the slower moving streamthat the legacy media will cite if pressed. Why?Because science?Because nature, because cell, whatever. Okay.And you know, it's just a play on words.And the thing is that fundamentally,this is the streamthat is supposed to determinewhat's true for people.What is ittrue? Well, it's in a peer reviewed publication.What more do you want? Okay.And so let's go and decompose that,because that's really important.It's basically the fundamental high levelthing is thatscience is about independentreplication, not procedure citation.So you start there unless I can reproduceevery aspect of the experiment.I mean every single graph and table in the paper,ideally nowadays with a keystroke.I do not believe the paperand that's actually the minimum thingbecause when a paper is released,it is making claims often about the physical world.There's math and stats paperswhich you can do wholly on the computer,computer science papers you can do on the computer.But those that have collected data set,you know, you canyou can sort of divide it as there's the analogto digital interface which is the collectionand encoding of the data set.And then there is the processof taking the data set, writing codeto generate the figures and tablesand the PDF that makes up the paper.All right.So at least the digital layer.Let's talk about that for a second.That digital layershould be truly reproducible research.And you know the constant reproducible researchperhaps,you know, John Clare Bowen and David Donohoat Stanford in the early2000s have taught about this for a whileare has a sweet packagemany people have used Jupyter notebooks.Okay.And the basic concept behindreproducible research is you don'tjust give somebody a PDF, you give them the,you know,TAR file or the source code where they can hit enterand they've got the local database.It could be a school light,it could be just a bunch of flat files, whatever.But they've got the data there and they hit enterand the code slurps up all those files.It makes a graphs and it generates a PDF, right?And the reason this is so important is you can see,you know, people can't honestly have the wordsto describe every single parameter they used. Right?They don't really have the wordsto describe certain hacks.They did it on the data or how they cleaned it up.All of that, though, is there if you actually tracethrough every step of the source codeand it does something elsewhich is very useful, it trains graduate studentsbecause they can just look at the source.How do you do that figure? You can do this one.And then in a future paper that builds on this,you could import that.Okay, so that's reproducible research.The next step is what I calltruly reproducible research, where that codeand that data and that PDF is not simply likeonline, it's on chain.Why put it on chain?Well, first is that itgets you outside of academic paywalls and stuff.It's actually truly public number 1. 2.it's immutable or it's very hard to mutateand there's a track record of it being mutated.So it's,you know, the aspect of archival publishing.People are starting to pull down paperswhy it had this thing, which is like:Oh, they're pulling down papers finally, right?And they're like celebratingthe fact that they are like,you know, defacing the archives here.I'll show you this.Of course, it's always framed as excess or wiest.That's likegetting ridof harmful papers is a vital steptoward reestablish and trust.Nick's publisher should target articlesthat are flawed in other ways.So they are truly 1984.Okay.And they'll just they'll basicallyyou know, go with the edge casesand then start moving in from the edgeand moving in from the edge.And this article is not found, right?Now, If you did this in the Soviet Union,it would be obviousthat is like this was not a good thing.Even if it's wrong, have it out thereso people can see that it's wrong and how it's wrongand critique it as opposed to deleting itand pursuing something that was quote published.So what's happeningto basically the truly repressedresearch will stop this from happening.Most people even know this is happening,that the archives are getting silently purged.It just doesn't come up anymore in PubMed.This is very damaging to the historical record.This is why stuff like CI Hub is so good.I mean,you know, you'll know that the system has been fixedwhen Satoshi Snowden, Alexandra Elbakyanget Nobel prizes or the equivalent.I actually think the Nobel itself is a broken prize,by the way.Like it's you know quote Eurocentric, right?Whatever the next prize isI think will be some kind ofSatoshi prize,some like global, decentralized, pseudonymous prizewhere it's like awarded on chain and it's for workthat is reproducible and so on.I'd love to do something like that at some point.So coming back to truly research,the data would be on chain.The code turn that data into the PDFwould be on chain and the published PDFcould either be on chain or with one.You know, enter were generated fromthat I'm going to say on chain by the way.It could be are we even IPSF.I don't necessarily meanlike you literally need to start on Ethereum, right?What I mean is that you haveimmutable storage, public storage of the thing,right?And here's where that gets interesting.Why is that interesting?Once you start doing this for enough papersa citation becomes a function call.Because when you're citing an old paperthat you're that you actually are using directlythat analysis, you might actually be able tojust literally use it as a function you're importingthat old paper and you're using that to generatea graph that you're modifying in this paper.Okay.Especially for stats papers,especially for bioinformatics papers,methods papers of many kinds,computer science papers, machine learning papers,a fairly large set of things can literally be usedin exactly this way where the later version.You know for example,you're doing a benchmarking here.You want to make sure that you're being fairto the other authors.You literally import their moduleand you function called out with your datasetand you've got that in the codeso people can see you're not playing any shell gameswith your benchmark. Benchmarks are quite...that's a very common thing and that's likea good example of what I'm talking about.Still, when a citation becomes a function calledthat's possiblebecause the network of papers starts to be on chainand then you can start doing all these meta things.All a Google Scholar.What only Google can do Google Scholar. Why?Because all those papers are, you know, behindlike academic publishing sites, right?Somedaysomebody will probably do something like CI Huband just put all this CI Hub on a blockchainor something like that in public.And when that happensthat's like this,you know, liberation of all of this old content.And then you can start actually backtracing it where the 30 papers at this paper sites,you can see them there on chain at this timestamp,it goes back ten papersand you can trace it all the way back.Ideally, it's like Newton or Maxwell or something.And here's the thing that you'll often findwhen you actually trace back the citations.Many thingsthat we think of as sort of like physical lawsare just function fits to curves.And the raw datathere is like five data points or whatever.In a paper in the 1930sor the 1800s or something like that.And then it's just kind of ait's like law, it's like pass down.There's a story of spinachand how it just like Popeye spinach,you know, helping muscles or carrots,helping eyesight.These things become apocryphaland they are spreador picked up in scientific journals.And each guy cites somebody else.But no one actually has the original paperbecause it's too hard to find itand you track it all the way back.Might not say something like quite what it says,and this is particularly importantin like medical studies.So having everything, you know, first you getan individual paper on chain that's still useful.It's reproducible. It's truly reproducible.And then you start getting a constellation,a network of them,and then you start turning like citationsinto function calls.Now, you at least have done somethingvery important, which isthe digital part of thepaper can at least be replicatedon your computer locally.You know, there's a cache.Bedford's law.You know, there's very specific tests you can run.You know, George Marsagliawhen he's looking at like random numbergenerator says called like the die hardbattery of random number test.You can you canrun basic checks on this type of stuff for victory,which is unfortunately more common than one.I think, for faked or massaged data sets and so on.You can run consistent tests.See, are they actually getting this graph?Given these inputs, at least you can testwhether it's logically consistent.This is the kind of stuff that any VC associate doeswhen evaluating a deal.They'll just try to add up the rows in the columnsto make sure that they can back outthe same revenue number a few different ways.You know, if not, there's often some inconsistency.Okay, sothat would be one of the things you can doa truly reproducible research.You can at least look at the digital part.Now, what people will say is, well,what about the actual physical measurement, right?You're just taking the digital partand you're just trusting that.Well, I'd say two things.First is everybody doesn't have,you know, like an Illumina sequencer at their home.You don’t have highest peak at home.You don't have a incline plane.You don't have a superconducting supercollider.You don't have those things at home.We do have our computers and mobile phoneswhich can do billions of calculations.We have RWC and other things that anybody can rent.So at least the mathematical part.Lets at least get on base with thatwith the digital part, and we can check that.Now for the physical part.What I think you'll go to is I think eventually getwhat I call crypto instruments.And right now if you if you've done any genomicslike the file that's uploadedhas all kinds of metadata on it and used to checkfor things like batch effects, right.Because you know, you sequence today, sequencetomorrow, sequence the next dayand you might find that there's some spurious.You know, correlationwhere these samples seem to have this signaland the next day, a sample of the next signal.And you always have to correct for batch effects.It's very important to track all that metadata.With your sequencing run, which machine was it on.Which day was it on, etc.And just make sure that you'renot actually backing out of your sample.The machine idiosyncrasieswhich sometimes people can do a regressionand they think it's a real signal.It's not it's actually just like,you know, different machines had a slight shift inlike luminosity or whatever.And soit's alreadytypical to record on these biomedical experiments.And so what I say is you recordjust a little bit more metadatawhich are, you know, Merkle treesand Merkle roots that hashcertain pieces of the datato give a digital chain of custody.So now as the stuff is comingstreaming off the instrument before it's analyzed.Before can really be faked or messed around withthat is like put on chainand you know you kind of have something already withthis would like registered clinical trials.There's certain kinds of experimentsthat are important enoughthat they're pre-registeredand you know, you're doing the experimentso that whatever the results are,you're going to report it and so on and so forth.So if you're doing something for publication,you know, sometimes there's courtroom settingswhere people film it just to make sure their thingwas on the up and up, right.And the thing is, if you're basing multi-billion,sometimes multitrillion dollar decisions on a paper.You need to have like respectfor the people on the other endthat they are allowed to reproduceevery aspect of it all the way downto like the sensor data from that instrument.Otherwiseit's just a proclamation from a priesthood.It's not science.You know, if you can't reproduce it without trustingthe guy, you know, like you want to minimizethe amount of trust by minimizingthe amount of trust, by being open kimono, right?By, you know, being ashonest as one can be and distributingall of the data and so on and saying:So look this is everything.Here's even the video of it.And so on and so forth.Here's the commands to rerun the experiment on yourautomated pipe header or your high seek whatever.Like now you've at least, you know,you can say what more could I have done, right?I have given you all the toolsto reproduce the experiment.And that's one thing that rebuilds trust, not.I'm a scientist.It was a prestigious journal.I need this for my promotion.Which is basically where people are at.Because retractions are so,you know, career damaging.The people don't really want to make corrections,the retractions and compare this againto, like I said, the open source culture whereon a GitHub repo it's assumed even on the Linuxkernel, even on the Bitcoin repository,how many open issues are there?Like without even looking?Probably dozens, if not hundreds, right?These are massive projects. Everybody depends on.Even then, people understandtheir works in progress.Okay, that kind of modestyand humility is not there in academiawhere things that are used by far fewer peopleand that are far fewer of a base to stand on,have to pretend that they are,you know, from like Athena's head, like fully born.You know actually,Athena was born out of Zeus head. Sorry, I got that.I got that mistake, you know, so like thistruth is fully born and it isn't how it is, right?So putting all the pieces together,truly reproducible research means the digital part,the code, the data, the paper are on chain.When happens for multiple papers,a citation becomes a function call.Anybody can now reproduce what the paperand its antecedents are on their computer.They can do checks like Bedford's law,they can do statistical checks.And that's a digital part in the analogdigital part, which are the instruments.Eventually we get crypto instrumentsthat start recording Merkle trees.Merkle roots with the other metadatathat they're already recording.And you start to get a digital chain of custody onthese papers and on our entire scientific apparatus.Now, what I've described, by the way,there is a difficult but finite problem on parwith Wikipedia.I say we have to get the backfillof all the important papersinto truly reproducible research format,and then we need to have front fill being,you know, new papers that are all on chain.Okay, go ahead. I know there's a lot.(Vincent) Yeah, yeah.I'm curious like how are you saying?Like imagine all of this, like works in this field,like sciencebeing upstream of most,like scientific, like technological progress.How do you see it?Like in general, like scientific progressunfold like,do you see like machines taking over at some pointsolving diseases?Like I would be curious, like your visionfor kind of like how decentralized scienceand like science broadly like will transitionto kind of likethis age of like aggregates that are like doing moreand more of the workand like cloud labs and separate taking off.Like, how do you see that future unfold?(Balaji) Yeah.So one big thing is I think replication is massivelyunderestimated as a driver of the use of scienceJust as an example, likeyou guys have used tons of GitHub,you know, based open source projects.What do you do?You'll download it, you'll run it.If it doesn't run on your computer.It's an ambitious project.And, you know, like how many times do you quotereplicate their claims?You're literally executing the software.And if it doesn't replicate or workon your computer, it's useless.So like some, you know, software is replicatedliterally,I don't know, millions, billions of times dependingon, you know, rails how many times, Python Djangowhatever those the replicationsin a sense being able to run it locally are massive.And once you get science as being somethingthat you can think of as a componentof your software infrastructure,you know, where there's not like, here's the paperand there's like a human transducerthat needs to somehowpull it onto their site oncethat's actually considered like a component of it,just like but crypto's done,you know, the concept of like composable finance.Composablescience, composable science for papersare composable with each other.The key subroutines are composablejust saves everybody just insane amounts of time.It's like it is completely non-linear, you know.Because you've now got a library of things.Wow, I can actually all of this workis being put into these artisanal papersthat are just like effectively scansof what was offline and they're not builtfor the machine that built to the computer.Okay.So, that's like the broad concept of whyI think this would accelerate things.And then, you know, now you asked a specificquestion, you want to repeat that specific question.(Vincent) Yeah.Kind of like how you seekind of like the most optimistic visions of cloudlabs, AGI, etc., like influence science,like kind of like.(Balaji) Well, A.I..Is a friend of minewho's been very bearish on AGI and eventuallyI was able to figure out a bet with him.I was like: Okay, you agreethat artificial special intelligence existsand if not, general intelligence like domainspecific things like yes, sounds like okay.How about math?Okay.We are seeing language modelsdo all kinds of interesting simple manipulation.We're seeing things like,you know, forecast of the state of PDA use.Obviously, we're seeing things like Dall-Eand so on.Will you bet me that A.I.will start to advance math problems and get proofsthat we have not seen before that humans can check.Right.And he had to agree that while.Yeah.And so we're talking aboutit's like literally advancing the state of humanknowledge with proofs that are better than one humanbecause it's a formal system. Right.Depending on the area of maththat you're talking about,in theoryit should just be like, you know, a search spacethrough the whole thing unless you're introducingsome new symbols or what have you.Obviously the machine representationis a non-trivial thing, but the symbolic algebrapackages and Mathematica has been working on thisfor some time and that area exist.So some that some of the affordancesfor the computer exist.And I actually did see something just recently,so it was like a first for A.I.math customer.It's just very recently.A new computer program has solved severalopen problems in combinatorics and graph theory.Right?So that's pretty legit, right?Once you start gettingyou know, this is similar to thefor colored math problem for color map problem.Right from a long time ago, it was likeone of the first computer aided proofs, right?And it was controversial.But because, you know, could a human verifyall those different combinationsin that amount time in theory? Yes.But the computer helped, right?Is likeI forgot the exact same. And it was something like,gosh, I think there was a shorter proof for colormap theorem.Can every two map, you know, befor color map theorem states that no more than fourcolors required color the regions in absoluteno to just regions of the same color, right?And so Apple and Haken, you know, proved it.And then, you knowthis is also proved in 2005 and in this partwith general purpose proving software.Okay, so coming back.A.I. advancing the state of mathpretty big deal in my view.I mean honestly in a sense like what is your rulerfor the progress of civilization?The progress of civilization is kind ofhow good are you in math?I think you can think of lots of other metrics.I think the, you know, dictatorship scaleis probably another good one,which is the amount of energyyou can manipulate, right?Like, you know, sub planetaryor like solar system or whatever.But the amount of math you can doprobably pretty closely correlates with that.You're probably not going to be likeas a god, manipulating starsunless you can do a fair amount more math.We can right now. Andthis correlates with a lot of other measuressophistication,but also allows for whowhat is going to succeed us in the year 3000?Will there be humans?Could they be like, you know, A.I.enhanced humans or, you know, some some kind of formthat we can't even understand right nowlike pure software, who knows?But if that does happen,the way I think we all know.ıf it's sort of advanced in the senselike the Neanderthals aren't around.Homo sapiens is the successor of what came beforeus on the various, you know, archaic hominids.And, well, we're better at math.And so that's like one ruler, right?You can say,because everything else is sort of arbitrary.They made like stones.And we have stones that reshape in a certain way.But math actually does have kindof an absolute ruler to it.So that's like one thought in termsof how you kind of measurewhat scientific progresslooks like over the medium to long term. AndI mean, there's more Ican talk about, but let me stop there.(Vincent) I'd be curious because like Qmakes this excellent point that kind of like cryptoshould be a very like technology that freedomis like closely associated with.While A.I.is more like surveillance state China likeChina doesn't like it.Kind of like the freedom properties of crypto.So do you think there's a risk thata being like a dominant driver of progressis a very like centralizing technologylike in the hands of like the Chinese stateor like a DeepMind or maybe notnecessarily by nature, kind of like decentralizedbecause like compute and talent,like there are benefitsto having centralization there.So how do you see kind of like aAI unfolding on the centralizationdecentralization spectrum and the roots with this?(Balaji) It's complicated.So first thing I'd say is actually thinking of itas a triangle, which is CCP is, you know,like most cities with AI, BTC with decentralizationand crypto and NYT with social.And so if you think of social, basicallythat's not done yet.We think of social media as like mature,but the metaverse is socialand then crypto is, you know,all of all the stuff that we're seeing here.And then the AI is roboticsand all the stuff in the physical world.So it's like three different ways.Why those three technologies, bythe way, why is it not trite?Why not talk about electric carsand, you know, solarpanels and spaceships and stuff?I love those things.Those are also cool,but electric cars, supersonic aircraft,those are almost like endpoints or devicesor inanimate,whereas AI and social and crypto are three waysto coordinate large numbers of human beings.Social and crypto, perhaps very obviously.Whether their up-down or it's markets, basicallysocialist sort of left democracy with markets.And crypto is like, oh sorry, social is likeleft democracy with like elections and upvotesand speech and voice and crypto is right democracywith markets and auctions and exits and so on.And then AI is actually neither leftor right democracy but harmony like one.Okay, that's like the Chinese model underHu Jintao is likehow does a billion person state one.Which is a different model of aggregationlike the Democratic model is an electionand you pluribus and comeswith an election, you know, Kenneth Arrowand all the stuff in aggregation functions.The market model is let the market decide.And the model is harmony, which is slurpall this stuff into just one all seeing,all knowing AI God.Basically, right?And that's kind of what CCP is building this,this thing that knows moreabout any human than anyanything has ever known before.I don't know what the full implication of that is.We're just at the very early days of this.I don't want tosay I think it has to be AGI to be concerning.It's something that it just script all the dronesand hunt any dissentmore than anything we've ever seen,which is obviously troubling because,you know,it's like an unbeatable order in that sense.And if it's a bad order and an unbeatable one,that could be bad.You know, if it's a good order.A good order can turn bad over time, you know,so it's pretty complicated now with that.So first, identifying as to try the other thing.I'd say is crypto can be sort of corruptedor repurposed for centralization with the CBDSand so on.But A.I.can also of coursebe decentralized with federated machine learning.Or if you're seeing, you know, there'sknockoffs of Dall-E 2 and other things that happenvery quickly, you know, they're not as good,but they very quickly get out there.And moreover, these models are difficult to trainbut as you know relatively cheap to evaluate.And so they're literally just bags of coefficients.And probably in the fullness of time,they'll either getreverse engineered or hacked or something like that.Once it's known that it's possible,you know, it's probably possiblefor other people to catch up.I don't I'm not sure how defensiblethose things are, especially with like the one shotstar, four zero shot stuff.Like the whole point is that you don't needas much data to train or would have it right.So we will see, you know,so that's like the second is decentralized A.I.and there's also centralized crypto.Let me pause there.(Alex) Gotcha.I'd actually like to switch gears for a minuteand just talk about how to think, right?You're pretty well known for this,but how would you say you draw from historyas you have been throughout a lot of this interviewto make predictions in technology?And what are the biggest challenges in doing that?(Balaji) Well, I meanyou know, the thing isthere's differentthere's different ways to pull from history.And one of the things I consideran unsolved problem is to determinewhether a historical analogy is accurate.What I mean by that is if you analogizean RLC circuit to a spring with dashpot, okay?You get the second orderharmonic differential equation where you can exactlyanalogize the R the agency to the spring constantand the dashpot and so on.Right?It's like it's just an analogy.It's a mathematical analogy where you have a secondor differential equation that's likewhen most famous math analogies, you know, Feynmantalked about in the time in lectures and whatnot.And mathematical analogies are the best kindbecause there is an ice amorphousin between the objects here in the objects here.And maybe leading tothis gives you insight into these and vice versa.Historical analogies are always more fraughtbecause, you know, people will just argue:Oh, this guy is just like Hitler or whatever, right?And everybody will feel, you know, this is likeabout their strength of assertion on it.And so on.I do think that at some pointwe might become smart enough that we could saylike something in between the extreme microof like an RLC circuit versus a spring induction,but in the extreme macroof like a current populationconfiguration is like a market configuration.Okay?So that is something which is not like inanimateobjects and it's not millions of people acrossa very long period of time, but it's like marketmicrostructure, like market depth.So that's not millions of people,but it's often many thousands of peopleor even hundreds of thousands of people.And it's not that controversial to say, oh,this, you know, set of market dynamics,this evolution of prices, this order book over timelooked like this other one.Right?There's people who just like hold orderbooks over time.And there might be certain crowd phenomenathat's like,oh, this guy comes in with a big selland everybody gets scared.And, you know, like the liquidity leavesor you could have something like that.I'm sure the HFT guys have a whole menagerieof common, you know, shocks to order books.Okay.And that's a little bitlike an intermediate thing between,you know, the history of a circuitand the history of the population.It is the history of a mesoscalewhere you don't run the experiment enough times.They've seen exactly how this order bookwill collapse in certain circumstances.And the mathematical analogy part becomes easierbecause in theory you could, you know,especially if you had full information in every,you know, price, quantity pair in the order book,if you could map that to the new order bookand you could kind of see how similar they were,you could you can make a mathematical analogy.And I think eventually it's possible that I mean,we're at the beginning of sort of digital history,you know, as I mentioned in the book.And as long as we don't blow ourselvesup, most of humanhistory actually extends into the future.And it's hard to think about itlike as being at the beginning of something,because we think of ourselves as like theculmination. We're at the beginning of something.And if that's thecase, then the ability to look at a hugenumber of humansis almost like molecules in a fluid and saythis state is like a certain laminar stateor this state is a certain turbulent stateand therefore we can analogize it to previousperiodswould be sort of like in fluid mechanicsmaking: Oh, this,you know, laminar flow and this is turbulent flow.And I can analogized it to what I did before.So identifying that historical analogypart like thatmapping that ice amorphous and recognizeras the most difficult partto convince other people of, you know, agreeing thatthat part is the most difficult.Subject to that if you do thinkthat there's a configuration of humans todayand the reason you use configurationis if you almost start thinking about humans is likebilliardballs that can just like atoms smack into each otherand do various things and they'll do certain thingsunder certain circumstances.There's like configurations of humansthat acted in certain ways in past historythat might act in similar ways today, in a sense,you know, saying goes human nature doesn't change,robot nature may change, but human nature does.Robots are getting waybetter. Algorithms game better.That is a new that's a new thing under the sun.But human nature doesn't.And so if you can make that analogyand you can find a previous configuration,you can say, well, today is like yesterday.And I talk about this somewhere in the book where Isay, you know, look at the macro, macro level.I can give about 30 examples, showthat where we're decentralizingin a way that's similar to more the early 1900slead 1800s then to 30 years ago.Like our future is our past.It's like peak centralization.1915, you go more decentralized, another direction.Okay, so that's high level.How I think about the use of historicalanalogies. Go ahead.(Alex) Sure.Let's dig in a little bit more on that. Right?Like to what extent do you approach historyas being cyclical?Right?I think it's John Hilliswho has some great writing on this.He talks about these broad historical cyclesof centralization and decentralizationbeing created by sort of the advent of informationtechnologies over time.Do you align with that cyclical approach to historyin the context of technology,in the context of,you know, the way you approach prediction?(Balaji) So it's funny, it's almost trivial.But basically I have this whole thing in the bookwhere I talk about the Helix theory of history.Okay?So the linear theory is it's just a line, okay,you know, Z of T equals KT okay?We're just advancing. We're just progressing.Maybe it's some wiggles,but for the most part, the arc of history is long,but it bends for its progress.And then the cyclical theory is it'syou know, it's a parametric curve, right?X of T equals cosT, Y of T equalssinT and you're just going around a loopand we just come back to where we are.And that's like the, you know, hard men creategood times.Good times create weak men.Women create.It's hard to create good times,good demonstrate, weak man, weak man createhard times, hard times, good, strong man,something like that.Right.You know, again, the you know, but again, my pointand as they talk aboutthe book, there's, you know, left, rightand libertarian versions of that cycle.You know, left version would be the revolutionaries,you know, go and push and make the revolution.And then a Stalin compromisesit and then, you know, we're oppressed again.And then there's another revolution,you know, like that.Right.And so the cycle versionhas something to say for it.You know, one of the reasons is humans are,you know, under 70 something years old.And so as things drop out of human memory onthe order of two generations,you know, certain kinds of things seem to repeat.So there's like fourth turning and,you know, there'sgosh, what's his name?Peter Turchin and stuffI think is the most quantitative look at this RayDalio, Turchin and Straussand how are all worth reading for this sort ofAsimov and Psychohistory?Look at things, okay?But the way I kind of think about it is V3which is helical, right?And so now you can kind of superimpose those, right?ZFT equals KT x f(T) equals cosTYT equals sinT and now you've got a corkscrewthat's maybe going up from the origin.And there are cyclical aspects.We're also making progress in some wayswe're not guaranteed to do so.It's possible that spring goes flying like this.If you watch the Collapse of Civilizations podcast,sobering to realize that civilizationscan collapse, that our current civilizationcould collapse, that others have beforethat in a sense,we're like the guys who got to the last levelof a video gameand we're made the most successful up to this point.I don't thinkprevious human civilizations, to our knowledge,had gotten to like space travel and so on.But that may just mean thatlike our final flame out is like really chaotic.So it's actually good to decentralize,to have eggs in multiplebaskets, to get to other planets.And that's what a lot of talks about,about backing up humanity.One thing I actually think is underappreciatedthat the Internet may allow us to do is actuallyencrypt humanity.And what I mean by that isit used to be that there was terra incognitathat say, like, here, be dragons on the map, partsyou didn't know about parts of world you neverand I actually think that we're at peakvisibility like right aroundnow in terms of being ableto see the faces of all the people understandthe earth.You never used to have somethingwhere 3 billion people could find out whatthree other billion people look like thatlike Google images like that never happened before.People were never that visible to all other humans,you know, like very few people'sphotos were printed.Photos are relatively unusual.People essentially were not in the panopticonto the extent that they are.And I think a reaction against the Chinese controlwill be the secret state, the encrypted state, wherejust the very fact that you'rea member of a digital society is not even known toanybody other than other members that in a tlocally with your air glasses, you can see thatthat person has the same glowing sigil that you do,but it's not disclosed anybody else.That territorythat that building is an unmarked buildingand you basically start to encrypt the real world.And if you think about it,if you if you didn't have Google Maps,if you didn't have those overlays,if you didn't know,you wouldn't know what many buildings on the streetwere who's in those offices or what have you.It would basically be something where, you know,you couldn't open the door, you wouldn't go in.So we're sort of visibility now.And one of my I think out of the many predictionsis the re encryption and pseudonymous of the world.And why does that actually matter?Well, it's an intermediatebetween now and getting to Mars. Why?One of thethings Steve Jobs did within Apple is he builthe pushed secrecy, wide secrecy.So you could have multiple teamsthat didn't know about each other,that were working on the same thing, but they wereinnovative since they couldn't copy from each other.Right.And they didn't feel competitive with each otherbecause didn't know about each other.So they weren't memetic. Right?They were decentralized.And Peter Thiel and Girard and so on.Talk about mimesisa lot like basically copying people and you know,mimesis can be good in the sense that that'show you learn language, that's how you learn skills.You're copying other people doing things.Copying isn't always better, but when you look at,you know, many kinds of things that peoplefight over, like famously 54, 40 or fight wasa borderor an almost border war between the US.And you know what, at the time,you know, today we call Canada,it's kind of is actually Canada at the timeor like still British Canada.But 50 or 40 year fightwas that the Americans wantedthe border between the US and the Northern.I think, I said is Canada is like British Canadaor something like that.The antecedent again to to be at the 54thparallel and 40th minute or whateverit is with latitude.It's actually like the 49th parallel.The point is, unless the thing was mapped,people wouldn't even be able to fight oversomething like that.You might say, Well,how could you possibly go away from maps?At one point I'd make in the book iswe can see the Franco-German border, right?That border, you know, the Maginot Line was Bill,people invaded back and forth.It's this huge thing, militarized landmines,all I mean, not any more.But, you know,there were all kinds of crazy stuff happening there.We can see it.People know basically who's on either side.You can go on Google Mapsand you can kind of get a sense are you likebasically a borderline German,a borderline French person. Butwe don't see the Twitter, Facebook border.These gigantic things,which are both individually much bigger than France.Germanyput together, Richard, is like 300 million plus.We're 3 billion.The people who log on to Twitter100% of the time are all the way in Twitter land.People log into Facebook countriesin time over here, but those folks who the twosocial networks compete over who might, let's say,log in to each about 50% of their time online.I'm just using that as one metric.You might have other metrics about the borders.Those people are not known to either party.Right.There's this giant I don't know if it's 50 millionor 10 million or if it's totally disjoint groups.We just don't know what the size of that border is.We also don't to the size of bordergiant Facebook and TikTok.Right.But the other day, actually,you know, somebody pointed outthat, you know, they're actually here.Let me see if I can find thistweet. They pointed out thatFacebook, Instagram wastrying to blockthe TikTok videosfrom being published.I see if I can find this.(Alex) Go for it.(Balaji) Okay.I can't find this time, but point ismade to try to block TikTok videos coming in. Right?Okay, great.We've got a heads up.(Vincent) Do you have more time or?(Balaji) No, no, no. I actually do too.So when we...(Vincent) Maybe as a last givenour audience are kind of builders and peopleand decentralized science and you are kind of likeone of the most successful builders in the world,like having built both in the sciences in crypto,what would you recommend?Kind of like a piece of advicemaybe to people that want to build out.Also like some of the visionsyou describe for this, the world of science.How should approach it?Of course, it's like the best practicesplaybook of how to buildstart ups, etc.,but it might be different for decentralized science.Like how would you in general, justas generally advice for a builder and DeSci.What would you do?(Balaji) I've got a very specific thing builda demonstration of truly reproducible research.Take two statistics, paperswhere one side see the other, okay?And maybe actually use a function from the other.Have them both be on chain,maybe with the data and stuff on our weave.And just show how you did that.That would be a huge breakthrough.This focus on something very specific.Then we've got that proof technological firewhere we can show, here's a paper, here'sanother one.It's like ARPANETsitting like the first packet, right?That first on chain citation as a function callwhere you have composablescience will be a milestone.And I think that's like a very concrete thingthat somebody can build.It's not really that hard to do.It's just kind of figuring outlike how to put the code on chain or on some data.If you want to use Solana or whateverthat somebody find, do it are you one.Point is use some kind ofdecentralized platform to showthat you can get composable science.I can get composable finance.(Alex) Awesome.I think that's just about it for us. Balaji.Appreciate the words, appreciate the time,appreciate the advice at the end there.1729.com thenetworkstate.com for anybodylooking for the buck it's great.Any final words?Are well I'm on Twitter @balajis so follow me thereand if you do build anythingand in truly reproducible researcherssay which is on chain very interested in seeing it.And you're doing things that are like Molecule DAOI'm interested in that too.Thanks. (Vincent) As one last question.That direction, do you have specificlike recommendations for like a book or a resourcelike to dive into like the science like somethingyou would recommend you haven't recommended before?(Balaji) Oh, well, I like thePrinceton Guide to Mathematics.If you ever do have to be in solitary confinement,that is a book to bring with you.That the bench press.It will be okay.All right.And there's a culvert or whatever, right. AndI think we also haveif you just subscribe at thenetworkstate.comI'll be pushing out a bunch of more free contentand chapters that will cover a bunch of these topicsand have more, more references there.(Vincent) Amazing. Thanks for taking the time.Well, the pleasure.(Balaji) Thank you.(Alex) Thanks Balaji!(Balaji) Bye!(Alex) Thanks for tuning in.For more information about this podcastand about molecule, check out the show notes below.If you have any questionsand want to get into a deeper discussion abouttoday's topics,feel free to visit our Twitter or discord.You can find all the important linksin the description and show notes below.Also, if you're a researcher seeking funding,if you want to start working in a biotech DAOor if you're an investor, pleasevisit our website molecule.to for more information.Thanks again for tuning inand we'll see you again soon. Bye.(Balaji) And people might say; oh my God.Well that'll kill pure science.You have to make it all accessible and sort of likelook at vegetation, look at three blue, one brown.Look at some of these science channels on YouTube.There's an audience for it.And actually, there's a fairly well-heeled audiencethat wants to learn about this stuff.You could actually monetize your teaching now,for example, and use that to fund research.Basically, a lot of these openfunding models will probably write a whole.I just went through several of them right there.(Alex) Hey guys! Alex here.This is episode two of the DeSci podcastand it's a special one.Balaji Srinivasan is an angel investortech founder and author of The Network State.Formerly, he's the CTO of Coinbaseand general partner at Andreessen Horowitzand he's also an early investor in many successfultech companies and crypto protocols.Balaji was the co-founder of earn.comacquired by Coinbase.Council acquired by Myriad Teleport,acquired by Topia and Coin Center.He holds a B.S., M.S.and Ph.D.in electrical engineering and an MS in chemicalengineering from Stanford University.I'm also happy to be joined by Vincent Weisser,who's chief of product at Molecule and Vita DAO.Today we spoke about scientific progress,the future of human optimism,the helical theory of historyand how to make predictions.Hope you enjoy.Yeah, so why don't we do that?You know for many, I think you need no introductionbut for the sake of anyoneI guess I'd say on Indoctrinated.Why don't you give yourself a quick intro,plug the book before we get into all the allthe juicy stuff and we'll be off to the races.(Balaji) Sure.So how's my audio? Good. (Alex) Sounds great.(Balaji) Great. Okay, good.So I am.My name is Balaji Srinivasan.I am https://twitter.com/balajis and balajis.com .I am the former CTOof Coinbase, former general partnerat Andreessen Horowitz.In a prior life, I was a career academic.I taught computer science and stats at Stanfordcoming Ph.D at Stanford.I mentioned that much less nowadays simplybecause I'm so bearish on academiaand I kind of think that that era is endingand the new eraof decentralized academia, decentralized media,decentralized science is beginning.And we can get into that when we talk today.I have a new book that just came outcalled The Network State,and it's at thenetworkslate.com.It actually intersects with many of these thingsbecause the way that the nation statejustifies itself is it says that everythingit's doing because of science.Right? Quote unquote, science.And you know, as I get to,there's a huge difference between sciencein the sense of Maxwell's equationswhich are independently reproducedand quote unquote, science in the senseof just peer reviewed publicationswhich are often not independently reproducedor even reproducible.And mimics the form, the journal publication,the citation and the prestige and so on.Without the substance which is the abilityto do an independent replication.And this core differencebetween quote unquote science and actual science.And one of the things I actually think aboutand I talk about is it's actually only one thingIt's more prestigious than science.You know, that is.(Alex) No. (Balaji) Math.I know that sounds almost trivial,but we don't normally think of them as opposed.Right.You know, the king and the queen of like stem.The dark get our stem.Science and how could you have math? Butone way of thinkingabout it is cryptoeconomics is based fundamentally on math.It is based on the fact thatwe can go and download the Bitcoin blockchainand run a bunch of mathematical computationsto verify all the past transactions.Same with the Ethereum blockchain.And that's differentthan academic economicswhich claims to be based on science.Where it has got into this realmwhere you cannot verify everything.All right.And it's become the sort of priesthood,this prestigious priesthood.And as I'll get to,I think many of the concepts behind,you know, the difference in crypto economics and,you know, legacy economics or fiateconomics can be applied to, you know,crypto information versus fiat information.Are you taking some non reproducible thingon faith, on the assertion,the fiat, you know, like a stateor of some state associated institution?Or is it crypto in the sensethat the data set, the calculations,the code, everything can be downloadedand reproduced locally.And this, by the way, is areturn to these topics. Butit's a long running strand in Western culturethat when the centralized thing is ossifiedand it is unresponsive,you break the glass and you decentralize.That's what Martin Luther did when he penned the,you know,95 theses to the door of the church in 1517saying the Catholic Church from ossifiedactually faith through comes just through the Bibleand this wasyou think of as a theological thingbut it is also a political thing where he wasdecentralizing power awayfrom the church to individualsand of course, began a whole conflict overwho has authority or what have you.But that is what crypto is doing.It's decentralizing that power, that verificationwho has the authorityto say what's true away from the government,away from the Federal Reserve?And now I would argue away from academiaand to the individualwith their computer or their mobile phonewho can run the calculations for themselves.So the networks need actually, I have to add more.You know, I've got the V1 out there.That's how I think of it right?I have the director's cut comingwhere I've got a bunch of stuffon this kind of topic, like whatI call the Ledger of Record on Regulation and so on.And those are like 50 or 100 page chaptersthat I kept out.But by the time it's done it will be quite long.But I think it'll be of interest to a lot of people.All right.So let me pause there.That's a book.It's free online, thenetworkstate.comYou can also get a PDF in Latin if you want thatand you can get it on Kindle.We'll do a hardcover audible.But but you can go there.If you subscribe you'll get free chapters Biblelessons.It’s all free online.Okay. Go ahead.(Alex) Excited for the hardcover, by the way.Always a big fan.No, just excited for the hardcover.(Balaji) Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah.We're going to try and make it a work of art,I think.I think the online version is pretty decent,but we can improve if you have feedback.But we gonna try to make the hardcoverlook really like a mantelpiece kind of thing.(Alex) Love it.All right.So to start us off at sort of a macro levelhere, you know, given as you mentionedyou're pretty robust academic foundations that.Yes, MS Ph.D. trifecta from Stanford.(Balaji) I also have an MS in chemical engineeringfor what that's where it so like so I have a.So anyway so I just I've been actingyour way too long, so I know a little bit about it.Go ahead. (Alex) More than the trifecta, then.I think you'd have an interesting researchperspective here.What do you think are the key factorsholding back scientific progress globally?I think the entireVannevar Bush thing of centralizing research aroundand after the time of World War 2 has run it course.And so I think the fundamental thing holding backscientific progress globally is the choke point.That is, the U.S. government.And what I mean by that is, you know, you often seepeople say:Oh, basic research has to be federally funded.What about, you know, the Internetand the human genome and so on and so forth?And it is true that there's been some great stuffthat's come out of what I callthe centralized research establishment.But Basho has this concept of seen and unseen.And there's this concept also of crowding out.So all of these funds that were appropriatedand centralized with the federal government,all the research so centralized there,there's a certain school of thought that comes whereit's grants and it's papers.There's choke points that happen.And if you if you seen there's a graphthat Carlson has postedthat I've also posted a while ago which showsthat the same cohort that started receivingNIH grants has basically just agedlike roughly one year per.Do you know about the graph I'm talking about,you might be able to show it. Okay.it's, you know, NIH.See if I can find it.NIH grant recipients.Yeah, here it is. It's kind of like.It's this.This gets gives a concept.So if yougo into that and you scroll down a little bit,you see thatthe fiscal year, the blue in the red thingthere. Right.Basically, as the years go by.That, you know, mode of the bell curvejust shifts over roughly one year at a time.And so it's like the same cohort of peoplewho are on each others grant committeesthat are warning them stem cell stuff.And they're just sort of aging with it.It's very political centralized processthat is ossifying alongwith much of the rest of Western civilizationwhere you see, you know, Top Gun Infinity,you see, you know, like 70sometimes 80 year old politicians, you know.Patrick Carlson actually had thistweet just a little while agoand see if I could find it,which shows that this the case for movies.this is the case for... Oh, here we are.(Alex) We'll put these links in the show notesfor anyone to listening on audio.Yeah. Here you go.So take a look at that one. See that.Look at those two graphics.And the first oneshows that like, you know, movies with leads,you know, less than 30 yearsold were very common in the 90s and 2000.They are incredibly uncommon today.And now 60 year old.Why is that?Because people are like, oh, Marilyn, America.I was like better.And, you know, they want they want Tom Cruise.They want this this proven stars.But those guys are aging.You know, you go the next graphicand you can just see like the age of NIHinvestigators has dropped off.And you have that saying like which is,you know,it's like science advances one funeral at a time.If you've heard that like it's verylike obviously it'svery cynical, but it's also true in the sensethat often things are not,you know, people the old guard doesn'twant to retract something or want to give in.But when they're no longer there to fight it, thenlike there can be progress that's made, you know.And so to your question,that centralization, the one thing that happens isyou'll get people like, you know, MarianaMoscato or others who will say, oh,all innovation is due to the state.And, you know, what about DARPA?Why don't you givethanks the great glory of the state for,you know, taking and taxing all the money from youand then dribbling it back a little bit back to youin the form of research dollars.And the thing about this is,if you go a little further backobviously much of mathematicsand physics was discovered before NSF existed.You know, like Maxwell'sequations was not NSF funded.You know, and neither was Newton.There are if you go further back in time in fact.You know thermodynamics and fiscal mechanicscame out of experimentsand the empiricism of steam engineslike the engineering drove the science.And there, you know, there's these huge industriesof railroads and aviation and automobiles,which obviously involve quite a lot of science,but also a lot of engineering that managed to arisewithout something like the kind of federal researchestablishment that we have.I'm not saying there wasn't some federalfunding for railroads and stuff like that,but fundamentally the thing was more decentralized.The reputation system was decentralized.The funding system was decentralized.By the time the so-called gentleman sciencewhere people would get independently wealthyand tinker and putter around with stuffin the will publish sort of for each other.Right now today that actually sort of coming backwith open sourcewith the fact that people can putterand they can try things outand they can share the results onlineand they can even do so anonymouslyAnd it's not just gentlemanbut gentleman and gentle pseudonym science.Like the https://project-evidence.github.ioor Satoshi Nakamoto’s whitepaper.Those are things which, you know,they're now very highly cited at least certainly theyou know the Satoshi Nakamoto Bitcoin whitepaperwas very highly cited in traditional academia.It's probably not the kind of thingthat you could easily get publishedin traditional academiabecause it spans many disciplines.It is not thought of as a good concept.But he could put it out on the internet.And https://project-evidence.github.io/that's now almost conventional wisdom.I tweeted about thislike in March, April 2020which was basically evidencefor lab leak thesiswhen that was highly controversial.Oh, my God. Conspiracy theory.Now, it's almost conventional wisdom right nowthat basically it'spolitically useful is almost commercialism.But it's not so much that the facts have changed.The trail in some ways has gone colder.So to your question,the key factor is centralizationand that might have actuallyhad some benefits. Okay,in some senseduring that period, to me have also been in a senseinevitable.1950 was arguably peak centralization.I talk about this in the network book.You'll get one telephone company in two superpowersand three television stations.You know, AT&T, right?You know the U.S.and the USSR.So one telephone company, AT&T,two superpowers, the U.S.and USSR, three television stations, CBS, ABC, NBC.That was highly an apparently centralized.You had these massive empires, the Soviet empire,the Chinese, like everything, is just massivelycentralized into these Geiger statesand really under the U.S..And you saw that the third world was, you know,those parts that weren't, you know, like being wheresome of them were actually actively fought over,but they were not combatants themselves.And this degree of centralizationwas actually very atypical.If you go backwards and forwards in time.So this whole thing of the centralizedscientific infrastructure that we think ofas just a fact of natureactually arose within living memory.You know, it might be older people,you know, but it's if you're 80 something years old,you were aroundbefore this whole thing was basically set up.And so we need to actually not just get rid of that.We need to transition away from itgradually and transition into something else.And so then it gets to, I think your next question.(Alex) Right, which is, you know, in that same vein,let's suspend our disbelief for a minuteand pretend you had full control.Right. We're playing God here a little bit.How would you change that legacy researchand funding structure?So this is like,you know the NIH budget is actually pretty large.It's several billion dollars a year.You know, much of this is now startingto be taken over by people doing kill fellowshiplike things and getting academics out to kind ofjust go and dotech startups.So several different things.First isI think it's somewhat framed incorrectlyand I'll just kind of contest a little bitthe framing of the question which is,it's all about like“How would you allow India to flourishif you were in control of the BritishRaj in 1940 something?” Right nowmy answer is I free India, right?I let India be free and I'd let them you know, goand build up their own countryand do it independently, right?And so if given full control,I would give up full control.Okay. And how how would we do that?Essentially what you want to do is shatterthe entire thing into many differentfunding sources.You know likethe thing about this is.Are you going to be able to break NIH this way?You're not. Right?I don't actually.It's almost like not a very useful lecture.But I do think just like I don't believeyou can abolish the Fed like Ron Paul wanted that.I do believe you can exit the Fed. Okay?And NIH is a giant jobs program.And, you know,NSF is also basically like this but smaller.And the thing about it isall these people are paid uslab techs that are basically doing the jobthat a pipetting robot should be doing.You know,all of this stuff is almost like artisanal science.Where, why is it not reproducible?Lots of bench science should be a programthat is run by essentially something like,you know, digital or analog microfluidicsor a pipetting robot.And it should not be run by a human.There should be much much more efforton bringing downcost, increasing reproducibility,increasing automation.The fact that we have had this huge subsidyfor like the, you know, 40 something postdocwho is basically like a pipette, you know, ispart of which has inhibited laboratory automation.I would argue because the the imperative isn't therequite as much.You have these people who are sort ofpromised academic jobs and dangled in front of themthat status and independence payoff.And they basically never get there.And they're embittered and they're adjunctsor whatever for the rest of their life.And that whole thingwhere you're kind of dangling something at the endwhere the pipeline doesn't really fit is,I think something that's reaching end of life.And so what are the kinds of thingsthat you should fund?Not perhaps, you know,I don't think it'll be within academia.I think it's going to be outside of academia.I think it's going to be like crypto science,decentralized science where we pool capitaland fun things.What do you fund?You basically fund independent investigatorsand you fund relatively low cost.You know, maybe it's like one, two, three years.And unlike the traditional academia,you don't have to write a grantwhere basically everything is done beforehand,you know.Traditional academia,you know, when you write a grant about some receptorpeople are so skepticalthat unless you've actually done the science alreadyand you show it there, so you end up.Kind of saying: Oh, I'm going to do somethingthat you've already have done.And really the grant is for the stuffyou haven't done yet, right?And then that gets put forward.So instead of doing something like that,just go to a much more honest VC/startup model.You can do something like the Thiel Fellowshipwhere you fund somebody for anybody.I might be interested in doing this myself,you know,not too distant futureand we'll test it and see if it works.But the concept is you find somebody who's smartand young, they're interested in something.I funded somebody recentlywho's working on artificial wombs.I funded people,so a woman who is interested in doing thatbecause she’s passionate about infertility issues.And I think that's an importantthing to work on as well.I funded peoplewho are basically doing the sort of one off thingsthat you probablywouldn't get funding for an academicor to crazy or too innovative or what have you.And I think that what you dois you give people like maybe a 1to 3 years of funding, okay?And it's usually like one personor maybe like a very small group.And they're trying to do the basic scienceand prove it out.And then if it workstheir technological fire catches,then they start a companyor they turn that into a company, okay?And if it doesn't, then like you eitherfind somebody who wants to continue the fundingor they shut it downor they, you know, like figure out some wayof funding it from like sellingNFT is or something like that.These are new models that are now available, right?And every job at some pointhas some sales component.You just don't get money for free.In academia, it's a grants mechanism.But once you're in an open worldand you can get moneyfrom basically anybody, not just academia.Guys like Andrew Human or David Sinclair,they're kind of like pioneers here.They're starting to like monetize in public.The scientists influencerwho do you have to explain your work?This whole point of publication,if you also devote some of thatto making kind of cool videos online,explain the social importance of it.That's good.And people might say; oh my God.Well that’ll kill pure science.You have to make it all accessible and sort of likelook at vegetation, look at three blue, one brown.Look at some of these science channels on YouTube.There’s an audience for it.And actually, there’s a fairly well-heeled audiencethat wants to learn about this stuff.You could actually monetize your teaching now.For example use that to fund research.Basically, a lot of these openfunding models will probably write a wholeI just went through several of themright there. But just to recap,you can set up a company and get it funded.You can try to do crypto style funding,whether it's design, crowdfundingor it's NFT or some combination thereof.You can become like a science influencerand get subscriptions.And like Veritas, you and others are showingthis actually much larger market.You could even set up like job dashboardsand stuff on your page.If you're like a physicist,then you know, the kinds of people are readingyour blog or the reading your publicationsare going to disproportionately be peoplewho are have skillsthat others want to employ or others want to find.And so it separates.There is bunch of different waysof kind of doing science outside of academia.And so how do you change the funding structure?I would look for outside academiafunding, decentralized funding and fortunate.Those things are coming online. (Alex) Gotcha.As something of a follow upthere, you talk about legacy media outletssort of enablement of decentralized censorshipof cancel cultureof American empire, all of whichI think you'd reasonably take issue with.And we can impact that a bit.But the question I have hereis whether you think there'sa reasonable connection with academic journals,gating of open information.So more simply, are thereare there commonalities between the New York Timesand nature of the scientific journal, for instance?(Balaji) Yeah, absolutely.And the thing is, academia movesslower than legacy media.It hasyou know,the thing is that of the pre-internetpower centers of the US like DC,which is regulation.Harvard, which I'll use as a medium for academia.Hollywood which is film.New York, which is media.DC and academia and Hollywood,you've been take years to multiple yearsto turn something around.You know,a paper or a film or especially a ruleor regulationthat can take multiple years to transform around.Media had a 24/7 metabolism.You know, CNN and others like metas,used to shipping in newspaper every single day.So they were the only legacy,you know, institution that had the same metabolismand speed of people who are deploying on Internet.So they became sort of the point of the spearof the establishmentagainst these tech interloperswho were rising first in Silicon Valley.And now, I think a globalized. Okay. Andso legacy media basically hadthey're attacking everybody.They're attackingI mean every country, every movement within the U.S.everything that possibly could contest the U.S.,whether it'sFrance or Hungary or China or India or Russiaor conservatives or centrist liberalsor tech people or crypto people or whatever.But there's like a new enemy every single day.And when you start actually adding all this upbecause like: Oh yeah.I guess they have kind of denounceall them, you might agree with one or two of them.You might say okay, well.Look, China is actually gettingpretty ultranationalist here.That's a real thing.But when everybody is denounced, other than like,you know, the New York media establishment,everybody and even them, half of them are denouncinglike that's become saying we're okay.Well, everybody's bad.Maybe this guy is bad,you know, or maybe these people areactually just pointing the fingerat everybody themselves.And, you know, so legacy mediahas been more out in front in terms of pointingat some poor guy onlinewho's made a joke and driving them from their job.Academia hasn't you know, you don't have timeto publish a paper on the metabolism of Twitter.But the connection with academia is.Academia is the slower moving streamthat the legacy media will cite if pressed. Why?Because science?Because nature, because cell, whatever. Okay.And you know, it's just a play on words.And the thing is that fundamentally,this is the streamthat is supposed to determinewhat's true for people.What is ittrue? Well, it's in a peer reviewed publication.What more do you want? Okay.And so let's go and decompose that,because that's really important.It's basically the fundamental high levelthing is thatscience is about independentreplication, not procedure citation.So you start there unless I can reproduceevery aspect of the experiment.I mean every single graph and table in the paper,ideally nowadays with a keystroke.I do not believe the paperand that's actually the minimum thingbecause when a paper is released,it is making claims often about the physical world.There's math and stats paperswhich you can do wholly on the computer,computer science papers you can do on the computer.But those that have collected data set,you know, you canyou can sort of divide it as there's the analogto digital interface which is the collectionand encoding of the data set.And then there is the processof taking the data set, writing codeto generate the figures and tablesand the PDF that makes up the paper.All right.So at least the digital layer.Let's talk about that for a second.That digital layershould be truly reproducible research.And you know the constant reproducible researchperhaps,you know, John Clare Bowen and David Donohoat Stanford in the early2000s have taught about this for a whileare has a sweet packagemany people have used Jupyter notebooks.Okay.And the basic concept behindreproducible research is you don'tjust give somebody a PDF, you give them the,you know,TAR file or the source code where they can hit enterand they've got the local database.It could be a school light,it could be just a bunch of flat files, whatever.But they've got the data there and they hit enterand the code slurps up all those files.It makes a graphs and it generates a PDF, right?And the reason this is so important is you can see,you know, people can't honestly have the wordsto describe every single parameter they used. Right?They don't really have the wordsto describe certain hacks.They did it on the data or how they cleaned it up.All of that, though, is there if you actually tracethrough every step of the source codeand it does something elsewhich is very useful, it trains graduate studentsbecause they can just look at the source.How do you do that figure? You can do this one.And then in a future paper that builds on this,you could import that.Okay, so that's reproducible research.The next step is what I calltruly reproducible research, where that codeand that data and that PDF is not simply likeonline, it's on chain.Why put it on chain?Well, first is that itgets you outside of academic paywalls and stuff.It's actually truly public number 1. 2.it's immutable or it's very hard to mutateand there's a track record of it being mutated.So it's,you know, the aspect of archival publishing.People are starting to pull down paperswhy it had this thing, which is like:Oh, they're pulling down papers finally, right?And they're like celebratingthe fact that they are like,you know, defacing the archives here.I'll show you this.Of course, it's always framed as excess or wiest.That's likegetting ridof harmful papers is a vital steptoward reestablish and trust.Nick's publisher should target articlesthat are flawed in other ways.So they are truly 1984.Okay.And they'll just they'll basicallyyou know, go with the edge casesand then start moving in from the edgeand moving in from the edge.And this article is not found, right?Now, If you did this in the Soviet Union,it would be obviousthat is like this was not a good thing.Even if it's wrong, have it out thereso people can see that it's wrong and how it's wrongand critique it as opposed to deleting itand pursuing something that was quote published.So what's happeningto basically the truly repressedresearch will stop this from happening.Most people even know this is happening,that the archives are getting silently purged.It just doesn't come up anymore in PubMed.This is very damaging to the historical record.This is why stuff like CI Hub is so good.I mean,you know, you'll know that the system has been fixedwhen Satoshi Snowden, Alexandra Elbakyanget Nobel prizes or the equivalent.I actually think the Nobel itself is a broken prize,by the way.Like it's you know quote Eurocentric, right?Whatever the next prize isI think will be some kind ofSatoshi prize,some like global, decentralized, pseudonymous prizewhere it's like awarded on chain and it's for workthat is reproducible and so on.I'd love to do something like that at some point.So coming back to truly research,the data would be on chain.The code turn that data into the PDFwould be on chain and the published PDFcould either be on chain or with one.You know, enter were generated fromthat I'm going to say on chain by the way.It could be are we even IPSF.I don't necessarily meanlike you literally need to start on Ethereum, right?What I mean is that you haveimmutable storage, public storage of the thing,right?And here's where that gets interesting.Why is that interesting?Once you start doing this for enough papersa citation becomes a function call.Because when you're citing an old paperthat you're that you actually are using directlythat analysis, you might actually be able tojust literally use it as a function you're importingthat old paper and you're using that to generatea graph that you're modifying in this paper.Okay.Especially for stats papers,especially for bioinformatics papers,methods papers of many kinds,computer science papers, machine learning papers,a fairly large set of things can literally be usedin exactly this way where the later version.You know for example,you're doing a benchmarking here.You want to make sure that you're being fairto the other authors.You literally import their moduleand you function called out with your datasetand you've got that in the codeso people can see you're not playing any shell gameswith your benchmark. Benchmarks are quite...that's a very common thing and that's likea good example of what I'm talking about.Still, when a citation becomes a function calledthat's possiblebecause the network of papers starts to be on chainand then you can start doing all these meta things.All a Google Scholar.What only Google can do Google Scholar. Why?Because all those papers are, you know, behindlike academic publishing sites, right?Somedaysomebody will probably do something like CI Huband just put all this CI Hub on a blockchainor something like that in public.And when that happensthat's like this,you know, liberation of all of this old content.And then you can start actually backtracing it where the 30 papers at this paper sites,you can see them there on chain at this timestamp,it goes back ten papersand you can trace it all the way back.Ideally, it's like Newton or Maxwell or something.And here's the thing that you'll often findwhen you actually trace back the citations.Many thingsthat we think of as sort of like physical lawsare just function fits to curves.And the raw datathere is like five data points or whatever.In a paper in the 1930sor the 1800s or something like that.And then it's just kind of ait's like law, it's like pass down.There's a story of spinachand how it just like Popeye spinach,you know, helping muscles or carrots,helping eyesight.These things become apocryphaland they are spreador picked up in scientific journals.And each guy cites somebody else.But no one actually has the original paperbecause it's too hard to find itand you track it all the way back.Might not say something like quite what it says,and this is particularly importantin like medical studies.So having everything, you know, first you getan individual paper on chain that's still useful.It's reproducible. It's truly reproducible.And then you start getting a constellation,a network of them,and then you start turning like citationsinto function calls.Now, you at least have done somethingvery important, which isthe digital part of thepaper can at least be replicatedon your computer locally.You know, there's a cache.Bedford's law.You know, there's very specific tests you can run.You know, George Marsagliawhen he's looking at like random numbergenerator says called like the die hardbattery of random number test.You can you canrun basic checks on this type of stuff for victory,which is unfortunately more common than one.I think, for faked or massaged data sets and so on.You can run consistent tests.See, are they actually getting this graph?Given these inputs, at least you can testwhether it's logically consistent.This is the kind of stuff that any VC associate doeswhen evaluating a deal.They'll just try to add up the rows in the columnsto make sure that they can back outthe same revenue number a few different ways.You know, if not, there's often some inconsistency.Okay, sothat would be one of the things you can doa truly reproducible research.You can at least look at the digital part.Now, what people will say is, well,what about the actual physical measurement, right?You're just taking the digital partand you're just trusting that.Well, I'd say two things.First is everybody doesn't have,you know, like an Illumina sequencer at their home.You don’t have highest peak at home.You don't have a incline plane.You don't have a superconducting supercollider.You don't have those things at home.We do have our computers and mobile phoneswhich can do billions of calculations.We have RWC and other things that anybody can rent.So at least the mathematical part.Lets at least get on base with thatwith the digital part, and we can check that.Now for the physical part.What I think you'll go to is I think eventually getwhat I call crypto instruments.And right now if you if you've done any genomicslike the file that's uploadedhas all kinds of metadata on it and used to checkfor things like batch effects, right.Because you know, you sequence today, sequencetomorrow, sequence the next dayand you might find that there's some spurious.You know, correlationwhere these samples seem to have this signaland the next day, a sample of the next signal.And you always have to correct for batch effects.It's very important to track all that metadata.With your sequencing run, which machine was it on.Which day was it on, etc.And just make sure that you'renot actually backing out of your sample.The machine idiosyncrasieswhich sometimes people can do a regressionand they think it's a real signal.It's not it's actually just like,you know, different machines had a slight shift inlike luminosity or whatever.And soit's alreadytypical to record on these biomedical experiments.And so what I say is you recordjust a little bit more metadatawhich are, you know, Merkle treesand Merkle roots that hashcertain pieces of the datato give a digital chain of custody.So now as the stuff is comingstreaming off the instrument before it's analyzed.Before can really be faked or messed around withthat is like put on chainand you know you kind of have something already withthis would like registered clinical trials.There's certain kinds of experimentsthat are important enoughthat they're pre-registeredand you know, you're doing the experimentso that whatever the results are,you're going to report it and so on and so forth.So if you're doing something for publication,you know, sometimes there's courtroom settingswhere people film it just to make sure their thingwas on the up and up, right.And the thing is, if you're basing multi-billion,sometimes multitrillion dollar decisions on a paper.You need to have like respectfor the people on the other endthat they are allowed to reproduceevery aspect of it all the way downto like the sensor data from that instrument.Otherwiseit's just a proclamation from a priesthood.It's not science.You know, if you can't reproduce it without trustingthe guy, you know, like you want to minimizethe amount of trust by minimizingthe amount of trust, by being open kimono, right?By, you know, being ashonest as one can be and distributingall of the data and so on and saying:So look this is everything.Here's even the video of it.And so on and so forth.Here's the commands to rerun the experiment on yourautomated pipe header or your high seek whatever.Like now you've at least, you know,you can say what more could I have done, right?I have given you all the toolsto reproduce the experiment.And that's one thing that rebuilds trust, not.I'm a scientist.It was a prestigious journal.I need this for my promotion.Which is basically where people are at.Because retractions are so,you know, career damaging.The people don't really want to make corrections,the retractions and compare this againto, like I said, the open source culture whereon a GitHub repo it's assumed even on the Linuxkernel, even on the Bitcoin repository,how many open issues are there?Like without even looking?Probably dozens, if not hundreds, right?These are massive projects. Everybody depends on.Even then, people understandtheir works in progress.Okay, that kind of modestyand humility is not there in academiawhere things that are used by far fewer peopleand that are far fewer of a base to stand on,have to pretend that they are,you know, from like Athena's head, like fully born.You know actually,Athena was born out of Zeus head. Sorry, I got that.I got that mistake, you know, so like thistruth is fully born and it isn't how it is, right?So putting all the pieces together,truly reproducible research means the digital part,the code, the data, the paper are on chain.When happens for multiple papers,a citation becomes a function call.Anybody can now reproduce what the paperand its antecedents are on their computer.They can do checks like Bedford's law,they can do statistical checks.And that's a digital part in the analogdigital part, which are the instruments.Eventually we get crypto instrumentsthat start recording Merkle trees.Merkle roots with the other metadatathat they're already recording.And you start to get a digital chain of custody onthese papers and on our entire scientific apparatus.Now, what I've described, by the way,there is a difficult but finite problem on parwith Wikipedia.I say we have to get the backfillof all the important papersinto truly reproducible research format,and then we need to have front fill being,you know, new papers that are all on chain.Okay, go ahead. I know there's a lot.(Vincent) Yeah, yeah.I'm curious like how are you saying?Like imagine all of this, like works in this field,like sciencebeing upstream of most,like scientific, like technological progress.How do you see it?Like in general, like scientific progressunfold like,do you see like machines taking over at some pointsolving diseases?Like I would be curious, like your visionfor kind of like how decentralized scienceand like science broadly like will transitionto kind of likethis age of like aggregates that are like doing moreand more of the workand like cloud labs and separate taking off.Like, how do you see that future unfold?(Balaji) Yeah.So one big thing is I think replication is massivelyunderestimated as a driver of the use of scienceJust as an example, likeyou guys have used tons of GitHub,you know, based open source projects.What do you do?You'll download it, you'll run it.If it doesn't run on your computer.It's an ambitious project.And, you know, like how many times do you quotereplicate their claims?You're literally executing the software.And if it doesn't replicate or workon your computer, it's useless.So like some, you know, software is replicatedliterally,I don't know, millions, billions of times dependingon, you know, rails how many times, Python Djangowhatever those the replicationsin a sense being able to run it locally are massive.And once you get science as being somethingthat you can think of as a componentof your software infrastructure,you know, where there's not like, here's the paperand there's like a human transducerthat needs to somehowpull it onto their site oncethat's actually considered like a component of it,just like but crypto's done,you know, the concept of like composable finance.Composablescience, composable science for papersare composable with each other.The key subroutines are composablejust saves everybody just insane amounts of time.It's like it is completely non-linear, you know.Because you've now got a library of things.Wow, I can actually all of this workis being put into these artisanal papersthat are just like effectively scansof what was offline and they're not builtfor the machine that built to the computer.Okay.So, that's like the broad concept of whyI think this would accelerate things.And then, you know, now you asked a specificquestion, you want to repeat that specific question.(Vincent) Yeah.Kind of like how you seekind of like the most optimistic visions of cloudlabs, AGI, etc., like influence science,like kind of like.(Balaji) Well, A.I..Is a friend of minewho's been very bearish on AGI and eventuallyI was able to figure out a bet with him.I was like: Okay, you agreethat artificial special intelligence existsand if not, general intelligence like domainspecific things like yes, sounds like okay.How about math?Okay.We are seeing language modelsdo all kinds of interesting simple manipulation.We're seeing things like,you know, forecast of the state of PDA use.Obviously, we're seeing things like Dall-Eand so on.Will you bet me that A.I.will start to advance math problems and get proofsthat we have not seen before that humans can check.Right.And he had to agree that while.Yeah.And so we're talking aboutit's like literally advancing the state of humanknowledge with proofs that are better than one humanbecause it's a formal system. Right.Depending on the area of maththat you're talking about,in theoryit should just be like, you know, a search spacethrough the whole thing unless you're introducingsome new symbols or what have you.Obviously the machine representationis a non-trivial thing, but the symbolic algebrapackages and Mathematica has been working on thisfor some time and that area exist.So some that some of the affordancesfor the computer exist.And I actually did see something just recently,so it was like a first for A.I.math customer.It's just very recently.A new computer program has solved severalopen problems in combinatorics and graph theory.Right?So that's pretty legit, right?Once you start gettingyou know, this is similar to thefor colored math problem for color map problem.Right from a long time ago, it was likeone of the first computer aided proofs, right?And it was controversial.But because, you know, could a human verifyall those different combinationsin that amount time in theory? Yes.But the computer helped, right?Is likeI forgot the exact same. And it was something like,gosh, I think there was a shorter proof for colormap theorem.Can every two map, you know, befor color map theorem states that no more than fourcolors required color the regions in absoluteno to just regions of the same color, right?And so Apple and Haken, you know, proved it.And then, you knowthis is also proved in 2005 and in this partwith general purpose proving software.Okay, so coming back.A.I. advancing the state of mathpretty big deal in my view.I mean honestly in a sense like what is your rulerfor the progress of civilization?The progress of civilization is kind ofhow good are you in math?I think you can think of lots of other metrics.I think the, you know, dictatorship scaleis probably another good one,which is the amount of energyyou can manipulate, right?Like, you know, sub planetaryor like solar system or whatever.But the amount of math you can doprobably pretty closely correlates with that.You're probably not going to be likeas a god, manipulating starsunless you can do a fair amount more math.We can right now. Andthis correlates with a lot of other measuressophistication,but also allows for whowhat is going to succeed us in the year 3000?Will there be humans?Could they be like, you know, A.I.enhanced humans or, you know, some some kind of formthat we can't even understand right nowlike pure software, who knows?But if that does happen,the way I think we all know.ıf it's sort of advanced in the senselike the Neanderthals aren't around.Homo sapiens is the successor of what came beforeus on the various, you know, archaic hominids.And, well, we're better at math.And so that's like one ruler, right?You can say,because everything else is sort of arbitrary.They made like stones.And we have stones that reshape in a certain way.But math actually does have kindof an absolute ruler to it.So that's like one thought in termsof how you kind of measurewhat scientific progresslooks like over the medium to long term. AndI mean, there's more Ican talk about, but let me stop there.(Vincent) I'd be curious because like Qmakes this excellent point that kind of like cryptoshould be a very like technology that freedomis like closely associated with.While A.I.is more like surveillance state China likeChina doesn't like it.Kind of like the freedom properties of crypto.So do you think there's a risk thata being like a dominant driver of progressis a very like centralizing technologylike in the hands of like the Chinese stateor like a DeepMind or maybe notnecessarily by nature, kind of like decentralizedbecause like compute and talent,like there are benefitsto having centralization there.So how do you see kind of like aAI unfolding on the centralizationdecentralization spectrum and the roots with this?(Balaji) It's complicated.So first thing I'd say is actually thinking of itas a triangle, which is CCP is, you know,like most cities with AI, BTC with decentralizationand crypto and NYT with social.And so if you think of social, basicallythat's not done yet.We think of social media as like mature,but the metaverse is socialand then crypto is, you know,all of all the stuff that we're seeing here.And then the AI is roboticsand all the stuff in the physical world.So it's like three different ways.Why those three technologies, bythe way, why is it not trite?Why not talk about electric carsand, you know, solarpanels and spaceships and stuff?I love those things.Those are also cool,but electric cars, supersonic aircraft,those are almost like endpoints or devicesor inanimate,whereas AI and social and crypto are three waysto coordinate large numbers of human beings.Social and crypto, perhaps very obviously.Whether their up-down or it's markets, basicallysocialist sort of left democracy with markets.And crypto is like, oh sorry, social is likeleft democracy with like elections and upvotesand speech and voice and crypto is right democracywith markets and auctions and exits and so on.And then AI is actually neither leftor right democracy but harmony like one.Okay, that's like the Chinese model underHu Jintao is likehow does a billion person state one.Which is a different model of aggregationlike the Democratic model is an electionand you pluribus and comeswith an election, you know, Kenneth Arrowand all the stuff in aggregation functions.The market model is let the market decide.And the model is harmony, which is slurpall this stuff into just one all seeing,all knowing AI God.Basically, right?And that's kind of what CCP is building this,this thing that knows moreabout any human than anyanything has ever known before.I don't know what the full implication of that is.We're just at the very early days of this.I don't want tosay I think it has to be AGI to be concerning.It's something that it just script all the dronesand hunt any dissentmore than anything we've ever seen,which is obviously troubling because,you know,it's like an unbeatable order in that sense.And if it's a bad order and an unbeatable one,that could be bad.You know, if it's a good order.A good order can turn bad over time, you know,so it's pretty complicated now with that.So first, identifying as to try the other thing.I'd say is crypto can be sort of corruptedor repurposed for centralization with the CBDSand so on.But A.I.can also of coursebe decentralized with federated machine learning.Or if you're seeing, you know, there'sknockoffs of Dall-E 2 and other things that happenvery quickly, you know, they're not as good,but they very quickly get out there.And moreover, these models are difficult to trainbut as you know relatively cheap to evaluate.And so they're literally just bags of coefficients.And probably in the fullness of time,they'll either getreverse engineered or hacked or something like that.Once it's known that it's possible,you know, it's probably possiblefor other people to catch up.I don't I'm not sure how defensiblethose things are, especially with like the one shotstar, four zero shot stuff.Like the whole point is that you don't needas much data to train or would have it right.So we will see, you know,so that's like the second is decentralized A.I.and there's also centralized crypto.Let me pause there.(Alex) Gotcha.I'd actually like to switch gears for a minuteand just talk about how to think, right?You're pretty well known for this,but how would you say you draw from historyas you have been throughout a lot of this interviewto make predictions in technology?And what are the biggest challenges in doing that?(Balaji) Well, I meanyou know, the thing isthere's differentthere's different ways to pull from history.And one of the things I consideran unsolved problem is to determinewhether a historical analogy is accurate.What I mean by that is if you analogizean RLC circuit to a spring with dashpot, okay?You get the second orderharmonic differential equation where you can exactlyanalogize the R the agency to the spring constantand the dashpot and so on.Right?It's like it's just an analogy.It's a mathematical analogy where you have a secondor differential equation that's likewhen most famous math analogies, you know, Feynmantalked about in the time in lectures and whatnot.And mathematical analogies are the best kindbecause there is an ice amorphousin between the objects here in the objects here.And maybe leading tothis gives you insight into these and vice versa.Historical analogies are always more fraughtbecause, you know, people will just argue:Oh, this guy is just like Hitler or whatever, right?And everybody will feel, you know, this is likeabout their strength of assertion on it.And so on.I do think that at some pointwe might become smart enough that we could saylike something in between the extreme microof like an RLC circuit versus a spring induction,but in the extreme macroof like a current populationconfiguration is like a market configuration.Okay?So that is something which is not like inanimateobjects and it's not millions of people acrossa very long period of time, but it's like marketmicrostructure, like market depth.So that's not millions of people,but it's often many thousands of peopleor even hundreds of thousands of people.And it's not that controversial to say, oh,this, you know, set of market dynamics,this evolution of prices, this order book over timelooked like this other one.Right?There's people who just like hold orderbooks over time.And there might be certain crowd phenomenathat's like,oh, this guy comes in with a big selland everybody gets scared.And, you know, like the liquidity leavesor you could have something like that.I'm sure the HFT guys have a whole menagerieof common, you know, shocks to order books.Okay.And that's a little bitlike an intermediate thing between,you know, the history of a circuitand the history of the population.It is the history of a mesoscalewhere you don't run the experiment enough times.They've seen exactly how this order bookwill collapse in certain circumstances.And the mathematical analogy part becomes easierbecause in theory you could, you know,especially if you had full information in every,you know, price, quantity pair in the order book,if you could map that to the new order bookand you could kind of see how similar they were,you could you can make a mathematical analogy.And I think eventually it's possible that I mean,we're at the beginning of sort of digital history,you know, as I mentioned in the book.And as long as we don't blow ourselvesup, most of humanhistory actually extends into the future.And it's hard to think about itlike as being at the beginning of something,because we think of ourselves as like theculmination. We're at the beginning of something.And if that's thecase, then the ability to look at a hugenumber of humansis almost like molecules in a fluid and saythis state is like a certain laminar stateor this state is a certain turbulent stateand therefore we can analogize it to previousperiodswould be sort of like in fluid mechanicsmaking: Oh, this,you know, laminar flow and this is turbulent flow.And I can analogized it to what I did before.So identifying that historical analogypart like thatmapping that ice amorphous and recognizeras the most difficult partto convince other people of, you know, agreeing thatthat part is the most difficult.Subject to that if you do thinkthat there's a configuration of humans todayand the reason you use configurationis if you almost start thinking about humans is likebilliardballs that can just like atoms smack into each otherand do various things and they'll do certain thingsunder certain circumstances.There's like configurations of humansthat acted in certain ways in past historythat might act in similar ways today, in a sense,you know, saying goes human nature doesn't change,robot nature may change, but human nature does.Robots are getting waybetter. Algorithms game better.That is a new that's a new thing under the sun.But human nature doesn't.And so if you can make that analogyand you can find a previous configuration,you can say, well, today is like yesterday.And I talk about this somewhere in the book where Isay, you know, look at the macro, macro level.I can give about 30 examples, showthat where we're decentralizingin a way that's similar to more the early 1900slead 1800s then to 30 years ago.Like our future is our past.It's like peak centralization.1915, you go more decentralized, another direction.Okay, so that's high level.How I think about the use of historicalanalogies. Go ahead.(Alex) Sure.Let's dig in a little bit more on that. Right?Like to what extent do you approach historyas being cyclical?Right?I think it's John Hilliswho has some great writing on this.He talks about these broad historical cyclesof centralization and decentralizationbeing created by sort of the advent of informationtechnologies over time.Do you align with that cyclical approach to historyin the context of technology,in the context of,you know, the way you approach prediction?(Balaji) So it's funny, it's almost trivial.But basically I have this whole thing in the bookwhere I talk about the Helix theory of history.Okay?So the linear theory is it's just a line, okay,you know, Z of T equals KT okay?We're just advancing. We're just progressing.Maybe it's some wiggles,but for the most part, the arc of history is long,but it bends for its progress.And then the cyclical theory is it'syou know, it's a parametric curve, right?X of T equals cosT, Y of T equalssinT and you're just going around a loopand we just come back to where we are.And that's like the, you know, hard men creategood times.Good times create weak men.Women create.It's hard to create good times,good demonstrate, weak man, weak man createhard times, hard times, good, strong man,something like that.Right.You know, again, the you know, but again, my pointand as they talk aboutthe book, there's, you know, left, rightand libertarian versions of that cycle.You know, left version would be the revolutionaries,you know, go and push and make the revolution.And then a Stalin compromisesit and then, you know, we're oppressed again.And then there's another revolution,you know, like that.Right.And so the cycle versionhas something to say for it.You know, one of the reasons is humans are,you know, under 70 something years old.And so as things drop out of human memory onthe order of two generations,you know, certain kinds of things seem to repeat.So there's like fourth turning and,you know, there'sgosh, what's his name?Peter Turchin and stuffI think is the most quantitative look at this RayDalio, Turchin and Straussand how are all worth reading for this sort ofAsimov and Psychohistory?Look at things, okay?But the way I kind of think about it is V3which is helical, right?And so now you can kind of superimpose those, right?ZFT equals KT x f(T) equals cosTYT equals sinT and now you've got a corkscrewthat's maybe going up from the origin.And there are cyclical aspects.We're also making progress in some wayswe're not guaranteed to do so.It's possible that spring goes flying like this.If you watch the Collapse of Civilizations podcast,sobering to realize that civilizationscan collapse, that our current civilizationcould collapse, that others have beforethat in a sense,we're like the guys who got to the last levelof a video gameand we're made the most successful up to this point.I don't thinkprevious human civilizations, to our knowledge,had gotten to like space travel and so on.But that may just mean thatlike our final flame out is like really chaotic.So it's actually good to decentralize,to have eggs in multiplebaskets, to get to other planets.And that's what a lot of talks about,about backing up humanity.One thing I actually think is underappreciatedthat the Internet may allow us to do is actuallyencrypt humanity.And what I mean by that isit used to be that there was terra incognitathat say, like, here, be dragons on the map, partsyou didn't know about parts of world you neverand I actually think that we're at peakvisibility like right aroundnow in terms of being ableto see the faces of all the people understandthe earth.You never used to have somethingwhere 3 billion people could find out whatthree other billion people look like thatlike Google images like that never happened before.People were never that visible to all other humans,you know, like very few people'sphotos were printed.Photos are relatively unusual.People essentially were not in the panopticonto the extent that they are.And I think a reaction against the Chinese controlwill be the secret state, the encrypted state, wherejust the very fact that you'rea member of a digital society is not even known toanybody other than other members that in a tlocally with your air glasses, you can see thatthat person has the same glowing sigil that you do,but it's not disclosed anybody else.That territorythat that building is an unmarked buildingand you basically start to encrypt the real world.And if you think about it,if you if you didn't have Google Maps,if you didn't have those overlays,if you didn't know,you wouldn't know what many buildings on the streetwere who's in those offices or what have you.It would basically be something where, you know,you couldn't open the door, you wouldn't go in.So we're sort of visibility now.And one of my I think out of the many predictionsis the re encryption and pseudonymous of the world.And why does that actually matter?Well, it's an intermediatebetween now and getting to Mars. Why?One of thethings Steve Jobs did within Apple is he builthe pushed secrecy, wide secrecy.So you could have multiple teamsthat didn't know about each other,that were working on the same thing, but they wereinnovative since they couldn't copy from each other.Right.And they didn't feel competitive with each otherbecause didn't know about each other.So they weren't memetic. Right?They were decentralized.And Peter Thiel and Girard and so on.Talk about mimesisa lot like basically copying people and you know,mimesis can be good in the sense that that'show you learn language, that's how you learn skills.You're copying other people doing things.Copying isn't always better, but when you look at,you know, many kinds of things that peoplefight over, like famously 54, 40 or fight wasa borderor an almost border war between the US.And you know what, at the time,you know, today we call Canada,it's kind of is actually Canada at the timeor like still British Canada.But 50 or 40 year fightwas that the Americans wantedthe border between the US and the Northern.I think, I said is Canada is like British Canadaor something like that.The antecedent again to to be at the 54thparallel and 40th minute or whateverit is with latitude.It's actually like the 49th parallel.The point is, unless the thing was mapped,people wouldn't even be able to fight oversomething like that.You might say, Well,how could you possibly go away from maps?At one point I'd make in the book iswe can see the Franco-German border, right?That border, you know, the Maginot Line was Bill,people invaded back and forth.It's this huge thing, militarized landmines,all I mean, not any more.But, you know,there were all kinds of crazy stuff happening there.We can see it.People know basically who's on either side.You can go on Google Mapsand you can kind of get a sense are you likebasically a borderline German,a borderline French person. Butwe don't see the Twitter, Facebook border.These gigantic things,which are both individually much bigger than France.Germanyput together, Richard, is like 300 million plus.We're 3 billion.The people who log on to Twitter100% of the time are all the way in Twitter land.People log into Facebook countriesin time over here, but those folks who the twosocial networks compete over who might, let's say,log in to each about 50% of their time online.I'm just using that as one metric.You might have other metrics about the borders.Those people are not known to either party.Right.There's this giant I don't know if it's 50 millionor 10 million or if it's totally disjoint groups.We just don't know what the size of that border is.We also don't to the size of bordergiant Facebook and TikTok.Right.But the other day, actually,you know, somebody pointed outthat, you know, they're actually here.Let me see if I can find thistweet. They pointed out thatFacebook, Instagram wastrying to blockthe TikTok videosfrom being published.I see if I can find this.(Alex) Go for it.(Balaji) Okay.I can't find this time, but point ismade to try to block TikTok videos coming in. Right?Okay, great.We've got a heads up.(Vincent) Do you have more time or?(Balaji) No, no, no. I actually do too.So when we...(Vincent) Maybe as a last givenour audience are kind of builders and peopleand decentralized science and you are kind of likeone of the most successful builders in the world,like having built both in the sciences in crypto,what would you recommend?Kind of like a piece of advicemaybe to people that want to build out.Also like some of the visionsyou describe for this, the world of science.How should approach it?Of course, it's like the best practicesplaybook of how to buildstart ups, etc.,but it might be different for decentralized science.Like how would you in general, justas generally advice for a builder and DeSci.What would you do?(Balaji) I've got a very specific thing builda demonstration of truly reproducible research.Take two statistics, paperswhere one side see the other, okay?And maybe actually use a function from the other.Have them both be on chain,maybe with the data and stuff on our weave.And just show how you did that.That would be a huge breakthrough.This focus on something very specific.Then we've got that proof technological firewhere we can show, here's a paper, here'sanother one.It's like ARPANETsitting like the first packet, right?That first on chain citation as a function callwhere you have composablescience will be a milestone.And I think that's like a very concrete thingthat somebody can build.It's not really that hard to do.It's just kind of figuring outlike how to put the code on chain or on some data.If you want to use Solana or whateverthat somebody find, do it are you one.Point is use some kind ofdecentralized platform to showthat you can get composable science.I can get composable finance.(Alex) Awesome.I think that's just about it for us. Balaji.Appreciate the words, appreciate the time,appreciate the advice at the end there.1729.com thenetworkstate.com for anybodylooking for the buck it's great.Any final words?Are well I'm on Twitter @balajis so follow me thereand if you do build anythingand in truly reproducible researcherssay which is on chain very interested in seeing it.And you're doing things that are like Molecule DAOI'm interested in that too.Thanks. (Vincent) As one last question.That direction, do you have specificlike recommendations for like a book or a resourcelike to dive into like the science like somethingyou would recommend you haven't recommended before?(Balaji) Oh, well, I like thePrinceton Guide to Mathematics.If you ever do have to be in solitary confinement,that is a book to bring with you.That the bench press.It will be okay.All right.And there's a culvert or whatever, right. AndI think we also haveif you just subscribe at thenetworkstate.comI'll be pushing out a bunch of more free contentand chapters that will cover a bunch of these topicsand have more, more references there.(Vincent) Amazing.
