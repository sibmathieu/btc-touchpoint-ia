  "text": "Eminent writer and philosopher, Professor Sir RogerScruton, has for over three decades taughtat institutions on both sides of the Atlantic,including Birkbeck College, Boston University,and more recently, the University of Buckingham.He is an author of over forty books.In his work as a philosopher, he has specializedin aesthetics with particular attention tomusic and architecture.He has written several works of fiction aswell as memoirs and essays on topics of generalinterest.He engages in contemporary political and culturaldebates from the standpoint of a conservativethinker and is well known as a powerful polemicist.He is a fellow of the Royal Society of Literatureand the British Academy.He has been officially honored by the CzechRepublic by the city of Plzeň-- I hope that'sclose-- and by Virginia's general assembly.In 2004, he received the Ingersoll WeaverPrize for Scholarly Letters.In 2015 he published three books, all of whichwere chosen among the people's books of theyear.In 2016, he was recipient of the Polish LechKaczynski foundation's medal of courage andintegrity, was awarded the Italian Mossy Prizefor the culture of wine in recognition ofhis book, \"I Drink, Therefore I Am\" and wasknighted that year in the Queen's birthdayhonor list.We're glad to have with us Professor RogerScruton.As you heard, that was on the verge of becominga list of my sins.I realize that, in this place, I’ve gotto be on my very best behavior, so I shallbegin by thanking the Wheatley Institution,and Richard Williams especially, for invitingme and for thinking about this important questionof what these three great concepts reallyembrace and what they have to do with eachother.Richard Williams got in touch with me saying,“Look.You’re an expert on aesthetics, and we herein the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-daySaints believe in the beautiful, and the good,and the true, but we don’t know how to saywhat we believe.You have been working all your life on this,so you should come and tell us.”All I can say at this point is that, perhapsbecause I’ve been working all my life onthis, I don’t know how to say anything aboutit.Always, I come back to questions, and theonly benefit of having thought about thesequestions for so long is that there’s acertain clarity in asking them, but no furtherclarity in answering them.Now, that shouldn’t depress you, becausein a true philosophical approach to things,it is the clarity of the question, in theend, that really matters.That enables you to fit the subject matterinto your own life and make the decisionsthat you have to make about it.Let me say a few things about art and truthfirst of all.The enlightenment—by which I mean that massof thinking and idea-mongering that beganin the beginning of the 17th century and wenton through the beginning of the 19th—broughtwith it, as I’m sure you know, a certainloss of the religious anchor in everyday life.Maybe in this part of the world, that losswas not felt so much.But of course, there was nobody living inthis part of the world just then.But, there were your ancestors lost somewhereon the way to this place who did, probably,feel a residue of this great movement of ideasthat began in Europe and recognized that thescientific worldview, which had come to thefore with Newton, was posing a certain threatto the more naïve of once religious beliefs.Among educated people (especially in Franceand Britain, and in Germany, too) there wasan attempt to find a rival source of meaningto the religious—to find that rival sourceof meaning in art, because for various reasons,art struck people as having a different statusfrom science.Science was a threat to religion.That’s true, because it was underminingthe old explanation of things in which Godtook such an important place.But, art seemed to represent a different wayof looking at the world from science, onewhich preserved the mystery of things anddidn’t undo the mystery.Since the mystery was so important, why notlook to art as a source of meaning?So, art suddenly became prominent as a humanenterprise, and with it the birth of the subjectof aesthetics—aesthetics being the philosophyof art and the philosophy of beauty.There are three important figures that I mentionthere: Shaftsbury, Baumgarten, and Kant.Shaftsbury was an English philosopher, thirdEarl of Shaftsbury, who was a pupil of JohnLocke (who wrote very influential essays aboutthe role of the beautiful in the formationof the human spirit).Shaftsbury was an educationist and somebodywho felt that it was his duty to draw theattention of his contemporaries to the complexityof human life and to the consolations thatwe find in human life, and beauty is one ofthem.He was very influential, though his theoriesare somewhat all over the place.Baumgarten was the person who invented theword “aesthetics” as a name for a discipline.He wrote a book called Aesthetica, which wasabout the art of poetry.The original word is a Greek word, as I’msure many of you know, for feeling.We have it in our word “anesthetic.”The burden of his book, Aesthetica, was thatpoetry communicates truths about our condition,but communicates them not through abstractthought, but through concrete feeling.Therefore, it’s a different kind of truth,and it has a different role in our lives anda different value for us.He began the whole enterprise of distinguishingthe artistic way of looking at the world fromthe literal-minded and possibly scientificway.Kant, who was much influenced by Baumgarten,took this up and wrote the first systematicwork of aesthetics.These great thinkers raise the question: whatdo we learn from art?Is what we learn from art a kind of truth—atruth that we, perhaps, couldn’t learn fromany other human activity?Well, for a start, art is not one kind ofthing.There is abstract art and representationalart.Abstract art is like music or like abstractpainting, abstract sculpture.It doesn’t actually have a subject matter.That’s the whole point of it.You’re supposed to appreciate it for whatit is in itself, for the harmony of linesand figures, for the ways in which thingsbalance against each other.It’s supposed to attract attention purelyfor its own sake and not for the subject matterthat it represents.Already, that makes it rather difficult tosay exactly what it is that we learn from artAnd then, of course, what about fictions?The realm of art includes things like novels,plays, films, poetry—all of which are aboutthe world in some way, but they don’t giveyou literal truths about the world.They are about fictional worlds, and it requiresan effort of the imagination both to createa fiction and also to appreciate it.When you read a great novel, like Jane Austen’sEmma, it’s not in order to find out aboutsome person called Emma Woodhouse.You know there is no such person.But you do know, nevertheless, that in thecreation of this fiction, Jane Austen hasput some part of herself, and some part ofher deep observations of the human condition.But, there aren’t literal truths about aparticular person’s life.What kind of truths are they?Or, is there another kind of truth?That’s one of the problems that we encounterin this area.Then, there is the problem of the role ofexperience.If you read a poem to yourself, or recitea poem, you know that what matters is thesound of that poem, the structure of it, theway the verse unfolds, the form of it, butnot what it literally says—or, at least,not what it literally says when extractedfrom that form.It is not like a textbook.If you are curious about a nuclear physics,you might pick up a textbook of nuclear physics,read it, and having absorbed it and beingdiligent students, memorized the whole lot,you put it on the shelf.And that’s it.That’s the last time you look at it, becauseyou’ve extracted the information from it.But that’s not the way that people appreciatepoems, is it?It’s not that they extract the informationand then never visit it again.On the contrary, a good poem is one that gainsfrom repetition, even when you know it byheart, and even when it says something thatseems extremely light.Even if it touches with a light touch on therealities of this world, like Robert Frost’s“Stopping By Woods.”It doesn’t say very much, but the form,the rhythm, and the way in which it seemsto touch something deep in you, mean thatyou will want to repeat it, want to go onreading it again and again.One thought, then, is that we don’t actuallygo to art for information.The information content is not the primarything.It’s the experience.But, of course, not all truth is information.We have lots of different ideas of truth.Christ said, famously, “I am the way, theTruth, and the Life.”He didn’t mean “truth” in the sensethat scientists use that word—that he issomehow a true representation of the world—Hemeant something deeper.He meant that you can trust in him; and bytrusting in him, you come to know somethingabout yourself—how far you can go in whateverdirection and with what kind of hope.Perhaps that use of the idea of truth, whichbrings in a notion of trust, is a more importantone for considering art, because we find supportin the person we trust.It’s like that with art as well.In many works of art, we feel that we arein the presence of a genuine spirit.Many people feel this, of course, about theworks of Beethoven, who described his MissaSolemnis, in the preface, as “from the heart. . . to the heart.”What he meant was that this was an utter,sincere outpouring of what he felt, and heexpected the audience to engage with it inthe same spirit, trusting in him to be theguardian of their emotions for the hour-longexperience that he was offering.That kind of an idea of truth is a very differentone from the scientific one, but it stillseems to be an idea of truth.Now, this brings up the topic of desire andpleasure.Huge topic.I have to say that I’m talking here as aprofessional philosopher.I know many people in this audience are studyingother subjects, are simply curious about theintellectual world, and are not used to thinkingin this abstract, philosophical way, so Iapologize.I just hope that I will inspire you to goon and pursue the matter further.There is a connection between desiring somethingand feeling pleasure on obtaining it.If you really want a glass of water, thenupon obtaining that glass and drinking, youfeel pleasure, the pleasure of satisfyinga desire.But it’s not a simple connection, becausewe know that many things that we desire don’tgive us pleasure when we obtain them.This is one of the most important parts ofmoral education: to recognize the differencebetween those things that you desire whichwill bring satisfaction when you obtain them,and those things which you desire which, whenyou taste them, you push them away with revulsion.I won’t go into that, but of course, youmight think that maybe art has something todo with that, too.Maybe it can teach us in advance about thethings which we won’t enjoy when we possessthem.There are many kinds of pleasure.There’s pure sensual pleasure.You sink into a hot bath at the end of theday.This is a pleasure of the senses as the warmthspreads through your body.It doesn’t tell you anything about the world.It’s not based on any kind of thinking,but it’s the kind of pleasure that animals haveBut, we also have intellectual pleasures—pleasureswhich come from thinking things.The pleasure of reading a book is not a sensorypleasure at all, is it?It’s a pleasure of the mind, the pleasureof following an argument, of playing withwords, and so on.And then there’s what I call intentionalpleasures.The word “intentional” means directedoutward onto the world, like the pleasureyou take on somebody’s giving you a present,or the pleasure you take when you go to seeyour child take part in a hundred meter race(or in the long jump or whatever) and yousee in the playing field—there he is!He’s done it!He’s got the first prize!That’s a pleasure about something.When you have a pleasure about something,that means you can make a mistake as well.The race was at the other end of the field,and it looked exactly as though your son hadwon it.Only later do you discover it was someoneelse, a look-alike.So, was your pleasure real, or not?In a sense, it was real, but it was also amistake.So, there are mistaken pleasures, and that’sa very interesting fact.So, pleasures can be at something.I can take a pleasure at the beautiful sceneout of the window.I can take a pleasure about the triumph ofmy son in the long jump and so on.Aesthetic pleasure is of the first kind.It’s pleasure at something.It’s not like pleasures of taste.When you eat a strawberry ice cream and takepleasure in it, that’s a pleasant tastein the mouth.When you look at a profound picture and aremoved by it, that’s not a pleasant feelinganywhere in you, is it?It’s not a sensation of pleasure.You’re pleased at this thing that you’relooking at, and pleased by it, maybe pleasedabout what it’s saying.It’s completely different from a sensorypleasure.There’s a question, therefore, that we mustask: what is the relation between tastes infood and drink, and tastes in music and painting?They’re not the same kind of thing at all.You like strawberries, and I like blueberries.Fine.There’s no real disagreement between us,just different tastes.But, you like Beethoven and I like Heavy Metal.This is a bit more like a disagreement, especiallyif you then go on to say, “Your liking heavymetal is a sign of the degeneracy of yoursoul.”The argument can begin then.It may not be possible to resolve it.But the fact is, in matters of artistic andaesthetic judgment, we do argue, and the argumentsare very important to us.Maybe you don’t think this, because you’renot interested in Beethoven or heavy metal,but there are always going to be areas whereyou are interested.Suppose you live in a little town which hasbeautiful houses and beautiful streets, andyou’re really pleased with it.Your neighborhood is charming and somehowconsoling because of its orderliness.Then, someone puts in a planning applicationfor a huge skyscraper in bright orange tiles.You start getting together with your neighborsto campaign against this.There will be arguments put forward as towho is right and who is wrong.These arguments matter enormously to people.Looking at the architectural mess betweenSalt Lake City and Provo, I suspect that Americansdon’t think about this as much as they should.But, on the other hand, anybody who has beento Europe will recognize that there, peopledo think about these things and argue aboutthem all the time.And, as a result, all sensible tourists don’tspend their holidays here, but in Europe.Anyway, that’s another matter.The great question, then, is: what is thevalue of this kind of pleasure—the pleasurethat we feel in works of art and aestheticobjects?Can it be a vehicle of truth?It’s very interesting that we can feel pleasurein works of art, even when the works of artare sad, or even tragic.We take pleasure in a sad story, because thestory does something to the sadness.The weepy movie may have enormous appeal.You may feel like it hasn’t worked if youhaven’t had a bit of a weep during the courseof it.The sadness is part of what was promised.It’s part of the deal.And yet, it can’t be real sadness, becausenobody voluntarily submits himself to that.It’s something like sadness put in a frame.The story puts it in a frame and makes itsuch that it doesn’t hurt you in the waythat, for instance, the death of someone youlove would hurt you.That framing of our emotions seems to be oneof the things that works of art do for us,isn’t it?We seem to be able to come to terms with thesadness of human life, partly because we canrepresent it in ways that make it more meaningful—framedand isolated.To pleasure, we always say “Come again,”but to knowledge, we say, “Thanks.”Once you’ve obtained the knowledge, that’sit.You’ve got it.The pleasure, you’ve had it once, but youwant it again.Especially in the case of works of art, therepeatability of the pleasure is what it’sall about.But, perhaps there is knowledge in repetition.So, let’s just think about that for a moment.Though, I want to say something about artand virtue first.What is the moral value of art?What kind of moral improvement can art generatein us?Has it got a particular role in presentingthe moral world and improving our own engagementin it?Well, obviously, art is a source of moralexamples, but the work of art does not merelypresent the example.There are lots of examples which prompt youto sketch for yourself ideas of good behaviorand bad behavior.It puts us in a position of judgment.I mention there Henry James’s portrait ofIsabelle Archer (which I’m hoping you youngpeople will be about to read, if you haven’tread it yet) in Portrait of a Lady, in whichHenry James presents to us a good woman whois also naïve and exploited by a cunningand evil man.James doesn’t judge these characters himself.He puts us in a position to make a judgmentand to make the judgment through the eyesof Isabelle Archer.The reader gradually comes to understand hersituation as she comes to understand it.That’s real art.Henry James never says anything.He makes you think it, but think it for yourself.That might have a special moral value, mightn’tit?Rather than just telling you what to think,morally, making you think it for yourselfso that it’s a course of education in theemotions that he’s directed at you.Well, that all looks quite plausible for fictionand for representational art, but what aboutabstract art?People think that abstract art—art whichdoesn’t have a representational content—canalso have some kind of moral value.That’s what Beethoven was saying about hisMissa Solemnis—and what many people sayabout music generally—that it is tellingus something about our emotions by leadingus to feel secondhand, so to speak, what thoseemotions are.There’s a kind of emotional education goingon there, too.But then, there are real problems, and thisis one that Richard Williams wanted me totalk about.It’s a very difficult one to talk about.What happens when you encounter a work ofart that presents vice, but aestheticallyin such a way as to make the vice attractive?I take the example here of Salome.Here is the problem, as you remember, of Salome,the story of the daughter of Herodias whodanced before the king.She coveted the head of John the Baptist (perhapsbecause her mother had put her up to it),and had finally persuaded the king to giveit to her.In other words, she had persuaded the kingto kill the prophet that he had been reluctantto kill up to that moment because of his manifestholiness.This was made into a play by Oscar Wilde,a rather clever play, and then that was setto music by Ricard Strauss.His music is full of a distraught lasciviousness,but it’s very beautiful and seductive.I won’t play it to you.I’ll leave it to you to encounter it.It’s all over YouTube, of course.This music kind of brings you to Salome’sside.You feel that somehow she’s in the gripof an emotion that she can’t deal with.She’s got to satisfy it, but as representedby Strauss and Oscar Wilde, Salome goes thewhole hog and takes hold of the head and kissesit.Here’s the kind of thing that you see inmodern opera productions.Modern opera productions are designed especiallyto be offensive to members of the Church ofthe Latter Day Saints, so don’t worry.They’re usually much worse than this, buthere is Salome, having sung her incredibleAria of sensual ecstasy over the severed headof John the Baptist, seizing it and kissingit in this unacceptable way.Well, most people would feel that’s goingtoo far, and perhaps people did think thatit was going too far.This opera did have quite a bit of troublein its early life, but now it’s part ofthe repertoire.And yet, it seems to take a kind of ghoulishpleasure in artily perverted behavior, andthe music seems to put that behavior in akind of enchanting light, because the musicis drawing you in all the time.You find similar things in other works ofart of the mid-to-late 19th century, art thatrescues evil by making it seem beautiful.Baudelaire’s Fleur Du Mal (which I’m suresome of you who’re doing French here willbe reading and studying) is a very good exampleof this.He takes the excesses and the degeneraciesof life in a modern city and looks for a meaningthat lies concealed within them.He does this through incredibly powerful imageryand beautiful verse forms that make it lookas though there is a spiritual meaning behindall this that redeems it.The spiritual is revealed, even though whatis described denies the possibility of thespiritual.It’s as though, by denying things in theright way, we can affirm them.I think that’s what Baudelaire himself thought,and often people have described him as a Christianpoet, precisely for this: he rescues fromthe heart of corruption and despair that littlegerm of spiritual purity which lies in theimagery of his verse and which we take awayand then make to grow within us.I’m not sure if that is true, but it’san interesting thought.In Shakespeare, of course, there’s a lotof evil—the evil of the character of Iagoin Othello, for example, and also Macbeth,who is a self-doubting evil man.But, it’s straightforward.Shakespeare doesn’t expect you to be ontheir side in any way.He certainly doesn’t do a Salome on them,although at a certain point, there is a lotof sympathy for Macbeth.Milton’s Satan in Paradise Lost is anothervery important example of an evil characterwho is so portrayed by the verse that youcannot fail to be on his side.His wounded pride is something you immediatelyidentify with, and you come to see that there’sa kind of nobility about it.This is what the verse is doing.Is this immoral verse, therefore, that’sbringing you to the side of Satan?Blake, in his illustrations for Paradise Lost,seems to think that.So, there are some other examples that I giveyou there: Claggart, the Bosun in Herman Mellville’sTale of Billy Budd (another one that you’reprobably about to read), sexed and made intoa brilliant opera by Benjamin Britten.Then there’s Dimitri in The Brothers Karamazov,by Dostoevsky.What do we think about him?Is he just confused, or are we being, again,brought into the world of a character whois unable to make moral judgments for himself?Are we also, perhaps, confused about whetherwe can make those judgments?One of the questions that will arise hereis: what is the distinction between moralart and moralizing art?Here is a piece of Russian revolutionary artfrom the 1917 revolution, which is manifestlymoralizing.It’s telling you that these people are obviouslymistreated.So what?Is it saying anything that helps you to understandthat mistreatment, or to take a differentstance towards it?Or, is it just like a moral tale, just anillustration to something else?Many people feel that art shouldn’t moralizeas directly as this.It’s too crude.It should be more like Henry James in ThePortrait of a Lady, making you do the moralizingrather than doing the moralizing itself.Well, that may be so, but let’s go on.I want to say a little bit about beauty now.I’ve said some things about art’s relationto truth, something about its relation to goodnessIn both cases, it’s extremely complicated.It seems that there’s nothing simple thatyou can say.What about beauty?There’s a certain kind of habit that arose,especially in the late 19th century, connectedwith people like Oscar Wilde of putting aestheticvalues first, saying that these are the thingsthat matter.Wilde famously said, “In matters of graveimportance, style, not sincerity, is the vital thing.\"And he lived his life, or at least pretendedto live his life, as though that were hisguiding principle: to be elegant and soothingto the eye and to ignore all those simple,old-fashioned moral values which got in theway of that.But in his works of art, he didn’t thinkthat.To put aesthetic values first is, or mightbe, a kind of immoralism.Osmond, who is the husband of Isabella Archerin The Portrait of a Lady, is somebody whoreally does put aesthetic values first, andhis delight in collecting beautiful thingsand living this aesthetic way of life hasled him to great pecuniary need.He needs money, and she has money, so he marriesher in order to get ahold of that money, andalso in order to collect her.She was beautiful, too, so he collects heras a beautiful object, but doesn’t love her.Oscar Wilde does a slightly cruder versionof the same idea in the character of LordHenry Wotton in The Picture of Dorian Gray.There are two sides to the aesthetic experience.There’s the kind of relishing side, andthe exploring side.Relishing a beautiful work of art or a sublimework of music is something that you can dowithout necessarily exploring the depths ofthe human heart, even though the work of arttouches on them.And, perhaps, this kind of aestheticism meansforgetting the cognitive dimension of aestheticpleasures and realizing that they’re notjust sensory pleasures.They’re not just pleasures in the way youexperience things.They’re also directed toward a vision ofthe world.Each of those goals that I’ve talked about—truthand goodness and beauty—is important becausethey are what you’re focusing on, but theyseem to reduce art itself to an inadequatemeans.They seem to leave out the aesthetic dimension.Only when combined in a unity do these values—thekind of truth and the kind of goodness ofwhich beauty is the sign—mark out a pathfor art.If beauty is the way in which truth is presented,the way in which goodness comes to your consciousness,then we seem to have something like an accountof the value of art.There’s also a question here about meaningand form.The meaning of a work of art—and this goesback to Baumgarten—lies in the form andis not really detachable from it.If you try to translate a poem into straightprose, say what it means, and give its equivalentin simple language, then you lose the meaning.The meaning is not just what it says; it alsoresides in the form and is not detachablefrom that.This is a little bit like religion and revealedtruth.In much religion, there’s a promise of anotherway of seeing the world, what we might calla God’s-eye perspective.It’s not just that there are theologicaldoctrines, such as: God exists, Christ isthe son of God, etc., although those are importantto the Christian religion.There is also revealed truth when you meditateon these things, and suddenly you see theworld in another way, as though from God’sperspective.Perhaps in those circumstances, the form ofthe language that you’re studying in a sacredtext, for instance, is very important, justas it is in poetry.That’s why those great texts have been preserved,not just for what they say but for their wayof saying it.And again, in religion, as in art, repetitionis very important.You repeat the service every week.You say the Lord’s Prayer every day.If somebody said to you, “What a waste oftime.You’ve said it once.Why say it again?You know what it means.You know the words.What’s all this about?”You know that that’s not what prayer isfor.Prayer is about putting you back into therelation with God that you’re constantlyslipping out of.Therefore, it demands repetition.And there are truths that have to be rehearsedif they are to be owned and in order for youto know exactly how to feel something andwhat to feel towards the world around you.You might feel you know it one moment, butyou’ve lost it the next.And getting the right words helps you to recaptureit.That idea of revealed truth that comes toyou through repetition (as in prayer) is abit like the aesthetic experience as I’vebeen describing it.Perhaps it gives you a secular version ofrevealed truth.That’s what people like Nietzsche and Wagnerthought.They went further and thought that, actually,art could therefore be a substitute for religion.That’s what we really should be now devotingourselves to.We have art, as Nietzsche says, so as notto die of despair.Art is still there, giving us this meaning,even when we’ve lost faith.Finally, some thoughts about the intrinsicvalues of art.Poetry and plays and paintings present imaginaryworlds.Representational art gives us an opening ontothe world of the imagination, and they allrescue their subject matter from a purelyinstrumental conception of its significance.Things portrayed in art are not portrayedas useful.They’re portrayed as interesting for theirown sake.They’re rescued from the instrumentality.That’s why every allusion matters; the imageis a distillation of the thing depicted.Poetry and painting work in the same way.Here is a landscape by Van Gogh, which everybodyknows, probably.The brush strokes there imbue the landscapewith an observing consciousness.They are marks of the moral being for whomthis is not a thing, but a vision.To absorb that, you recognize that it’sa very long way from the way a field of wheatwith a flock of rooks above it would look.This doesn’t look in any way realistic,but somehow it has a power that it wouldn’thave if it were wholly realistic, becausethe brush strokes of the painter imbue thatlandscape with his own soul.It’s as though the imagination of the painterhad reworked the thing that he’s paintingso that it isn’t just the thing.It’s also that thing distilled into hisown consciousness.In the imagination, we are thinking aboutabsent and nonexistent things, but the consciousnessinvolved is a creator of its own object, asin that case of Van Gogh.The imagination is something that we can will.I can ask you to imagine some things.I can say, “Imagine a field of wheat.”You won’t be able to imagine it like VanGogh did, but nevertheless, you will summonit up in obedience to that order.That is an interesting thing.Through works of the imagination, we bringdistant things into close relation with each other.That’s what we do in figures of speech,in poetry.We’re bringing things into relation witheach other.The brush strokes in the painting bring ahuman action into relation with a landscape.These imaginary worlds that we create canstrike us as true, or as false, and I wantto contrast that Van Gogh with a paintingby Thomas Kinkade.This is one of his visions of paradise.This is a controversial painter, as you know.Van Gogh died in poverty.Kinkade died leaving $53 million, and diedof drink.I think 1 in 10 Americans have a Kinkade abovetheir mantelpiece, because it’s a soothing thing.For some people, this is a vision of whatpainting should be.It’s much truer to the appearance of thingsthan Van Gogh, but there’s a question about it.What is that question?Many people would say there’s a falsificationbehind this painting.I don’t want to cast judgment on it, butjust say a few things about it.Why does this strike so many people as false?In one sense, it’s truer than the Van Gogh.It’s closer to the way things actually look.But the falsification, if it exists, is thefalsification of the observer rather thanof the observed.It shows a world presented through a veilof self-congratulatory sentiment.That’s at least what the critic would say.It tells you that you’re a good person andno further efforts need to be made.Van Gogh is not telling you that at all.He’s telling you that life is rough, andyou need to make efforts even to see this.It tells you that further efforts need bemade, and that meaning lies in the forms and colors.There are pastel shades smeared over the landscapelike a disease.Well, is that right?I’ll leave it to you to think.But, this brings us back to the parallel betweenart and religion.Religion provides us with truth, but it’snot just straightforward, literal truth aboutthe way the world is.There are all sorts of things that we believe,but there’s a much more important dimension to it.A spiritual truth tells us how things reallyare for us and what our position really isin the world of human relations and humanemotions.In religion, we recognize that there’s noredemption through falsehood, and the sameseems to be true of art.That’s what those two pictures, I think,lead us to suppose.Art, too, has its own way of presenting thespiritual truth of things, and if it falsifies,then it doesn’t produce the kind of redemptiveconsolation that we’re looking for.This might explain sadness in the works ofart.It might explain tragedy.In tragedy, you go to the depths, but youfind a kind of rescue there.Only if you go to those depths, however, willyou be rescued.Enjoying sadness for its own sake, in justa sentimental and pretense of grief, is notgoing to help, but in actually going to thefull encounter with mortality and what itmeans, as in a real tragedy, maybe there isa help.Maybe that does take us to a point where wecan learn something that we need to learn,and learn it in our hearts and in our emotions,learn to bear this thing.Perhaps that is why we want to go to tragediesagain and again.So, art is certainly not going to be any helpto us if it loses sight of what we are andwhat we need.And we do recognize that there is a distinctionbetween true and false emotion.False emotion comes about when the ”I”eclipses the “you.”Most real love is about you, the other.Sentimental love pretends to be about you,but it’s really about me—me feeling thiswonderful thing and showing thereby my moraldistinction.We find that kind of sentimentality in art,and also we find art which challenges thatsentimentality.Thomas Kinkade is all about me being a lovelyperson, whereas Van Gogh is all about the“you” that appears to him, even in a fieldof wheat—because, of course, that’s Godwho’s appearing to him.As I go back to what I said about Henry James,remember that real art doesn’t judge; itopens the world to judgment and inspires that judgment in us.I wanted to finish with some difficult examples.In The Brothers Karamazov (another book thatyou might be on the verge of reading, or onthe verge of not bothering to read) Dostoevskydoesn’t judge.He invites us to judge in his stead, but whathe’s inviting us to judge is a whole communityof people who don’t judge, but just do inthe most horrifying way.And this is a very challenging book.Dickens, in The Old Curiosity Shop, the deathof little Nell lays it on with a trowel.They’re trying to make us weep over thedeath of this innocent little girl who’sforgiving everybody for dying before her time,and it’s not only unrealistic and implausible,but real schmaltz.Oscar Wilde famously said about this, “Aman must have a heart of stone not to laughat the death of little Nell.”Which is a brilliant way of summarizing it.Salome, though, is a realization in imaginedform of a grim state of mind—a really horriblestate of mind—but realized without any negativejudgment.That’s the great problem: this is musicof sublime power which simply happens to havebeen applied to this horrible situation.Strauss was able to do that.He once said that, “If you gave me a railwaytime table, I’d set it to the most beautifulmusic.”Is this a fault?Again, just to conclude, to get you to comparetwo portrayals of the crucifixion.Grunewald, is the famous Isenheim Alter Piecein Germany, gives a hyper realistic portrayalof the horror of the crucifixion, such thatnobody can say that he’s denying the realityof this or that he’s turning away, or falsifying.There’s no falsification.But, somehow it leaves you without hope.It’s as though it really is just that: thedeath and destruction of a person.Whereas, in Tintoretto’s case, you see themost extraordinary sequence of events in which,actually, not just of the resurrection ofChrist, but the redemption of mankind is foretoldin every detail of the painting.And this, therefore, is not a horrifying paintingat all, but a consoling one, and one in whichyou see just why it is that Christ had tobe sacrificed.From Grunewald, you don’t know why it is.It’s just yet another inexplicable and horrifyingaccident of human degenerate life.Those are two examples that you might takeaway to think about, and I think I’ve goneon for long enough now.I can invite some questions.Thank you.We'd invite you, please, to use the microphone. We have a few minutes for questions. Then, Dr. Scruton hasagreed to autograph some books. They are available for purchase. If you'd like, he'll be there for a few minutesand would be happy to sign some for you as soon as the Q&A is over.We'll go about 10 or 15 minutes.Q&AQuestion: Myquestion is this: I have a dilemma as a listenerto music, or other art forms, when I knowthat this particular artist is, perhaps, livinga life of dissipation, or is immoral in someway, and yet the art they’re creating seemsto be an art full of light.Is that my difficulty that I’m not seeingthe dissipation in their art?Is that something that I should be judgingor listing to that?Scruton: You can live an immoral life, andas it were, compensate for it by putting allthe virtue that you fail to have into yourworks of art.And this is not unusual, actually.Quite a lot of the romantic artists were likethat.Schubert led a fairly dissolute life, butyou won’t hear any of it in his music.You’ll hear tragedy and pain and suffering,but also the pure love of the human condition.So, there isn’t any reason to think thisis not possible.One of the problems these days is that weknow too much about artists, and they do tendto live in a slightly wild way.Not all of them, but there are very few greatartists whom one can imagine living a respectable,middle class, married life with 2.5 childrenand dressed in a three-piece suit every day.It just doesn’t seem to work that way, butthere were some in the past.They weren’t necessarily the best.Question: So, divorce the art from the artist?Scruton: Yeah.I think that, in the literature on this, thereare quite a few people who write about thingscalled the intentional fallacy.It’s a fallacy to think that works of arthave to be understood in terms of the intentionof the artist.And there are others who write about the deathof the author: the author disappears behindhis work.All we have is his work.Dostoevsky was a completely degenerate character,but his novels are imbued with the highestkind of Christian orthodoxy.Question: I’m curious more about what youwere saying on aesthetics, and specificallywhen you talked about relishing vs. exploring.What I interpreted that to mean was relishingin the style or the specific manner of theart and then allowing yourself not to be confinedto that.Is that what you meant, or is there somethingmore?Scruton: I meant that there are two differentattitudes to art.The first is the attitude of the connoisseur,who wants to experience new things and evermorerefined emotions and enjoys those emotionsfor their own sake, and regards himself assomehow a kind of virtuoso of feeling.There is that response, which is sort of theaestheticist response, and then there’sthe response of somebody who sees the workof art as a means of exploring the world,something that’s taking him on an adventureinto knowledge and into the moral reality,which is a more healthy attitude.That’s all I wanted to say.Question: Okay, and you’re saying they needto be merged together?Scruton: Well, both are there, but the questionis: which are you going to emphasize?The emphasizing of the relishing can leadto this kind of narcissistic concentrationon the self.Question: My question is, basically, thatwe have a lot of art that is great and wonderfulart, but has been tarnished not by the artist’srepresentation himself, but by society.Certain pieces of art, such as the operasof Wagner (or some of the less politicallycorrect works of Gilbert and Sullivan, orother artists in all different medias) havebeen tarnished, not because of who these artistswere (well, maybe somewhat in the case ofWagner) but because society has deemed thesepieces of art “immoral” based on how theyare used or how they are viewed in the lightof today’s society.What are your thoughts on that, and how oughtwe to respond to that kind of art today?Scruton: Well, of course what you mean isthat works of art can pick up bad associationsthrough their use, and it’s not very differentfrom what the first question was about.Does this affect the intrinsic value of thework of art, or is it just an extraneous thing?We all know, in the case of Wagner, that hewas tainted with the brush of anti-Semitism,and that was his fault.He certainly was anti-Semitic.He wrote the most horrible things about theJews, but he wrote them a hundred years beforeHitler without envisaging anything like that.But the Nazis took a serious interest in hisoperas and always presented them as thoughthey were celebrations of the Nazi ideal ofthe Arian race.And this did lead to many people being totallyput off them and thinking that they can onlybe used in that way because there is somethingin them that lends them to that use.That’s one of the great questions for Wagnerlovers: can you rescue his works from thataccusation?This is an important question for me, becauseI just tried to do this with a book I’vejust written on \"The Ring of the Nibelung,\"which, at least in my view, does rescue Wagner.Question: I’m glad that someone’s goingto rescue Wagner, because I love Wagner’sRings.Scruton: Well, there you are.You’re on the right lines.All you have to do now is save up and buythis book.Question: Poor college student in Provo.Probably couldn’t afford it.Question: What’s the most beautiful color, objectively?Scruton: The most beautiful color, objectively,is the pale violet used by Tiepolo in paintingthe lips of degenerate women.Question: What’s the most truthful one?Scruton: I think that one is equally truthful.Question: Back to the Kinkade and the VanGogh.Between the two of them, I think I’ll takehome the Van Gogh.I think I’m with you on that, and my responseto the Kinkade that you presented, when Isaw it, was a kind of revulsion.I’m kind of perplexed, though, by a pangof sympathy that I imagine myself feelingfor someone who might look at the Kinkade(which I would say “Kitschy” is what Iwould call that).I can imagine someone of religious sensibility,maybe not my kind of religious sensibility,looking at the Kinkade and feeling a kindof genuine moral edification from a picturethat I would call kitschy, and I’m curiousabout my own reluctance to dismiss it entirelyout of hand for that reason.Scruton: This is a very important observation.Of course, the natural description of it is“kitsch”, but it’s a very difficultconcept to define, or to put your finger onexactly what’s wrong with it.It is even more difficult to put your fingeron what’s wrong with the person who loveskitsch.Maybe there’s nothing wrong with that personat all; it’s just that he or she has notaste in art.But it doesn’t follow that his religiousemotions directed towards the Kinkade, forthat reason, are false.And this is the real question.There’s a very beautiful story by JamesJoyce called “The Dead,” which is thelast story in Dubliners (another book thatthe young people are about to read), in whichhe describes a reunion of people whose emotionsare all wrapped up with sentimental songsand weak little memories of the past, butthere’s a real regret and a real love in thereThey are directing all their emotions throughkitsch objects and kitsch language, and yetthe story itself is completely redeemed fromkitsch.It’s about kitsch, but not itself kitsch.That’s a very interesting revelation, becauseit’s a forgiving story which shows that,indeed, people can latch their emotions ontothese unworthy objects, and that we who seekto see through them are maybe actually notsuch good people as the people who love thosethings.Question: The sort of corollary would be akind of malicious judgment that I might seeon someone that I see in a European museumwith their guidebooks, knowledgeably scrutinizinga religious painting that I suspect meansas little to them as an irreligious painting,however aesthetically formed it may be.Scruton: Yes, but in the end we do want thecontent of a religious painting—the religiouscontent—to somehow match the aesthetic experience.The Tintoretto isn’t just a beautiful painting.It’s a triumph of religious thinking, aswell.Question: I loved what you had to say aboutrepetition and prayer, that “truth mustbe rehearsed if it is to be owned, knowingwhat to feel” and that prayer puts you backinto the relation you are constantly slippingout of.My question is two-fold: what would you sayabout the role of imagination in prayer?And then: what would you say—because, onthe one hand I completely agree with you aboutthe importance and primacy of form in prayer—butwhat would you say to people who suspect thatform becomes rote and belies sincerity?Scruton: Form becomes rote?Question: Yes, that somehow form could takeaway from the sincerity that we are striving for.Scruton: Yes.It’s difficult.There’s a famous Victorian hymn that begins“teach us how to pray aright” We all lackwords with which to pray for the simple reasonof the huge distance between us and the object,and that distance can be overcome just likethat with the right words.All religions have those basic, rote-learnedprayers which help the people to overcomethe distance—something like the Hail Mary.Every Catholic is able to put himself immediatelyin the presence of God with that prayer.Or the Hear, O Israel of the Jews, and soon.We need also to make our particular requestsand establish our particular relation withGod, and there imagination is important.But, on the other hand, it’s a little bitlike the Kinkade example, again.We might just end up uttering total platitudesand clichés.God must think to himself, “I’ve heardall that so many times, and I gave you thisreally good prayer.Why don’t you say that?”There are real questions as to how to go forwardwith the imagination and how to go forwardsafely, really, and I think that’s one reasonwhy religious poetry is so beautiful to us.Someone like George Herbert gives us new prayersof his own which also correspond to bits ofus which haven’t been put into the languageof prayer before.I think that’s all I can say, though.Question: I’m hoping to major in communications,and I’m fascinated by how you speak of theimportance of ruminating over art and allowingit to teach us different truths.I feel like in the world today (especiallymy generation—the “I” generation asthey say—the social media generation), itseems to be more focused on rapidity of sharinginformation and less on reflection.It’s more about who can get what out first.I guess my question is: as a man who has spenthis entire life studying aesthetics and appreciatingart, what would you say to someone in my shoeswho finds themselves in this world that seemsto discourage this type of artistic reflection?Scruton: This is a very important question.My own children have this question, obviously,as they’re slightly younger than you.There are two things to say: one is that,of course, social media has changed the natureof communication, because it’s taken awaythe filters through which people communicated.When I was young, to communicate somethingreally important (like your love for someone)you would write a letter.There would be lots of crossings out, andthen you would do another version.The written word filters out all the clichésand all the nonsense, and eventually, if you’relucky, you got something that she can keepand treasure.Or, if you’re not lucky, to throw away.That’s the kind of filter that forces youto improve what you’re saying to the pointwhere you, yourself are conscious of whatyou’re saying.As you know from Twitter (I said I wouldn’trefer to Trump, but this is such an obviousexample), there you can just throw out intothe world half-formed thoughts in which allyour incompetence and illiteracy are perpetuated.Should you do that?Maybe that’s the way things will be.But if you’re studying communications, whatyou should be addressing is the question ofwhether you can keep the value of these immediatecommunications—of Twitter and Facebook andso on—and gradually improve the form.Can you introduce a filter?The only filter on Twitter is the number ofcharacters, but on Facebook you could perhapsstart a movement whereby people learn howto despise the badly arranged wall and theilliterate words and so on.Introduce criticism into social media.That might be a step forward.I admit, it won’t get you to the point whereT.S.Eliot might have joined Facebook.Alternatively, of course, there is the possibilityof not using social media at all.There is a real question then of whether yougain from that or lose.You certainly gain a better quality of contactsbut far less quantity, and for many youngpeople, that’s the problem.It’s the quantity of contacts and the immediacyof the relations with them which is reallythe temptation.I don’t really have anything to say thatwould give you a cause for hope.This social media is now with us, and that’sthe way we’re going to be governed, it seems,as well as the way in which we establish relationswith each other.Maybe in the end, there’ll be small communitiesof savages who don’t use these things, likeme, but our circle of acquaintances will getsmaller and smaller until we can all be containedin one museum.",
