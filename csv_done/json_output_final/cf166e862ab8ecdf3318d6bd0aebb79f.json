terencekeeleyprofessor keeley is the author of theeconomic laws of scientific researchin 1996and then sex science and profits in 2010and breakfast is a dangerous meal whyyou should ditch your morning meal forhealthy for health and well-being in2016.professor keeley's bookthe economic laws of scientific researchwas particularly influential onmyintellectual development as well as mycareer i read it when i was in graduateschoolabout 13 14 years ago and itfundamentally transformed the way that ithought about economics and researchand it helped mebecome more friendly to free marketideas and ideas ofhoweconomic systems function without theneed for central planning and that ledme down the path of studying austrianeconomics which later on was enormouslyimportant in my ability to understandbitcoin and then write about bitcoin andbecomeeventually leaving my uh career inacademiaand uh working independently in uhproducing a bitcoin research and bitcoinpodcast and teaching economics on myuniversityas an independent scholar running abusinessonline rather than working at auniversityand i thinka lot of that was down towhat professor keeley taught me aboutthe way thatscientific research works and theeconomics of scientific fake research soi'm very pleased today to welcomeprofessor keeley here thank youprofessor for joining usthank you that was a very excitingintroduction i'm delightedwhat you said is a story that's veryexciting for me so thank youthank you so much soi think the umthe focus of our discussion today is uhprobably going to be on the economiclaws of scientific research so could youtell us a little bit about that book andwhat drove you to write it andwhat are the main arguments of itthank youwell what drove me to write itwas i was a biochemist in britainworking at the benchin the 1980s when mrs thatcher who wasthen a very radical prime ministercutin the small way the government fundingof science and she did so becausebritainthe british government funded morescience per capita than any othercountry in the world and yet the britisheconomy in the late 70s early 80s wasdoing so badly and so she said clearlyif the british government is fundingmore scienceper gdp per capita than other westerncountries and yet we're falling so farbehindit can't be as important as everybodysaidwell what struck me was the consequencesof her cutting a very modest cutting bythe way but the british scientificcommunity erupted in rage and veryquickly started producing statisticsshowing how british science was beingdestroyed by mrs thatcherbut the problem with those arguments isthat i was a scientist both at oxfordand then later at newcastle and myexperience was in both universitiesthat in thatcher's timethe pressure to grow was incredible wewere getting more scientists in the labevery year we were building more labsevery year and we were getting moremoney every year and yet at the sametime the scientists both in oxfordnewcastle were going out saying thatbritish science was collapsing and wheni challenged them i got a veryinteresting story from the oxfordscientists i was told you don'tunderstand oxford cambridge and londonare being protected by mrs fletcher butthe rest of the country is a desert andas in newcastle they that you don'tunderstandfor electoral reasons mrs thatcher isprotecting the provinces but the heartof british science also cambridge londonis a desertand that was the first time i realizedan entire scientific community can justsay something that's simply not trueand so then i find started to find outwhat the truth wasand the truth comes down to a veryinteresting phenomenon which is veryrarely talked about it's called crowdingoutand what that phenomenon means is thatwhen the government funds somethingit crowds out its private funding so forexample if the government supplies allthe schools for freepeople do not send their children toschool and pay for it because thegovernment is providing it for free andall the four payment schools closeand it was the same in british sciencewhat i discovered it wasn't hard todiscover but it was as if no one elsewanted to discover what i discovered wasthat when the british government undermrs thatcher cut funding for universityscience quite modestly but it did cut itthe growth in the private funding ofuniversity science both in charities andcompaniesmore than doubled i for every pound thebritish government took away from theuniversities the private sector isputting in more than two pounds so whati discovered was that as the britishgovernment pulled out of fundinguniversities in britain the privatesector more than compensated and yet thebritish scientists in an extraordinaryact of collective blindness hadn't seenthat and i thought that was veryinterestingyeah i think that's very interesting tooand i'd add umi thinkthe particular uh the particularly mostinteresting part perhaps of your book isthe historical analysis that uhlooks deep into the history of theindustrial revolution and the nature ofgovernment funding of science there soonepretty amazing uh fact which doesn't getmentionedmany places other than in your bookis there is the fact that britain wasone of the very few places in the worldthat did not fund science orspecifically one of the places in europethat did not have public funding forscience during the time of theindustrial revolution and that doesn'tseem to have uhhampered industrial progress muchhas itwell it's even more dramatic than thatuh let me just show you something ibrought this bookjust to show you it's called the powerof creative destructionuh theprime author is philippe agile who's afrench professor of economics verydistinguishedthis was reviewed in the wall streetjournal the financial times theeconomistit came out only a few weeks agoandat its launchthere was an international conferenceof foot lasting four daysover a hundredeconomists spoke eleven of them werenobel prize winners one of them wasemmanuel macron the president of francehow many book launches get a country'spresident alongand yet what philip angel says in thisbookis that it is impossible toindustrialize without the governmentfunding of science it is inconceivablehe says that the state could take offeconomically unless the government fundsscienceand it is extraordinary that such ahistorical misconception could bewritten today in 2021 becauseyou're absolutely right the one countryin europe where the government did notfund science was britainand that and that's actually why therewas an industrial revolution becausebritain was what they call a nightwatchman state the british state didessentially nothing but run the policeforce and not even very efficiently bythe way but the result is that no onehad captured the stateand so taxes were very very lowpeople were free to do what they wantedwhereas in france and germanyhuge taxes people were not free to dowhat they wanted because they weren'tparticularly free citizens and thosecompanies and those intereststhat were already established doingwhatever it wasthat were threatened by innovation wereable to use the power of the crown tostop innovation it was because britainwas the night watch that state oflaissez-faire state that between about1790 to 1890 it created the britishindustrial revolution which was theworld's first and what's reallyinteresting is the world's secondindustrial revolution was the unitedstates of america and from 1890 to thepresent day the united states americahas been the richest most successfulcountry in the world but the americangovernment did not start funding scienceuntil 1950 so between 1890 and 1950 theamerica was the richest mosttechnologically developed country in theworldactively no government funding thescience and so the two greatindustrial nations first britain andthen america became industrial becausethe government left the economy aloneand that is the most important lessonthat the history teaches and yetthe major teachers of scientificeconomics today to this daypropagate a story that's just incorrectit is an extraordinary phenomenonyeah it's absolutely amazing um and andthe complete ability to ignore the uhevidenceofjustthe lack of scientific uh funding forgovernment funding for science that wentinto the industrial revolution is alsoamazing i mean if you think about itthe most important things that gave usthe industrial revolution probably thesteam engineand the you know the proto steam enginesthat existed before ityou discussed the evolution of all ofthese during the industrial revolutionand it was people out there in workshopsinnovating and coming up with moreefficient ways of doing things overdecades and centuriesthat gave us the um engine and it wasn'tthese um you knowwe later developed theories to study thethermodynamics involvedbut it was not the thermodynamics thatgave us the steam engineabsolutely not you're absolutely rightit was surprisingly ill-educatedsometimes even near illiterateworkmenplaying with machines that wereessentially developed to pump water outof coal mines and tin mines and theywere basicallyplaying with the technology in theirvery isolated communitiesthere must have been an awareness ofwhat was going on in gas science inlondon and in france and in thenetherlands but essentially these weremen all men i'm not being sexist herejust was all men these were men workingin their workshops improving the toolsthat inherited from their fathersand through trial and error in theabsence of academic science creating theindustrial revolution the industrialrevolution in britain owed nothing toscience it was absolutely all in theworkshop as adam smith explained veryclearly in 1776 in his book the wealthof nations he he of course observed theearly part of the industrial revolutionand he said look it's got nothing to dowith universities and nothing to do withscience these are men again i'm notbeing sexist it's just how it was inthose days these are men in theirworkshops improving technology throughcommon sense and creativity and trialand errorand that's how we got an industrialrevolution and it is extraordinary thestoryis completely forgotten now but i cantell you why it's forgotten would youwould you like me to tell you how theerrorgrewpleaseit all happened funnily enough in theunited states of americaand the united states of america is thedominant powereverything that happens in america therest of us copy that's just how theworld isandwhat happened in americaessentially was sputnik before 1957the american government there was asmall amount of funding for the nationalscience foundation but it wasn't veryimportant and in any way it failed i icould go into that but i'll leave thatfor one side there was a small amount offunding but it was largely nominal theamerican government didn't essentiallyfund science until 1957 but in 1957the russians launched sputnik and it'svery hard to believe they're hard tounderstand nowbut the crisis of terror this cause inamericawell you brought if you you got to readthe literature of the time but theamericans really believed that russiawas going to destroy them by droppingnuclear bombs on them from spaceand then of course it wasn't justsputnik which was the first artificialsatellite then the russians put thefirst animal into space it was a dogthen the russians put a first human intospace yuri gagarin and the americansfelt that they had lost the space raceand the danger wasas i said that russia would destroyamerica from spaceand so americaunder john kennedy of course createdthis huge desire to go to the moon firstbut in 1958 and this is the key date in1958 before kennedy on brightonin 1958 the americans produced darpawhich is defense advanced researchprojects uhagencynasa again 1958 and also the defenseeducation act this was pouringgovernment funds into science whichcreated a problem and the problem wasthisthis meant that america was acceptingthat the russian soviet systemseemed to be more efficient than theamerican free enterprise capitalistsystem and that was very difficult foramerica to accept and soan organization called rand the randcorporationemployed two economists ken arrow andrichard nelsonand basically charged them withinventing an economic model whichbasically said the free market isbest but it depends on the governmentfunding of science only the governmentfunding of science other than that ithas to be the free market and that'swhat richard nelson and ken arrow didbut they did it i'm afraidin ways that are simply intellectuallynot acceptableeconomists have two sorts of market andherepeople have to understand something veryvery importanteconomics is not intuitivethe science of economics is completelyalien to normal peopleand this makes it very very difficultfor societyto judge what economists are sayingso economists believe in two sorts ofmarket classically competitive marketand no classically competitive marketsclassically competitive markets are themarkets we all understand the marketsthat adam smith described or davidricardo classical markets are companiescompeting with each otherbut neoclassicalmarkets are the ones that economistsinvented around 1890 1900and it's a very interesting exercise intheir classical market you have aninfinite number of companies and aninfinite number of producers and aninfinite number of consumers and aninfinite number of products all of whichare interchangeable and knowledge isshared there is there are no companysecrets in this mythical market and it'scompletely mythical certain thingshappen and certain things don't happenof course they don't because it's a mythone of the things that doesn't happen ina neoclassicalcompetitive market is research it's veryeasy to show why that should be we don'thave to get into that but what richardnelson and ken arrow said look they saidthe most competitive market of all is aneoclassically competitive market wehave all these companies competing withall these consumers what could be morecompetitive than a neoclassical marketbut research doesn't happen in anair-classical market thereforegovernments have to fund it and because99.99of people don't know how to read aneconomics paper everyone said finallyken arrows keno won a nobel prize by theway canara and richard nelson haveprovedeconomically that governments have tofund science because the morecompetitive the market the less scienceit happens it's a total myth the onlypeople who knew it wasn't truewere fellow economists but they weren'tgoing to explode the myth because theconsequence of the canary richard nelsonstory was that governments pouredscience at american universitiesand the american academic who saidactually we don't need this money wouldsuffer the sort of fate that i sufferedwhen i first started saying thatuniversal hatred because people wanttheir universities to be funded by thegovernment and sonone of us believes in conspiracies noneof us are conspiracy theorists but thisis the nearest you're going to get to areal conspiracy the economist knew thiswas rubbish on the part of richardnelson and canaro but it was in theirinterests and no one else could seethroughyeah and i think um you know in generalthe incentives aroundscience and economicsare uh quiteblatantly conflictedin a way thatis obvious to everybody who should knoweconomics and you know economiststhemselveswill talk about the problems of monopolyfundingand price controls in all kinds ofdifferent fieldsbut somehow that does not really uhapply to their analysis of their ownfield and the funding of their own jobsbut if you really look at it you knowit'sit's just another example of a monopolyprovider of a goodand the monopoly provider themselvesdecides for the consumershow much they need of this they decidehow much funding is neededand i think the key conceptthat is really important in my mind isthere is no opportunity cost for thecentral planner and this is i think thecentral fundamental insight that ludwigvon mises bringson uminto his critique on socialismthe problem of socialism you know thereis the incentive problem we know of theincentive problem but even if we assumewe get rid of that when we create thenew socialist man who is a completeangelthe real problem of socialism is notincentives the real problem of socialismis calculationand it's precisely about the fact thatwithout the private ownership of thefactors of productionthe owners of those factors ofproduction or the ones who are able tomake the decisions with them cannot makeefficient productive decisions andcannot know where to allocate theseresourcesunless they can calculate in terms ofits real opportunity cost unless theyare the ones who face the opportunitycostso if you don't have private propertythey can't think of the opportunity costof the capital that they're allocatingand that necessarily results inthe collapse of socialism as an economiccoordination mechanism without privateownership there can be no division oflabor and there can be no extensiveeconomic capitalist system and there canbe no long-term accumulation of capitaland that's exactly the same thing thathappens in the process ofeducation and in academic researchbecause there is one buyer it'sthe government that buys for everybodyyou know the government decides how muchscience society needsand it's the people who are in charge ofthese allocation decisions do not facean opportunity cost they are notallocating capital from their own pocketthat money is uh you knowthey don't face a real opportunity costfor it in fact they face the incentiveto spend as much as they can and thescientists obviously want to spend iwant to receive as much money as theycan and the universities want to get asmuch money as they canso everywhere the incentives are towardmore and more moneywhereasbecause it is not a free marketthe umthe uhyou know the the market discipline isreplaced by um a process where everybodyfacesthat incentiveto increase more and more of theproduction rather than focus on thequalityyou're so right and you're so rightabout von mises of course he togetherwith von hayek pointed out that under asocial system without prices that are atrue reflectionof the cost of production and withoutthe profit that comes from allocatingthe resources accurately then then thatjust builds on the chaos that you'vedescribed your analysis of von mises andthe free market and socialism iscompletely correctit's even worse than you describedthoughbecauseum for the scientists they havepersuaded government all governmentsuh that the money should be distributedby the scientists and so what happens isthe money is given by government tonational science foundation or nationalinstitutes of health or the mrc inbritain and it's the same all over theworld and then the scientists the skydiscuss amongst themselves where themoney should go it's complete capture bythe producers is absolutely brilliantbut every invested interest is alignedso the government loves giving money toscience because the sums of money arerelatively small one two percent of gdpalthough if you look at the sums ofmoney they're not that small butin exchange for these sums of money theycan go around the the thepoliticians pretending to be like medicipatronizing galileo and so for examplewhen in 2000 the human genome wassequenced the person who declared it tothe world standing on a podium with allthe television cameraswas president clinton and he was takingall the credit even though ironicallythis was a largely privately fundedexercise but politicians take the creditin britain we've seen the politicianstake credit for the vaccine and one cancarry on with thiswe can talk about the vaccine separatelyperhaps but the point isbecause the vaccine is a private successby the way uh but the point is althoughthe vaccine was a private success um inengland uh boris johnson was able totake the credit for that so politicianslove funding science scientists love thegovernment funding science because theydo it on their terms and funnily enoughindustry loves it because industrydoesn't understandindustry thinks it's getting a subsidyfor its own science what is that's whatit thinks that's why it supports it whatindustry doesn't see is crowding out thereason government funding of sciencedoes not stimulate economic growth and icome onto the empirical evidence in aminute but the reason it doesn't workis that all the best scientistsif the government funds science the wayit does with the scientists funding eachother all the best scientists into thatsystem they go to work for theuniversitieswho wouldn't because you're notanswerable to taxpayers uh you're notanswerable to uh investors who areanswerable to management they're justanswerable to fellow scientists and sothey're all the best scientists go touniversities but there aren't that manygood scientists the numbers of greatscientists are relatively small and ifall the good scientists from theuniversities you don't get the greatscientists in industry which is whereyou really want them and so industrystarts cutting back on its investment inresearch because they're not getting areturn on that investment because allthe people who could have given them areturn are working in the universitysector so all the vested interests arealigned the net result is slowing ratesof economicsyeah that's fascinating i think yeahultimately the uh thethe the problem with all government uhspending ideas is the opportunity costit all sounds wonderful when you thinkwell you know they're giving all thesescientists money and the scientists aremaking all this newscience that's going to make our life somuch better butyou know these people you know the smartpeople that are there wouldinin in the absence of this fundingthey are smart people they'll be outthere they'll be doing something usefulfor somebody they'll be using theirskillsin this fieldin order to produce uh value forthemselves and for others and soyouyou would get this kind ofscientific experimentation and the umyou know learning process and the newinventions that come from itif people wear in the market they don'thave to necessarily befinanced by the government in fact youcould arguably say as we see from theexample of the industrial revolution wecould say thatwhen they have the market pressure whenthey have the market telling them youknow this kind of pump is good but ifyou could run it a little bit faster itwould save us a lot of moneyhow do we make this faster let's look atall the optionsarguably that's a better place to beapplying the scientific method perhapsthan university journalsyou know maybewithout the bureaucratizing and i thinkthis is really the issue becausethe point i was getting at earlierbecause withoutwithout the ability to measure things interms ofa profit you know without there being aboss who's saying we could really needwe could really use a faster pumpwithout there being a bottom line you'reending up having to judge scientificoutputthroughticking boxes of basicrequirements and essentially you knownumbers and metrics thatwill inevitably be gainedand soyou know you look at the academicpublication industry today you seeit's um you know in order to get acertain job you need a certain number ofarticles in a certain number of journalsand there's just an enormous inflationof journals an enormous inflation ofarticles and enormous inflation oftitlesbut very little actual content in thesejournals very few people read what hasactually in academic journals becauseum it's not reallyin any sense related to the real worldand the real market it's based onumfilling you know ticking bureaucraticboxesit's even worse than you suggest by theway your analysis is completely correctbut it's even worse than you suggest idon't know if you know this but scienceis going through something called areproducibility crisis have you heard ofthe reproducibility crisis yes it's agreat man yep great there's a great manin stanford called john iron edis and hehas shown that half of all publishedpapers are wrong i mean it is the mostextraordinary statement the title of hispaper is half of all published papersare wrongand it turns outhe's absolutely rightthatit's worse than some fields and otherssome fields are very soft epidemiologynutritionthat's why i wrote the book on breakfastby the way as an illustration of how anentire field can be completely wrongso on the other handmy instinct is that pure physicsand chemistry the numbers the fourthpapers is much smaller so it depends onthe field but nonetheless if you look atthe entire and of course there arerelatively few scientists in physics anawful lot of people in nutritionalepidemiology so if you look at the morethan half of wallpapers are wrong nowhow could this possibly be and theanswer isthat these people are not being testedby the market they're being tested bythe national science foundation or themedical research council through aprocess called peer review and peerreview basically says if you don't agreewith me i'm not going to pass this paperso if you come up with something reallyimportanta classic example for example was ivfin vitro fertilizationin vitro fertilization first came out asit happens in britain but this is noti'm not being nationalist i'm justsaying it happens to come back inbritainand the scientists and the gynecologistswho first developed it couldn't getgovernment grants for it uh why notbecause the government granting bodiesdid not approve of the idea of in vitrofertilization well it works the otherway as well in the field of breakfastwhere everybody says breakfast is themost important meal of the day if youtry publishing a paper that saysbreakfast is bad for you you try gettinga grant that says breakfast is bad foryou and by the way breakfast is bad foryou um then uh but that's for the bookbut i'm just an illustration or if youlook at fat everyone is told has beentold for the last 50 years fat is badfor you we must all eat carbohydrate theexact opposite is true but the point isif you're not in the market if you'renot being testedit's technology that keeps sciencehonest science has to be tested againstreality which basically means the marketif science on the other hand simply istested by peer review then if you cansatisfy the peer reviewers your careerflourishesand if you have something likeepidemiology or nutrition where there isso much data you can always select justthe bits of data you want to give theresults you want without actuallycheating or lyingthen you get this terrible situation ahalf of all published papers are wrongbecause people are simply publishingpapers to satisfy the peer reviewersselecting the data accordingly withabsolutely no concern as to what isactually happening in reality onlymarkets because there are tests ofreality or technology technology is whathappens in markets and so it is exactlyas you describe but even worse than youdescribedyeah absolutely i mean if you thinkabout itdispassionately the peer review systemisperfectly suited for developinggroupthink it's a perfectuhmechanism for a bunch of people to gettogether or what is called i think thefirehouse effect where firemen spend alot of time with each other doingnothing but talking and then theydevelop weird beliefsthat they share with each other becausethey spend all of this time aloneisolated from the rest of the worldand i think there's there's an elementof that it's umit's highly likely that um you know onceresearch has taken one direction in acertainfield such as for instance theridiculous notion that you know animalfats are bad for you but industrialwaste is good for youumwhich wewhich is a favorite recurring theme onthis uh show because uh we've also hadumnina teichows who wrote the book the bigfat surprise uh we've hosted her beforewe've discussed this it's an astonishingstory andit's very easy with statistical papersthere's always a way to around it and inall those fields that rely on statisticsyou need to take everything with abucket of salt because it's very easy tomake papers that achieve whatever resultyou want you know you just runyou're doing statistics and you cancherry pick the data you can cherry pickuh the methods that you want you cankeep running data until you get theresult that you want you're likely toalwaysfind spurious correlations that can fitwith the narrative and the story thatyou want toselland uh nutrition has gone completelydown that path in a way that iscompletely devastating you know it mightbethe deadliestmistakeon earth if you think about it this haskilled possiblymore people than all the wars of the20th century combined think about howmany peopledie early because ofthe fact that they thinkthey're looking out for their health byavoidingthe traditional animal fats that alltheir ancestors ate and insteadreplacing them with this industrialsludgenina is a great great person there arethree giants in nutrition and what'sextraordinary about the three of them isthey're not scientists all three of themare journalists nina was a journalistmichael pollan whotalks about the importance of animal ofplant productsand the one who discovered all aboutsugar and and also saltgary thompsongary thomps thank youso gary tabs is a journalist nina's ajournalist and michael pollan now theydon't fully agree michael pollan wouldhave us be much more vegetarian nina butall three of themessentially have shown that theestablished story is completely wrongand the reasonit had to be journalists who broke thenews for us is exactly your business ofgroup think there's a very very verygreat man really a very great mancalledfleckum[Music]his first name will come back to me hewasthe first scientistwho in 1935showed that scientists work in groupsand he influenced hugely people likethomas or robert merson and all thelater philosophers of science likefirearms and he pointed out thatscientists work in groups and the reasonthey work in groups is that knowledge istacit that's to say knowledge is notexplicitif i produce for you i know you you knowan awful lot about bitcoin if i were togive you a piece of paper telling youhow to clone a gene you wouldn't have aclue onlyprofessionals in the fields can clonegenes can read each other's papers andso only very few people have thespecialized knowledge to help each otherand you need people you can't do thingsalone you have to work even yourcompetitors you have to work with it'svery easy to show thatand so fleck back in 1935 said that whatscientists do is they actually creategroup think organizations and he gavenames to them and all sociology andphilosophy of science subsequently hascompletely concurred with that that'swhat scientists do but the result isthatthe peer review system which is that ina sense bit largeis a horriblyconfining way of thinking now aristotletwo and a half thousand years ago saidthe scientist should pursue truthrespective of how many people he offendsbut the trouble is in the modern worldif you have to worry about offendingpeople you won't you know if you youwon't get your grants you won't get yourpublications you won't get yourpromotion you won't get your tenure youwon't get your jobs and so science isbuilt on subscribing to establish pointsof view it's very dangerous only themarketvery important only the market protectsyou because the market doesn't give adamn about your group thing the marketwants to know does this car actuallywork does this airplane actually workand all the science in the world isirrelevant all they just want istechnology that's good once you moveaway from the market that's when you getinto these terrible fields that areactually rather sordid in the endthis is uhto a very large extent uma reflection of uhsome of the arguments in my next bookfiat standard which will be out in acouple of monthsand in this book i um so in the bitcoinstandard i discussed bitcoinand i you know i explained bitcoin forfirst principlesas a monetary system and how it worksand what the implications of it are andthen in the fiat standard which is mynext book i looked at the fiat monetarysystem and try to explain it also fromfirst principles which is uhin my opinion turned out to be aa pretty useful way of understanding theeconomicforcesthat arecreated when you have this mechanism formoney that is centralized and undercentral control which is the centralbankand effectively under the fiat monetarysystem you knownew money ismined into existence to borrow a termfrom bitcoin you know we mine bitcoin wemine gold we mine fiatwhen any entity guaranteed by thegovernment or the central bankissues debt you're absolutely right it'sbankers lending money that create moneyexactly and so when you think about itthis way um the government's credit iswhat isthe native token of the fiat monetarysystem and that allows the government anenormous amount of uh influence on allthese monetary on all of thesenon-monetary aspects of societyincluding science you know there's justnever been areal genuine crisis of funding forscience becausethere's always more debt there's alwaysmore money printing and the fundingnumbers always go up you know the theamount of money being spentit might go through a hiccup for a fewyears here or there toucher might make acut here or there but in the long run inlooking at the past 60 70 years theamount of funding for science like theamount of funding for pretty mucheverything else only goes up it onlyheads in the direction of up becausethere's no opportunity to cost thembecause the money is constantlydevaluingandthis inevitably means more and moregovernment influence on these aspects ofsociety you know the market for food isheavily influenced by the government'sability to grant credit and so largefarmers large farming conglomerates cangetcredit at better rates than smallfarmers and they can produce with bettereconomies of scale so that hascompletely distorted the market for foodproduction we see the same thing inscience and we see all of theseall these patterns repeat in manysectors of the economy that aremassively distorted becauseumyou know when you when one part of themarket has a money printer where theycan just grant creditinfinitelythey are going to have a very very uhstrong influence on the market and ithink this is what we see in science andthis is what we see in nutrition we seeit inmedicine in many many many areas andthis uh in in my mind is kind of the uhyou know if i were to sell you on thebigger picture of why bitcoinbitcoin is a free market way of doingmoney so it's a way toundercut the entire government monopolyand all of the government influence onall of these aspects of society which isprimarily down tothe control on the monetary systembitcoin is an alternative monetarysystem whose supply can't be controlledby government and whose umand whose uhprotocol rules are distributed andcontrolled by their by the usersindividually and which doesn't have acentral authority in charge of itso let me just ask you a questionhow therefore is the decision made toincrease more currency in the bitcoinsystemso there's a schedule that wasput for the production of bitcoin beforebitcoin started to operate in andthe network has beenumbasically going by that schedule sincethen soyeah nobody can really change it thethe way it works is every 10 minutes newblock of uh transactions is mined andwith it there's a reward of a new amountof bitcoin that is produced so for thefirst four yearsit was programmed to do 50 new bitcoinsevery 10 minutesand then for after the first four yearsapproximately four years it drops to 25every 10 minutes and then four yearslater it dropped to 12 and a halfand now it's at six and a quarterso at this point we've already had about18.8million bitcoins minedandas time goes on the daily productiondeclines because it drops by half everyfour years so we've still got anotherabout 2.12.2 million uh coins to be mineduh roughly over the next century or sothat's very very interestingyes so nobody can make more of itand you were a very early adopter wereyouum notnot early enough unfortunatelybuti mean i heard about it but i was anacademic and unfortunately you knowi had uh i was i heard about bitcoinrelatively early but i had too much ofthe umsmart ass academic attitude of oh ohwell here's why it can't work and soi heard about it early and i keptwatching as itcontinued to rise but i always thoughtyou know clearly itwon't work and i wasn't very wellinformed about it like basically allbitcoin critics are generally uninformedabout it and so for a very long time iwas uha bitcoin i mean to be fair i wasn't uhi wasn't a bitcoin hater i wasn'texpecting i wasn't hoping that it wouldfail i was justi couldn't see how it could work and soi wasn't early enough to get in on itbut then later on i began to really payattention and start to read and start torealize okay this is very interestingbecause it's a it's a new invention andit's umyou know you can think about it as atechnological invention rather than anetwork it's not it's not facebook it'snot amazon it's not a company with a ceoit'si guess more similar to the steam engineit's it's a way of doing uh money andit's it's an idea that just gets aroundanybody in the world can run somesoftware on their computer in the sameway that anybody in the world can make asteam engine in their workshop soanybody can make bitcoin anybody canjoin this network and it's an opennetwork that nobody controlsand it operates through the fact thatnobody uh controls it and we've seen itover the last 10 years it's reallyprovenuh over and over that nobody really isin chargejust very very quickly because i i don'twant to bore your viewers who will knowthis but just for my sake what sort ofacademic were you and where were you inacademiai was uh a professor of economics at thelebanese american university oh reallyhow very yeah so when i talked aboutclassical and neoclassical economics youknew what i was talking aboutyeah yeah yeah i studied uh i'd done aphd at columbia university insustainable development and before thati had a master's degree fromthe lebanese from london school ofeconomics and development management soi had studied economics um from amainstream perspective but then towardthe final yearsi started reading some austrians andstarted reading you know things that arenot recommended in the syllabus and sothenhere i amvery gooddelighted to hear that storyone thing led to another and now youknow i'min bitcoinwhat is very interesting about thegovernment funding of science by the wayisumthe numbers of studies that have comeout showing empirically that thegovernment funding of sciencedoesn't work in terms of economic growthand the best source of these studiesincrediblyis the agencies of the americangovernment so the congressional budgetofficeand has produced two reports over thelast 20 30 yearshuge analysis of the actual just theempirical data showing that thegovernment funding of science simplydoesn't work whereas the private fundingof science is what yields all theeconomic growth uh the oecd produced areport in 2003 again only empiricalshowing that the government funding ofscience across all nations of the oecdover a 21-year period had produced noeconomic growth only the private fundingand the bureau of labor statistics inwashington dc had also produced such astudy and the defense department hadproduced such a study and i think it's avery interesting fact which is very hardto understand i don't really understandwhy the most effective destroyersempirically of the fact that governmentsshould fund science have come agencieseither the american government or oecdwhich is of course hugely influenced byamerica butthese reports that are so beautifullywritten and they're so defensivelywritten because they know they're goingto be attackedthey've made no impact at all 99 percentof people still believe that governmentsshould fund science even though theempirical data is very clear that it'snot the case very interesting example ofhow people believe one thing in the faceof evidence in the otheryeah it's absolutely fascinating um totheir credit i mean i thinkit's uh we should give them credits forcoming up with this but yeah the thetrack record is pretty uhit's it's pretty obvious umwhen you look at it a little bitcriticallyother points that you mentioned in yourbook which would be worth discussingjapanjapan a lot of people bring up japan asan example ofgovernment fundingof technology and science leading toeconomic growth what is your take onthatwell it's a complete myth well when iwrote that book and i by the way i'mwriting a new book bringing everythingup to date but when i wrote that book in1996 uh it was very obviouswhat the facts werejapancontrary to all myths in those days wasthe only country the only industrializedcountry in the worldwhere the government funded less thanhalf of all academic science so in 1996when that book came out every otherindustrialized country in the world thestate was funding something like 85percent of academic science but not injapan less than 50 percent equally japanlike switzerland when you look at r dwhich is this broader so academicscience is just academic scienceresearch and development is a muchbigger thingwhich is all the stuff that industrydoes as welland japan and switzerland as it happenedbut funding the state was funding only10 15of r d whereas in every other country itwas about 50 50. so japancompletely contrary to myth was the oneindustrialized country where thegovernment didn't fund science and yetbizarrely the myth arose that mitti theminister the ministry of industrialtechnologyhad somehow led japan into thisfantastic economic growth all this ofcourse was before the crisis that japangot intoandhow myths like that grow i really don'tunderstand because even if you look atthe projects that miti had propagatedlike nuclear power the midi inspiredprojects have all failedand so in the end what you have is astory that mittias a very good ministry had helpedcoordinate with the companies of japanwhat their needs were so if this companysaid look we need protectionism ofcourse japan grew behind protectionismno one ever talks about it now but japanlike britain like america grew behindprotectionism they exported likeanything but it was impossible to importinto japan and basically what mitti didis it went to the big companies and saidwhat do you need in the way ofprotection we'll give it you what do youneed in terms of access to foreignmarkets they'll negotiate that for youand mitti put out a brilliant but thereality is that japan was the mostlaissez-faire country in the world rightup to the timethat its system collapsedsince the collapse of the systemhas been growing much more slowlybecause actually it got as rich aseveryone else and you can't grow morethan two percent a year once you're inthe lead um then the government of japanhas put much much more money intoscience and the hope somehow of gettingback to the magical days when japan wasgrowing at 10 percent a year but onceyou're in the country you can grow itonly two percent a year and japan hascontinued to grow at that potential evenless and the government has poured moneyinto science to absolutely no effectjapan proves the point of britain andamerica of growing under laissez faireno government or little governmentfunding of science behind protectionismthat's how you grow but try to get thesefacts out of the public domain apartfrom youvery difficultyeah bitcoin is uh generally umonce you've gotten to the point whereyou think and accept that bitcoin canwork thenyou've already madean enormousleap against consensus when it comes toeconomicsum you know you're uh being called asociopath by the new york timesso you develop a little bit of a thickskin and you become willing to discussand look at other concepts and so that'swhy i think you know among the bitcoinuhbitcoiners and among readers of my bookumthere's more of a receptivity to thesekind of uh heretic ideaswe've discussedmanyheretic ideas that you wouldn't hearelsewhere i think it's an it's it's umit's a wonderful testament to thecorrupting influence of government onscience which is thateverywhere else you know there's so manyuniversities out there all regurgitatingthe same stuff taking the samepolitically correct boxes talking aboutthe same problems and suggesting thesame solutionsandvery little diversity of thoughtin any meaningful sense when it comes toum these questions um your universityincidentally is a private universitybuckingham universityi kind of i just want to say i want tosupport something you've said becauseyou said something very interesting andi want to i want to prove to you thatyou're right because i think you don'tknow thisthere are very very very few economistswho argue that governments should notfund science in fact basically none butthere is one exceptiona professor of economics in melbourneat the royal melbourne institutetechnology called jason potts i don'tknow if you've heard of jason potts buthe also believes that government's fromthe fun science but his particular areaof researchis bitcoinsoone very interesting so the oneunconventional professional economistout there is also the one economistwho's taken the prophet he writes he'sgot all these grants starting bitcoinyou should look him up because hecompletely proves your theorythat it's the unconventional thinker whoboth understands that government fundscience and supports bitcoin jason pottsvery good manthat's fascinating yeah i'm uh i'll i'llbe sure to look him upum so your university buckingham is aprivate university i did not even knowthat there were private universities inthe ukwhat's it like operating in the blackmarketfor knowledgei'm no longer at buckingham i left aboutfive years ago i'm nowi'm now essentially at the catoinstitute of washington dc okay uh sincethe epidemic i've gone back to englandbut i'm still a research fellow there umso i was a buckingham for 15 years sothe thing about barkingham is let me imean since you've asked i will answeryour questionuh because not many people understandthis why should they but i'm going totell you so actually in britain alluniversities are private this issomething that's very rarely understoodand i'm only telling you because youasked i wouldn't normally bore peoplewith this but in britain alluniversities are private as it and thatcomes back right back to the gloriousrevolution of 1688and the bill of rights of 1689 when thebritish freed themselves frommonarchical rule and became an orbitname a republic we essentially became arepublic in 1688 1689 but we kept thequeen because it looks prettyand at that point the decision was takenbecause of what the terrible thingsjames ii had done he was the king wethrew out in 1688 he had tried to rulethe universities in 1689 the bill ofrights universities were declared to beindependent of the state and so in factuntil 1919 all british universities werelike harvard yale stanford because ifyou look at americathe vast majority of students in americago to state universities owned by thestatebut a small number of uni students go tothe private universities harvardstanford yale princeton so they're theones we've all heard of but they onlyeducate about 10 of american studentsand yet incredibly in this nocoincidence the best universities inamerica are are they a small group ofprivate universities that cannot be acoincidenceum it's very interesting they're allindependent charities see the harvestand the yales as but as i said 90percent of students go to the stateuniversities in america in the rest ofthe world you look at europe almostevery university is owned by the statenationalized the first universities ineurope came out in italy bologna paduauniversities like that they were allprivate initially but over the centuriesthe states throughout europenationalized their universities it is avery interesting fact the bestuniversities in the world are oxford andcambridge which are privatei come onto the detail minute andharvard yellow and the american ones andprivate universities are so much bettergo to france go to germany go to spaingo to italy these countries all as richas britain and america per capita buttheir universities are rubbish comparedto the ones you have in britain andamerica and it's because only britainand america essentially have alluniversities or at least some universesbeing private what happened in britainis very sad because in 1919 the britishuniversities had been bankrupted by thefirst world war all their young men hadgone to fight so there was no fee incomeand the inflation we had no inflationfor a hundred years between 1815 and1914 the end of the napoleonic wars and1914 100 years later the british poundactually increased in value there wasactually over a century some slightdeflation that's the gold standard ofcourse and then suddenly and so all theinvestments when fixed returned two anda half percent three percent they werethey were they hadnames that we all now remember but allthat was destroyed in the first worldwar when inflation destroyed the valueof the poundonlylost 75 percent of its value down today25 so the universities for privateinstitutions lost all their investmentsand all their fee income by 1919 everysingle british university includingaustin cambridge was trading insolventlyactually trading insolventlytheir debts exceeded their assets andthey were in marked deficit on theirannual accounts and so they went to thebritish government and said we wantmoney or we're all going to close and sothe british government started givingthem money and then with the money camecontrol and so by the time buckinghamwas created in 1975 the entire britishuniversity system behaved as if it wasnationalized all the money came from thestate the research money came from thestate the fee income money came from thestate and the capital money all camefrom the state and so they werecompletely nationalized in spiritand the result of that was that theuniversities were particularly totallymonolithic in what they taught theuniversities taught socialismgovernments have to fund not justuniversities but schools sciencetransport housing the universities weretotal centers of socialist propagandabecause that's just whathad served them so well at least theythought it had and so buckingham wascreated in 1975 to saywe need the university to defend themarket even to this day you go to abritish university and start talkingabout the market and people practicallyspit at youand umi see you nodding um because it's trueum and so back it was now buckiam hasdone quite well uh it came top for manyyears it came to up in the nationalstudent survey of satisfaction so yearafter yearthe university was proven to be the theuniversity that most satisfied thestudents of course because they werepaying fees so of course we looked afterthemum it's i i left and it's not doingquite so well now but but essentially itwas a brave attemptto showthat uh the private sector even inbritain could do a better job of thegovernment and that was really proved bythe fact that it came top beating oxfordfrom cambridge even in the nationalstudent survey every year it producedthe most satisfied students every yearso buckingham is an experiment that'sworkedum as i said i i left five years ago andunfortunately it hasn't done quite sowell in recent years but i'm sure it'llrecoveryeah and of course we've got to rememberthe uh the the cards are rigged againstit because uh it has to pay taxeswhereas all these other universities arebeneficiaries of tax money or moreaccurately inflation moneyno that's not quite true buckingham likeall the other british universities is acharity it doesn't have to pay taxes butthe other government the otheruniversities get huge huge lots of moneyfrom the government and of course that'swhat happened tobaccoyeah yeah so yeah the the game is alittle bit uh rigged against them butthis is uh highly fascinating for mebecause umuh so many things have their origin in1914 1919 and in particular the moveaway from the gold standard and the factthat you tied this to the umuniversity system is absolutelyfascinating for me it's uh i i discussedthis to an extent in the theater i'mgoing to see if i'm going to be able tosneak it into the uhinto the draft since now it's almost onits way to the printers maybe i can workin a couple of paragraphs on this pointbut i think yeah that's uh that makes alot of sense because uh the currency wasuh being devalued there was more than100 rise in prices over the uh period ofthe warand so obviously uh everybody there oryou know governmentuniversities like everybody else werefacingmassive liquidity problems and solvencyproblems andwhen this happens ironically and this isthe terrible thing about monetarymanipulation is that it's the one marketwherein the more the government messesupthe more power the government tends toget becauseit ruins everybody else financially andruins their ability to remainfinancially independentbutits own printing press continues to bethe only savior available for others sothat that's why you know hyperinflationends up really weakening societies andcentralizing themyeah i think we're still suffering fromthat first world war actuallyumthis is this is a recurring theme in theshow wegenerally here we think world war onehas not ended and we think you know andi i think one of my more controversialopinions is that uh bitcoin is the onlyway that we can end world war onebecause it's what's going to finallytake that government money genie and putit back in its bottle because it's goingto take money out of the hands of thegovernmentthat is a very interesting uh argumentbut certainly if you look ati mean if you look at 1914 or 1913you see thatboth in britain and america thegovernment was taking only somethinglike 10 of gdp in taxes but ever sincethen that percentage gdp taken in taxeshas risen and it's 1914 1918 total warthat started that process of accreditingaccrediting british government i thinkyou've got some questions that yourviewers are askingyes absolutely flavio wants to uhask you a question flavio go aheadhey there thank you dr keely this hasbeen avery interesting conversation i wantedto ask about thewhen there was this transitioninto thelow-fat high carb diet in the 70swhichwe know it's been very deadly for manyso many people i live in the u.s so isee people that arebeing affected by this that changingthat everywhere all over the place uhit's been greatly attributed to the bigfood industry soin principle this wouldn't beattributed togovernment-funded science so what wouldbe the argument of the ofgovernment-funded science beingresponsible for this changei'm afraidit is the government funding of scienceit's not the food industry by the waythe food industry are not a group ofangels please do not think that i but asit happens the food industry in thisarea have followed the science and itwas maynard keynes who once said veryinterestingly that we all think theworld is run by vested interests butactually it's run by ideas and that'scertainly the case in american nutritionso the story in american nutrition isvery simpleyou had in america this fantastic andvery frightening epidemic of heartattacks after the second world war andthere was a time when something like aquarter of all deaths in america whereheart attacks eisenhower had a heartattack he didn't die from it but it wasa real epidemic and no one understoodwhere it came from we now know it'slargely cigarettes largely notexclusively cigarettes but it was alsothe increase of nutrition in apopulation that had previously beenrelatively malnourished to generate notover nourished so we do know that if youhave peoplewho in their young in their youtheat moderately and then at some pointare given a great deal of food thattends to give you heart attacks whereasif people have always eaten too much andyou continue eating too much funnyenough is not so dangerous butcigarettes are probably the worst thingof all and so an american physiologistin minnesota whose name will come backto me in a second um[Music]uh ansel keys that was his name anselkeyes came up with the idea that it wasbecause americans were eating too muchfat and he produced these data sayinglookjapanese people don't eat much fat andthey don't get heart attacksamericans eat too much fat thereforethey get heart attacks and of course ifyou look at the tube of the bloodvessels the atherosclerosis is full ofwhat seems to be fat so it all madesenseit was complete rubbishansel keys and niner teachers would havebeen saying this a few weeks ago on thisuh podcast because she's very good onthis neina she's very good on this umand so keys just came up with the theoryand the trouble is he was a monster andhe was a bully and he was a bruteand what he did was he went to thevarious funding agencies the americanheart foundation for examplerun by doctors who knew no science andhe presented himself with completeconfidence he says i can show you thatall your patients are dying because ofthis fat in the diet only give me thegrant money and i'll prove it to you andwhat he did was he leveraged this grantmoney given by these doctors who knewnothing about scienceum to produce all this dataand he then captured through hisacolyteshe produced his phd students andbut themselves are looking for jobs andgrants and so he captured havingcaptured the grant giving body of theamerican heart he then captured thegrant giving bodies of the nationalistdue to health and he then captured thegrant giving bodies of the nsf until itbecame impossible in america to publisha paper to get a grant or to getpromotion unless you selected your datato showthat fat kills you and carbohydratesaves your lifeall of which and i mean there's reallyonly one word one can usewell ii'm not going to use a really bad wordit's just not trueit's just not trueby the way in my book breakfast is adangerous meal i'm going to show it toyou because it's got a funny covershe's got a little shark fin in a bowlofshark fin made of wheat pigsi studied the first such exampleof mass error in science which isbreakfast people have been saying for ahundred years that breakfastis the most important meal of the dayand i trace where those ideas came frombecause it's such an interesting storyand yes the cereal companies take thestory on but initially it's thescientists actually and then the cerealcompanies jump in so to come back toknow the teachers and fat andcarbohydrateonce the story was embedded because innutrition it's so easy to sell data youwantyou could produce andit's the same so harvard in particularthe nutrition people at harvard peoplebut also cambridge and england are thesame people who said breakfast is adangerous meal also saying that fat isdangerous the same group of people usingthe same scientific method of selectingdata because in some strange waythey felt they knew better they theysort of they knew better than the datathey knew what was right and they weregoing to select the data to show theywere rightand to repeat myself they came fromansel keys professor physiology inminnesota and only then the foodcompanies jumped in but initially it wasthe scientistsand it was their capture of thegovernment funding of science thatenabled them to do it sadlythat's interesting um i mean what whatwhat was their motivation for this wasit religious in your opinion or was itbecause in my mind it makes more sensethat it was industry that was uhno no and so keys was looking for fame imeanansel keith ended up on the cover oftime magazine ansel key is when heretired he retired to a little villageon the coast in italy about a hundredmiles south of naples and to this dayyou drive there and there's a big signfor the village sayingthe village underneath the home of ancelkeys and some keys became famoushe was the man who saved the world fromthe terrible problem of heart attacks hewas a man who discovered what was a gooddiet and what was a bad diet and hedestroyedthose scientists who knew that he waswrong he destroyed their careers in mybook and in niner teacher's book we tellsimilar stories we chronicled both of usthe scientists whose careers he crushedand he crushed themby making it impossible for them to getgrants and thensuch a wicked thing one or two of thesescientists particularly in britaingot money from industry because that'sthe only source of money they could getfor their research and as the keys turnaround said look they're getting moneyfrom industry they're prostitutes youknow you can't trust them so theycouldn't winno ansel keys wanted fame mostscientists want fame and and and it's avery honorable thing to want you know inan aristotelian sense you know you wantto show that you've done good work andyou want to be a man who is respectedand credible so but answer keith hadthat i'm afraid to a pathological extentand for him it worked he became one ofthe most famous scientists in the worldas i said how many scientistsfind their names in the front cover oftime magazineyeah fascinating uh chicken has anotherquestion for youdo you want to go aheadhey thanks safeso i wanted to talk a bit about basicsciences uh so i guess we were talkingabout steam engines uh and you knowthese applied technologies but uh idon't think it's always been the casehistorically that we have had mechanicsor you know craftsman uh sort ofdeveloping machines and then you know inretrospectacademic scientists are basic scientistscoming in and trying tosort of build a framework for why theywork the way they work uh so classicexample would be somebody like maxwelluh could be something likesemiconductors superconductorsuhso so that's uh something that i wouldcontend umbut more than that i think uh youmentioned something very interestingthat almost no economistsargue for you know a private funding ofbasic science and you know i guess thereason is that they just don't realizeumthat historically uh you know privateorganizations and patronage has played agreat role in funding that and you knowas you talk about that in your book thatoften you know private investments haveexceeded uh government investments inthis so uh so i often hear from myscientists scientific friends and i'mcoming from a physics backgroundspecifically so i hear a lot about umexperiments like the a let's see i hearabout you know the hubble telescope andall these giant telescopes that arebeing built and clearly they have uh youknowgiven us a lot of new insight andknowledge into the physical world theyalways sort of you know ask you know howdo you think this would have happened ifit were not for the state fundingand of course after having read yourbook and going down this rabbit hole irealized that there are alwaysopportunity costs that they don'taccount for and there are always youknow parallel mechanisms through whichmany of these developments could havecome aboutsowhat i wanted you to sort of share yourviews uh on is if in a parallel universewe had the 20th century without themassive state funding of basic scienceswhat would have that looked like sowould we have had something like anin-let's see would we have had thesegiant super array telescopes what wouldbe the state of fundamental knowledgethere that is such a nice questionuh i think it would be pretty similarbut it would look different um the theuniversities would look different theuniversities would be much more involvedin teaching and much less involved inresearch sothe the the shift of universities fromteaching institutions toresearch universities uh would have beenmuch lessprominent than we've seen on the otherhand we would certainly see moreresearch taking place basic sciencetaking placein industry and also as you havedescribed so well by philanthropy so youtalk about astronomyif you look at astronomy astronomy is anis an entire field an entire disciplinethat came out of the private sector umfor example radio astronomy was actuallya byproduct of bell labs it was the belllabs who discovered that radio waveswere coming from the starsit wasn't government funding or anythinglike that in fact bell labs won a nobelprize for it um and if you look at thegreat optical telescopes of the 19thcentury and indeed the early 20thcentury in california again all thesetelescopes are being funded privately soyou know the discovery of galaxies was aprivately funded discovery made bya man in ireland who had the thenworld's greatest telescope and he was avery rich man and he funded telescopesin facttrying to get rich people not to fundtelescopes becomes a bit of a problemit's like rich people going up to spacetoday once people become rich and in acapitalist country people do become richthen they like to spend their money onthese sort of prestige projectswould we have cernum i i suspectwe wouldn't have cern and i suspect wewouldn't have the hubble telescope atleast not quite with the expense thatthey have currentlyengaged in howeveri once did a uha calculation and i asked myself youknow look at the huge amount of moneythat the gates foundation hasthe gates foundation could easily payfor cern if it had wanted to so we dohave private funders who could have paidfor what are essentiallyvanity projects i meancern is not going to advancethe wealth of the people of the worldit mightin 300 years timeand though i'd be surprised but cernlike the hubble telescope is aboutscience purely for its own sake now wehave decided as a nation or nations thatwe're going to fund that out of thetaxpayer i am prepared to concede to youthat in a world of strictly of only freemarkets it's possible that cern would besmaller it would still have it i meanin 1940 when the american governmentfirst needed umcyclotrons like cern they had to go tothe private sector and borrow them whenthey were creating the manhattan projectstarted off by borrowing cycling francefrom the private sector so we wouldstill have these things but they wouldpossibly be smaller i i don't know neverforget of course that the americans in1991 canceled the super collider projectbecause it was essentially a defenseinitiative that was pretended not to bebut when the soviet union collapsed in1989 the ssc the scccclosed two years later three billiondollars lost all those people maderedundant so the point i'm trying tomake is that and the other point i wantto makeseven percent of all r dindustrially is funded by is for basicscience you can't run a successfulcompany without doing basic sciencebecause basic science is so useful tothat company and companies that neglectbasic sciencetend to go bust and there's a directcorrelation between the amount of moneya company funds in basic science andit's subsequent profits all that is inthat book that you very kindly read allthat data is there so the the for-profitsector is of course going to pay forbasic science because without basicscience it's not a position to make thenext advances and on top of that whatyou could call trophy science like cernor the hubble telescope is going to bepaid for i think by philanthropist afterall the 200-inch palomar telescope paidfor by private philanthropists the wholeof space exploration all of munigoddard's workwas paid for by the guggenheimfoundation mooney goddard in the 20s and30sinvented the stage rocket so it goes upinto space you lose the first stage youlose the second stage and then you'rethere he invented the gyroscope tocontrol rockets he invented the liquidfuels to control rockets his rockets aregoing up to 7000 feet if the secondworld war had not intervenedmooney goddard in massachusetts fundedby the guggenheim's would havegota missile in spacean artificial satellite beforethe end of the 1940s unfortunately thesecond world war intervened and he wassent off to work on bazookas and thesethings of course happen and then ofcourse we then had the germans and andthe russians but space exploration wasfunded by the private sector so i'mbeing rhetorical here i'm not beingaggressivebut don't tell me we won't have thehubble telescope without the privatesector damn it we wouldn't have hadspace rockets without the private sectorand never forget the first thing nasadid when it was created in 1958 its veryfirst act was to buy mooney goddard'spatents at the cost of a million dollarsin 1958 a million dollars is a lot ofmoney so but for the second world war hewould have been there 15 years earliersothe whole of astronomy from the 200-inchpalomar telescope to mooney garneredbeing the first person to really get upthere all of this came from the privatesector the state then moves in andcrowds out and then the military come inand then the army come in but there's noevidence that the private sector wouldfail however i'm prepared to grant youthathubble telescope might be to today'sphones under the private sector might besmaller cern might be smaller but thetrends would be there because thephilanthropic money is there as long asit's not being crowded by the governmentthat and never forget just repeat myselfseven percent of industrial r d goes onbasic science and industrial r d is hugeso we're talking about big sums of moneyand i guess there's a there's a biggerethical argument if i may just commenton that which doesn't seem to get acrossto so many people is simply of coercionof uh you know coercing coercing a largepart of society to pay foruh something that umthey wouldn't have otherwise paid for sothrough taxation so i i just find thatethically wrong uh you know so that'ssomething that that never gets picked upby the state advocates for basic sciencei i could not agree with you more i ipersonally feel very strongly about thati mean i personally think that we'respending money on cern he's doing goodwork and this is not an attack concernplease don't misunderstand but there areso many other things that we could bespending our money on people arestarving people are poorandi i could not agree with you more i i itotally agree with youyeah well peter has a follow-up questionuhto thisthank you terence um thank you that'sthat's all really fascinating stuffi have a follow-up questiontowhat chicken has just asked it relatesto appliedfunding for applied science rather thanbasicscienceand i wanted to ask you because i'm sureyou're familiar with the arguments thatshe's made about the work of marianamazacato who's been very influential ininforminguk policy on innovation funding sinceabout 2012-13she wrote a book called theentrepreneurial statewhich became very influentialand essentially what masakato argues isthat it's a misconception toattribute lots of the technologicalsuccessesof the past few decadessuch as the invasion of the iphone toprivate industryshe makes the case that although privateindustryin the form of apple in the case of theiphonetook a number of differenttechnologies and combined them in anovel wayactually if you look at the individualpieces of technology that lie within thewithin the iphone for examplelithium-ion batteriesthemicro hard drive micro processorthe artificial intelligence behind sirithe multi-touch screen of the iphoneshe argues that all of these individualtechnologies were developed throughgovernment funding of science so in thecase of lithium-ion batteries that wassomething that was developed by thedepartment of energy in the case of ummike's the microprocessor that wasdeveloped by darpaand she goes through systematically likewe mentioned cern my html was inventedin cernsoshe makes this case that actuallygovernment funding of science has beenfundamental to transforming particulardigital technologiesand sogiven that that narrative is soprominent i just wanted to ask what yourresponse was to people like mazacartathat make the case that actuallyalthoughwe think of these innovations as asprivate privately funded they have avery heavy reliance on governmentfunding for the applied research thatwent into themthis is a very very good questionum mariano mazzicato ishugely influentialandum it's therefore very importantto show that she is in fact completelywrong and two people have done this oneattempted to do this i have twicewritten so you just look up if you lookup my name and narrative carter and putthem in google my two articles will ofcourse come up i've written more thantwo actually but there's also a verygood italian political economistcalled alberto mingardi who's written avery careful analysis of where she iswrong in my articles apart fromalberto's articles i make the followingpointsto which she has never respondedonenot once in any of her publications tillshe discussed crowding outsofor herthe government funding of scienceis has no opportunity costum the government does this and not onceshe worked out thatwhere do these scientists come from whois being deprived of the activities ofthese scientists point number one pointnumber two her understandingof umthe the economics ofrisk as i have explained and i'm notgoing to go into the publications herebut her understanding of theimplicationsof risk is is is economicallyincorrect i shall come on to that in aminute we have time and thirdly it's allanecdotal if you look at thequantitative gdp data if you just lookat rates of gdp per capita growth inbritain america of the world and thenyou compare that to when governmentstarted to fund science both in britainand america there's no deflection of thelong-term trendswhat she's actually described aresituations where governments have set upprogramspulled really good scientists out of themarket for these programssome of which but only some of whichhave worked most government programsproduce absolutely nothingand then she said look we wouldn't havethis and she's not looked at the factthat these scientists have been pulledout of the market she's not looked atthe costsof that the opportunity cost of that andshe's never addressed crowding out andshe's never addressed the fact thatsuccessive government reports themselveshave shown if you look at gdp per capitaas opposed to looking anecdotes you getno benefit from the government fundingof science i think it's a i think it's amasakato's workonly gets a free pass because everybodywants it to get a free passshe works at university college londonwhich is basically acting as a sort ofgreat cheerleader for the governmentfunding of science andbecause she says nothing that is initself actually wrongyou know i mean she doesn't tell ontruths but because her truths are soutterly partialuh by only giving a partial truth in asense it's very dangerous but i'vewritten at some length as has albertomingardi on mariana meza carto and i'mvery happy to point people to thosepublicationsyeah i uh i agree with you entirely onthis i think the the her entire caserests on the idea of not examiningopportunity costs peter you wanted tofollow upit was a follow-up questionbut not a bit tangential it was onpatents so i don't know if you have afurther comment other thanyeah let me have a further comment and icome backthe other thing that mariano mezakartadoesn't do is she doesn't understandradical uncertainty i'm sorry my brainwasn't workingshe saysthat the reason the private sectordoesn't fund in science is because ofradical uncertainty you do you'reuncertain you don't know what the profitis going to be so it's exactly the otherway aroundumthe only reason companies invest inresearch or anything marketing whateveris because of medical uncertainty it'sbecause they're trying to do somethingthat's different from everyone else thatthey can get a return on their profitthe reason people invest in projects isbecause radical uncertainty means that'swhere the profit is there's nouncertainty you don't invest in itbecause it's a neoclassical perfectlycompetitive market i think she's gotthat completely wrong but please talk tome about patents because i have verystrong views on patents and i'm happy tobore you all with themyes please go aheadunfortunately i i'myeah i i unfortunately i have toleave at this point but i'll join you ina couple of minutes peter cancontinue uhmoderating this but i do want to hearyour take on patentsthey're a scam they should be abolishedthey accepting pharmaceuticalspharmaceuticals are a special casebecause umit can cost a relatively small amount ofmoney to copy another drug but the costsof producing a drug the first onehugely costs of regulation i mean 90 ofthe cost of a new drug of regulation andsafety and all that and so you do needand the empirical evidence shows veryclearly that the stronger the patents inpharmaceuticals the more pharmaceuticalsyou get but in every other field ofindustry the empirical evidence is veryvery clear that patents do not stimulaterates of invention they will notstimulate rates of innovation and theydon't stimulate rates of gdp per capitathey make certain companies rich but theprice of patents is absolutely terriblepatents are a form of securing amonopoly that's what they're about andtherefore they enable companies to makeexcessive profit i mean people like billgates are absurdly richbecause of his exploitation of ipr inintellectual property rights what weactually want is competition we wantcompanies to enjoy first mover advantageso you make a discovery you can benefitfrom it for a time but then what youwant is other companies coming in andcompeting with you and catching up sothen you have to do more research tocompete with the people who arecompeting with you and the whole pointof patterns is to try to stop thatprocess from happening let me give youan example the most interesting examplei thinkin 1903 the wright brothers in americainvented the airplane they not just thethe way they did the wings but also thepropeller and all sorts of things thewright brothers invented the airplaneandthe result was they patented itand every time someone else tried to flyan airplane in america without payingthe wright brothers the license fee andthey didn't pay license fees in americafor complicated reasons which are theyhaving to talk about but for now let mejust tell you the facts the wrightbrothers sued them in court and won sowhen america went to war in 1917the american army because the americathe air force was part of the army theamerican army didn't have any airplanesthe british the french the germans theitalians they were fantastic numbers ofairplanes the americans where americahad invented the airplane had noairplanes the wright brothers didn'tmake any more airplanes because theywere in court all the time glenn curtisand the others who tried to copy themdidn't make airplanes because they weresued to destruction so the extraordinarything is in 1917 the country thatinvented the airplane had no airplanesand even by the end of the warthe americans were flying britishairplanes to british designsbutonly a few days after the war wasdeclaredwoodrow wilson declared a patent pooland a patent pool is where you can filea patent but you can't actually exerciseit so you you file it but you can'texercise it and between 1917 and 1975a long period of time there were nopatents in american aviation in 1917 themost primitive country in the world foraviation was america by 1975 the leadingcountry in the world for aviation wasamericarichard nixon in 75 then reintroducedpatterns because he was trying toprotect incumbents because richard nixonwas a bit of a thug was a russian nixonhe didn't believe in free markets hebelieved in helping rich people becomeeven richer not a very nice man but thehistory of patents in american aviationillustrates beautifully because it's soclear-cut that patents are designed toinhibit innovation because that's theirpurpose you take out a patent so youdon't have to do any more researchbecause you've got the market for thenext 20 years so you don't have to doany more research and no one elsebothers to do research because theycan't break into your market that's whatthey're about and we only get economicgrowth despite patterns not because ofthem they're a medieval scam we shouldwe used to have hundreds of problems inenglanduntil 1601 famous parliamentary debateeverything was patented every industryin england was a monopoly everythingsoap was a monopoly salt was a monopolybeer was a monopoly even textiles yeahwe the colleague everything was amonopoly and then in 1601 parliamentabolished all monopolies except forinnovations francis bacon persuaded themto keep it for innovations andinventions but actuallyeven those patents are just a medievalhangover we should have got rid of thema long time ago and all the empiricalevidence shows very clearly that patentsgot nothing to do with economic growthand all to do with rent seeking by aprivileged minoritythank youthe the thing that i i guess i'll askhimas a follow-up to that then is whetheryour position on this has changedbecause i'd heard in a couple of yourprevious podcasts that you've madesimilar anti-passing arguments but wheni was reading the economic laws ofscientific research and this is this isin the first half i haven't quitefinished the book yet so maybe you comeonto this more later but it's on page 42and you say thatthe entire town has invented the patentum because they increasingly discoveredthat when they were developing newproducts theydiscovered they had a disincentive whywould a man devote time or money ondeveloping a better mousetrap if aprofessor can then sell an identicalcopyand you describe this as a problemandthat leads into a historicalintroduction ofhow florence came to introduce the firstpattern in 1421 and it sounded a bitfrom that discussion like you youacknowledged that there was a genuineproblem in in innovation so i waswondering whether that's uh that was athat's the position that you've you'vedeveloped over time um and if so whatwhat's changedumthere's the book i've just just checkedout page 42 absolutely right um i wrotethat in 1996 which is what 25 years agolong time ago um and i was still verymuch a practicing scientisti don't think i'd even talk to aneconomist i don't think i've spoken toan economist in my entire life when iwrote that booksince writing the book i've been verylucky i know i know i knew nathan versusrosenberg so i had met economist but iwas writing as a practical scientist andmy experience of patterns in my fieldbecause i'm i am a a cell physiologisti'm a clinical biochemist and there's noquestion that patents are important inpharmaceuticals they just are because ofthis problem of regulation uh and so iwas arguing from inexperienceum but i've nowknown for at least 15 or believed forthe last 15 years now i've looked morewidely as particularly outsidepharmaceuticals which is the onlyindustry i really knew about thatpatents are a scamand actually they're quite a wicked scamum and if you look at the development ofthe third world there's this thingcalled tripsum which is this internationalipr deal which is part of the wtoand under trips basically all patentshave to be recognized so that poorcountries can no longer do what japansay did which is behind protectedprotectionist barrierscopy japan grew rich the way britaingrew it copying the netherlands behindprotectionist barriers the way americagrew rich cropping britain behindprotectionist barriers and japan grewrich the same way copying behindprotectionist barriers that's no longeravailable to the third world so you hearpeople saying why is that this middleincome trap well that's becausesince the wto and trips since 1995the traditional routes to middlecountries becoming richer have beenblocked off you're no longer allowed toprotect infant industries and you're nolonger allowed to copy for freeall that you're allowed to do if you'rea third world country trying to getricher is to cheap use cheap labor toundercut western markets through cheaplabor and of course export labor in theform of immigrantsand it's all i'm afraid it's all a bitof a scamrich people make it find it very easy todo r dand make new discoveries and they thenexploit the law to maintain their wealthso they don't have to do any more r di'd be interested to get safe's take onthat becausei'd imagine i think for most of us inthis group the idea that protectionismwas something that contributed to thesuccess of thecountries like britain andamerica would sitfairlyuncomfortably with our understanding ofthe economics of that situation beforethey've answered let me just invoke twoimportant people schumpeter and keynesboth schumpeter and haynes said the samethingthat i mean shampoo particularly is veryvery interestingum trumpet said look if you actuallylook at the history of him he wrote thisin a very famous paper published in 1941you may it's easy to come across he'slooking at the growth of america he saidlook america absolutely confirms thestrength of thelist lists as the german economistalexander hamilton we've all heard ofhim and this learnt from alexanderhamilton the alexander storyof protecting um uh infant industriesand schumpeter absolutely was opposed toglobalizationin that area because he said thehistorical record is very clear as i'vejust described of copyingother people behind protectionistbarriers and it just it's workedhistorically successively this sits verybadly in with the ideology oflibertarianism and my friends at thecato institute glare at me and growlwhen i say these things but theempirical facts are very clearly thereand the reason it's important torecognize those empirical facts thateconomic growth does not come actuallyfrom competitive or comparativeadvantage we all hear about these thingsand we all worship atmosphere we allworship david ricardo and of coursethose give you efficiency advantages andthey give you one-off static advantagesof course they do but economic growthcomes from replacing venom with paperfrom hawk replacing horses with motorcars and that doesn't come fromcomparative or comparative advantagethat custom r d and innovation and thespread of ideas and funnily enough thosethings are not dependent upon the freemovement of goods capital services ofpeople they're dependent on threemovement of ideas that's all you needyou you capture the odd you know likeslater traitor slater who moved toamerica with uh the textile industryuh factory in his head and the japaneseof course allowing a few products tocopy them but if you understand thateconomic growth is not about competitiveand comparative advantage economicgrowth is about innovation and thespread of ideas and copying otherpeople's ideas then you start to look atthe world in a very very different wayand that's what my next book is aboutit's calledsomewhere yet i've written the firstdraft but it's not ready to go yet butit's called something like economicgrowth for the first thousand years inwhich i point out that we are thatunlike schumpeter and keynes both ofwhom understood this by the way we havebeen solda neoliberalstory of competitive and comparativeadvantage that's very very convenientfor the rich of the first worldactually ain't so good for the restso i think safe is back and just tojust just to recap safe i was justdiscussing with terrence theterence was making the argument thatpart of the economic success of britainthe netherlands and the us japan was dueto their protectionist barriers and iwas saying that for many in this groupthat idea won't sit particularlycomfortably with the way that we have wehave analyzed thoseeconomic phenomena in past discussionsso i was asking what what your thoughtswould be in response to that notion thatprotectionism was a positive force forthe early economic development ofcountries like britain and the usi'm i'm skeptical um i mean it's uh atthe risk of challenging professor keeleyumand and uh you know getting my asskicked um i'm gonna say i think you knowif you look at the uhsure that there there were some elementsof protectionism but i wouldmorei'd be more likely to think that it wasthat the growth was happening in spiteof the protectionism rather than uhbecause of it in other words if the ukwasmore closed off to trade that if it hadhigher trade barriers and if it hadhigheruh import tariffsthen probably things would have beenslower i don't think things would havebeen betteryou know people like the point forinstance recently to south koreaas an exampleof you know a country that had uh tradebarriers and interventionist governmentbuti think uhwhen you compare it to north korea yousee that it had relatively littleuh trade barriers and that's what meantthat it grew much faster thannorth korea soi'm sure those things existed but i i istruggled to see how they could havebenefitedbritain in the u.s and made themyou know develop industrially betterbecause in my mind having the ability toimportthe inputs that you need for theproduction processes at the lowest costpossibleis an enormous uh driver of innovationi wonder also whether hong kong would bea good counter example terrence to be tothe idea thatprotectionism leads to rapid developmenthong kong and singapore they'reentrepreneurshong kong important export umthey're not hong kong's not a greatmanufacturing base so hong kong is ofcourse an exception i agree with youcompletelyi'm talking about a much larger countrytrying to become a manufacturingindustrial countryumumthen what the empirical evidence is isclearumin the case of britain america and southkorea as these countries get richer ofcourse so it becomes in their intereststo start exporting and then under thosecircumstances they become very keen onintellectual property because they wantto protectwhat it is they are themselves producingi would argue that what's important isthat a free enough and big enoughinternal market the united states had ahuge internal market and it wascompletely free and so it was free toinnovate i certainly believe a smallcountry can't be protectionist uh forreasons at orbits because it hasn't gotthe internal market to generate thecompetition but the reason i've comesensitively to this whole businessprotectionism is bluntly and i say thiswith some reluctance actually but therewe are um we are moving into a world ofgreat populismand i personally believe that thepopulist threati think we're handling it well i thinkthe western world is not going tocollapse into populism but you look atcountries like poland and hungary andyou know in a mild way brexit or trumpand the supporters and what's going onin brazil and what's going on inindonesia and places like that there isthis protectionist thing that'sdeveloping and we have to ask ourselveswhyand i think globalization hascontributed to that because of theundercutting ofjobs for the poori also think we're moving intouh we're moving back into the world ofgeopolitics china is definitely going tobe aa challenge to the rest of the world andi think india and the united states andwestern europe and russia thesecountries are going to start becomingwe're moving to a different geopoliticalworldand therefore i asked myselfif we were to move into a world wherethe worlds had broken down to say fiveessentially separate economic blockswould that be a problem no each week bigenough to have enough competition inturn if all that it needed as long as uhideas moved between them that's all youwould need for these things to work andthe reason i think that i've becomemore protectionist i'm going back to myearlier point i'm sorry is that i thinkthat the disaffection of peoples ofvoters from a sense of powerlessnessthat comes from a globalized worldis very very dangerous and so we needthe electorate to feel empowered andglobalization disempowers the electoratethat's in a sense the point ofglobalization and i think it's becomedangerous in that sensei could be wrong i mean you'll noticethat i'm talking about globalization inmuch more tentative waysthan i am about other things i'mprepared to be told i'm wrong butthere's a very good book actually i'vejust read by johann norberg called openand this is about the first so if youhaven't read it i recommend it and johanis that the first libertarian i know towrite a book about libertarian economicsso the first half of open is all abouthow wonderful free markets are ibelieved every word there was no problembut the second half is but lookthere's this globalist there's thisanti-globalization reaction and it's avery unpleasant reaction some veryunpleasant people are being elected aslibertarians we at least have to look atit so i'd go as far as say is let's lookat open by johann norberg and let'sthink about to what extent globalizationfuelsfuels populismand after all you know 1933 hitler inthe wake of the globalization of the1929 financial crisis uh does does thereare precedents forum globalization causing great damagei'd say i think the uh i i woulddisagree with here with you because ithinkum the problems of what are being blamedon globalization are really the problemsof a fiat monetary systemwith the fact that global trade becomesa problem uh you knowif two people across an imaginary linein the sand are deciding to trade withone another they both must see benefitfrom that trade or otherwise they wouldnot have agreed with itif this ends up being a problem foreither of them or for other peopleinvolved it's almost always the casethat it is because of the manipulationof the currency and it's because of theproblems that people face withinternational tradein a hodgepodge of currencies which hasessentially devolved the global monetarysystem into a system of partial barterwhereby if i wanted to buy somethingfrom the uk i need to first buy yourmoney in the uk and then i need to buyyour thingsbecause you can't accept my foreigncurrency so this leads you know the theuninvention of one global monetarysystem which was with the case under thegold standardleads to this world of balkanizedtrading blocksandhigh inefficiencies in barter and thenof course the fluctuation of the valuesof the currencies and of course theconstant inflationall of which gets blamed on umglobalization and effectively thescapegoats end up being um you know theidea of international free trade but ithink those are really distinct things ithink if we had a sane monetary systemthese things wouldn't be a problem youknow there were no or there were verylittle problems there were there wasprobably more globalization in 1910 inthe world than there was in 1990 butpeople werecomplaining much more about it in 1990because it was built on a quicksand ofshifting the national currencies90 of redundancies are caused by newtechnology not by imports you'reabsolutely right um and your the worldwas very globalized in 1910 but lookwhat happened in 1914 people like keynesdid actually blame the outbreak of thefirst world war to some extent onglobalization but to come back to yourearlier point that we are into theseblocks the trouble is we live in nationstates we just do live in nation statesso now i'm moving away from economicssince it's sort of geopolitical politicsif we live in nation states then we haveto ensure that those nation states arehappy even so if a trade between a and bmakesz unhappy then actually that's a problemfor the nation of state that's reallyall i'm saying but i i find yourinterpretation very very interesting i'msure that you're at least some degreeright you may be holy right i'm notqualified to tell but i like yourexplanation but what i would say as withjohann norberg who is a greatlibertarian he talks exactly like you bythe way about trade is thatwe live in nation states if they're madeunhappy by globalization we should atleast look at it and try to work out whythat is because an unhappy nation statecan result in some very unpleasantpeople being elected i'll stop thereyeah well you know there's a constantrunning theme in this show that wediscuss a variety of topics whateverthey arebut the conclusion of each one is thatbitcoin fixes this and so[Music]today you know the issue of government'sstudy isgovernment funding of scienceand i think a lot of the discontentsaround globalizationi would like to believe that um theseare things that can be fixed by a uhby a strong hard monetary unit that winsits value on the market and achievesmarket acceptancewell by so doing you'll hugely destroyand disempower the nation state so thatfeeds into my argument so we may besaying the same thingperhaps i i'd love to send you a copy ofmy book i'll be emailing you about iti'd love to get your thoughts on iti think i've been sent an e-copy is thatnot rightyes i think yes yes yes yeah peter sentyou one yeah that's right but a hardcopy would be nice i find it much easierto read hardi would love a hard copyall right absolutely you got itthank youall right thank you very much professorkeeley for joining us cheers it's been areal pleasurethank youbye[Music]",
