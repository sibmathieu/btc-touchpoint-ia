  "text": "hello and welcome to another bitcoinstandard podcast seminar in today'sdiscussion we're going to continue thetopic of uh the last seminar with danielprince on homeschooling and fiateducation so during the last seminardaniel gave us his perspective oneducation as well as his personalexperiences about as a father of fourwho does uh homeschool or moreaccurately we should say unschool hiskidsand uh today we wantedto follow up we had a bunch of questionsto address fromlast timeand i have a bunch of questions that iwanted to talk about and a bunch ofotherconcerns so i'm going to kickthings off first withoneperspective on it which is generally theopposition that you hear tohomeschooling is that well you know ifsomebody's not putting their kids inschool then they don't care about theirkidsand they'renot concerned about themlearning the essential skills of modernlife and they're not concernedabout them fitting in to society andintegratingyou're essentially having kids so thatyou can give the world uh sociopathsum but i thinki think it's becoming clear now you knowas the internet is allowing more peopleto get in touch with people that aredifferent from the uh same 28 peoplethey went to high school withit's becoming easy to see that not allunschoolers are like thatbut i think there is another kind of uhunfair stereotype and criticism we cancome up with uh so i'm going to beinsufferable here daniel andgive you my best shot at knocking whatyou're doing down soii hope you can take it butisn't thisis isn't this a luxury that uh very richparents can afford to give theirchildrenumbut it's extremely dangerous for peoplewho are not extremely rich because youknow if you're extremely rich you andthe parents have the time and theparents have the moneythen yeah the kids can go around and uhyou know learn what they want wheneverthey wantbecause eventually you knowthe kids just need to figure out how tokeep running daddy's businessand uh you knowthat'skind of like playing life on easy modelet's face it if you're borninto a family with capital thenyeah you can spend your uh childhoodenjoying life and learning and exploringand traveling and sailing anddoing whatever you want and fishing andso on because ultimately all you need todo is just take over your familybusiness ortake over your family wealth and youknow spend the daddy's money umsoyou know maybe maybe it is easier forthis kind ofclassbut maybe for most peopleyou know the people first of all whohave to work so they can't just go andput their kidsleave their kids outand about uh range-free all day becausekids can get into trouble and can do allkinds of nasty things or you know theycan get uhabducted or get into fights or who knowswhat happens so you need somebody tosupervise them and if you can't affordthat because you have to be in a jobbecause you know you don't have a lot ofmoney and you're not richthen that means either you're going toleave the kids free or you're going tohave toyou knowtrust in children's judgment to managetheir life for the majority of the daysoumon the coand on the other side it's not justabout what they do with their day andtime management i think the moreimportant aspect of it is if you're notrich thengetting this education isa path out of povertysoit's it's a luxury for us to be able tosaythat you know school was bad and boringand it didn't challenge umdidn't challenge me intellectually anddidn't stimulate me and it's uhit's you know if you look at maslow'shierarchy of needs all of those thingsare nearer to the top whereas for manypeople in the world you know they are atthe level where they are cannot reallysecure the most basic elements of theuh of their daily needs in terms of foodand shelter and so on so if you're inthat worldit'sa kind of uha a sure ticket you know if you turn upto school 12 years you learn youralgebra you learn to write and read andspelland umyou know have some develop thediscipline to deliver homework on timeto meet deadlines tobe held responsible and to facepunishmentif you have those things and if you dothem in school and then you go touniversity you get a degree you can geta joband if you're poorumyou know this uh this this is anenormous improvement over what your uhother options areso it's it's it's maybe a luxury thatpeople like you can look at this and saywell you knowum you're going from one box in a schoolto a box in a university and then you'regoing to a cubicle in an office andyou're getting instructed and gettingshouted atand yeah sure it suckswhen you've triedmore fun ways of living but for manypeople this is an enormous improvementover the alternative which is you knowmaybe slave away at a sweatshoporyou know go join a gang orget into crime or prostitution or so onfor many peoplethese are the options you know youyou go to school you go to work all dayyou slave away you send your kids to agood school they do what they have to dothey learn their lessonsand then they get the job and they get alife where they you know they get abetter job than you had and then theyget a better life a better house abetter existenceumdo you think maybe this is uman elitist thing that isperhaps good for rich people but prettydangerous to beuh marketing as a solution for everybodywhat do you thinkyeah it's a very good very goodsummation uh and of course obviously inverypoorcountries situations where literary isgoing to literacy is going to be high uhthethe you know the focus on educationdoes need to be there um whether that isi meanhelicoptering inall of the foreign aid that we give outto to different countries to buildschools and whatever else uh is thatactually um going to the right placesand is that having the the desiredeffect for for these kids that getexposure to education we certainly hopesoum but then on the the other end of thescale uh like you were saying uh likethe rich kids that are just gonna end upuh running mummies and daddy's uhcompanies umwhat's what you'll find withuhthere's there's actually a good uh goodstudy done by um i'll give this to peteras well afterwards uh it's called thehole in the wall project and the powerof self-organized learning by sugarmitraand he conducted this in 1999in new delhiand uh it was um located in an expansiveslum just outside of uh their officeswith desperately poor people who arestruggling to survive and what they didis they sunk a computer into the openingof uh of a wall near their office andthe screen was visible from the streetand the pc was available to uh to anyonewho passed bynow what happenedwas pretty astonishing as he goes on totellchildren came running out of the nearislam and glued themselves to thecomputer they couldn't get enough theybegan to click and explore they began tolearn how to use uh this strange thing afew hours later a visibly surprisedvivec said the children were actuallysurfing the webthisalso is on this um link which i'llprovide peter there's there's a video ofthem of them doing this so ityesit kind ofgives youwhat we were talking about before umthis feeling that if we can just placetrust back in to the fact that kids aregoing to be able to teach themselves andlearnand we can put tools in front of themthat they can start using andcollaborating with each other to to usethen they will learn and they will teacheach other um but likei understand i understand exactly whatyou're saying is this a privilegedlifestyle to be able to make this choicetonot useto choose to not use the educationsystem uh yes i'm in a privilegedposition i suppose that uhi don't have to be in an office anymorefor 11 hours a day my wife doesn't needto work um we've managed to escape thatfiat nine to five existence but mostpeople haven't most people areboth parents are working so they needthat aspect of daycare they have nochoicewhat i'm hopinglikewe i mean we've said many times you knowkovit has sped everything up by 10 yearsthat's sped up remote workso if we can now have the case whereat least one of the parents is back nowin the in the home and able to remoteworkor they might even now be able to beboth parents in the home remote workingand move away from the area that theywere forced to pick to in which to livebecause they wanted to be near thisparticular school that they've taken thekids outbecause that's a huge trap as well whatyou find is people over payforhousing to be either closer to theiroffice when they're younger in life orwhen they're older in life and they'vestarted a family closer to the schoolthe school they want their kids to go tobecause that's the one because that'sanother virtual signal i want my kids togo to that school so they're going toget the best grades and i look good inmy society that i can afford to sendthem to this school if you take all thataway you can move away from that areayou have now two potentially two parentsworking remotely at homeyou have uhfar lessoutgoings for the uh the prices uh theprices of the houses and you canactually startslowing your life down and the kidscan enter into an online learningplatform so they're still not completelyuncontrollable and running around theworldyou know singing anarchy at the top oftheir voices they can they can find uhplenty of tools online to to keep themengaged and learning with with otherkids uhi'vemet so many differentpeople in so many different situationsyou know singleworking moms or fathers that have takentheir kids out of school and have justmanaged to make it work even whilsttraveling full-timeso the traveling full-time remoteworking and the kids uh either one ortwo kids with them are doing aself-directed education as welland what you'll find is actually whenyou're traveling as well doing that it'scheaperthan when you actually sat in i i thatblew me away we we traveled for two anda half yearsand that was cheaper month to month thanit was than we were just sitting stilland um uh you know just living life tolife uh day to day excuse me um soyeah i don't know what would umis there any particular point in youropening question that you want me to goback to and and kind of pressi i gotta say um i i agree with you i'mgoing to try and play devil's advocate alittle bit more but i can't hide myagreement on on on this last point whichis that i thinkmost people if they reallythought about itat least one of the parents's work isuhprobably not worth all of the extraexpenses that you have to give for thechildum i think if you because the higher theincome that you make then the better thethings that you have to get your kidsare so it's not like this is uhsomething that can be resolved when youget this much money because the moremoney you get the more money you'regoing to want to spend on your kidseducationand on you know on your kids nannyingand on your kids activities and all thethings that you can't give them becauseyou're not thereso the more you earn the more you spendon that stuff and i think a lot ofpeople report the idea that actuallywe're far better off giving up some ofour income whether it's by one of theparents not working or both parentsreducing their work hours and spendingmore time at home and then not having todeal with all of the that comeswith school becauseum you know in many cases it depends onwhere you are in the world many casesyou know free well in no cases really isa free educationgood and if it's good then you're payingfor it one way or the other so forinstance in the u.s you can get into agood free schoolbut you're paying the tuition out ofyour uh property taxesand so and out of the price of your uhhousesouh it it ends up essentially in the usyou know the inefficiencies instead ofgiving the money to the good schools yougive the money to the um counties thatrun them so there's an extra layer uhwhich complicates accountability butthere's also a ton of waste there's anenormous amount of waste in schoolingbecause it is an area in whichgovernments have spent a lot of moneythere's an enormous amount of waste andso if you actually want the high qualitystuff you know if you wantyour kid to be in a small classroomwith um you know interesting intelligentcaptivating engaging inspiring teachersin most places in the world you have topay an arm and a leg for that it's quiteincredible actually how high theseprices areand so yeah if you wanted to send themto these uh top schoolsthenyou know two salaries are going to be umbarely enough for most people butif you think about it if you snap out ofthe need to have the marquee name youknow they graduated from the school andyou think about what it is that they getfrom that experience you can providethem that at a fraction of the costwhile giving up some of your income andi think you'll come out ahead of itin terms of justbasic finances obviously this isn't truefor everybody but i thinki'm just trying to make the point that ithink a lot of peoplegetstuck into this hamster wheel ofwe need to pay the tuition for theschool and therefore we need to get thejob that we hate and we need to spendall day away from the kids and theydon't see how all of these problemssolve each other basicallyif you focus on the um you know the onecommodity that matters the most to yourown life which is your time you onlyhave your time in this world you knowyou're born you're given a bunch of timeyou're born with nothing you're given abunch of timeand then you die and when your time isup and that's it then you take nothingaway from you your whole life is timeand so people i think get fixated on thematerial aspects of lifeignoring their own time so it's it'slike life is a game where you're justtrying to collect more coinsand that's not what life is it's notsuper mario there's nothat there's no trophy for picking upthe most number of coins at the end uhit'stomorrow a cliche it's about the journeybecause really the journey is all thatyou have at the end of the day there'sno trophy you get to take away with youyou you have the life and you need tolive it andyou know you're only going to be aparent of kids once in your life andthat's really i think the thing thatpeople miss like youuhyouyou're only going to have thisexperience once if you're going todedicateif you're not going to dedicate time toit to experience it to enjoy it to watchyour kids grow you're going to beregretting it for the rest of your lifemost likelyand the toys and the money that you haveare not going to make much of adifference so i thinkumthe the financial aspect of it isprobably underage because i i think thethe maybe the flawed premise in myquestion is the fact that ultimatelywhat the uh if the kids have a parentthat can work for them then theythat parent could also give them time ifthey can work they can also give themtime and that is probablymorevaluable for the kids i would say um buti guess 100yeah yeah that's a great point becausewe're at this stage now where you knowyoung couples uh are deciding to havekids they're both working they both havehighly professional jobs and they bothhave that sunk cost of probably thecollege degree and four or five yearsinto that career and they might havealready made uh one or two promotionsbaby comes alongyou havemaybe it dependsdepends what country you live in maybeyou get a monthum paternity leave some some countriesmore lenient you might get six monthsafter thatyou arehanding the baby over to some kind ofdaycare or nanny or it's going to somekind of center it's it's so sadit's it's dystopian it really is tothink that you would give a baby thatyoung i mean you you mustthis must hit home with you you've gottwo very young kids around you and couldyou imagine giving them up every dayfor five days to go and work in a uh afiat job for nine to five you and yourwife gone i mean the the the trauma thatthat baby would suffer but people aredoing it because they've been forcedinto this cornerwe all know why you know what thehappened in 1971 that umthe the only way that they feel thatthey can survive is by running on thistreadmill and they think that they'redoing the right thing for their kidbecause they're chasing the tokens andthey're not focusing on the time all thechild wants is to be spending time withtheir parents it's that natural it's aprimal instinctit's absolutely amazing it's so accuratei think you have to have been a parentand have to have focused on this oneaspect of thingsto just see how remarkable it is how howkids really want your time and attentionandas young as they are they always areable to detect when you have given themtheir time and their attention and iknow i've noticed this because you knowi uhi'd be on twitter sometimes so i getthem to not get to do something and whyas they get distracted you know i sneakonto my twitter and i start uhtwitteringandimmediately the the they are they feelthe disengagement and they get agitatedwhereas when i put the phone away andeven even though you know i try and besmart about it i'll sit like behind herso that she doesn't quite see me on thephone and she just thinks i'm standingover her but immediately they feel theattention it's almost supernatural itprobably is supernatural umthey feel that that you're giving themyour attention and they feel secure andhappy when you give that and then whenyou're not and when you're distractedthere's just no way to compensate withthe for it and i think a lot ofparenting is just compensating for thefact that you're not able to give yourchildtime and attention and the obvious wayyou do that istwo thingsboth i think are terrible but one isabsolutely horrificthe first is you buy them things so youbuy stupid plastic that they don'tneed and you think you know give themmore shiny toys andthey'll love mebut the second which is the worst andthe far more pervasive is you give themsweetsthis is like the parenting substitutethat is just in my mindit's cruel it's it's child abuse like ifyou feed your children those things andyou just let them have themat all timesyou know you think you're being nice tothe child it's a child it doesn't knowwhat's good for it it has no idea what'swaiting for it 30 yearsdown the line ofheavy candy abuse and becausethey're being encouraged totake the candy that all the candidatesthey want inas early as age threeand because you know every time they dosomething that's good in school you buythem ice cream every time that they dosomething that'severy time you want to make up for themfor something every time you want tobribe themevery time you want to apologize for notbeing there for something you just keepbuying them sweets and it's terribleit's terrible it's a horrible substitutefor a relationship and it's a horriblesubstitute for attentionum it's much worse than just buying toysbecause you know all right plasticstupid toys they'll play with them for15 minutes and they'll forget about themand they'll just be junk uh in your roomand then you get rid of it one day butthe sugarit's whatever you'reyou're you're getting them onto a drughabit that isextremely difficult to break it's stillhard for me to break now you know afterfive years of eatingum basically only meat and eating nosugars and no plant foodi'm still tempted to dig into uhcheesecake it's uhit's it's it's a lifelong addiction andit's just something not uh it's notsomething i'm going to beever rid ofif you you know if you'reif you were an alcoholicyou don't go back to being a normal uhdrinker a normal social drinker that'sit youyou you're scarred for life you can't dothat drug anymore and this is what sugarreally does andyou know if you recover fromthat nutritional damageyou need toconstantly have a very very veryum acareful relationship with swedes youcan't go back to having a normalrelationship and getting them started onit very young is just absolutelyterribleand i think the the obverse of thiswhich most people don't realize is thatif you just give them time and attentionyou really don't need money you don'tneed anything kids are so easy to amusethey've only been on this earth for acouple of years they have not seen thevast majority of mundane that youhave seen all of your lifeand so you can just make an entireafternoon out of just showing them abridge you knowthat they'llit's it's an adventure uh on its own youdon't you know you canthey can learn and they can enjoythemselves and they'll have a good timeand it won't evencostserious money um this is i think whatpeople miss about itum i think for the first three years oftheir life or so i think every day mustbe walking around like they're on a newlsd trip every time they wake up from anap right imagine like justtruly imagine like you know imagine likeyou know you you take your daughter fora trip in the car she wakes up or yourson's the youngesthe falls asleep in the car and he wakesup in a completely new location like youperhaps you've gone to a forest orsomething for a walk like the isthiswhatit's it must be so damn weird but you'rethere and your wife is there and asibling is there and that's the safetyand that's the um connection uh that'sthat's just sopowerful and we've had such a breakdownin the family uh because of theseexpected uh social norms and constructsthat have built up around us it's likeno the only thing you can do for yourchild is to send them to the best schooland my god they even havein the us they even havepre-kindergarten now right which i thinkwould qualify you for kindergarten whichthen qualifies you for the primaryschool it's it's sounbelievableit'sbeyond dystopianyou know if somebody made some kind oflike hands made tail movie about it tvseries you know based on like the kindof stuff that we're talking about andthe umthat the treatment of kids and just uhforcing them through mate oh do you wantto keep me going on school uniformsyeah go aheadholyimagine like this would be a good scenein said tv series imagine like peopleshow up at your door in suits withclipboards and they introduce themselvesasbureaucrat a and b and they say uh mr mramus we have it on um good authoritythat uh you have a five you have adaughter in this house that's gonna beturning five years of age this yearuh is that correct uh yes okay all rightwell then she's gonna have to wear thisand come with usthat'sabout as dystopian as it getsbut that's what people are willinglydoing and then every september all themums on facebook are taking littlepictures of little johnny and littlejane in their matching school uniformswith their30 kilo rec sacksfull on god knows whatand send them off out the door and thestate will teach them nowyeah it's ridiculousi think this brings me to anotherpoint that i wanted to get to whichwhich is the uniformism the the not justin in school but in terms of thinkingum and here i think it's you know beyondjust the uh usual platitudes that theyteach you in school aboutwhich ironically they do teach you knowabout being an individual and thinkingfor yourself and all that stuff as yourecite all the things thatget you the right answersum beyond these kind of uhfeel-goodmotors i think just thinking about it ineconomic termsthe expected returns on knowingsomething that nobody else knows arereally high so if you're the onlyplumber in a townthat's a very good gig you know it'smuch better than being the 20th plumberin the same town you know if you havethe town of a thousand people with onlyone plumber you're going to have a lotof good business going because you'reextremely valuable people really reallyneed you if there's 20 plumbersthe services of a plumber are going tolikely be cheaper sowhat you want as an individual foryourself is to try and specialize inarcane knowledge that is not easilyavailable for other peoplebecause then that makes you special andthat makes you um able to charge and apremium because you can provide a lot ofvalue for people with that knowledge soyou're always trying to specialize andindividuate your skillswhereas um in school you're being forcedinto knowing alluhinto knowing all of the same things thateverybody else knowsandyou know evenas an individual not just about what youwant i'd rather live in a place with alot of umdifferent people because then that wouldmean a lot of different skills i'drather not live in a place withidentical drones because then everybodydoes the same thing there's not a lot ofroom for specialization and for thedivision of labor and for tradeso it's kind ofsurprising when you think about it thatas the economy and economic activitybecomes more developed therefore morespecialized therefore people havemore and more detailedjob descriptions and more specializationwithin a much larger structure ofproductionbecause of the development of capitaland the accumulation of capital in thatkind of world you need more variety inorder to um have more productivity andhave more inventiveness and have moreways of approaching problems and justhave more possibilities for trade thanthe division of laborandpublic education of course is uh leadingus in the opposite direction whereeverybody's being made to think the samethings and use the same things and ofcoursea lot of that is driven by fiat it'sdriven by government insistence and it'syou know the century of public educationwas also the century of fiat it's not acoincidenceeducation becamegovernment policy in the 20th centurylike it had never been before becausethe government had the printer and sincethe government has the printer thenthey should justmake the most of it and you knowreally if you think about it once thegovernment has the printerumany kid who's pooris essentially a policy choice you knowif anybody in the us today is poorthey're poor becausejay powellwants them to be poor because jay powellcould just click a button and make thatperson rich and nobody could even careyou know he's printing trillions to bailout bankers every dayumhe could print uh 500 000 andrescue a poor family and make them livea good life and yet he chooses not toum and i think you know pierre richard'sbrand of accelerationism here has reallywon me overmost economists will generally and moan about this is not fairthis isdangerous you're destroying the currencyyou're destroying the incentive to workbut i thinkyou know pierre is p appears a geniusand it's uhand and and he's also extremelyextremely responsible in the sense of umhe's heavily influenced by jocko willingso he's always about you know takingresponsibility and taking ownershipand not being a whiny little and iabsolutely love that approach to lifeand in that approach you knowyou don't want them tostop printing moneybecause we have bitcoin now so we don'tneed to beg them because it's not ourmoney anymore no you wanted toaccelerate it and you want to justbasicallyumshow them the absurdity of their ownpremises because if the government cansave goldman sachs by printing a bunchof money well then why don't they justsave a poor family that's starvingin a poor american citythey obviously value that thing moreand i thinkit's uhit's it's a compelling logic that'sbeing taken to its extremes uh you knowpierre rashad is going to sound uhuh conservative with this kind of uhuh stuff very soon when it's going to bemuch more demand for printingbutyeah i thinkit's the money printing is heavilyimplicated in thisso my question then is i guess to turnthis aroundis do you think if we got uh rid of fiatwhich um as you may have heard bitcoinmightdoif we were to get rid of fiat and we gotrid of the interventions of governmentsand education we have got education goback to being a free marketis there a good way of doing schoolingin a free market that's good that's umand i said and you know think about itwhen you think of education umthe whole thing is massively disfiguredand think of anything that's uhdisfigured by government interventionand you canconservatively estimatea 10xincrease in price and a 10xdecrease in qualityon anything you know if government wasto handle cars in the country where youlive todayexpect cars to get a lot more expensiveand a lot worse very quickly so applythe same standard to educationeducation will get a lot cheaper and geta lot betterteachers will be responsible there'll bemarket competition things will improvemassivelyhow will thatplay out do you think there'll be roomor to put it differently if we lived ina in a bitcoin standard if we had a hardmoney and government was unable tointervene in education would we stilldevelop schools would we still developspecialized places for learningor would we just end up havingunschooled kids roaming aroundeverywheregetting into everybody's lawn andeverybody's hairflipping cars over and setting themalight yeah exactly that's it that'sdefinitely what would happen that's whathappens every six weeks in the summerholidays rightwhen no kids are at schoolwell i meani don't want to get into too manypersonal stories but yeah you could makethat argument yesbut um yeah it's a good question andi don'ti would love to say if we were to moveto be a bitcoin standard that therewould no there would not be acentralized education system because whywould we justredesign the same thing i would love tosee a much moreuhdecentralized approachandbring back morea kind of like a micro school approacha an approach of mentoring orapprenticeships right apprenticeshipswhen did they get like completely pushedto the house or what right i mean whatwas thathow helpful was that to people that werestruggling at school and they weren'tfitting inside the cookie cutter systemnow all of a sudden they can go andbecome an apprentice whatever and go andget directum experience inwhatever business that they chosethat just makes so much more sense towhat we've i mean it's still it's itit's still taking place it's just it'sbeen delayed by 10 years by the uheducation mafia essentially they takeyour kids at uh six and instead ofthe kids at age of uh 15 going out andgetting out of war even 10 12 going outgetting an apprenticeship working at abutcher shop or at a car mechanic andseeing if they like this field ofbusinessinstead of that happening they spend allthat timein school and then at university andthen they do that apprenticeship afterthey spentyears and hundreds of thousands ofdollars on education um and then they goand you know they you start your job asan intern it's something that i like tobring up a lot when discussing theminimum wage issue and i bring this upin the principles textbookpeople think the minimum wage isis bad but the vast majority of jobswill hire you initially below theminimum wage if you're a doctorin your first year out of medical schoolyou work as a slave getting paid lessper hour than the janitor and yetdoctors are lining up to get theseresidencies becausegetting the residency is how you learnon the job and that's what makes you adoctor and many of them will tell youthey learn so much more in residencythan they do in four years in medicalschool so theythat they fall over themselves trying toget into thesevery scantily paid slavery level umjobs in those hospitals because theircompensation is not in uh the money thatyou spent it's and sorry it's not themoney that you get paid during that yearit's in the money that you make laterand that's essentially theapprenticeship model so people don't uhprotest uhprotecting doctors from the minimum wagebut the same logic the same exact logicapplies for a 15 year old working as awaiter or washing cars your first jobyou're there to learn how to work tolearn how to deal with people to learnthe basics of an industry and that's aneducation that you should be paying forthe fact that ismost internships um you know you learnmore than you contribute there andthat's why you don't get paid a lotthat's true for engineers it's true forlawyers it's true for most jobs peopledo an internship either after theyfinish university or during their timeat university and they learn a lot fromthat and they benefit a lot from it andit'sit's amazing when you think about itsome kids and i've always envied thosekids umwell maybe envy is a big word but i'vealways liked this that there'd be thatkid who knows what they want to do andyou know since the age of five all theirlife is you know i'm to be a pharmacistand they just know and they're justgoing through all the things they needto do to become a pharmacist or a doctororyou know own a restaurant or somethinglike that and these kidstheycould very easily um learn all thethings that they learn at school intheir spare time andspend most their time uh on the joblearning in these kind of fieldsandthey'd probably be better off you knowif you were working at arestaurant as a kidand spending a few hours a day learninguh the topics that you find relevant foryouyou'll still learn to read and you'llstill learn math and you'll learn allthe reading and the math that you needin order to run yourhotel or restaurant or whatever it isthat you like to runandyou learn a lot by being on the job andnow that's justinstead of having 12 year olds do thatfrom the comfort of their home from thecomfort of afamily that provides for them where youknow you go and you spend the whole daytrying to do something and the worstthing that can happen is that at the endof the day you decide this thing is notfor me and you go back home and you havea house and you have food on the tableand you have a family that can providefor you i mean it's if you think whenyou put it this way it seems like anincredible opportunity and you almostfeel cheated out of yourchildhood that you didn't get to do thatyou know go out there and liveyour daily life as a teenager as a miniadult basically practice adulthood withthe safety net of a family insteadpeople are thrown into this in theirmid-20swhen they'vebeen brainwashed into the idea that umscoring high grades on a test is what'sgoing to get youyour restaurant to work properly youknowsit and learn youruh calculus and learn your chemistry andhistory andall that stuff and then your restaurantwill work and then they're surprised tofind that you know at age 23they're out there trying to make arestaurant work and they have no ideawhat to do because all the stuff thatthey learned hasn't been very useful sothey're basically starting frommaybe not square one but pretty close toityeah it's it's so true and i that's howi got my job i was 18 i think 17 or 18and i did a two-week internship at aforeign exchange brokerage in london anduh yeah that was it but you knowthat two weeks was getting coffeesandwiches runningerrands like the most mundane errands that you could do forlike 16 guys that were sitting around ina uh in a circle desk together uh allshouting and screaming numbers at eachother it was dollar mark it was thedollar mark spot desk in in london anduhman what what an experience that wasthat was such a great experience thatthat'swhat i wanted to do after i got out ofthe hell i hated the fact after twoweeks i had to get up and trudge my assback into school at the time i was likegod i can't wait for this to be overbecause if those guys needed someone onthe desk then i can just go in and i'vei've had my face in the door they knowwho i am i had a few drinks with a fewpeople that you know that that should beenough and sure enough a year later iwas done out of school didn't have anyparticularly good grades they didn'tcare they're like yeah sure you can comeand work we'll try you out you know welike you know where the coffee isexactlyandyou can go and get 100 of them a day andin the end uh i still had to go and uhandthat was a very very low wage incomparison i have no idea what minimumwage was back in those days butit was not a lot and a great percentageof it was going on the train ticket toget in and outso you'd turn up at 6 15 and by 6 30you're getting 16 guys breakfast you'reback out getting breakfast rain snowshine whatever in londonthen you're parking to the director'scars and then you'regetting another round of coffees withinhalf an hour because they've finishedtheir breakfast then four of them neednew cigarettes because they'd all sitthere and smoke you know these are thedays where you could still smoke on thedeskso but you were total dog's bodybut it was that experience that built upthe um the uh what you needed to startcarving out a career for yourself but ifyou didn't like itone you just left two it showed and youwere firedand it's doing everybody a favor becauseyou don't end up doing a job that youhate andthey don't end up hiring someone that ishopeless and not interested in doing thejob whereas if now we have thissituation i think it changed early 2000sespecially in the banking sector youcould only hire someone that had aminimumx degree in math or phd in economics orsomething for the banks sowhat happenedall of the banks start complaining aboutthe talent that's out there on themarket because these guys turn up theysit down and they're like right i'mready to trade and like the you arewhat are you sayingyou need to get coffee first yeah yeahyou go and get my coffee and you go andget his coffee and uh she likes a teawith milk and he's like i didn't go tocollege for four years for this whatunfortunately that doesn't matterlabor theory of value right thereyou knowyou going to college doesn't give it itdoesn't give the experience value yeah ithink this is this is this is uh this isvery true and it's umi think it's just the generaltheatrization of everything whereas we've discussedbefore on this podcastunderin the fiat world the results areoptional and so it's really no longerabout whether you canget into the bank and make the bankmoney or obviously it is to some extentbut it's becoming less and less aboutthat and you look at the currentcorporate worldumi mean does anybody even want to makemoney selling anything anymore it's likeall of these corporations are just outthere to regurgitate a bunch of uh about virtual signalingnonsense about you knowthe evils of carbon dioxide destroyingthe planet andwhipping themselves andself-flagellating themselves over racismandgender and all kinds of otherstuff that iscompletelycompletely unrelated to the line ofbusiness in which they're supposed to bebutthe reality is the vast majority ofcorporations today they don'tlive to satisfy their customers theylive to satisfy their banker they liveto satisfy their central banker theylive in order to play the politicallycorrect games um you know close uh yourbusiness when there's coved and uhtheyou know borrow uh from the bank at lowrates uh that it'sum it it's the socialization of industrythat is allowing so much of economicproduction today to just be fake i thinkuh an enormous number of people in thefiat economy don't have real jobs theyhave fiat jobs where they're justumyou know filling up an office andhanding and performing a bunch ofrituals which when performed correctlyallow the entity for which you worktouh extractlow interest ratesborrowing fromthe next uhfish in the uhin the food chain essentially so you getmoney thrown at you from above if youtick those boxesand the more politicizedmarkets become the more significant thisbecomes and the less significant thepolitics the less significant economicproduction becomes ithink an enormous number of companieswouldn't existif it was about their business you knowyou think about something like ibm whatthe hell does ibm even do anymore otherthan just take low interest rate creditand theninvest in a million different things allover the world and thenmake patents from them and then have ateam of lawyers go around the world suepeople fordoing anything from those patents butthere's i mean it's it's not a businessit's more like ait's more like a mafia wherethey're justusing their connections to get the moneyand then theybuy up all of their competitors they buyit anybody who's doing anything relatedto anything that they can do becausethey can get lower interest ratepayments and so they can sit out as allof their competitorsanytime they have a bad quarter they cansitibm has lower interest rates and theycan stick around they can buy them theyhave more moneybutyou know you compare it to what abusiness should actually be like youknow with an idea a mission and a leaderand a ceo who's working on doing youknow we want to give peopleuh cheap uhshoes we want to give people a reliablecar we want to give people a computerthat worksandfor most of the well not most but for alot of these businesses umthis isn't uh the reality anymore theceo is changed every 18 months and he'sessentially thereto run a bunch of financial engineeringwizardry so that he can do interest ratearbitrage better and the operationalside of the business is almost uhit's almost like a front to the businessit's almost likeuh you knowyou're trying to rob a bank and the waythat you rob a bank is that yourent out the store next door to the bankand pretend that you're running abusiness therewhere you know you're selling cookiesand you're selling the cookies and youdon't care if you make money from thecookies what matters is that every nightafter everybody's goneyou can dig under your uh shopand into the bank next door i got thisfrom a woody allen movie by the waysome time agobut uh this is this is what like mostfiat businesses arethis is a long tangent but all of itgoes back to education and i think thisis kind of why education isbecoming so completely unhinged fromreality whether it's at the universitylevelor school level it doesn't even matterwith the questions whether the questionsare right or wrong it doesn't evenmatter what matters is that you followthe instructionsand tick the boxes because that's whatyour job is going to be your job's notgoing to involve deliveringgood quality shoes at low cost to peoplewho need them your job is going toinvolveyou know ticking boxes and getting fiatfinancing so it's like applying for thatcrime family that's digging under thebakery into the bankif you wanted to join them your cookiebaking skills are irrelevantthey don't care how good are you atdigging into the bank that's what wereally need and then they don't care ifthey make shitty cookies and uh thecustomers don't like them although inthat film they end up making greatcookies and the shop makes more moneythan they would have made wrong in thebankbutyou know that was probably one of the uhat least the story was probably writtenbefore in 1971 when you couldmake money in ways other than robbingbankswell actually there's a graph on 1971 iwas on wtf happened in 1971 i was justflicking through it because i knew itwas there and i wanted to try and findit um the the growth of physicians uhversus administrators i don't know ifyou've seen that one i think it's likeone of the last fewit's just explosivelike it's just all of theseadministrative jobs completely throughthe roof and and that's exactly you knowi mean what what they're looking forlike those those box stickers this ishow they're runningumtheir countriesit's likethere will be more and morebureaucracies and more and moredepartments will open up to look aftercertain different littleniche things that all of a sudden needpolicies and regulating and to do thatwe need to staff an office of 50 peopleit's just like complete madnesscomplete madness and and who who fitsthe bill the best this is the best thingwho are the best people for those jobswell this comes back to standardizedtesting that you were talking aboutbeforethose peoplethat got the a stars and the a'sare the best because theyexcel are being averagebecause that is all school is testingfor who is the best across the averageand so they end upbeing picked out for the administrativejobsbecause they know that they have beenconditioned have you ever watched umjohn taylor gatto's six purposes ofschoolingum i don't think i've watched but i'veread some of gato's work yeahright so he this is this is like matt hehe that there was a guy called alexanderingalls who wrote a book back in 1917 or18and gato tried to track this book downit took him two years to get to thisbook and he finally found it in somebackcupboard dustyenclaveof harvard after many phone calls andbeing turned down by harvard to even umentertain the idea of him finding andgetting his hands on this book someonecalled him back out of the blue and hemanaged to get it and he said it's themost boring book he's ever read in hislife and it's massive and it's tiny tinyprint but then he got to chapter 10the six important functions of secondaryeducation and this is like the bible ofthe purposes of schooling sowell actually no the book is called theprinciples of secondary educationthe principles and there are six chapter10 the first one is adjustive functionso to establish fixed habits of reactionto authority bam number one wow i meanjustjaw dropping number two integratingfunctionto create conformityand how do they create conformitythey've got everybody moving togethersitting down together at the same timemove on the bell looking the same comingback to school uniforms right you knowjust conform just conform standing inyour classes for assembly or whateverbecause that's your group of 28 peoplewhatevernumber three directivediagnose your proper social role forlife so that's what they're doingthey're sorting youit's the directive right okay you'regonna be umgood at this you're not good at this andthey start sorting you very very earlynumber four differentiating function soto do that to build on number three thedifferentiating function is to split thestudents into higher and lower classesso you have the more affluent and moreum kind ofclever i would say intelligentinhigher sets or classes than you wouldthe um they're not so clever or thepeople that can't sit still or you knowthose that just aren't interested inboard they get completely separated andyou do that you well in the uk they usethe uh asset system soyou know you'd have like set one twothree down to fiveuh five selective function now this onethis one's weird i'll let you watch theclip uh because gato talks about how umthis is kind of likepreservation of favored racesand this isset in place to prevent the poorfrom interacting with what would be seenas the better breeding stock and thatmeans putting humiliating labels on onthe the poor of poor mind or poor in umyou know the views of the eyes ofsociety and so you put labels around theneck like um you knowyou're not very clever you're not verygood at thisyou're you can't play sports you knowalways picked last for sports and all ofthis kind of stuff that we've all beenthrough and we've all witnessednumber six is the propydutic functionwhich is the grooming of those in higherclasses to manage those in the lowerclassesandthat is a perfect example of why youhave prefects or head boys or head girlsor class presidents for those peoplethat are being groomed to make them feelas though they are going to be the onesthat are going to be better in societythan the other people now this is allwritten out in that bookfrom back in 1918and it'scertainly true today of a lot of thesethings siralexander inglesis spell ing l i s i believe butpronouncedinglesand this ishe's not writing this critically he'swriting it explaining it rightuh soum who john telegato or alexander inglesingallsingalls wrote the book the principles ofsecondary educationthis is his guide mapto what school should be foryes but i'm trying yeah it's hisguidebookhe's not criticizing this is notsomebody trying to uh yeah no no thesethese are the points this is this iswhat school is forand it's it's gato when when um when youwatch the link i've already shared itwith peter when you watch the linkyou'll be likethis is crazy and um and that is firstprinciplesthat's fair education from firstprinciples standpoint right thereyeah and that's what's been built onthe theaterization of education isanother thing that came about in 1914incidentally i bought the domain namewhat the f happened in 1914i bought it a while ago and i've beenmeaning to start collecting thesebecause it's also very similar to 1971it's one of those years where a lot ofthings keep popping up you know thefederal reserve was established in 1914world war one happened thenand you just see the parallels all overand it was basicallythen when you gotmodern public education in the form thatit is it's then when modern medicine wasborn in the current crazy form in whichit isand it was then in which the modernuniversity system wasborn as it isand it was alsoat the time when we had the antitrustlaws born and this is usually presentedas a big giant victory forpeople against corporate power but inrealityas money rothbard explainsthis was the triumph of corporate powerand and solidifying itand protecting it from competitionthrough the force of the state soumevery market now there was a judge thatwas going to rulehow much of each goods saleseachcompetitor needs to have and that uh youknow if you're if you're the kind ofsimpleton who believes in kings andeconomics that sounds like a great ideabecause now the judge will just stopanybody fromfromhaving too much of a share but inreality what this ends up doing is it'sbeing used by the incumbents to freezeout all uh competition and that's whatends up strengthening those monopoliesuh over timeum so a lot to answer for ininterestfor the early 20th century yeah i meanit'sum it's it's when public funding for nowfor uh science started in the uk and inthe us it's when uhone of the u.s i think it was more afterworld war ii butso many of thesethingsbegan to happenum around that time and it was justa lot of it was the rise ofindustrialization and men likerockefeller we've had um we've had anepisode here that was uh a big giant uhuhtribute to rockefeller in order to knockdown keynes and of course you knowas uh as a lifelong enthusiastand uh lover of hydrocarbon fuels i ihave a soft spotfor a rockefeller because you knowobviously it's not cool to say this butreally rockefeller's uh contributions tothe uh energy industry are the reasonthat uhwe have the standard of living that wehave todaybutum you know he became so richand he had so much moneyandhe wasumhe essentially brought the incredibletransformative organizational mind thathe developedonum industry and on the energy sectorand try to apply it for all aspects ofhuman life and this is what kind of therockefeller foundation was working onand many of these other foundations it'sjustyou knowweknow that we have american people whowould like to have gasoline and keroseneandall of these amazing productsand we have all this stuff restingundergroundand we need to work out thelogistical procedure of getting this oilfrom under the ground into people'scar tanks and into theirkerosenestoves and whatever so we need to havethis organization and it's it'syou knowit's easy to look at it right now andsee how it works and think well it'simpressive but imagine having the kindof foresightto build this from scratch when it wasstill very primitive when theseindustries were extremely primitiveextremelynewand then to come up with the idea ofvertical integration wherewe as standard oil are going to handlethe entire process fromexploring for that oil undergroundall the way to getting it into your uhinto your house in the safest cheapestmost usable wayi mean you have to admire the kind of ummind that it took it and and today youknowwe have a lot of business leaders thatmake a lot of money but you know a lotof them make that money because theymade a right call on some fiatmoneya lot of them have invented the new wayfor people to shake their ass on thetheir phonewhich is interesting and all but reallythe the the transformative impact ofgetting energy into the householdis enormous it's uhyou knowi'm i'm saying all of this because i'mgoing to say something bad aboutrockefeller it makes me feel uh guiltybecausebecause i i start to feel like these uhyou know the the thecarbon dioxide hysterics who areungrateful about those things irecognized fully that my computer andeverything that i enjoy in life todaywould not be possible withoutrockefeller and i pay tribute to justthe incredible genius that it took himto design that uh processbutwhen he applied that thinkingfor issues pertaining tohumans that's when it went wrongand that'sone of the insights you learned fromreading popper or reading hayek or mostsignificantly i think misesis that humans aren't machines andhumans can't be controlled from abovehumans have their own will and their ownwill motivates them to look out forwhat's best for them and they'reconstantly acting in a way that improvestheir own life so if you try and imposethings on them top downyou cannot do good for them you can'thelp people by imposing things on themyou can onlyyou can only make life worse for them byum imposing things on them and theresult isumyou know if you readpoppers the open society and its enemiesthe rockefellers wereto an extentum bitten by the same kind of bug thatpeople like plato and marx and hegel hadwhich is here we have this incrediblebrain that can organize andsystematically treat andmanagephysical objects and we do a great jobwith it we need to apply thatmethodology to dealing with human beingswe need to organize human society in thesame way that we organizeeconomic production of physical goodsand that'salways been a catastrophe every timeit's been tried it's of courseto an extent the motivation becomebehind all kind of totalitarianideologies which is you know let's justmake the population better that's themotivation behindeugenics is the motivation behindall kinds ofhorrible ideas like socialism andthe likeand uh it is to a very large degree whatgave us modern fiat educationwouldn't you sayand have you ever thought abouthow the modern education system isboiling the oceanshow much co2 how much carbon dioxide ifyou know all the hysteria coming out ofthe status quo how much carbon dioxideis emitted into the uh into the airfrompeople first of all just doing theschool runs you know how many billionsof people are doing school runsthe buses how many of thosegoing crazy what about the uh thesebuildings are generally old buildingsright how would you say that they'reheated and they're heatedwhat likehow many weeks of the yearuh you know that there's there's so manydifferent ways that you could goyeah it's uhit'si think the the a bigger part of thewaste that's involved is the fact thatuh you're trying to mass-producesomething that can't be mass-producedand so you'retrying to fit in a model where economiesof scale workand in order to get the economies ofscale to work the only way to do it isyou basically compromise on the qualitybeyond any kind of recognition it's justnot possible to scale things thatinvolve human attentionandthe result of it is thatan enormous amount of waste is uh takingplace because you know getting all thosekids into the same place at the sametime and getting them out and thengetting them all to get into the moodfor math and then snap out of it and getinto the mood for englishwriting classes or whateverit's it's it's not easyumand billions of tons of pointless paperin pointless textbooks which yeah youknow get updated every i'm i'm sureyou're aware of like the the wholescamthe textbooks you know that yeahbusiness i mean that's that's shockingabsolutely shocking what's going onthere i mean you want to talk about oneuse plastic how many kids have got like50 pieces of one used plastic in theirpencil cases sitting on this like youknowall of these crazy narratives that we'vejust been having to listen to for for solongum but then you know if you were tochallenge challenge the system againyou just trigger so many people but iwanted to um i wanted to uh point to uha quote of yours from from your yourchapter in the fiat standard which uh iwanted to bring up with you and kind ofuhlean on umeducation no longer needs to be met uhsorry excuse me education no longerneeds to meet the needs and aspirationsof the student to help themsucceed in life it needs to meet thepolitical gains of the source of fearthat is so true now did you know of anorganization safecalledpisanookay this is the um no it's the pisaprogram actually it's run by the uhthe uh oecduh and the pisa program is umprogram for international studentassessmentright sobasically the pisa programcountries uh they put forth their umtheir 15 year old's ability in readingscience and math so obviously they taketheir um their 15 year olds uhtestsum and submit them to the oecd who runthis league table of which countries aresupposedly doing a better job witheducation than the other ones so we'vegot a pretty clear incentive right forum you know what what are they gonna dowell the first thing they're gonna do istry and pick the top students or whatand this happens every three years sothis is not a yearly thing so everythree years with this pisa assessmentcomes around this programnext year is going to be one so theytake the results so that cohort of 15year olds whoever's next year is justgoing to be whipped and whipped andwhipped because they want the bestresults possible but on the other endwhich i find more distressing is thosestudents that are not deemed to be goodenough or up to scratchthey get off-rolledso they just disappear from the uh thethe state school register now in the ukum it was apparently reported that 10000 studentshad uh disappeared from the state schoolsystem um to avoid having their resultsmarked in the last visa assessmentso what the hell is going on that is theexact thing that you talked about inthat in that sentence thereit's the incentive for the governmentand the fear to make it look as thoughtheir education system is doing betterthan anybody else's meanwhilethey the students they just don't careyou do well or you don't existit's nonsenseyeah you know an interesting idea ishould have uh added perhaps maybe i'llget to add it to the fiat standardalthough i've shipped it off to thepublishersbut i think they'll let me out of thisthere's a there's an old saying i forgetthe i think it's good hearts law i thinkthat's the name of it which is thatwhatever metric is targeted stops beingusefulif you'reif you're trying to aim for achieving aspecific metricthat metric is going to stop meaninganything because it's going to bemanipulated and it's going to becomethe target of human action in itself andthen you can bring the metric downwithoutchanging the underlying reality which iswhat you actually care aboutand fiat education is a great example ofthis sohow do we know if all of this money thatwe're spending on kids is being usedcorrectlywell we test them all right so then wetest them so how do we make a good testhow do we make a test thatreflects things so we come up with atest and thenthe entire education process becomesabout getting the right result on thetestnot just the studentsfor themselves but also the students forthe school to get its money and sothis is really i think what fiat doeseverywhere um and it's it's a it's along themeit's a running theme in the fiatstandardin particular in the second section ofthe fiat standard which is let'sapply this mental framework and see ifit helps us understand the mess in whichwe find modern education modern scienceand modern nutrition in particularmodern dietaryrecommendations on the food industry andi think it's extremely powerful becauseyou see this over and over and overagain you have people in positions ofmonopoly powerpeople that you have to get yourservices from you know you have your ownyour local mafia of public schooling andyou can only join them or you have yourlocal mafiaof uh dietary advice and you can onlyjoin them and you have your local mafiaofyour global mafia of food producers andyou have to own the heat from them wellwe you know we don't have to yet butthey're working on it they're going tostart trying to ban meat very soon itlooks like itso you have these monopolydecision makersand they're not getting paid by theircustomers they're getting paid by fiatthey're getting paid by the moneyprinter which is essentially devaluingeverybody else andthe the main impact is having is that itis removing thefeedback between the market and theparticipants in the marketand the providersbecause now you don't have to pleaseyour uhcustomer anymore you just have to pleasethe people who are paying the fiatdegrees and you see this over and overand over again and i think education isa perfect example of this and one onevery fascinating story about this isyou look at thecost ofpublic schooling education per studentif you measure how much money publicschools spendthere's this great guy called coreydeangelis i'm sure you must know him ontwitterhe'she's a he's a freedom of choice ineducation advocate and he brings up someincredible incredible facts which youdon't hear about often and one of themis that he did a comparison between thecost ofthe best uh private schools in thewashington dc areathe best best private school that youcould get your kids intoand then you compare thatto how much public schooling spends perstudent and actuallypublic schooling is more expensive perstudent it costs more money to send kidsto these dysfunctionalcrime-ridden drug-riddenpublic schoolshell holes basicallythan it does to send them to the mostexpensive school inthearea in the us capital and the reason isthe most expensive school is a freemarket school they can't keep studentsat the door so they're alwaysthey're always running a tight shipthey're always working afor a tightropethey're always having tooptimize theirperformance they cut they're alwayshaving to cut the waste they're alwayshaving to make sure they get theirrevenue in the door whereas the publicschools have none of that and so evenwith the crappiest buildings and thecrappiest teachers and thecrappiest supplies possible they stillmanage to outspendthe mostprestigious and most expensive schoolsin the areayeah it's nuts yeah i i follow coreyyeah man he's doing some great work uhyeahit shocks me like you read through thereplies under some of his uh tweets uhand you know he all he's doing isdropping truth bombsbut it just triggers so many peoplebecause people just make thatthey're just trapped in it when you'retrapped in a system you'll neverquestion it it's you know classicstockholm syndromeand you know if you're if you're uh thepeople most trapped in the system ofcourse are they uh public schooleducatorswho are the most ardent defenders of thesystem and you'll see them answeringcorey'stweets with their uh semi-literateanswersi'm saying that you know no we have toget the kids learning quicklybecause otherwise if the kids don'tlearn then you know things are going tobe badthat's generally the kind of gist oftheir argument and their mindit's you knowit's it's the thing that you run intowith all kinds of status ideas where ifyou oppose somethingbeing provided by the statethe status can only imagine that youoppose that thing existing at all likeyou want to ban kids from learning toreadthis is what it means if you opposepublic educationbut of coursewhat he makes clear and i think we seethis in many many sectors is that whenyou just do thiswhen you have free competition ratherthan monopoly and when you have theconsumers paying rather than fiat payingthen you end upwith a much betteroutcome for the consumers ultimatelyyeah absolutelyall right who's got uh questionsi have a questionthank you a very very interestingdiscussion umso one question is at the beginning youmentioned thatthere are onlineum tools that can be very helpful to toeducate your kids um which which youknow it's very good to hear i'm not toofamiliar but i'm happy to hear that onecomment and question i have on that isum i mean i also believe that thepurpose of education or going to schoolis not justlearning facts and being exposed totheir curriculum but also to socializethe key to be able to interact withother kids we are extremely socialanimals as you as you as you probablyagree with me right um so what would yousay to that what's what's theif a kid spends too much time onlinethen how would you replace thesocialization aspectwhich is supposed to be in my opinion astrongelement of a good school systemuh to to give you an example of of howour kids are using uh one of theseedtechtools uh they they use galileoxp.comokay and that's where they're doingtheir socializing that's where they'rehanging out with kids uh and what i loveabout it is they'rethey're not forced into hanging out withthe same kids every lessonor every daythey get to hang out with kids that arenot even their own age so you know youmight have eight-year-olds in uh in thesame club as a 13 year old which ireally enjoy to see because then you youhave this um kind ofand they're from all over the worlddifferent cultures as well um so thatthat for me is umway moreuhsocialof a setting than would be a classroomwhere you're forced to sit down and openyour books and be quiet and not even beable to talk to somebody else but uh onthe first call that safe and i did we wereally debunked the socialization uhmyth souh if you missed that one make sure youyeah okay um so i don't want to repeattoo muchbut i think we did go over it for abouta good 20 minutes 30 minutes maybe okaybut so you think that spendingtime in person physically with others isalso importantyeah yeah 100 uh and that for us that'sdone via um you know just interactionswith friends joining sports clubs ordance clubs music clubs whatever it iswhatever the kids interested in that'swhere they go and have their physicaland social interactions and of coursebirthday parties whatever that they getum uh invited to that's that's actualsocialization whereas i find school tobe the opposite i i find school to beanti-socialit's um it's it's forcing kidswhomight not have anything in common witheach other to spend hours a day witheach otherthe same kids for maybe as long as 12yearsand they're not even really allowed tospeak to each other during the daywhen they're in lesson timethat's not that social when you get toyou get to play time or recreationwhatever you want to call it and youspend most of that time avoiding thepeople you know you don't likerather than being socialall right thank you thank you that'svery helpful really appreciate yourproblemall right anybody else have any morequestions they wanted to ask danielpeterso daniel for people that are interestedin homeschooling their children butdon't have a lot of time what's the oneresource aboveall the others that you mentioned thatyou think people shouldcheck out firstuh sir ken robinson's ted talk for mewasone of the most pivotal moments in ourdecision-making processuh thehis original one he's got three tedtalks uh the original one is called uhdo schools kill creativitythatwasmaybe i watched it at the right timemaybe we were primed for it i don't knowbut i remember watching it and then justwatching it again and again and it wasjust such anamazingwell-given speechvery hard hittingandjust made me start and my wife startreally questioning all the things thatsafe and i have been talking about likeyou know we hadn't questioned the systemto that pointmy god no you know i had a decent enoughjobgood enough that my wife didn't have towork so she could bemum and you know do the school runs andand all of that kind of stuff and we'vedone the private schooling uh we've donethe kindergarten and we've done you knowall of the usual nine to five fearlife stuff you know we were in it andseeing that speech was like whoa hang ona minute what did that guy just sayand that really did start me down thepath of uhit's like bitcoin isn't it as soon asyou start following the rabbit andchallenging the narrative there's alwaysan extra little nugget to findso that's if anybody wants just oneresource i would say yeah gogo there go watch that speechbrilliant thank youthank youanybody else have any more questionsdaniel i have one more question i'mcurious to hearyour take on thisumand in the western society it's becomingmore and more common and accepted tojust move away fromfrom your place of birth in search ofyou know more money more economicopportunity which means the the familystructure is not there anymore you knowmy my family is in italy i mean unitedstatesmy wife's family is in romania so peopletend to be spread out rightand and andkind of start to realize that this isprobably not a positive development inmany ways right it's good to have yourgrandparents parents and childrentogetherwhat are your thoughts about that umand how did you experience it in yourlifeyeah thatthat's been very umyeahthat's beena very key part of our life actuallybecause we moved my wife and i movedaway from the uk in 99 uh so at thatpoint we didn't have any kids so my kidshave grown up the whole time away fromtheir their grandparents and extendedfamilyuh so yeah i mean itcould be difficult at times you wouldthink oh i wish we just had thegrandparents around the corner uh itwould be nice um if they were you know abigger part of each other's livesumbut i guessit was justit was just one of those things that'sthat's just where we found ourselvesand that the situation at the timeumit's easier now with with zoom uh youknow skype used to be good enough but uhzoom's even better uh but it's not thesame that's not the same as having likethe physical contact and whatever elsethat's obviously much nicerum but we got to a point wherewe were now living in france we wereonlya couple of hours away so we could be toengland uh three or four times a yearthey could be here once or twice a yearso we were getting the interactionobviously nothing in the last two yearswe won't go intointo that um but uh yeah it'sit's definitely something worthconsidering if you um depending on youknow how tight your family isuhand um you know that the role that youwant um grandparents to play or even ifgrandparents want to play a role this isuh you know one thing some somegrandparents are like nah done uh i hadmy kids uh i'm not gonna not gonna spendmy time looking after yours which hashappened a lot in the uk becauseboth parents are workingand they still can't afford the daycarenanny and granddad end up picking up theum picking up the threadsand they end up looking after the kidsthree or four days a week and it's likethat causes even more familial problemsso it's um i know it's that there's noexact answer um but uhyeah i guess that's uh that's mythoughtsthank youyeah i think um this is another aspectumi'm just going to start insufferablyalways referring everything to the fiatstandard from now onand tell myself that it's actuallymarketing to justify ityeah do it umyou know when i just whyin the fiat stand in the chapter on fiatlife um you know the first chapter inthat section is on time preference andhow fiat changes people's timepreference because we can't saveand therefore we start discounting thefuture more and i think one way in whichthis manifests is that the family losesits importance becausewe expect more and morethat first of all we don't expect oursavings to last so the role of thefamily in providing and passing onsavingsis diminishedand therefore that weakensthe incentivefor people to stick together you knowwhy should you care for your father whenhe's not going to give you moneyand on the other handumthethe essential function of the family isto take care of the family members whenthey're very young and very oldand that gets undermined becausewhen they're young the government isproviding for them increasingly and whenthey're old the government is providingfor them increasingly as wellso there's little incentive for kids tolisten to their parents there's littleincentive foradults to provide for their uh grant forfor their elderly parentsand these bonds become weaker and soyou know obviously family is stillimportant for a lot of people but it'snot as important as it was a couplehundred years ago because back then itwas literally life and death if youdidn't have a familyit was very hard to make it out in theworld on your own yeah you know youlife was very hard as it is before wehad ummassiveuse of uh modern hydrocarbon energy andbefore the industrial revolution lifewas pretty hard for most people you hadto work all day a lot of the time inorder to scrape together a livingsoyou had to have a family to do that youhad to have kids and you had to have thekids around you when you got old andeverybody supported each other it's farless important right nowpartly of course because of theadvancements of technology but also ithink partly because of the interventionof fiat in the system that makes thismuch more uhmakes it much more powerful ummakes the government much more powerfuland thereforeweakens the family bonds and this iskind of an an uhan evolutionary adaptiveuhfunction of the state the state willnaturally growto undermine the family and will growmore when it undermines the family moreand so it's going tonaturally be hostile to the family andit will undermine and i thinkthe the undermining of the umlarge familyof the extended familyuh isan enormous part of the problem of whykids need to go to school in the firstplaceum ifum you know i i don't come from a bigfamilybutas i've grown older i've gotten toreally appreciate it i think it would beumi think it's justpeople massively underestimate how muchof an asset it is to have severalsiblings um and then to go on and haveseveral kids and to have several unclesand ants on both sides it's just anenormous asset in life these are peoplevery similar to you who are highlylikely to love you and take care of youand help you out andi'd much ratheruh go through life with this and if youthink about it from that perspective ifpeople hadlarge extended families and you knowthey'd the kids would always have thingsto do um they'd be in a safe spacebecause it's an area you know where theextended family lives so there's a lotof area for them towalk around and be surrounded bypeople who are family or at leastfriends of family and relatives offamilyandthe natural synergy that exists therebetween the grandparents and thechildrenis incredible you know i've seenrecentlysome research where a bunch of fiatscientists took some kids to umtook kids to uma retirement home and got the kids totalk to the retireesand it was great for the kids and it wasgreat for the retirees who could haveknown who could have imagined thatum generations uh interacting with oneanother would be beneficial for bothit's only beenpart of human society foreverin every human society that has everexistedsowe've undermined that becauseyou knowwe have small nuclear families andthey're independent and they'reseparated from one another and so thekids don't have extended family to spendtime with the the notion that uhi mean in a senseit's kind of unhealthy that if you havetwo kids and you knoweven even if the parents are stayinghome with the kidsthey're just interacting with one otherkid and two adults and that'snot very healthydoesn't mean the school is idealbut it would be far healthier if youknow a kid grew up i think in a placesurrounded bymany more kids and adults that arefamily that take care of them that umyou can trust them aroundand that'sthat's being undermined massivelyand it's umi think this is this is really the kindof deeper structural answer to theproblem of what do we do about uhkids um and how do kids spend their timeyeah if they had five siblings and 45cousins living within500 meters of each otherall of themthat wouldn't be an issueno exactly um one one thing umi kind of wanted to tell you aboutbecause i'm not sure whether you haveeven seen this kind of meme it's it'svery prevalent in the uk but there'ssomething called uh skiing umaimed at the boomer generation so allthe grandparents uh and it's umbut it's an acronym for going on a skiholiday for example the acronym ski isspend kids inheritancehow fear is thatthat is exactly what you were talkingabout you know don't save for the futuredon't say fear or generations just goout and spend it and that of coursewillhave an effect on because theyeven my parents say it from time to timeoh yeah well we're going uh you knowwe've been out skiing today we boughtsome new furniture and like it's it'sall tongue-in-cheek butit's like god damn you're falling forthe fear meaning that's going onwithout even realizing it and it's it'spretty it's pretty sick and it's um it'sit's done purposefullytoto get them spending and um i thinkyou're right like uh the state has aninterest inyou knowcertainly has an interest in dividingfamilies look what it's done the lasttwo yearsand if you look at uk brexit that wassplit 50 50.that split familieslook at the the us politics now in umyeah in in the u.s obviously that splitsfamilies this all works in the state'sfavorabsolutelyit's uh yeah it is depressingbut then again hey let's not forget wehave bitcoin and bitcoin fixes thisyou paid me to ityesit's amazing that whatever happens inthe world we can always end on thispositive note because we know thatbitcoin fixes it all the only questionsoutstanding are just how bitcoin willfix it so will we head to a world inwhichpeoplehave uhmoreyou know kids justrun around free range or will we getgood schools because i'm still not readyto kind of entirely write off the ideathat sending kids to a specialized placeif it's run effectively and efficientlyon a marketthey could learn and they could have funand they could spendsome time there and i think you knowmaybe the market will develop somethinghealthy like thisum even when there isn't uh all of thedistortion fiat providesyeah butwhatever it does we know that bitcoinwill fix itsure i mean more schools like thesudbury valley style kind of school ithink would be a great place to startwhere kids have the choice you know doyou have that specialized place you haveadults there that are going to superviseand are going to help and are going tomentor but there's no compulsion it'snot compulsory for the kids to turn upevery day and follow the same thing theyturn up one day perhaps they want tolearn maths you go find that guy that'sgoing to sit down and help you learnthrough math perhaps you don't perhapsyou want to go and play the trumpet yougo and find someone that's going to helpyou learn how to play the trumpet orgive you access to a youtube videothat's going to teach you knowit's just having this choice you don'thave that at school zeroyou are a drone and controlledevery minute of the dayand at the same time toldbe yourself like you said earlieryou know it's double speak it's completedouble speak be yourself be true toyourself sit down shut upbut answer what we tell youyeahthis is the answers two plus two is fivewait till that turns up in the textbookswon't belongall right well thank you so much danielagain for
