forjoining us thank you safe it's apleasure to be with you and to see somefamiliar names on theuh the seminar list excellent well firstof all I'm going to begin with a littlebit of a confessionum I have not prepared for a podcastepisode as much as I have prepared forthis one you've spent a lifetime writingso much and I've been reading your workfor almost 20 years now though Iremember the first time I picked a bookof yours it was the war of the world Ipicked it up in Heathrow I had a flightto New York and I read it uh most of iton the flight I couldn't sleep thatflight I just kept reading at it it wasreally really interesting I've read somuch of your work over the time youproduced a mountain of uh excellent workand there's so much we could talk abouttoday and so many questions that I wouldlike to discuss with you but I think ifI were to narrow it down the things thatI'm most concerned about discussing areprobably World War One history monetaryhistory and of course Bitcoin which isreally the uh the main topic that wediscussed around these parts of theinternetso uh you've probably not discussed thisuh recently very much it's probably oneof your books that you've received thesequestions upon but perhaps the book ofyours that I find the most interestingis the pity of War on World War one Ifind that to be a very very fascinatingbook and it's uh quite powerful in itsconclusions because it lies against theconventional wisdom on World War One inparticular uh you argue that war was notinevitable and um in general I think onething that I like about your work isthat you don't argue that history wasset in stone history is not uh overdetermined it's like we're taking a walkin a garden with many paths and we justhappen to take in one of the paths andeach path leads to many other uh Forksdown the road and we just keep takingindividual ones but there's nothingpredetermined about most of thesediverges and I think uh perhaps the mostintriguing possibilities the idea thatworld war one was not inevitable thatworld war one was not uh something thathad to happen and it didn't have tohappen in the way that it did and itdidn't have to leave the world with sucha bloody and the influential Legacy thatcontinues to be with us really untiltoday so uh could you perhaps begin withgiving us a little bit about yourperspective about why the war was notinevitable why World War one was notenough to but it's true that I wrotethat book quite a long time ago in the1990s but I've continued to think aboutthe question ofthe first world war it was a an eventthat dramatically altered the worlduh it it really began the process ofunraveling the European Empire'sdominance of the world which had beenestablished in the 18th and 19thcenturiesas a as a boy it was probably the firsthistorical event that interested me Ican remember looking at ajp Taylor'sIllustrated history of the war when Iwas a Schoolboy and thinking uh how Ineeded to understand better the eventsthat had turned my grandfather JohnFerguson's life upside down when he'dstill been a teenagerthe thing that frustrated me when Ibegan studying history seriously atOxfordwas the insistence of a really largebody of scholarship particularly Germanhistoriography that the war wasinevitablethat one could in fact Trace its Originsback to the unification of Germany anduh from that moment on some historiansseem to argue Europe was honored aninevitable a collision course uhdestined for a conflagration I began tohave doubts about that view of the pastthe more closely I studied the originsof the war now the origins of the firstworld war is one of those topics thathas generated a library full of of booksand for a period of time I I read a lotof those books and the more I read aboutthe events that led up to the outbreakof war in August 1914 the more it struckme that there were contingencies themore alive I became to thecounterfactuals the alternativescenarios that might have played out asyou get deeper into historical researchas you pass from reading the textbook tothe monographto the archival research I think youbecome more aware of these contingenciesbecause as you read the letters ofcontemporaries you see that they did notknow in June of 1914 that there would bea global conflict that would last fourand a quarter years and terminate thelives of more than 10 million uh mostlyyoung men people did not really have asense that that was a a base casescenario I was writing the history ofthe Rothschilds bank at the same time asthe pity of war was getting written Ihad a curious period when I was writingtwo books at once the Rothschild'scorrespondence makes it clear that theoutbreak of the war came as a surpriseeven to the best informed people surethere had been small conflicts prior tothe outbreak of the war and the Balkansmost obviously but the sense that youcould end up with a global conflict ofsuch scale and duration that reallywasn't something that that people weretalking about in the summer 1914 and itgradually dawned on me that the thingthat was inevitable or was highly likelywas a war between Germany and Russiathat that had become increasinglyprobable over time and that in such awar it was highly likely thatAustria-Hungary would side with Germanyand France with Russia but what was notinevitable was British intervention andindeed Britain did not have any formalcommitment to intervene in the case ofsuch a war so to bring my excessivelylong answer to conclusion what I triedto show in the pity of war was thatBritain's decision for war was a highlycontingent thing driven by a variety ofdomestic political calculations but onthe 2nd of August 1914 when the Britishcabinet met to make their decision onwhether or not to support France andtherefore Russia it was by no meansclear before that meeting which way itwould go and indeed if you'd asked theparticipants they would probably haveexpected not to intervene because theythey mostly thought Lloyd George thechancellor of the excherical would beagainst uh going to war and in fact hedidn't take that position uh partly forhis own political ambition it ended upbeing a good call by Lloyd Georgebecause he ended up becoming primeminister during the war and successionasworth but I tried to show that thatwas a meeting which could have gone adifferent way but for I think LloydGeorge's decision uh it's quite easy toimagine the liberal government notintervening perhaps falling from powerbut it would have taken time for a newgovernment to be formed and in that timeuh it might have been uh too late tosend the British expeditionary forcethat was a crucial intervention there'sa scenario in other words acounterfactual scenario in a paralleluniverse in which the war happens inEurope but it doesn't become a world warbecause Britain doesn't intervene and itdoesn't become a global war that lastsfour and a half a quarter years becauseGermany actually can win it if it's onlyfighting against France and Russia therewas a distinct probability that Germanywould win that war when you look at thecasualties the French suffered in thefirst six months they were absolutelydevastating France and Russia would nothave been able to keep the war goingmuch Beyond 1916 if Britain had not beenon their side and so you end up with adifferent kind of War there's a greatEuropean War it lasts about two yearsand Germany wins it and that creates acompletely different world from theworld that we have known over the lastcentury or so yeah and generally I thinkpeopleum think of this as beingunthinkably heretic how what would uhhow dare you want to see Germany win thewar but it's World War One we're talkingabout here not World War II and sothere's a hugely different war and sopeople's judgment is generally coloredby thinking of Germany as being theGermany of World War II but in fact ifGermany had won that war as I think youargued quite convincingly we would nothave had the Germany of World War II itwould not have had the rise of midnightand I think the the powerful argumentyou make which is we what we would havegotten out of that in 1916 or 1917 wouldhave been similar to what the EuropeanUnion look Union looks like a centurylater but I said that as a provocationat the time and it certainly succeededin provoking people but I argued that ifyou travel to Germans as well intomaking it through and well in a sense Ithink that the argument's not quite asmuch of a provocation as I thought itwas at the time the the key point isthat if if Britain had not intervenedBritain had stayed out then German waraims would have been different and acore German war aim would have been tocreate some kind of central EuropeanCustoms Union which Germany would havedominated uh it's not likely thatGermany would have attempted to Annexall are part of Belgium that that wouldhave been to risk bringing Britain intothe war so you have to imagine morecircumscribed German war aims and youalso have to remember that if you don'thave a war that lasts until 1917-18 youdon't have a Russian Revolution if youdon't have a Russian Revolution then thewhole history of Eastern Europe looksradically different and a great dealmore benign the Germany of let's say1916 in this kind of scenario wouldstill have been a parliamentary regimethat is to say the reichstag would stillhave been a powerful institution it'snot correct to say that Kaiser bilham IIwas some kind of dictator or for thatmatter that the great general staff rana military dictatorship it really didn'tactually Germany was more democraticthan Britain at that time because thefranchise was Universal male suffrage sofrom the vantage point of not onlyGermans but also most people inContinental Europe and especially inEastern Europe uh this would have been afar less disastrous outcome than what infact happened which was the RussianRevolution and the continuation of thewar in the form of the Russian Civil Warafter that Revolution that was acatastrophic event that led to anenormous number of of deaths andestablished the uh truly Dreadfultyranny of the Bolsheviks over theRussian Empire so in the counterfactualworld where the war is limited itdoesn't last so long it doesn't becomeGlobal you actually avoid the RussianRevolution uh at least you avoid aRussian Revolution that puts theBolsheviks in power and that surely is apreferable world to the world that wegot absolutely I think the amount ofhuman suffering that would have beenavoided without the rise of Hitler andthe rise of the bolshiks would have beenenormous and Britain didn't really standto gain much I think this is the reallytragic thing about it it isn't as ifBritain had a lot of interests to followthere because in Britain's interest atthat time was primarily focused on itsEmpire rather than Europe and so Germanycould have gotten in Europe and Britaincould have gotten the Empire and itwould have probably saved a lot ofBloodshed over the last hundred years orso what did you say well the British uhproblem was that they had failed tochoose you could either make acontinental commitment to preserve theexisting order in Europe but if you didthat you had to commit to a large armythat would be sufficient to deterGermany from going to war and you you'dwant to have formalized that securityguarantee to France the liberalgovernment was very hostile to the ideaof conscription and it didn't want tomake a formal commitment to France oranybody else and so what you ended upwith was the worst possible combinationthat the foreign secretaries the Redwoodgray privately said to the French thatthat Britain would come in but thatwasn't actually something that he eversaid publicly and Britain didn't have alarge army and that was one reason thatthe German general staff didn't reallyworry about British intervention theydidn't think that the relatively smallBritish exhibitionary force would makethat big a difference in the conflict onon land of course the British Navy wasthe biggest in the world and the Germansunderestimated the importance of theBritish Navy as a threat to their theirWar economy but from from a Britishpoint of view to intervene in this warwithout an army of any size meant thatyou had to build the Army while fightingthe Germans who had the best army in theworld at that point and that led prettyquickly if you think about it to thecatastrophe of the battle of the Sommewhen you had very hastily assembled anda fairly horridly trained armiesconducting offensive operations againstuh the heavily entrenched and extremelywell-trained German army that thatproduced The Great military disasters ofthe middle part of the war and and youlost a colossal number of peopleremember death toll in World War one washigher in relative terms for Britainthan in World War II and uh and the costof course not only in in life but alsoin Treasure was colossal Britain emergedfrom World War one with a much largerdebt burden and it was far harder tosustain the Empire after 1918 with thatdebt burden uh because ultimately youyou'd lost not only a very large part ofthe generation that fought the War butyou had I think fundamentally saddleBritain with an unsustainable uh debtburden and and although the BritishEmpire kept on going and indeed wasstill a going concern even after WorldWar II I think the roots of its Declineand fall lay in its failure to to choosethere was a count of action in which aunionist or conservative governmentcommitted to a continental strategy andraised an army of comparable size to theFrench or German Army but Britain chosenot to do that and I think that was afatal mistakeyeah and I think um a really fascinatingstory which emerged in 2017 so a fullCentury after this which I start off uhthe Fiat standard my last book I startedoff with that uh with the revelation ofthese documents it was uh it was a studyconducted by a man named John Osbornewho was working at the back of the 1920sand he wrote a study called unpublishedWar history the bank of England that waspublished that was written for the bankof England archive in the 1920s and uhit was only emerged in 2017 uh somebodywas digging into the attics of the bankof England andum this this is new information that hadnever been as far as I could telldiscussed before and I think it waspretty clear that was never discussedbefore but it seems to support yourconclusion very strongly because itrevealed a couple of things thathappened the first one is that the bankof England had actually made anannouncement in 1915 which very fewpeople had seemed to have mentioned Ithink in in the pity of War you say thatEngland had not suspended uh theRedemption of gold and they didn'tformally suspend it but they did sort oflean on their post offices in the banksto take the gold from people and onlymake payment to receive payment in Goldwherever is possible and to only makepayment in paperandum that's you know generally now youknow whenever you have problems withthat that means there's serious problemson the balance sheet you don't get tothat point unless you've got seriousproblems and then uh the other thingthat was going on which I found trulyamazing is that uh the the financialtime has said that the war bond issuehad been oversubscribed that everybodyhad bought the bonds in the Britishpublic that was very enthusiastic aboutgoing to the bondin the bitsy of War you said the Britishpeople weren't enthusiastic about thewar but uh it turns out that all theBritish people that only bought a thirdof those bonds and two-thirds of thoseBonds were bought by two employees thebank of Englandum with a credit line from the bank ofEnglandum there wasn't they didn't buy withtheir own cash they bought it with thecredit line from the bank of England andthen the financial time reported uh thatthe issuance was oversubscribed and thenone of our uh Mutual admiration uh a manwho has a mutual admiration John MaynardKeynes who was at the treasury at thattime he wrote to the bank of England uhcommanding them for what he called amasterly manipulation wherein they madethe public believe that the public hadbought the bonds when in fact the publichad only bought a third of the bonds nowwhen you when you add this kind ofevidence to the stuff that's in the pityof war and this is reading I'll confesslike this is what I really wanted totalk to you about I wonder what do youthink about it because it seems tosupport your views in the pity of Warvery uh conclusively yeah the Britishpeople weren't uh involved and if we hadslightly less dishonest people in chargeof the Central Bank and the treasury atthat time and the back of England thetreasury of that time they wouldn't havebeen able to pull it off and theywouldn't have been able to mobilize forthe warwell I haven't uh read those documentsthat you you refer to and uh so I shouldbe careful about what I say that the keything to remember is that in the mindsof officials at the treasury and thebank of Englanduh there was a perfectly familiarprecedent or at least familiar to thosewho were historically minded because itlay a hundred years or so in the pastand that was the way in which Britainhad fought France during theRevolutionary Napoleonic Wars at thattime uh the suspension of conversibilityinto gold had been the order of the dayat that time uh the the bank of Englandhad played the role of help meet to thetreasury it was well understood byBritish civil servants that in time ofWar you suspended the rules that appliedin peacetime it was also understood thatthat would have inflationaryconsequences but that was the the natureof War Finance this was something thatKeynes was very familiar with and hadthought a good deal about continue tothink about the same issue in World WarII but I don't think it was seen as asdishonesty I think it was seen as theexceptional things you do in time of WarSmart jeweleric Eye and Paul schmeltzingare working on a paperwhich hasn't yet been published uh oncentral bank balance sheets uh over thelong run based on Paul's exceptionalwork uh in his doctoral dissertation onuh debt markets over the long run andwhat's clear is that for central bankbalance sheets to expand in time of warwas quite normal uh and indeed you cansee that in most of the big conflictsnot in the Bank of England but othercentral banks played a significant roleuh in war financing so what happened uhin in World War one wasn't withoutprecedent it was really fairly normalthe thing that was new was the scale ofthe war which turned out to be largerbecause of the new technologies of theindustrial era uh and and so it was thesame kind of methods but being appliedto a much larger scale conflict uh thansay even in the time of of Napoleon sothat was I think that's the way to thinkabout this uh and and Keynes knew fullwell that there would be all kinds ofchallenges particularly as Britain beganto rely on the United States uh as asource of of supply and of creditors uhthe the problem for Britain uh in the20th century was that it couldn't winits world wars without U.S financial andultimately Military Support uh so yeah Ithink one can see that uh in 1914 1918the the problems of War Finance veryquickly manifested themselvesI'll say one last thingabout war enthusiasm uh there's a kindof legend about the popularity of ofworld war one which I tried to refute uhin the pity of War not surprisingly mostpeople uh were in fact quite unnerved atthe prospects of a general European Warespecially as it involved themobilization uh of very large uhproportions of the male population[Music]when it comes to war bonds uh it'sactually quite a risky thing to investin in the sense that if you invest in awar Bonner your country loses the waryou're likely to be wiped out just askRussians who who invested in tsaristmoderns uh which ended up beingdefaulted on entirely by the Bolsheviksuh so one bonds have to pay some kind ofpremiums to attract investors theproblem for uh Britain and Germanyindeed all the competence was you didn'treally want to pay the big premium thatyou would need to pay to get massivepublic subscription and that's one ofthe reasons why you had to get centralbanks involved that was even more truein Germany and the Germans had theadditional problem that they couldn'tactually sell German war bonds uh in NewYork the way the British and uh andtheir allies were able to yeah and Ithink um what is apparent from thatstudy by John Osborne which I mentionedis throughout the war the bank ofEngland continued to collect the goldfrom the post offices and the banks ofthe country and uh give the people thepapers which of course was translated toprice rises even though they hadn'tformally suspended the gold standardbecause that would have been unspeakablyunpopular that time I think if they saidwe need to fight this war and we need toget off the gold standard then we needto revalue the currency that would havebeen a non-starter I think anygovernment would have lost the trust ofthe parliament and or Parliament wouldhave been hung then they would have hadthe re-election this was this was acompletely non-starter so the way thatthey managed to do it was to formallycontinue to maintain the same rate ofexchange between gold and Sterling butcollect the gold and then print more andmore paper money in people's hands andthen uh blame the Horizon prices onum the war but what becomes reallyinteresting is from this study is thatThey confiscated 14.7 million ounces ofgold which is about 455 tons of goldwhich is an enormous amount most ofwhich was sent to the United States tofinance the credit so this is really theroots of British dependence on the U.Sand it is effectively I mean with thisgigantic movement of gold which islarger than Britain's gold reservestoday because today's gold reserves inBritain are around I think 290 tons sothis is much larger than the gold thatthey have left today with that movementof money to the US in order to financecredit line I think this wasum you know as the goals gold as goespower and it was this that was uh reallythe UK giving up its Global power inorder to finance this war that umarguably they shouldn't have been takenpart in well yes and no I think havingmade the decision to intervene uhobviously Britain had to win and itcouldn't win without American suppliesand ultimately American intervention Youcould argue that in order to achievethose things uh Britain played uh anabsolutely masterly game there wereplenty of pro-german and anti-britishpeople in the United States in 1914 itwas not a foregone conclusion that theUnited States would end up takingBritain's side in fact it was about thehardest thing politically that WoodrowWilson ever had to to do but Britain didlots to help uh it did a lot to help forexample by intercepting German cabletraffic uh and making sure that theUnited States uh saw the ZimmermanTelegram which was an important part ofof making the case for war againstGermany in in the United States I wouldalso argue that if you if you thinkabout what Britain got for its money gotfor its goal it was a it was a prettygood deal because the United States uhacted as quote the Arsenal democracythat that's a World War II phrase butsupplied a tremend tremendous amount ofthe uh the ammunition and other suppliesthat the uh the British and French andRussian armies needed because whatBritain did was it was essentially aconduit for American funding to reachless credit worthy uh members of theAnton's uh France and and Russia and andthat what worked out well in the sensethat Germany was defeated uh ultimatelydespite the fact that the Germans beatthe Russians caused the collapse ofstarism in 1917 despite the fact thatthe French had more or less ceased to beuh viable militarily by 1917uh Britain ends up winning world war oneand Germany suffers a disastrouscollapseat the point of victoryuh at the end of 1918.you would be I think forgiven for sayingthat Britain had managed to snatchVictory from the jaws of defeat and hadovercome the weakness that it had in1914 namely that it didn't have a largeland Army by 1918 Britain did have a lablarge land Army it also had an extremelywell equipped land Army that was able todefeat the German Army in the fieldemphatically and partly it was able todo so because of American supports Ithink if one thinks of it that way andremember the ultimate goal was wasVictory after August the spec in 1914then I think Britain achieved that andat the end of World War One the Strikingthing is the Britain's Empire is stillentirely intact and indeed grows in sizebecause Britain's able to acquire uhGerman uh colonies and Turkishpossessions with the breakup of theOttoman Empire the United States isn'tactually the dominant power in the worldin 1918 not least because Wilson cannotcarry the U.S Senate with him he cannotget ratification for the peace and theLeague of Nations so in the end Americanpower is only temporary then Retreatsinto a period of isolation leavingBritain and to a lesser extent Fran'sdominance so I don't think one wants toreap British decline too far back intothe story I argue that Britain has apretty good shot at reestablishing itsdominance the problems come in the 1930swhen a much more dangerous Germanyemerges under Hitler and once againBritain fails to deter that Germany fromgoing to war there I think one can seethe seeds have decline much more clearlythan in 1914-18 yeah although I think II think those are interrelated in thesense that on the one hand the rise ofHitler came about because of the uhessentially the empiric victory of WorldWar one which was to get you then walkeddown in World War II and also on theother hand because of the financialproblems which were to carry on I meanat the end at the end of the day theGreat Depression itself was essentiallya consequence of World War One Financein fact if you I don't know how familiaryou are with the work of the Martyrothbard the Austria School Economistbut he presents the chain of events thatled to the Great Depression as havingbeen inextricably linked to World Warone so it was the monetary expansion inWorld War one that had led to theproblems the Britain British had in the1920s which was that they couldn't goback to the gold standard at theprevalent pre-war rate which had beenaround for a couple of centuries andbecause they didn't have enough goldthey'd print too much money and theywanted to square the circle of trying togo back on this and the way that theytried to do that was to try and get theBritish and the French to print more andmore money essentially to stop thebleeding of gold from Britain because byuh undervaluing golden Britain that itcaused the uh an exodus of gold fromBritain to the U.S and so to a largeextent I think the inflationary monetarypolicy of the 1920s that led to theGreat Depression had its roots inBritain trying to export its inflationto the US to try and manage and stem theexit of moneyum all of which is kind of my veryelaborate way of sayingnone of this would have been a problemif they all stayed on the gold standardwhat did you say well I have a slightlydifferent view because I think the goldstandard after World War one wasextremely hard to resurrecthere I would strongly recommend Barryeisengreen's uh wonderful golden Fetterswhich you probably don't likebut but the point I can green makes isthat to try to restore the gold standardafter the events of 1914-18 was a doomedEnterprise and if you remember that thereasons that that he gives include notonly the enormous imbalances that thewar had created in monetary and andfiscal terms but also the fact that youhad changed the social order of uh theindustrial world you had uh you hadgreatly empowered trade unions you hadwidened the franchise and created moredemocratic systems and so it wasn'treally really a viable project to takeuh the late 19th early 20th centurysystem and resurrected unless you hadhad completely re-thought the theexchange rates which certainly uhBritish politicians and and economistswere mostly disinclined to do and thisis where Keynes comes in as well as as Ican green Kansas critique throughout thethe 20s was that it wasn't rational totry to go back to the thepre-1914 parity the 4.86 exchange rateand I think most economic historiansstunts canes have tended to agree I usedto teach this stuff at Oxford back inthe 1990s and so you're asking me todredge deep into uh the river of mymemory but I recollect debates withundergraduates about whether there wereAlternatives open to Churchill who wasof course Chancellor of the exchequer atthat time or Alternatives that othergovernments could have adopted theeichen green book essentially arguesthat the the economic shocks of the 20sand 30s were made worse by adherence togold and Escape recovery was madepossible by breaking gold pegs theobvious example is Britain in 1931France which clings on longer has a muchworse experience Britain has a very goodtime in the 1930s in comparativeperspective it has a much less severedepression than the United States or orGermany and so I think what could makeit a slightly different argument and Ithink that's implicit in icing in icingGreen's book that actually after you'vegone through something World War One theeasiest way to cope with all theimbalances is to have something morelike a floating exchange rates ratherthan try to resurrect system of fixedexchange rates which is all the goldstandard really was I mean gold standardis just let's remember it's somethingthat's kind of made up in Britain andonly largely adopted in the course ofthe 19th century particularly towardsthe end of the 19th century and itbecomes very convenient just toeffectively to Peg to Sterling becauseSterling's the dominant Global Currencyand trade is denominated in Sterling soa very logic extent and that thatprocess whereby the world becomes a goldstandard world is also a a processwhereby the world becomes dominated bythe British Empire dominated by uh theBritish pound it was it was probably adoom adventure to try and put thatHumpty Dumpty back together again afterthe great fall of1914-18. so my view of of the depressionis a different one from rothbards uh andmuch closer to uh the work of of ice andgreen or my old friend Harold James uhwhose work I also highly recommend toeverybody is listeningyeah I mean if I were if I may offer theuh counter to that I think the obviouslythe problem is trying to get back on thegold standard at the pre-war rate afterall the inflation that had taken placethis is this is where I think everybodyagrees yeah clearly if you're trying toget back at the same exchange ratebetween gold and Sterling that wasprevalent in 1913 and you try to do thatin 1920 or 25 or 1930 you're going tohave uh you're going to have massiveeconomic problems you're going to needprice controls you're going to need wagecontrols you're going to have Angryunions it's going to be deeplypolitically unpopular and this was theproblem that they had but of course thesolution to that I think here you knowwe we see the beginning of the two waysof approaching economic problems whereinthe Keynesian problem is oh look we havea problem let's stop worrying about howwe got here and just um do theshort-term thing that uh gets us out oftrouble now versus the more Austrianperspective which is you know you shouldthis is why you shouldn't have gone intothe award this is why you shouldn't havegotten into inflation in the first placeand there's no you can't twitch it awaylike you can't just wish for uh theinflation to go away you already createdall that money the money supply has beenincreased so the only honest thing to dowould have been to go back to a goalstand but a new rate you know 10 20 30maybe 40 evaluation of the Britishagainst gold would have just gotten usback on a gold standard and I think uhyou know the case against the goldstandard ultimately is I I think theflaw here is that essentially Britainbroke the gold standard and thencomplained that it didn't work it wasworking quite fine before they did allthese Shenanigans to finance World WarOne if they hadn't done that it wouldhave been fine and I don't think I don'tquite agree with you that it's a Britishthing it is a British thing in itscurrent Incarnation but the idea ofusing money as gold is something thathas existed for thousands of years forvery good reasons because Gold's Supplydoes not increase uh quickly sotherefore it uh it is the thing thatends up being the best store of value soit's the thing that ends up holding onto economic value the mostso my case would be that if they'd stopthe inflationismum re-evalued the currencies in terms ofgold that would have caused a verydeeply politically unpopular and painfulrecession for a few months similar towhat the US had in 1920 you know peopleforget that the US went back on the goldstandard in 1921 they had a recessionwhich lasted six months it was nothinglike the Great Depression because theywent back on gold and so they had thebooming twenties but then it was theinflationism of the 1920s becauseBritain hadn't done the same becauseBritain went on a gold bullion standardthat I thinkum exacerbated the promise for the USand then essentially I think the youBritain kicked the inflation problemacross the pond for the US to deal withand then both of them had to go offglobal standard in the 1930sand again from the Austria perspectivethis is uh things have just been goingdownhill ever sinceum but I I can understand how you knowpeople like Barry I King Green thewinners of the history and the winnersof The Economic Department was at leasta view this as a winning uh because thisis a good thing because I mean uh thethe cages dominated the economicsdepartments and they get paid from thatuh printed moneywell you know I say if I'm not I'm notan economist I'm I'm a historian and II've never been inclined to take sidesin the in the battles between uh Keynesand his his critics because I don'tthink that that that really everythingcan be resolved into a simple adichotomy between the keynesians and theaustrians you say everything wentdownhill but of course from the vantagepoint of uh of of History that's nottrue in truth the gold standard uh wassomething that certainly was associatedwith Britain's Imperial Heyday I want tore-emphasize that it only really becamean International System of fixedexchange rates uh based on Sterling's uhgold peg in the later 19th century andeven then it didn't come entirely Globalbecause there was still somesilver-based economies like China's theperiod after the 1918 was characterizedby considerable economic volatility andthat was partly due to countries likeBritain trying to return to the goldstandard at no longer realistic uh ratesbut but it was also caused by countriesthat had abandoned gold uh and pursuedinflationary policies all the way tohyperinflation like Germany and then youhave the countries like like France thatdidn't attempt to restore pre-war parityif one looks at the 1920s and 1930suh the Striking feature is the theeconomic volatility of those two decadesyou have bouts of extreme deflation andunemployment in the US and the UK youhave extreme inflation in Germany andAustria and Hungary uh in Russiaand then in the 1930s you have thegreatest contraction in economic outputin the history of the United States andand of Germany two of the most importanteconomies in the world at that pointthen let's look at what comes nextbecause it certainly can't be describedas all downhill the period after WorldWar II is characterized by anextraordinary boom and the the Westerndeveloped world that's uh that so ofcourse shared by Japan and later by someother Asian economies the United Stateswhich by 1945 was by far the largesteconomy in the world achievesextraordinarily sustained growth rightdown really until the 1970sand all of that happens under the systemof the Bretton Woods system which wasn'treally a gold standard it was a a dollarstandard but the dollar was back to goldat that point it was fixed at 35 and itwas redeemable at least for centralbanks which was you know workable for awhile but it wasn't very sustainable andthen in 1971 right they had to beremoved and that's when it goes downhillremember in all of that time othercountries are adjusting their pegs tothe Dollar on a regular basis theDeutsche marks being revalued regularlythe pound has been devalued and so itwasn't like the gold standard becausethere were quiteregular changes in in in the in thedollar exchange rates of the of themajor currencies and and that was Ithink a pretty successful uh system ofcourse it had its problems nothing isever static in history and by uh thelate 1960s it was obvious that thesystem was no longer sustainable becauseit wasn't really in the interests of theUnited States uh which found itselfincreasingly Under Pressure particularlyfrom Japanese exports so you end up youend up with the Nixon shock the 1970slooked pretty bad at the time because ofthe inflation that that was greatlyexacerbated by the Arabic countries uhoil uh price hikesbut again the United States came throughthat very difficult decade and emergedin the 1980s as entirely dominantdominant enough to win the Cold Warwithout a a showdown with the SovietUnionand when one looks back at how thesystem of flexible exchange ratesperformed because by that time the worldreally was in an era of flexibleexchange rates I think it was prettysuccessful and my mistake if I had topick a mistake that was made was thedecision that Europeans took to throwaway exchange rate flexibility andcreate a single European currency thatthat decision in the 1990s I think was amistake because I don't think thatEurope needed a single currency butthat's a whole other debate that wecould have yeahum yeah I think that's uh probably adebate for another day I have one otheruh theory on World War one I'm wonderingif you what your thoughts are on thisthis is kind of out there looking atexchange rates during World War OneGerman and Austrian exchange ratesdeclined the most during that period infact if we look uh this is a table fromthe Bitcoin standard you can see it herethis was the devaluation of the nationalcurrencies against this was Frank andyou see that the Austrian and Germancurrencies were devalued depreciated themost for 38.9 percent at 68.9 percentI'm wondering if you think just merelythe fact that they were much closer toSwitzerland than Britain and the USmight have been uh decisive Factor justbecause German people could easily goand exchange their money into SwissFrancs and therefore put more pressureon the British on the German on theGerman money in the uh Austrian uhcurrency versus the Americans of theBritish who were stuck holding to theirgovernment's inflationary bags what doyou thinkwell as I said it's a long time since Iworked on this but I'm pretty sure thatif that table covers the period of uh ofthe entire War down to November of of1918 then what what you capture there isto a large extent the consequences of ofdefeat that that's to say thedepreciation is is most pronounced inthe later phase of the waruh this is a chart that shows a tierthis is uh starts off in June 1914 andso it ends here in the November 1918yeah around here so so investorsremember the controls of 1914-18 werenever completely watertight thegovernments didn't have the capacity toenforce all the regulations that theythat they they introduced I know thisfrom my own research on the Hamburgeconomy in the 1914 to 23 period so theyread all these regulations that weredesigned to avoid people uh uh acquiringforeign currency but they weren't theycouldn't be entirely uh enforced and sowhat goes on is that there's quite a lotof illicit a black market uh trading inforeign currencies the key is thatyou're incentive to get out of Austrianor German currencies is clearlyconnected to your expectationsof inflation in those countries and andof course your expectations of of theUltimate Military outcome because losinga war is historically really very badfor your currency it's really bad foryou for your economy so part of what'sgoing on there is is the expectations ofthe outcome of the war but but I thinkwhat's interesting about the story isthat you know you can you can do similarcharts for earlier periods in history uhincluding the 1790s and and the early1800s and that's kind of how Wareconomics tends to work in a war youhave to pay for a great deal ofnon-productive activity the gettingpeople uh mostly men to go and kill oneanother destroy one another's armies soyou have to raise that money uh the wayyou do that is you issue bonds and whenthe public won't provide enough cashthrough that channel then you have toissue short-term instruments you startto monetize in order to make thepayments to the soldiers to the armsmanufacturers that's absolutely thecharacteristic pattern of of War Financeit is inflation it's inherentlyinflationary because you'll essentiallyexpanding the money supply and you'reengaged in destruction with theexpenditure this is not an unfamiliarpattern you can find the same thinggoing on in the wars of the 16th and17th century too and and so I think it'sjust inherent in the nature of war thatit's inflationary and if you don'tbelieve me ask ukrainians becausethey're in exactly this situation todayin order to sustain the war effortagainst Russia they've had to issue avery large amount of short-term paperit's highly inflationary I don't knowwhat the current inflation rate is I waslast there and back in September it waspretty high thenthis is how War Finance functions and itshouldn't surprise us to find that thecurrencies of combatant countriesdepreciated 1914-1980 nor should itsurprises that the currenciesdepreciated the most of those countriesthat did not have U.S financial supportbecause that's what the Central Powerslack the central power said no sugardaddy uh the on-taught powers had asugar daddy Uncle Sam and that's that'swhy there's this this difference in indepreciation okay one more questionum you've also written a fascinatinghistory of the Rothschilds Fab you'vealso written a fascinating history ofthe Rothschilds family and at that pointyou know 1917 it was a pretty dark pointin uh the war for Britain and uh duringthe war they issued the BalfourDeclaration which is something that isof special interest for me because I'mPalestinian so I'm wondering do youthink the financial situation of Britainhad anything to do with the issuing ofthe Balfour Declaration at that time ordo you think it was unrelated I don'tthink it was that closely related thatthe goal at that point in the war was totry to prevent the Germans frommobilizing any possible Internationalsupport and so the ball for Declarationwas in some ways a preemptive move tomake sure that zionists sympathies werewith with Britain and not with withGermany I covered this in in theRothschild history showing that not allmembers of the family were zionists infact there was quite a split in thefamily on on that on that issue but themotivation for the British governmentwas was really to prevent The JokerPrince tried to uh make a similar moveum you have to remember that that 1917is a time when the wars reached a somesomething of a stalemate and indeedthere's a risk that that the Germanscould win it because Russia's fallingapart so what do you do you run aroundtrying to secure the support that youcan get the most important of course isthe US getting the us into the war isthe absolute key for Britain which bythat time owns the United States a lotsof a lot of money but there are otherthere are the smaller interest groupsthat you want to sew up but yeah this isall this is time travel for me I haven'twritten about this uh in uh in well morethan more than 25 years yeah well youknow your books you write them and thenthey're out there and people keepreading them all the time so I shouldreread them myself yeah I think so Ithink they're a great read I keepreading more and more of your booksum all right so switching on to thetopic of money specifically and theascent of money and moving on to bitcoinwhat are your thoughts on bitcoin umI've heard you speak about it over thelast couple of years you've gone frombeing a skeptic to being perhaps not anEnthusiast but at least an appreciatorof the value propositionum how have your thoughts evolved andwhere do you stand now well I I updatedthe sense of money a few years ago onits 10th anniversary and included achapter that covers the Advent of ofBitcoin and indeed ethereum that wasback in in 2018 the ascended money wasoriginally published the same year ofthe Satoshi paper and so the originalincent of money couldn't really talkabout Bitcoin because uh I think the twothings came into existence the book andthe and the idea but kind at the samemoment when I wrote it up in in 2018 forthat 10th anniversary editionmy argument wasthat there clearly was going to be atransformation in the nature of moneyassociated with the Advent of theinternet that it was unlikely that wewould spend another 10 years paying forthings by typing in credit card numberson random websites thatought to be some change in the nature ofof money and payments and that thatwould gradually render certain forms ofof payment obsolete banknotes coins Iwent into a bank yesterday to convert awhole lot of coins that my son had savedinto bank money and it was a reminder tome how far that Financial revolution hasgone that it felt kind of comical to aska bank teller to count a whole bunch ofquarters nickels dimes and pennies tofigure out how much son had saved sothat that Financial Revolution is is anUnstoppable thing and it it will consignchecks to Oblivion too the question isyou know what will the new Financialsystem look like and in the ascendedmoney I said well there are a bunch ofcontenders and Bitcoin is is one of themuh then the the ethereumcryptocurrencies and all the differentthings decentralized Finance based ontop of that but there are other thingstoo I mean of which the centralizedChinese payment platforms are I thinkextremely important there are just lotsand lots of new ways of paying forthingsI think Bitcoin so far as a paymentssystem has not been overwhelminglysuccessful as a version of gold as a uhan option on digital gold as my friendMatt McLennan uh called it it's beenit's been more successful and so theargument of the the ascent of moneyvolume two or second edition wasadoption of Bitcoin as an option ondigital gold will determine its priceif and I forget the exact numbers butthere were roughly these if 0.2 percentof the portfolios of all themillionaires in the world are held inthe form of Bitcoin then the price willbe around fifteen thousand dollars if ifit's more like one percent then theprice will be somewhere uh more like 60or 70 000 roughly that so I basicallyasked what if every millionaire decidesto hold some percentage of his or herportfolios Bitcoin what will the pricebe and that was I think correct analysisthenthat adoption would be the key to thepricewhat subsequently happenedin 2020 and in 2021was that adoption becamedominated byleverage and speculation and exchangesfacilitated this so that we went from anoptional digital gold to something thatwas essentially a speculative objectalong with all the other cryptocurrencies and that speculation waspropelled by extremely easily availablemargin creditI think if one were to do anotheredition of the ascent of money todayit would say that out of the pandemicand the zero interest rate policies thequantitative easing Infinity of 2020there came a bubbleand that bubble uh meant that the creditdrove the priceand when the monetary conditionstightened as they did in 2021 inevitablythe bubble burst because that's whatbubbles do when the monetary conditionsget tougher the most exposed mostleveraged borrower on uh margin getsdestroyedso we're watching the the the thegradual and it's kind of slower processthan you'd expect gradual exposure ofall the the not only speculation but theillegal activities that flourishedduring the bubbleand when people talk about a cryptowinter what they're describing is thatprocessI ask myself if it's actually a cryptoIce Age becauseso much reputational damage has beendone not just by Sam Bank when freed butby I think an entire ecosystem ofspeculative and fraudulent players andso I I have to say my my myOutlook is somewhat Bleak because it'snot obvious to me why there would be arenewal of adoption in the wake of thispretty horrible bust so you you youshouldn't expect the crypto winter toend this year and maybe not next yearuh either the last thing I'll say isthatadoption had stalled in the UnitedStates even before it was clear that thebubble was going to burst despite SuperBowl ads there really wasn't a big shifttowards Bitcoin or indeed cryptoownership uh going on and I think thatwas interesting it meant thatyou didn't get the same very very rapidadoption that that had driven somethinglike Facebook into a position ofextraordinary popularity crypto wasnever as viral as as Facebook andFacebook found that it couldn't docrypto why not buckles of of regulatoryuh resistance all the people who wantedto regulate crypto right out to themargin have been empowered by thefailure of FTX and The Regulators havegot the bit between their teeth thelegislators who were enthusiasts havegone very quiet and for that reason tooI think the crypto ice age has some wayto run yeah now if I were to give youthe uh kind of the Bitcoin or Bitcoinfundamentalist perspective here by theway one should never be a fundamentalistI'm very very wary of allfundamentalists because life is reallynot well understood by a fundamentalistideologies of any kind so I I you willnever get me to say about any kind offundamentalist but you go ahead that isa fundamentalist statement in its own bybeing on the country on the contraryit's the exact opposite of that oneshould be extremely wary one shouldrecognize that in fact the world is muchmuch messier than any fundamentalistideology allows that's that's whathistory teaches you remember pure in inpeer and War and Peace goes from oneideological fad to the next until hefinally realizes that they're allsomewhat absurd but go on yeah but hedidn't have Bitcoin at that time well hehe had gold at least for some of uh ofof the book he has he has goals but Imean I I I I would I would ask thequestion if if it's gold you want what'swrong with gold and that's that's whatmy old friend Thomas Kaplan who's been aa consistent gold bug said to melast year in a conversation I'll alwaysremember he said well you know I agreewith you about the idea of Bitcoin as anoptional digital gold and it's it's it'sgreat for my thesis that gold has afuture because you know if you if youwant something to be digital gold thenyou you must see something attractive inGold itself it seems to me not clear atthis point that the average Americanneeds digital gold when there's realgold plus the US dollar the thing that'sstill true and was true in 2018.is the the use case is well establishedfor Bitcoinin any country that has a highlyunstable or authoritarian governmentwith a high probability of of eitherexpropriation or hyperinflation and andI think that's the use case for Bitcointhat is well established what's notclear to me is what what the use casefor Bitcoin is in the United States yeahI mean if I were to uh give you the thecase for Bitcoin as opposed to cryptoand as opposed to Gold I'll begin withgold I'd say the ultimate problem withgold is that you can't move it uh morethan uh further wave than your arm cantake it without government permissionand this is really the issue that youknow so I lived in Lebanon and thereason that I could escape thehyperinflation of the impact ofhyperinflation was because I had accessto bitcoin yeah my condolences yeah thatis as messed up a country as you couldhope to find in 2023yeah I mean I I I I'm sort of cautiouslyoptimistic that uh they've hit rockbottom and things are going to startturning around now mainly because thecurrency is completely destroyed and thegovernment can no longer pillage thepeople through the currency becausenobody's holding any of the currencyanymore so essentially the parasites aresuffocating and dying which is always agood thing but in this kind of settingyou know gold is not very useful in theyear 2023 if you're a businessman inLebanon you can't use gold to trade withyour International Partners you can'tsend gold internationally there are nogold Banks you you can't move goldacross borders without governmentpermission and even with governmentconversion is extremely slow andextremely expensive so it's it's usefulyou know to put it under your mattressor under your uh floorboards to keepsome there and that you could sell at apoint in time when there's a crisis andthere's an emergency but it's basicallybeen neutered monetarily since World Warone I argue because once central banksno longer use gold and one central banksare no longer trading with gold thenit's it's salability its ability totravel across space has been completelycompromised so bitcoin's valueproposition is on the one hand which atthe point I focus on in the Bitcoinstandard is the fact that it is evenharder than gold it does gold betterthan gold and that its current Supplygrowth rate is roughly in the same rangeas gold is around 1.8 percent per yearbut it's going to drop every two everyfour years it drops by halfSo eventually it's gonna drop to zero sothe supply is fixed at 21 millionwhereas gold increases around one and ahalf two percent per year every year soit's better than gold in that regard andthe focus of my first book the Bitcoinstandard but my second book the Fiatstandard I focus on the fact that it canmove it's basically gold with wings soit not only can you move it very quicklyacross borders but I think the key thingis that you can move it very quicklyacross borders without having to resortto any of your government's politicaland uh banking institutions and this isreally I think the the key valueproposition because you know if you'rein a place like Lebanon and and a placewhere the currency is having problems orthe place that has Capital controls andyou know Britain and the US have hadCapital controls they've had devaluationperhaps actually one small point I'll goback to when we were discussing theperiod between World War one and two andwhen I was saying that it went downhilla key thing to remember is that thedevaluation that needed to happen afterWorld War One did happen in the 1930syou know the dollar was devaluedsignificantly against gold in the 1930sif that had taken place in 1919 globallywith a pound and with all thesecurrencies then we could have been savedan enormous amount of headache but to goback to Bitcoin now you can move itaround so if there's an another 1971another 1934 another uh confiscation ofmoney if there's a new introduction ofyou know you keep hearing about allthese Central Bank digital currencyschemes Bitcoin is the one thing thatcan escape that you know don't want tosound too much of a fundamentalist butnothing has as good a chance as Bitcoinuh does at resisting State capture inother words if you find yourself in asituation where central Bankers orcurrencies are imposed or if there'shyperinflation or if you're forced touse your local currency and you'reforced to use the banks with very strictcontrols of where you can move yourmoney around at the end of the day youjust need a computer that can receiveone megabyte of data every 10 minutesand then you can move 10 billion dollarsworth of bitcoin across Internationalborders without anybody even knowingthat you have them more than with thatthey are yours that they moved from thiscountry to another so it's a synonymoussystemand it's got you know it's not obviouslyfoolproof it's not very easy for mostpeople to get this kind of level ofcensorship resistance definitely but itisincomparable to all other Alternativesat the end of the day it doesn't have tocompete against the hypotheticalum perfect monies that exist inimagination it's up against yellow rocksand Central Bank digital currencies andall kinds of things that have much morepressing shortcomings so this is I thinkthe value proposition for why digitalgold over gold because ultimately youknow in the current day and age nobodybuys the gold for the yellow shininessand for the fact that you can drop it onyour toe you buy it for the fact thatnobody can print it well Bitcoinrecreates that which is the mostimportant property of gold recreates itimproves upon it and gives it Wings inorder to make it move very quickly andthis again brings us to the differencebetween Bitcoin and crypto and this iswhy I think you know I'm when you saycrypto winter crypto Ice Age I I findthat to be a good good news personallybecause I think from from from abitcoin's perspective all of this noisearound uhum decentralized finance andrevolutionizing this and that and smartcontracts to be perfectly honest I viewmost of that as being justum excuses for launching digitalcurrencies excuses for launchingSecurities ultimately it's anunregulated unregistered Securitiesindustry that trades on these um on thishype but all ultimately all of the hypedoes it allows you to launch a securitywhich is ultimately centralizedpretending to be decentralized to getaround Securities regulation but itdoesn't have the censorship resistancethat you're going to need when pushcomes to shove in other words it's likea cardboard cutout of a ship and itlooks like a ship if you don'tunderstand how ships work really wellbut you know when the storm comes andyou need to get outum and you need to survive a storm inthe ship the cardboard cutout isn'tgoing to cut it much so I think yeah I IIthink there's a strong case that a lotof the crypto industry is not going torecover out of the next year or two butwith Bitcoin I'll invite you to considerthis what has happened now is by nomeans unprecedented we had a biggercollapse in Bitcoin in 2013 we had abigger collapse in Bitcoin in 2017 2018andum now we still haven't you know it was95 I think in 2014 and it's uh it wasabout 85 in 28 18 and it's now only 77percent uh if we if we're past thebottom so perhaps the monetary policychange affected it but you could alsomake a pretty uh solid argument thatthis is just the Dynamics of the BitcoinMarket itself because of the changes inthe um Bitcoin Supply so every time weget this having where the new supplydrops by half and there's a big bubbleafter it there's a big rise in the priceand there's a big speculative Maniawhich leads to a lot of Leverage andthen it leads to liquidations and thenthere's a big crash and I think the keyvalue proposition for Bitcoin which thiscrash has not compromised is the factthat youeven after the crash you still are atmuch higher levels than where you werebefore it soum you know in 2019 2018 the price ofBitcoin spent most of its time 110 000.so here we are four years later it's uhmore than double of what the price wasyou know the average price between 2016and 2020 was around 8 000 or so so wehad double that price so the the mainvalue proposition which is that thedecline in marginal production is goingto continue to cause a rise in the priceI think is uncompromised and so I thinkyou know I I I can't vouch for anythingelse in the crypto world I uh I Iwouldn't be too excited about themsurviving and weathering the storm but Ithink Bitcoin continues to tick alongone new block every 10 minutes there'snothing you know even after the Chinaban on mining and all the disruptionsadapted to the network the Network'sstill operating one new block every 10minutes andum as a long-term saving I think it'sstill uncompromised this would be mykind of uhcheerful story for Bitcoin well I Idon't radically disagree with what yousaid but remember I I I I was making apoint about the United States notLebanon uh the use case for Bitcoin inLebanon is absolutely clear that can besaid of many countries uh in fact areally large proportion of the world'scountries have real issues with currencystability uh and secure property rightsthe question really seems to me to behow far can you go with that narrativein the United States because what youstarted to do as I've often heard itdone in the past was to say oh well someterrible thing is going to happen theUnited States that you you really needto be protected against by having uhdigital Gold by having Bitcoin and I Idon't think that that story is a verycompelling one and I don't think it everwas you know when I first talked toenthusiasts like you which is quite afew years ago now they would talk aboutthe terrible inflation problem thatBitcoin was there to protect againstand it struck me as strange that that Iwas having this conversation when we'dhad about 20 years with inflation belowthe two percent Targetso that use case only started to becredible last year really and ironicallyas the inflation got worse so Bitcoinfell in price so that that seemed to meto undermine the claim that the Bitcoinwas some kind of inflation hedge so whatelse have we got well then there's theargument that the federal government'sgoing to do something drastic like itdid in in the early 1930s and compeleverybody uh to use a central bankdigital currencybut I mean we already have legal tenderuh I can't I can't pay for things withwhatever I like as things stand theissue I think safe is whether you canget the adoption trained to run againit was running very nicely in in 2020and I I think what was going on therewas a rising proportion of people weresaying well I need this in my portfoliosomewhere and a number of Institutionsbegan to get interestedI think that's all stalled because ofthe the crisis that we saw last yearand it's not clear what gets it to goagain because I think adoption was a lotof what was driving the price up now youyou also saw this breakdown in in thecorrelations or rather you arise in thecorrelation so that Bitcoin began totrade like essentially a proxy for a bigtech for a time and that that's that'sunappealing in the end in a stablecountryand the United States despite theworries that the New York Times is stilla pretty stable country the bestprotection for your wealth isdiversification I mean you wouldn't wantto be 100 in Bitcoin any more than 100in anything so you want to Diversifiedportfolio and Bitcoin has a place inthat portfolio the question is what sizeshould it be and I think the size is isthe issue I think it currently feelslike a quite small percentage of theaverage high net worth Americansportfolio when there are other all kindsof other Alternatives that are going tomake a lot more money this year becausein the end you don't want your portfoliojust to be a kind of Nest Egg foremergencies you want your portfolio togrow and I don't think Bitcoin is goingto go up in price this year that's kindof off-putting if you're if youralternatives are well whatever it isthat you want to buy uh so I that's howI think about it this is why I'm not nota a new put it correctly I'm not askeptic I'm not a hater I'm not neuralrabbini I think nuriel's beenlike a lot of economists very reluctantto think about this in any rigorous wayand very few economists have saidanything interesting about Bitcoin overthe last decade but but I'm not a kindof passionate believer because I thinkyou shouldn't be a passionate believerin any form of asset digital orotherwise you should be a cold andcalculating asset allocatorwho says what is going tobe correlated in my portfolio and whatis going to be uncorrelatedwhat is likely to appreciate this yearand what it's likely to do to go downthose are the questions to ask not do Ibelieve do I have faith I think thoseare inappropriate questions for therealm of money yeahum I think I would I would just arguewhen you saidum you know the inflation's been undertwo percent recently I think that's CPIin in around this part of the internetwe've got major problems with the waythe CPI is calculated uh primarilybecause of the problem that thecomposition of the basket of goodsitself is determined by the changes inprices and so as the price of desirableGoods increases because of inflationpeople substitute away from thedesirable Goods that they um useinferior goods and then the basket ofgoods has more and more inferior goodsand then so the CPI is adjusted in orderto fit that soum if you look at the price I thinkMichael said has made a greatcontribution to understanding inflationby saying that it's much better to thinkof it as a vector rather than a metric asingle number so it's not just onenumber that is announced every monthwhich you know is three percent or fivepercent or seven percent inflation is avector and it affects different Goods ina different way so when you look at theprice of digital Goods like say amegabyte of data well that's uh theinflation rate there in terms of theprice change is a decline of 20 30 40per year or something like that whereasif you look at the price of say um MiamiBeach real estate then it's going up ata much higher rate and so the rate ofmonetary inflation the increase in thesupply of money is reflected in thedesirable Goods if you look at the priceof real estate if you look at the priceof things that people want HealthcareHarvard Education these sort of thingsthey appreciate roughly at a similarrates to the increase in the moneysupply so the money supply for the UShas increased at around seven percentover the last 60 years on average sothis is a compound annual growth rate ofseven percent per year over 60 yearsthis is a pretty long run average so theCPI has been lower during that time butif you look at the change in the priceof Miami Beach real estate it is similarto that in fact if you look over thelast 10 years I looked at Zillow and atthe change in the prices of real estateat the the 10 biggest cities of the USand the average over the last 10 yearsup until a few months ago was 8.5 peryear for those 10 cities so this isreally the you know if you if you'relooking to live in a nice place ifyou're looking for a nice house this isthe real kind of price inflation ratethat you face it's 8.5 per year and itis similar to the supply growth rate ofthe money that you're using so the valueproposition ultimately is that Bitcoinis growing at one or two percentcurrently and it's going to continue todecline and it's just simple mathematicsit might seem like it's fanaticism andfundamentalism but as a lot of Bitcoinis like to say it's just simple math atthe end of the day this is growing atone or two percent per year whateverhappens you know we've seen so muchchange over the last 14 years and yet wecontinue to maintain the supply growthrates whereas you know Nationalcurrencies in the best case scenariothey're going to grow at seven percentover the next two decades so you know umat seven percent over 20 years that's anenormous increase versus what's going tohappen with Bitcoin where there's a onlyanother let's say if this sounds like anargument for uh investing in real estateum because there's a only so much moreMiami they can build and indeed quite abit of Miami will probably disappearunder the waves at some point I mean myown view is that one can't cherry pickuh to determine an inflation ratethey're they're in the end there'ssomething arbitrary about the basket ofof goods and services in any inflationindex and it changes over time so whenyou're making comparison with the 1970syou have to remember it's it's quitedifferent CPI but you know in the endWatson scarce Supply uh historic housingis my favorite I mean historic housingis in fundamentally scarce Supply youcan't build 16th century houses inEngland there are only the ones thatwere built then that still stand and sothat's a great asset class to beinvested in problem is it's not reallyliquid and you know you probably don'twant to look too closely or 16th centuryHouse's price in the next year or twobut in the end I come back to my pointthat that the rational actor is engagedin constructing a portfolio that will beDiversifiedwill include scarce things in it butwill also have have liquid things in itand there's a place for Bitcoin in inthat portfolio I mean I I have some Ihave a lot less than I had in early lastyear because it wasurgently time to rebalance them uh withthe prospects of of monetary tighteningbut there's a place for Bitcoin but youwouldn't want anybody on this call tothink that they should put all theirmoney in Bitcoin I hope because thatwould be terrible at Financial advice uhthe issue as I said is what percentageis the average millionaire going to wantto hold in in the form of Bitcoin theaverage millionaire in oh I don't knowBrazil will want a larger share of theirif their wealth in Bitcoin than theaverage American millionaire and I thinkthat's why Bitcoin will be very hard todestroy even if you know the moremilitant people at the bank forinternational settlements get their waythere will always be a a place for forBitcoin in those unstable parts of theworld where you know a military coup ora populist coup might be farcical butthen it might not because it's Brazil asopposed to the United States yeah and Ithink you know in the Fiat standard Iargue the most effective way governmentscan destroy Bitcoin the best chance theyhave is to go on a gold stand that wouldbe the way to undermine demand forBitcoin I think we can probably rulethat out uh yeah exactly as a scenariofor the new the near future I mean I Ithink the key question if one looksahead 10 years isdo you see the current regime offlexibleexchange rates with covert pegs do yousee that regime persisting and does theDollar Remain the anchor currency theanswer to that is yes and and yesbecause there's no way the ChineseRMB is a contender with capital controlsand all the obvious downsides of China'strajectory so I think we remain in a ina dollar world and the dollar issusceptible to periods of strength likelast year and and I think it's softeningthis year there aren't any very obviousother contenders so there's a bunch ofcurrencies that are going to beattracted to hold you just because ofthe sheer volume of trade done in themEuros people will still want some poundssome some Swiss Francs but I mean sinceit seems to me that the Fiat world isn'tgoing to change that dramatically in thenext 10 years uh there isn't going to bea rush to create new monetary unions ornew Bretton Wood systems or fixed ratesI don't think that's going to happen andthe reason is that it's prettyconvenient to be able to have yourcurrency flexible so I would say theglobal environment will not radicallyalterI think there'll be some hyperinflationcases currency collapses look atArgentina already at 100 per annum couldgo higher and I I think in those placeswhich are very very unstable there willbe a considerable appetite for Bitcoinbut my sense is that that's that's theworld for the next 10 yearsand the biggest change I would predictwould be The Disappearance of cashbecause I think that's going to happenuh it's already happened to an amazingextent in Sweden and the UK I was in theUK in December it is extremely hard topay for anything with cash in the UK nowincluding a pint of beerbecause almost all payments are now doneuh contactless and the card credit cardcompanies have done a tremendous job ofReinventing and upping their game tomake sure that they continue to dominatepaymentsI would put it to you thatthe biggest problem for a Bitcoinfundamentalist is just being marginaljust marginalization that as the worldshifts towards electronic paymentswith increasingly efficient AI basedplatforms to harness the data from everytransactionmost people will take the line of leastresistance this was true in China soit's really simple just to pay forthings with the with your phoneand that the transaction cost and justin terms of convenience is super lowso most people would just gravitatetowards centralized AI driven paymentsystems and they won't even think aboutbanknotes and coins they'll soon regardthem as comical the way we regard coalboxes it's like you know watch a moviewith a cold box and it's like that's howpeople used to make phone calls we'llsoon watch films where people pay withbanknotes and and the little kids willgo what the helland bitcoin's danger is being marginalin that worldbecause in the end most peopledon't really care about their privacyand find the convenience of being on anAI enabled system very attractive soyou'll have a role it just won't be thatCentralit'll never be as important as goldperhaps but I think the case here isthat you know the more efficient itbecomes the more liable it is to be tohave inflation and the more is going tobe surveilled I think this is the keything that you know the the the thecurrent Fiat system is not veryefficient at creating inflation tofinance the government because they needto create credit and it's not easy tocreate credit credit when you create toomuch credit it leads to a creditcollapse but if you have a physicalmoney printer that's when you gethyperinflation so when you move to adigital form or the money printer then Ithink we're going to have inflationbecome more of a problem when you havemore efficient forms of digital money wehave your Countryman Alan Farringtonyour fellows cotsman he's got a questionfor youthanks very muchum and and great to see you again Neil II actually I have no idea if youremember this I'm sure you probablydon't but I saw you speak in our formerschoolum and I shake your hand and it was avery good talk that was maybe two threeyears ago it was definitely pre-coveredsoum that's nice to see you again it'snice to see you again albeit virtually Idon't think we had beards then or did weI definitely didn't I no I don't thinkyou did either no this is my work that'sbeen a good thing no one tells me toshave anymore so I just don'tum I I have um I I had quite a fewquestions so I wouldn't ask them all nowit depends on how long we have but therewas one that followed on fromum something you said uh one or twoanswers you would just say and I thinkon unfortunately this it is quite aloaded question I just I really can'tthink of a less loaded way to ask it soit's maybe more like what is yourimpression of this rather than puttingyou too much on the spot but you talkedabout kind of coldly and camly assetallocating and I just even preface thequestion I I completely appreciate thatso I'm a professional investor and Ithink in that capacity I'm not sure atall how I'd recommend Bitcoin in aportfolio or maybe if I even would to behonest it would depend on you know allkinds of preferences of the client so II I do get where you're coming from withthat but the loaded part is that I I dokind of want to put you on spot a littleand just ask like what what do you makeof the idea that actually nobody shouldhave to asset allocate right you youshould be able to just save and thenforget about it for years if not decadesif not centuries and you know is is thatworth being passionate about above andbeyond what you know would beappropriate in coldness and calmness foryearly returns expectations that's aninteresting questionum I think one should discourage thingsthat are easy that encourage things thatare hard because we we were given brainswhich were quite powerful computers fora reason if there were some magicalasset that you could justyou could just save and put aside with a100 confidence that it would generate areal returnof let's just say five percent then it'dbe tremendous Rush uh to buy that assetsoyou'd almost certainly find that for aperiod the returns wentSky High because it would be too easyand I don't think life can be that easyI think ultimately what's striking to meabout the world as I find itis that we quite deliberately do noteducate people financiallyit's not really part of what people doat high school or college unless theychoose to study economics of finance andeven if you study economics I'm not surehow well prepared you really are tomanage your own money when you graduatequite badly in many casesso people graduate from education withan almost complete ignorance of financeand then they're asked to to borrowmoney to pay for housing or or largecapital goods not understanding reallythe nature of debt not understanding thenature of interest rates then they'reasked to save not understanding theproblems with basic savings accountthe world world is is full of sheepbeing fleeced and I would rather that westrove after financial literacy andexplain to people look there's a greatdeal of uncertainty out there I can'ttell you what the dollar is going to beworth 10 years from now or the Britishpound for that matterand I can't tell you where the s p willland a year from now or even a week fromnow that's the reality there's massiveuncertainty because the historicalprocess is completely chaotic it's awhole bunch of interacting complexsystems good luck predicting anythingso you better prepare yourself for lifeunder uncertainty there is not no suchthing as a risk-free asset sorry tobreak the news to you doesn't existso you must I think and I try and drumthis into my kids you must actas if that uncertainty is scarilypresent and that's when I say you knowcold asset allocation is the bestthe best strategy because you've got todo that if you get it wrong because mostpeople do most people like well I justgot to buy a house I'm just going totake a big loan I'm just gonna buy thatso that's my investment strategy I saidthis in the asset of money that mostpeople's investment strategy is to haveone long unhedged position on a highlyilliquid asset called a houseand that's a terrible strategy and notsurprisingly periodically breakspeople's hearts especially when interestrates go up and they'd only borrowed fortwo years or something like that so no Ithink it's better that we all have to beyou know aware of the uncertainties andtrying to be hedged learning how toprotect yourself making sure yourbalance sheet isn't skewed into oneparticular category I'm guilty as hellof having been I was overweight Bitcoinagainst my own advice by the end of of2020 and slow to rebalanceand that was stupid that was just stupidbecause there was a massive there was anot lovely game to be harvested late2020 and if you were smart you took itso that's the way I think about theworld don't expect there to be any niceeasy paths to Financial Securitythis is what the gold standard was youcould just save and go like you had towork hard to get your money but once yougot it it was yours and it stayed yoursit didn't get inflated before the moneywas destroyed but in the year of thegold standard almost nobody had wealthI mean this was a this was a goldstandard that allowed you to save inGold if you belonged to the top onepercent of the distribution but theother characteristic feature of the goldstandard was that most people had noproperty they rented their accommodationand that was it but the reason peoplehave property now is because of theindustrialization that has increasedliving standards which came about underthe gold staff there was the goldstandard that financed industrializationand the massive economics no no no no nono no no no but the great redistributionwhich radically altered the distributionof wealth and income happened after theoutbreak of World War Oneit happened when the gold standard brokedown that's that's just not not evendebatable yeah but that was that andthen and then it went into somethingspread no no it happened because all thewealth of of the industrial era wasdestroyed confiscated inflated away oror taxed as a result of two world wars agreat depression and a lot of inflationsthe destruction of wealth is not whatspreads well the destruction of wealthdestroyed it it was industrialproduction and increased productivitythat increased wealthnow but you have to rememberI'm sorry but this is economic historythe in the 19th century your golden ageright up until 1914. the world washighly unequal like much more unequalthan today the wealth distribution wasway more skewed than it is todaywhat changed that was that from 1914onwardsthe hereditary wealth the elites of thearistocracy were destroyed and there wasa a radical redistribution of wealtharound the world some of it was done byRevolution in Russia some of it was doneby inflation some it was done bytaxationit was a radicalre-uh sorting of the world'sof the world's assets and by 1950 at theend of all of that the world is a muchmuch more equal place than it had beenbeforein our timethere has been another great flatteningor leveling mainly caused by economicgrowth in Asia and the Advent of thelargest middle class in history in Chinaso we we are in a very much moreegalitarian world than than we were onthe eve of World War One and that's whyone shouldn't fetishize the goldstandard because the gold standard wasthe monetary system of a highly unequalWorld in which most wealth was inheritedyeah although I I I I I don't find thatvery compelling because I think the maindriver for the growth in livingstandards is the increase inproductivity I mean if you look at theamount of energy that the average personconsumes today it's much much higherthan what it was 150 years ago that'sbecause of technological improvementsnot so much because of inflation we cantalk about technological change if youwould like but it's not related in anyway to monetary standards I know Peterhas a question for youum I think the ones in the chat havebeen addressed yeah my question was aquick one on the gold standard as wellbecause you mentioned there that thegold standard only really becameformalized in the in the late 19thcentury so the question is would youwould you say that it's fair to say thatthere was uh there was some kind of goldstandard in the two centuries prior uhto that periodum instantiated by the fact that lots ofcountries hadum a peg to gold and that if you look atexchange rates they were roughly tradingum at parity in terms of the weight ofgold uh We've looked at the exchangerates between National currencies theywere roughly trading approximately totheir um weight in gold well if you'retalking about I mean let's remember 17thcentury is a time of monarchy monetaryAnarchy in in Europe and and indeedglobally there's there's nothingresembling a standard the idea of ofdefining currency in terms of of of goldis is one that originates in Englandit spreads relatively slowly it's notreally Universal or even widespread inthe 18th century and and you still havea sort of variety of different standardsin the first half of the 19th centuryof silver and and bimetallic and it'snot until really after 1870 that thatthere's this great rush to adopt goldand it's it's only in the late 19thcentury that Germany and the UnitedStates and other countries essentiallyadopt what is a British standard we callit a gold standard but what we reallymean is a pound standard it'sessentially the decision that everybodyis going to become part of a BritishdominatedFinancial system and the reason fordoing that is that Britain dominatesfinancial markets and Dominic'scommodity markets and so it's a matterof of of convenience uh particularlywhen there's an obvious uh Divergence inin the supply of silver relative to Goldso I think that I often people who talkabout the gold standardforget that it was a relatively shortperiod in which the world more or lessaccepted that rule and it was a it'ssurprisingly voluntary system it wasn'tas if they ever met and sat down andsaid we're the gold standard and built abuilding which was gold standard youknow HQ I mean it was just the bank ofEngland which didn't even have that muchgold because it didn't need to haveso the system was I think quitecontingent it was obviouslycontroversial in the United Statesbecause it implied deflationary policiesand we we forget that there weredownsides to to gold adoption at a timewhen although there had been major golddiscoveries most obviously in SouthAfrica it was still quite a stretch toget the whole world onto gold X Chinathe other thing to remember is that theonly reason the system was stablegiven that there were relatively finitequantities of gold was uh the rapid riseof a fractional Reserve banking whichcreated a just structurally relativelyeasy monetary conditions so I mean I'mprobably making this sound a little moreramshackle than it was but if you readWalter Badger it's great description ofhow the world works if you've ever readLombard Street read Lombard Streetbudget describes how the financial Worldworksand you realize that at its heart is theBank of England with this really quitesmall quantity of gold and what ismaking globalization possible what'smaking the financial system work is isis obviously confidence in the Bank ofEngland the sense that it's a it's astable anchor for the system but it'sall the other things that are built onaround it the edifices of the bondmarket of the stock market all the ofall the different institutions that areessentially operating with with Sterlingand Sterling denominated paper claimsso that's that's I that's the reality ofthe gold standard which some people areinclined to you know idealize I'm not Ithink it was a contingent system thatonly made sense in the context of of theall the near total British hegemony thathad been established in the world uh inthe late 19th and early 20th centuryyeah no we we obviously agree we thinkBitcoin is much better well except thatit doesn't have an Empirethat the reason that Bitcoin is nowhereclose to being gold in the sense of thegold standard is that there is no Empiresaying this will be our Reserve asseteverything would change if a centralbanks somewhere in the world said youknow what we're going to have someBitcoin we're going to treat it as areserve asset and I know people in inthis part of the world where I live inCalifornia keep hoping that will happenbut it hasn't yet yeah but I mean Ithink you know uh gold was money longbefore the British Empire existed God'sbeen money for thousands of years so itwasn't the British Empire that made itmoney the British Empire recognizedmonetary reality but it was just themost Advanced Financial infrastructurebut you mustn't confuse the goldstandard with gold being money those aretwo quite different things yeah but Imean ultimately it's gold that is whatmatters gold standard is just the waythat it was adapted to technologicalrealities of the 19th century but the21st century we had differenttechnological realitiesum all right Scott has a question maybeI think this will be the last one we'lllet you go thank you so much we reallyappreciate your time uh Scott uh yeahthank you very much um I'm wonderingwhere you see uh Russia Ukraine at thispoint in time and if uh you think thatthis is uh the end of Russia and wherewhere that stands thank you but it's agood place for us to end the discussionbecause one of the things that the warhas made very clear is the extent towhich throughout history War has beenculprit number one in inflation episodesthe the majority of inflation episodesin history are associated with with warand it's not I think an accident thatthat we've seen a spike of inflation notthat it wasn't already coming it wasalready coming from fiscal and monetarypolicy but it was clearly driven Higherby by this war this war is not about toendit's not about to end because both sidesthink that they can win both sides thinktime is on their sideukrainians think time is on their sidebecause ultimately Western sanctions areundermining Russia's economy and eachmonth they get a little bit more fancyHardware from the West the Russiansthink that they're going to win becausethe West will lose interest in Ukraineat some point and uh Russia is muchbigger than Ukraine and its economy hascontracted much less than Ukraine soboth sides think time is on their sidethat means the war will keep going it isimpossible for me to imagine how a peacedeal could be arrived at given thecurrent positions of President zielinskiand PutinI don't think the war will be waged atthe same intensity as we saw last yearsimply because the uh the attrition hasbeen amazingly High the casualty ratesin this war have been much higher thanin any War I think since the Iran Iraqwar with really really large proportionsof the original Invasion Force dead nowand the ukrainians are probablysuffering comparable attritionparticularly when they go on theoffensive so like the Korean War thiswar will have you know had it will haveone big nasty year of kinetic Warfarefollowed probably by two years of staticuh attrition this will be the mash phaseof the war and How It Ends I meanPutin's death would certainly help uhend the warI don't think Revolution in Russia isterribly likely but his death wouldcertainly change things the West coulddecide to give Ukraine enough uhWeaponry to win the war currently wegive them enough not to lose but wedon't really give them enough to winI'm not sure that will happen so mymoney is on a stalemate that drags onthrough the year moves the story fromthe front page to the inside pages anduh and we as we often do in these kindof cases will stop thinking and talkingabout it so much at the end I don'tthink I don't think Russia collapsesit's pretty hard to collapse Russia wewe had a pretty good try uh back in thelate 80s and early 90s and it's stillthere it seems as though um a Fiatsituation or an easy money situationenables these conflicts to happen atlarger magnitudes than they otherwisewould in a hard money environment do youagree with that or but no because Ithink the scale of war is is determinedby two things reallyone the technology to the politicalconstraints what's interesting aboutthis war is that it's still quite smallby 20th century standards I mean thearmies are not large I mean invadingUkraine with like 130000 people I mean that would just havemade Hitler and Stalin laughso these are our our relatively smallarmies but with very powerful weaponsthat are way more lethal and way moreaccurate than 20th century weapons soWars can happen regardless of themonetary system that seems pretty clearplenty of wars in the era of the goldstandard and the existence of the goldstandard didn't stop World War One thetruth is that monetary rules getsuspended like all rules get suspendedin war war is this ultimate emergencyit's the ultimate state of emergency andin the state of emergency you cansuspend civil rights you can just simplyspend individual Freedom the U.S prettymuch did that in in both world wars andthat's always worth bearing in mind I'llwrap the discussion by reminding you I'ma historian not an economist economistssuffer from the delusion that war is anexogenous shock they love to call itthat and historians understand that waris endogenous it is the essence of powerwar is the extremebear exercise of power and it transcendseverything else because once you're atWar and the blood is Flowing who gives a about monetary order nobody that'swhat you have to remember and that'swhat economists often forget and thatvery uh very somber note thank you somuch really appreciate your time wedon't agree on everything obviously butI very much enjoy your perspective everytime I read or get to talk to youagreement is overrated uh absolutelysafer pleasure and uh I it was apleasure to to exchange ideas witheverybody on this on this call I wishyou a good rest of 2023 were into weektwoand uh the storms are still better inCalifornia so uh great talking to youall bye for now cheers take care[Music][Music]",
