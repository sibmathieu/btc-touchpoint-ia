toenergy and bitcoin miningnow this is a really hot topic becausethere's a lot of controversy aroundbitcoin consumption of energy andadditionally there's a lot of debatearound peopletalking about how much hashing power andmining is taking place in chinawell i have two incredible experts inthis space we got marty bent and harrysutta to discuss these ideas in muchmuch more detailso sit back hold tight and get ready fora massive amount of information onenergy and bitcoin mining[Music]you're listening to bitcoin fundamentalsby theinvestors podcast network now for yourhostpreston pish[Music]all right so uh everyone welcome to theshow we got marty bentharry suttock here and guys i'm excitedto have this conversation because youguys are theexperts on this topic and uh welcome tothe showthank you for having us thank you forhaving me i'd like to speak for harrypress and expert may be uh a bit of astretch butno i'm hearing you guys in clubhouse andi'm just like whoawe need to have a chat with these twoand i mean i've beeni've been following you guys for yearsnow and this is exciting so what i'mgoing to doto start this off i just want to pitch acouple underhand pitches for you guysi want you to crank them out of theballpark so far that people can't evensee the ballit's going to be like the natural wherethe cover comes off the ball as you guysare hitting thesethese two underhand pitches the firstone i got for youchina controls all the hashing powerthereforethey can make bitcoin do whatever theywantfalse i mean they don't control all theall the hashing power historicallythey've controlled a significant amountbut that that amount has been waitingand even though all that hashing powerdoesexist within the borders of china theycan't really control the bitcoin networkat the end of the day the bitcoinnetwork is controlledby full nodes who dictate the consensusrules and invalidate the consensus ruleswith those full nodes and ifthe miners within china or anywhere inthe world for that matterattempt to to fall outside of thoseconsensus rules full nodes willredirect the blocks or transactions thatthey attempt to include in those blocksso in terms of being able to controlbitcoinvia the mining industry in china that isa bit of a stretchi believe the worst that could happenwhich is also a bit of a stretch is allthemining equipment within the borderscould be turned off and slow down blockproduction for some time but that's whywe have the difficulty adjustmenti don't know if you want to add anythingto that harry i do i want to reframe thequestiona 51 attack in the bitcoin network isnot the same as a 51attack on an election this is notmajority rulethis is not flip the party this is not adeep changeto the behavior of the network what itwould involve is a challenge to processand confirm net new blocksthere may be a very very shallow reorgthose are the kind of scope of theproblemsthat could arise from that type ofbehavior and exactly like martysaid the network is unbelievablyunbelievably antiviraland white blood cell driven and so whatthat meansis that you've got tens if not hundredsof thousands of peopleall over the planet with their eyes onthe assetthat bitcoin delivers which is the utxosetso the history of the fidelity of thetransactions over the last 13 yearshas been driven to this tip of theblockchain this point in timethat incredibly high fidelitytransaction setacross history is the asset that bitcoindeliversand right now it's delivering it to thetune of 975 billion dollars in marketcapand so if we were to see something thatwas going to try to erodethis historical value transfer thistransfer logthere are hundreds of thousands ofpeople with all of their eyeson proper behavior and proper gametheoretic designand so if we begin to see or smell thefirstinstance of this which would emerge froma very verysmall point in time 51 attack theability for the network to route aroundthat type of bad behavioris instantaneous and the negative impactfor the participantsin an attack like that would becatastrophic economically and sociallyand even coordinating the individualminers within china to attempt a 51attack like that would be logistically anightmare potentially impossibleespecially when you consider the amountof miners that are doing stuff off-gridthat's the one thing that is reallyironic about the first12-13 years of bitcoin is that some ofthe mostcapitalistic activities come from thethe mining industry within chinaif you speak with some miners in chinayou'll find that they they're profitdriven as well andthey don't want any of this stuff tohappen and actually spoken to some thatare looking to co-locateequipment in different geographicalregions just to tomitigate risk from the ccp there areindividuals running these businesses areprettycapitalistic it's not like the ccpcontrols everything that's going on inthe mining industryor anything for that matter from what ican telli want to jump in on on two more datapoints that are really important whenyou think about this mental modelone is that the largest bitcoin mine inthe world that i'm aware ofis about 250 to 300 megawatts in sizeand represents somewhere between threeand five percent of the networkdepending on the rigs that they'rerunningso you need to have if every farm inchina was that sizeyou would need to get your hands on 15to 20 ofthe largest so what that really meanswhen you look at sort of the power lawacross how large those farms really areyou need to find your way to get yourhands on 50 to 100 different warehousesat the same time and get them all tobehave in the same way there's a massivecoordination problemassuming you can even locate the seconddata point is thatis exactly what marty said the migrationof hash out of china over time byexisting playersis very very rapid and they're verymotivated so if you're operating on anyof those hydrofacilities in china there's significantseasonality you're already moving hashin between locations and so they'reincentivized to avoid those switchingcoststo migrate to regions where there'sstable access to powerwhich by and large is in eastern europeright now i've heard of some southamerican migrationamong a couple of other locations so thetrend is moving actively awayof the miners that are there currentlynot to mention the net new hash thatmarty and myself represent among othersmigrating elsewhere and explainwhy they're moving elsewhere politicalriskexactly it's power availability andpolitical risk sothey do not live under a stableregulatory regime by any stretchand they don't always have high uptimehigh availability of powerbecause you know they're very beholdento the to the wet and dry seasonality ofchina's hydro environmentwhat is the because i know the currenthashing is less than 50 percent therewhat's the number that we're seeingtoday and what was itfive years ago the most common stat thatwas thrown out at least within the lastthree years was sixty percentpretty sure that's weighing to aroundforty percent of recent estimatesit's been high eighty percent i wouldimagine at some point yeah like if chinawas going to control the bitcoinnetwork the best chance to do so wasprobably five or six years agoharry you have any other comments on onthe amount that's there right nowyeah the estimates i've seen aresimilarly 40 to 60 65and you know we tend to think it's thelower end of that range becauseyou know even you'll see bit mainpre-split and and i guess now they'rebit main post split the jihan iv they'velocated hash and usthey've got multiple facilities runningin the us and so even sort of the thecrown jewel of the chinesemining industry is locating hash in theus right now sowe've seen that progression over timehappen and like with anythingi think it's going to continue i thinkthat when you think about why hash wantsto leave it's about a regulatory regimethat's uncertainin favor of a regulatory regime that'sthat's at least more certainand legally is significantly morecertainthat really surprises me that you'reseeing them move into theinto the us i would think that the thepower expense here would not beoptimal for them how are you guys seeingthatthat means big operation was down totexas correct i believe they bought asubstation down therecontrol that substation i think driveyour cost of power production down verylowum i can't speak to exact sources ofenergy production for for these chineseminers that are looking todistribute their operations to northamerica but i mean just fromwhat we see in the field of greatamerica mining and there's abundantcheap energy hereall across north america not even justthe united statesi want to go back to a point that youmade early on there marty aboutfull nodes dictating what actually takesplace on the networkand that the miners are just providing asecurity service to secure the networkharry you had said the jihan 4. explainto people whohave no idea what that is and why thisis such an important moment thathappened in the summer of 2017that really kind of demonstrated to theworld thatrunning a full node is is really kind ofcalling the shots as to the directionof the network i think this is alsoimportant explain to people what thedifference betweenrunning a full node and mining even isthis is great and this gets to the coreof why bitcoin the softwarefunctions effectively what mining doesand what full nodes do is theythey and we we validate the integrity ofthe transactionsthat are processed and ensure that thebehavior of the networkis in compliance with the rule setthat the participants in the networkhave agreed to and sothe job of the miner is to process thetransactionswhat we basically do is say you knowthere's something called the mempool soyou've got thousands of people and nowmillions of people around the worldsendingbitcoin back and forth they areattaching afee to their transaction in an attemptto get a miner to include thattransaction in a blockso it's like an auction what miners willdo is pull the highest valuetransactions into blockssort of in cascading order from highestfee to lowest fee and soonce we've constructed a block which isreally just a set of transactions thatare compliant within the rule setwe find the block which means you knowdiscoverthe cryptographic signature of that setof transactionsand we say to the network look at me ifound itand we show the completed block to allthe nodesand the nodes look at the block and saydoes this blocksit within the compliant framework thatthe software that i'm runningon my full node says is check or failso you know we think about it very muchlike a puzzlewhere a puzzle takes a really long timeand a lot of effort to finishbut anybody walking by can tell you ifthe puzzle's done or notand so we're the puzzle solvers and thenodes are the puzzle checkersbut they have the power because if theysay your puzzleain't worth the pieces that areassembled we don't get paidso we have a tremendous incentive tobehave properlywithin the rule set that the nodesdictate because ifwe don't do that we don't get paid butwe spent all that money on theelectricityto solve the puzzle in the first placeso the game theory is such that thenodes have power over the minersand the miners are highly motivated tobe compliant within the rule set definedby the nodesso how much does it cost to run a fullnode and how difficult is itand i run one i'm just asking thisfor the audience to hear how importantthis is this piecethe person who's checking the puzzle tomake sure that it's a completed puzzle ilove the analogyhow much do they got to spend and howmuch effort is involved and how muchelectricity are they burningto do this activity pretty cheap you canget a raspi and a couple other piecesmaybeone terabyte two terabyte sd card andget a full node running for less thantwo hundred dollars i think i've seensome setups that are less thana hundred dollars there's evendevelopers workingon uh software a b core specifically onethat comes to mind where you canactually run a full node on anandroid phone or some android devices aswell so it's relatively cheapa lot of people can afford it i actuallyjust spun up a full node two weekendsagogot a new mac mini 16 hours to go fromzeroto setting it up and it's pretty easyyou go to github.combitcoin bitcoin you follow somedirections andyou're able to spin that note up anddownloadthe rule set and blockchain the historyof the blockchain andfollow along as new blocks are producedand you're savvy enough you'll actuallyuse your full node to make surethat if you're actually takingpossession of utxos your bitcointhat you're validating the addressesthat bitcoin is sent toon your node alone so you're nottrusting anybody else's node but but thenode that you downloaded andhave it in your possession would youguyslook at it as the governance structureof bitcoin is thata good way to describe it it's very lowcost to basicallybe a part of this voting in these thispuzzle checkerthe energy expenses is pretty muchnegligible like a person's not evengoing to noticethe energy that it takes to run a fullnodeyeah so and i want to be i want to besuper cautious of the termgovernance because bitcoin isfundamentally anopt-in system and an opt-out system soit's bi-directionaland so you know you hear the term likegovernance in a lot of othera lot of other projects that are outthere and i'm super wary of it becausei think that the governance mechanismfor bitcoin is fully distributed anddecentralizedand so what that means is that there'stotal autonomy to interact withthe rule set um independently andthere's no wayto sort of like uh the idea of a votemeans that there's a majority rulewhich is not the governance mechanismthat functions for bitcoinit's different than that so like youknow bitcoin is not a democracy bitcoinis a rough consensusyeah exactly that's what i was going tosay you know when you download you'reparticipating inthe social consensus of the network andusing that node to verifyfor yourself um at least in the way thatit should beso marty if the three of us wanted tocreate our own rule set we want to takethe bitcoinfull node that we're currently runningchange it slightly and the three of usagree to run that rule set now we'rerunning our ownhard fork version of bitcoin correctit's a very small network effectyes but then you we don't have anyminers that are willing to mine blockson that that network of three nodescorrectyes we'd have to convince if we keep thehash cash shot 256mining algorithm for our three-personbitcoin fork we'd have to convinceat least a couple miners to point theirtheir hash rateand our work network so harry go back to2017now that we just had that mini exampleofforking bitcoin with three full nodesand explain what was attempted back in2017 and what the result wasin 2017 and i'm sure marty's gonna havea lot to add to this as well i was stillin not in my bitcoin infancy but in mybitcoin pre-adolescencebut essentially there was a verycontentious technical introduction intointo bitcoin the software which was theargument that there wasa group of relatively centralized actorswho were pushing an agenda to dosomething called increase the block sizelimitwhere you know if you think of ablockchain as a database fundamentallyeach block has a certain amount ofspace within it in which you're able toinclude transactions and sowhat the argument that this group ofpeople wanted to introduce was a biggerblock size so they wanted to double theamount of transactionsthat could be included in a block andthey wanted to do sothrough a fork and so what the thebitcoin network was able to provethrough rejecting this was thatthe folks who wanted to do this werelargely mining adjacentand mining related it was it was bitmainand it was othersand what happened was you had these sortof i don't want to saylarger entities but they were sort oflarger corporate entitiescoinbase was on that list i thinkshapeshift was on that there were neverthree scale dcg is on that list uhi think that's important because you'reshowing how much firepower was coming tothe tablewith this idea that they won the fork itto have larger blocksi mean it wasn't like you were dealingwith a ragtag group of people in thespacethis was a a powerful minority decisionattempted decision the way it went downso this goes all the way backscaling debate so it was a scalingdebate bitcoin users the networkstakeholders within the network whetherit be people building businessesbuilding mining operations or just usingbitcoin and running full nodes andvery passionate about the trajectory ofbitcoin moving forward and of course thedevelopers as well working on theprotocoland the debate was all right how do wescale this andas harry mentioned corporate entitieswanted todouble arbitrarily so it's like anarbitrary doubling of the block sizefrom one megabyte to two megabytesand just a lot of the community myselfincluded a lot of developer communityand otherstakeholders for like all right thisdoesn't really make any sense because ifyou double it once what's to stop youfrom doubling it againand so on and so forth into perpetuityand thatis a bad trade-off to make and i thinkit's importantto highlight marty as you're saying thatthe bigger that we make these blocksthe less or the harder it is for a fullnode operator who's checking the puzzlepiecesto do that independently at 200with no electrical costs and all thatkind of stuff like because we've keptthe blocksmall anybody and their kid's sister cango out there and stand up a full nodeand become a checker of the puzzles thatare beingconstructed in a low-cost way so thatthat we havei mean i don't know what the number isi've heard anywhere from 10 to 100 000full node operators i'd be curious tohear what you guysthink the numbers are but to keep theblocks small we're able tokeep the protocol decentralized at theend of the day so i'm sorry to interruptyou keep going with whatyou were saying there said perfectly youwant to be able to make sure thatas many individuals as possible anddownload the blockchain which isfilled with data right now i believe theblockchains i haven't looked in a whileit's probably around like 350 gigabytesi would imagineand so like if that gets too big if youallow two mega blockmegabyte blocks four megabyte blocks soon and so forth blocks and producedevery10 minutes and those blocks wind upgetting pretty full it's a prettysignificantburden on individuals trying to downloadthe blockchain especially when you takeinto considerationbandwidth around the world and how howfickle that can be in some areas sotaking these trade-offs intoconsideration uhthe stakeholders particularly from thedeveloper community and bitcoinusers that rallied on twitter and othersocial networkshey this doesn't make much sense numberone because you're just arbitrarilydoubling it and then twoyou're actually hard forking to do thisand so when you're hard for there's achance that people getforked off the network and in bitcoinyou want to be backward compatible whenyou're making these updates soyou tend to rely on what's called a softfork which allows you to get theseupgrades but also make sure peoplerunningearlier versions of the software are notout of consensus like the man in a comaa man who falls in a coma forthree years and has his node running athome be able to wake up from that comaand go to his node and still interactwith the bitcoin networkthree years later no change is gonnamake it so he's out of consensus andthat's howthe bitcoin software project sort ofapproaches thedevelopment of the protocol it's veryconservative and want to make it soanybody throughout any point inbitcoin's history can interact with thenetwork no matter what versionsoftware they're running or as early ofthe software version as possiblethis is such an important point aroundthese trade-offs to highlight again andto beincredibly incredibly clear this isabout time preferencethis is about what features and andfacets of bitcoin arevaluable over over a 20 to 50 to 100year time scaleand prioritizing those now when thingsare stillnot fully ossified still malleable we asa community need to continue to provethat this is a multi-century project andtake those priorities to hearttoday in the development decisions thatget made on an ongoing basis and sothe argument that we need to double thetransaction throughputin exchange for compromising on thebroadness of the distribution of thevalidator setis an unbelievable sort of in retrospectdecision to have been proposedyou know whether it's seven transactionsa second or fourteendoesn't matter getting that validationset into as wide as aset of hands as possible is such anorder of magnitude more importantto the longevity and viability of thisproject that's the decision that gotmadethrough you know through the broadercommunity but i want to go back toexactly what marty said at the end thereabout backward compatibility this is thekeythat what we the choices that we make onan opt-in basis not the choices we evermake for the network the opt-in choicesthat we makecan be projected out over such a longtime scaleand we can have such a high degree ofconfidence that the bitcointhe utxo set like we've talked aboutthat sits in a walletor sits in an address over an incrediblylong period of timeuntouched will have the um the sameamount of validity and inclusionwithin the choices that get made by thedevelopment communityover these multi-decade time scales thisis why we are building harder soundermoneythat can scale over time precedentsmatterlike arguably like we could have ruinedthe network if the contingentof power brokers that wanted toarbitrarily doublethe block size could have destroyedbitcoinright then and there but luckily itdidn't work full node validators provedthat they run the network andhere we are today four years later andthat's really kind of the pointof this entire part that we're talkingabout is the full node operators sidedwithsmaller blocks with a segwit updateopposed togoing in in a different direction thatwas just hey let's just keepincreasing the block size which wouldlead to this centralization ofof nodes and so the full node operatorsthe consensusof the full node operators led tosmaller blocksis what will be validated for thecontext of this conversation that we'rehaving particularly tonight95 the hash rate was signaling for adoubling of the block size twowhich is the opposite of what the fullnode operators had signaledit's final proof that we are subservientto the to the will of the nodewe as miners are subservient to the willof the nodes and that is the correctpath forwardall right so let's go to this secondsoftball question that i havewe went almost 25 minutes on the firstsoftballokay so this next one my god have iheard this onebitcoin mining uses so much energy itwillboil the oceans that's our goalthis is what we got into this industryfor really just trying toto increase the temperature of theworld's oceans no i meanto start this particular topic like ithinkit has to be laid bare that the bitcoinwears its energy consumption to acertain degree on its sleeve likeanybody can pointat the network due to the fact that it'san open protocol an open source protocolall the data about what's happening inthe blocks and the amount of computingpowerdedicated to to bringing those blocks tomarketand the amount of hash rate dedicated tothat which is estimatedbased on how fast or slow blocks arecoming in every 2016 blocksyou can sort of ballpark how much energyis being consumedto produce the amount of hashes that arebeing produced to secure the network andadd blocksto the bitcoin blockchain so right offthe bat bitcoin has thisi don't want to say an unfair advantageis easy to pick on and point at say heylook at how muchenergy the bitcoin network's consumingwhereas if you had toget a measurement of the amount ofenergy that is used to back the usdollar reserve systemand that includes things like themilitary-industrial complex all thebuildingsthat run the federal reserve banks andthe the commercial banksin the u.s banking system all thecommutesto and from work of the people that workin those buildings the amount of paperexpended in those buildings the amountof energy and air conditioner andheating consumed in those buildingsthat number just isn't public the extentan effortto which you'd have to go actually getthat information to compare to bitcoinis extremely hard like it's not easyto find that information so bitcoin sortof had a disadvantage right off the batwith this particular argument that itcan't really be comparedtruly compared to to its competitorsbecause they don't weartheir energy consumption on their sleevejust like the bitcoin network doesand then which is what harry and i sortof know very intimately due to whatwe're doing specifically in the fieldwith bitcoin mining isif people came to understand the sourcesof energy that is being converted intoelectricity to mine bitcoinpaints a bit of a different picturewhere you're not reallycreating net new energy to to minebitcoin you're not going out anddrillinga hole in the earth to pull out oil tomine bitcoin specifically bitcoin minersagainbecause they are incentivized to drivetheir cost to power production down aslow as possible they go and seek outextremely cheap sources of energy whichtend to be strand of renewables orfossil fuels like natural gas in oil andgas fields that would otherwise bewastedvia flaring or venting in some cases sonumber one it wears its energyconsumption on its sleeve and number twodue to the just the pure incentives thatdrive costdown as low as possible bitcoin minersare going to disparate landsto find wasted and stranded energypreston i have three assumptions i wantto challengein this like as a very good sort ofbaseliningfor this whole discussion the first isthat energy consumption is not a badthingif you look over the long arc of historythe best societal biomarkersfor sort of societal advancement and andmaturity and qualityare all extremely correlated to energyconsumption per capita healthcareeducationnutrition infant mortality all of thethings that you would look at and saywow those are moving in the rightdirectionalso correlate incredibly tightly toenergy densityat the population level so that's sortof the first level setting that i thinkis important in a discussion like thisis like it's not like the energy isyou know being used to spin a whirlpoolin the ocean that never gets that nevertouches anything this energyyou know that that gets consumed by usas a society deliversutility and delivers good outcomes sothat's the first the first piecethe second is that i think energy in thecontext of bitcoin is really discussedas wasteand i just challenged that premise firstand foremost the bitcoin networkis directly tied to the laws ofthermodynamics as i'm sure we're goingto get into in more detail butthat tight relationship betweenthermodynamic laws andthe value proposition of the bitcoinnetwork the bitcoin network deliversincredible valueto millions of people all over the worldso that energy is not wasted that energyis properly utilizedfor positive economic outcomes forpeople you know so i immediatelychallenge the assumption that thatthat it's quote unquote wasted as ifit's not being used for something ofvalueit's absolutely being used for somethingof value the quality of the bitcoinnetwork delivers tremendous valueand then third this is another kind offoundational assumption around this thisargument setis that when i plug a new miner in i'mnotgenerating another marginal kilowatthourthat kilowatt hour already exists andit's being consumedby me but me plugging in a new minerdoesn't make the coal turbinespin one more time around the axle orthe or the nuclear turbine heat thesteamone iota more or the you know the netgaspipeline pump in one more unit that'snot how the energy grid is designed it'snot how the energy generation andtransmission systemcertainly in the united states and notelsewhere as well it's not how thatworksand so we need to go back to a bit moreof a first principle understanding ofhowenergy gets generated transmitted andconsumed for us to have this discussionin a substantive wayand i think the really important part isyou now havean incentive structure for the entireplanet to figure out a wayto harness the energy like you're sayingthat's already being createdwhether it's wind some type of waterturbineor whatever i don't care what it is orflaring and i'm sure we're going to getintoa lot of that with marty it's almostlike if you're on a sailboat you'recapturing the wind that's that's alreadythere you can harness it or you can putyour sail downand and complain about somebodyharnessing it but you now have one ofthe biggest incentive structures thathasever been put in place in the world fortrying to capture zero cost energywhich i think is a really exciting partto all of thisso i first want to just dive into thisideado you guys see it more from a from afuture standpoint fromwhere we are at today in five years fromnow are you gonna see peoplethat have like heating elements or homewater heaters and furnaces things likethatthat are actually mining rigs people insome areas are doing is very niche rightnowi know jesse pelton from hottle ranchdown in texas hehas a uh a hot tub that he made out ofan s that he'swarming with an s9 miner he calls it spa256to some of these some of theseapplications and in siberiai think there's been many cases ofpeople using miners to my bitcoin andthen heat their homesto save save on electricity coststhere's some do-it-yourself guides outtherethat you can find i believe kanoalchemist is onethat you can go and he's got a guide onhow you can create a home minerand use some waste heat from that minerto heat your housewhether or not that's commercial in fiveyears i can't sayconfidently that it will or won't be butit's certainly possiblei just look at it from let's just saythis does become global moneyeveryone now has an incentive to takethe thingaround their house that's just naturallyjust wasted energyand you would think that there would besuch an incentive for marketparticipants to start designinga ways to capture anything andeverything to start doing theseactivities to secure the network butalsoparticipate in some type of mining poolso that they're collecting money fromthisit just seems like an obvious next stepthat i guess wouldn't bereal obvious today it all comes down tothe cost of power i think the cost ofpower is low enoughi mean and people are looking to profitoff of mininglike it will happen like i said it'shappening a little bit butwhether or not that'll be widespread infive years again i can't say confidentlyagain the opportunity that existswith these stranded energy sources is solarge and so vast it's going to take acouple decades to beginbuilding out and plugging in theinfrastructure to takeadvantage of these sources and be asefficient as possible with thosei think commercial use case may come onthe back end of the curvei go actually pretty hard the other wayi think that i think it is going to beprettyapproachable to have this happen houseby house i think thatit's been a pretty good bet over thelast 50 60 years that that havingmoore's law at your back is a good spotto be inwhich is where we're at right now withwith solar and withsemiconductors and so you get some ofthis solar stuffcheap enough it's going to make all thesense in the world to throw a couplerigs on the back of that you know whywhy waste selling it back to your gridwhen you can just you know push itthrough some statsand so it's going to come down to thecost of the infrastructure and i thinkthat i think that's kind ofthe limiter there but like you getmoore's law working on on solar arrayswell enough and and you get you get someadvancement thereit's gonna make all the sense in theworld to have that on your home and andyou know depending on how you financeyou know the houses of the future you'reoffsetting your mortgage to some degreewith something like that or you'reoffsetting your other utility bills youryou know your water or yourpick your other utility you'reoffsetting it with you know with thosesats that are churning on the back sideof an arrayi could totally see that happening youknow 30 40 50market penetration so marty i want toget intogreat american mining and what it isthat you guys are doingtoday because i just find this soexcitingand just so fascinating becauseeverything we're talking aboutof harnessing energy that's alreadythere but it's not being put into anytype of productive usebut now through what you guys are doingit is so explained to this in a firstprinciples kind of wayfor people just from start to finish toreally kind of visualize what it iswe're talking about andwhat it is you're doing because it'sfascinating yes great american miningstorystarts the search for cheap abundantenergy you know like i said earlierthe goal of miners especially if you'rerunning a mining business is to driveyour cost of power production downas low as possible so on our journey tofindcheap abundant energy that will allow usto scale we stumbledinto the oil and gas industry actuallyour head engineer reitwas at a county fair in utah or statefair in utahjust talking to a buddy of his new oiland gas industry was explainingour problem of what we were trying to doin regards to cheap energy and his buddysaid hey i have this water treatmentfacility and we're justflaring gas into the atmosphere ibelieve we have like 50 mcfdif you want to come plug in a generatorand hook up those minerswe can certainly make that happen andthat was basically the start of thejourneythat we went on and so we went there weplugged in a generatorplugged in a pipeline that took the gasfrom where it would be flared and aflare like the stack that's behind me inthis videoinstead of piping it to the flare stackjust piped it to a generatorthat converted the energy intoelectricity andthat was used to run our miners and thatwas our first prototype we said hey thisworksso for the last three years or two and ahalf years we've beengoing around the oil and gas industryparticularly in north dakotain the bakken because north dakota hasvery strict flaringregulations and basically our value proptoproducers is hey we know that if youflare a certain amountyou're gonna have to stop oil productionthe regulators in north dakota are verystrictif drones flying over fields and reallytrying to to measure how much eachproducer is flaring after you flare acertain amountthe regulators come in and say hey youhave to shut down production you'recontributing too much co2and methane to the atmosphere and so wecome in and we say heyinstead of flaring that gas why don't wedo an off-take agreement we'll buy thatgas from you for very cheap instead offlaringyou'll be able to just pipe it to ourgenerators we'll consume it or excuse meconvert it to electricity using the epacertified generator we'll mine bitcoinwith it that's howour pitch started and it's sort ofevolving as theproducers sort of understand what'sgoing on in the 20 and 40 foot shippingcontainersthat we bring on to their well pads areproducingtalk the containers real fast so you'vegot a 20 to 30 foot containerthat's filled up with mining rigsit's pretty simple right theinfrastructure on the well pad you get apipethat takes the the gas and pipes it toyour generator we daisychain a few generators together just incase one goes downthe whole container doesn't go down youkeep hashing the energy from thatgenerator to a power distribution unitthat exists within the container andthen that pdudistributes the electricity to eachindividual minerin the 20-foot shipping container we canfit i believe like 160m20s i mean as the models keep going upand down you can get a little creativeand fit moreyou can get that's the thing about thesecontainers harry mentioned powerdensity earlier these these containersare extremely energy denseand so about like a 20 foot containerdepending on what modelcan produce anywhere from 750 kilowattsto1.2 megawatts of energy on the oil fielddepending on the btu content of the gaslet's assume it'sclean gas at 1100 bpu and you'reproducing 120 mcfdyou can consume that would be like amegawatt of a mining operation thereso we come on and it's the beauty of itthese are very modularcontainers and a modular solution totheir problem takes up very littlereal estate on the well pad again we sayhey instead of flaring that gaslet's run it to our generators and plugit into this container theinfrastructure is prettystraightforward and and we have somefans to helpregulate airflow and some filters tomake sure it doesn't get too dustyif you understand the physics of what'sgoing on particularly around the airflowyou can get these boxes up and runningand make sure that they havesignificant uptime one thing we're veryproud of that we've had 98uptime in the field which is comparableto like warehouse mineso now as they're funneling this gas toyour rigsto your generators it's that energizeyour rigsthey're able to keep doing theiroperationsfor longer because they're not flaringis that correctyes they're able to extract more oil andpush more to marketspecifically in north dakota but itseems that the posturing in the industrythroughout the united states is movingtowards the north dakota modeltexas railroad commission is isposturing like they're going to getstrict with flaring specificallyi want to just ground us in in some insome framinghow much cleaner is it to do it this wayto run the flare or the venting througha gen set or generatorthan it is relative to what they weredoing previously like like what's thedelta look likeit depends on where you are it dependson the type of flare and depends onhow windy it is so north dakotaespecially in the winter it gets verywindyand these flares as you can see this onebehind me is leaning a little bit whenit's windyit makes the the flare a little lessefficient sothe flare is burning methane at the endof the day which is a greenhouse gasthat's extremely heavy compared to co2it's uh 30 to 50 times heavier dependingon theamount of time it spends in theatmosphere and so when it's very windyand these flare sacks are blowing allaround very inefficientsome studies say flares with wind that'shigher than 10 miles per hourare 30 30 efficient you're having asignificant amount of methane leakbeyond that flare and when youpipe that to an epa certified generatorcombust it in there that's 99.99efficiency you're still creating co2emissions but it's much more efficientcompared to some flares and windyconditions then on top of thatwhich is more important you're creatingpositive economic value sosomething again like i said earlierwe're doing off take agreements but nowwe're getting into joint ventures withproducers want to participate in theupside ofsats that are being produced in ourmining containers and sothe flare is turning from a drag ontheir balance sheets and their incomestatements intolike a positive revenue streamsignificantly more resilient andprofitable at the endso how much if you if you procured oneof these mining rigs just saythe 20 to 30 foot size rig in a year howmuchwould that produce in value assumingthat i know it's really hard because theprice of bitcoin keeps going up i don'tknow how you could possiblyestimate that based on the price movingup all the time but give us a ballparkof like roi for something like thati can tell you exactly so we actuallybuilt a gas to hash calculatorthat's what we call our containers isgas to hash containers we basicallybuilt this calculatorour engineering team it takes your mcfdproduced on a particular weld pad so theparticular example i have up right nowis500 mcfd the btu discus is1100 btu so it's very clean gas thecurrent netback forthis producer is about 50 cents per mcfdand the minor model we plugged in wasthe m20swhich is a couple generations old fromcoming from what's minorcompared and so this is all compared tohenry hub prices it's not even justflaringwe're assuming that this gas was able tobe brought to market and sold at henryhub pricesminus the marketing cost so today if youwere to do thatthe revenue produced per day with thisparticular setup would be 15eight dollars and monthly that turnsinto four hundred and seventy fivethousand dollars roughlywhich is four hundred and twentythousand dollars more profitableit would be able to be selling that gasto market at henry hub pricesand now that's if they were able to evenget it to marketthe multiples that you're making on thisthis waste gas areinsane this doesn't even get into theiropportunity cost of not being able toperform their primary operationshow much time were they down for flaringlike if they could normally produce it24 hoursthey're down to 12 hours because offlaring what what do those numbers looklikei don't know the exact numbers arethey're shut down for for a significantamount of timein some cases where the well goes alittle staleand then getting it back up and runningis is a bit of a burdenand takes a lot of money so they'rehighly incentivized to reduce this flaresothey feel like they're getting close tothe epa targets or excuse me the stateregulator targets they'll shut downthemselvesto sort of fall below that line so theycan still revamp the wellwithout having to be forced shut downwhich if they're forced shut down andforce thestave shut down for an extended periodof time they may not be able to get thatwellback up and running very efficiently allright guys i want to transition intosome of the questions that we had fromtwitter i posted we were going to havethis conversation and we got aton of questions for both of you guysthis one is i think a really commonquestion that a lot of peoplehave for an average guy in your opinionis it better to invest in mining or juststraight up buy bitcoini think buying bitcoins probably betterbut if the execution risk is high that'sall i'll say rightharry you got to be able to execute onactually plugging this inand doing it at a at a price that'sprofitablelisten you really need to think throughvery carefullyif you have the shops to do it yourselfthere's some service providers out therewho do a good job of hosting your gearforyou but again like unless you'veproperly allocated to bitcoinwithin your perspective on the asset iwouldn't start looking at mining on anindividual levelbecause of the competition there's a lotof mistakes that can be made along theway and youwind up have the intent of getting intomining that you're gonna mine all thisbitcoin and it can take you a lot longerto plug in that machine and it may notmake as much money as you expectedbecause your electricity costsare higher than you thought they wouldbe and then the actuallike servicing the machines knowing whento replace fans andhow to work with the hashing boardsthat's not something you just jump intoand understand right awaybaptism by fire you gotta learn a lot ofhard lessons to to understand how toexecutehave these i mean the goal is to havethese bitcoin miners are essentiallyphysical bitcoin optionsyou want up and running as long aspossible you want them to havethe highest up time that you canpossibly get them to have andif you've never done it before there'sjust a learning curve that you're gonnahave togo through you're looking to accumulatea certain amount of bitcoin like harrysaidprobably better off buying just so youcan get in before the price runs upanymorethe other like intricacy to it is likeeach of you like exactly what marty saidabout about i think about thethe rigs basically as as bitcoindenominatedassets and specifically options theykind of play with whether or not they'rea bond or an optionbut they do have this option componentto them wherethere's this uncertain expiry so you'reyou're constantly living through aperiod of time decaywhere bitcoin price can go up andprotect your margins for longerbut on average hash rate goes upmachines get more efficientpeople find cheaper power over time thenumber of sats that your hash rate willproduceis going to go down and so you're livingthrough this period of time decay whereyou hope that price continues toappreciate so you can run at aprofitable marginbut the sacks that get produced it justisn't going to be there as you know aslong as youas long as you think and that's a it's atotal uncertain variable soyou have to be really thoughtful aboutsort of the dynamics at play withinyou know within the framework on how youthink about it you know because youreally you really are spending quite abit of fiatto accumulate sort of this this umdecayingsat revenue stream and then how do youintegrate that into sort ofyour approach to fully allocating tobitcoin in the way that you see fit foryourselfyou need to think about it within thatbroader context before you make adecision like that it's not like juststarting a businessi'll tell you the thing that i've justcome through the realization oftalking with you guys right now is justhow much of an incentive there isfor the people that are doing thisthey're getting energyfor free or they have some type ofincentive tolike the flaring example that youprovided for them to be able todo their primary operations because nowthey don't have to flare because it'sbeing sent through something like thisyou can just see how it's it is justdrivingthis type of work this type of miningwork into the handsof businesses that that have thoseopportunitiesto leverage and it's not like hey i'mgonna plug this into my walland my house and start using theelectricity out of the wall likeit's just not going to happen right likeyou're not going to survive for 10secondsno i think particularly what we're doingwith the waste gaschanges the opportunity cost in the oiland gas industrycompletely like now that this onevariable this one revenue streamhas been entered into the equation likeproducers start asking themselvesquestions like should i even build apipelinedo i need to drill as many wells nextyear the oil and gas industry arguablyin one of the most terribleallocators of capital over the last twodecades in the shale industryspecificallythis is coming from shell players thati've been speaking to for the lastcouple of years they'll admit it andthey took out a bunch of loansdrilled a bunch of wells expecting theprice of a barrel and oil to be between80 and 100and that simply hasn't materialized andso to keep a status quo of profit andthey have todrill more wells and get more volume tomarket to try to make up that deltain the price they were expecting and sonow that you have this revenue stream inbitcoin mining that's driven bycompletely different demand factorsis providing a service that's demanded24 7 365which is adding blocks to the bitcoinblockchain it justcompletely makes these oil and gasproducers more resilient they don't haveto dependon oil and gas only they now have thisother optionthat's driven by completely differentfactors allows them to take a step backtake a breatherand be more efficient and think aboutwhat they're doingis a bit more peace of mind thesecommodity producers need a two-weekdifficulty adjustment and a four-yearhaving in their uhsupply right it's uh last year provedthis right yeah the demand shock causedby the economic lockdowns and the shaleindustry collapsed in and of itselfand then the main futures contract gonegative and the amount of mergers andacquisitions andbankruptcies that we've seen over thelast 10 months arguablydue to a misallocation of capital andpoor planningso talk to everyone i'm sure everyone'sdying to hearthe answer on this one and it relates tothe supply chainfor the chip manufacturing this isbecoming a huge headline just not forthis space but for automotives and andyou name it somy understanding is that these rigs area year and a half like if you order anew rig right now it'sa year and a half from from deliverywhat's the impact of this what are thereal timelines that you guys are hearingandjust fill us in on on all the insidescoop that you goti think what we've seen certainly duringthe trump presidencyand the relationship with china that'skind of matured hereand now what we're seeing you know in apre during and postkind of peak covered environment is idon't think it's that controversialright now to say that the most importantcompany on the planetis tsmc it's got the most components inthe most physical infrastructureacross every sector whether that's aniphoneor a ford f-150 or an aws serveryou name the critical piece of of theamerican economyit touches that company in a criticalpath type of wayso the backdrop on sort of this piece ofthe conversationis that the supply chain constraints arenot limited to bitcoin exactly like yousaidthese are extremely broad constraintsand the entire economy is feeling themvery specifically in our in our industryin bitcoin miningagain you're spot on there are there aresignificantly delayed lead timesthere are significant price elasticityat this point in time for for in-stockunits um or for nearly in stock unitswhen you're talking premiums how muchare you talking the price of thishardwaretracks the price of bitcoin pretty closeas the price of bitcoin starts jumpingso does the price of the hardware sosince the summerbitcoins up 5x so the prices on thesehardware rigs have gone up 5xlet's put it this way like s9s which areprobably like the oldest models runningon the market right now selling for 20march of last year in some casesand now they're selling for 250wow yeah so you got to think about italong acurve of of convexity where the s9sgo from marginally negative tomarginally positive the firthe first and so with that first initialspike in bitcoin pricethey go from unprofitable to profitabledepending on your power costand so they receive the most kind ofupward volin the curve the other machines thathave higher efficiencythey are profitable you know longer andsooner so so they don't get the samespikeas early in the price action but they dosee that rising tide soyou know you'll see a more advanced unitgo from twenty five hundred dollarsto ten thousand dollars you know somaybe it's only up three or four xrelative to five x bitcoin so the s9 isa10 plus x a higher efficiency machine isup 3 to 5xso i'm curious you had said the s9 whichis a very old rigand you said that the price today wasaround 250 so if a personpurchased that today plugged it in gotinto a mining poolhow much bitcoin are they mining in ayear's time framefor something like that i'm just tryingto get an roibased on that price that that rig'sselling for just out of curiosity i meanusingsame metrics of 500 mcfd that would belikeyeah and i know it comes down to theenergy cost but if you were the energycost that you guys are getting withyour methane operation i'm trying tothink of how many s9s i would take toconsume that much energy on top of myheadi can tell you that that at 10approximately 10 centspower which is normal for a new yorkcity apartmentnot so normal for any miner on theplanet it's much higherthat's about a one year payback thatgenerates in net ofnet of electricity about 265 dollars ayearwow and then last year when it was at 20dollars you were you would have probablystill beeni mean it was 20 bucks 100 return on 20bucksi'm assuming you would have would youhave even had it plugged in a year agobased on the competition in the in thebitcoin price or would you would havehad that rig turned off10 cents not in a new york cityapartmentyeah so that's like theory is like a lotof these s9 soldbut like march or april last year harryand then they got moved to to peoplewith very low cost of power productionpeople was freeto power between zero and probably oneand a half two centsfor me it's just beyond fascinating toseethat just naturally taking place in afree and open market where these rigsthat i think at face value you mightthink oh well now they're just gonnathrow all these rigs awaythat they manufactured from eight yearsago and that is not the casethese things are being repurposed soldinto areas that haveno electrical cost or it's going to justpen up demand of energy that's justbeing burned offwhen the market runs again on the nextcycle it becomes a very profitablemachine for somebody to runand it's providing security to thenetwork and man you can go on and onit's fascinating stufftransparently from just from for me andmy career this is what's so excitingabout it is iget to be in one of the absolute hardestmost cutthroat mostflagrantly capitalistic environments youcould possibly find to me it's this intrading deskthose are the only things where you'rewhere you are you know kind of hip tohipand knife to knife with the person onthe other side of the tradeexcept for us it's everybody elselooking to start and run thesebusinessesmore efficiently and more cheaply at thepower cost level and do better tointegrate their supply chain andcapture margin along other sort ofnaturally occurring you know avenuesit'ssuch a game of inches such a game ofprecision it's so excitingand to bring this back to like the thechip manufacturing too like it is prettydire right now where you have thesefoundries like four major ones two ofwhichtsmc taiwan and samsungsouth korea are two producing asic chipsthatbitmain and micro pt which produceswhat's minersare using in their devices but with thatbeing said both companiesare looking to build boundaries on u.ssoil which is huge developmentpeople are really stressed out about itnow but i'm actually extremely bullishon the diversity of the semiconductorindustryinto the future in the next decadesamsung just announced i believe they'refiling for permits fora fab in austin texas that would becompleted in 2023 which is actuallyquicker than i would ever imaginetsmc is going to break land in arizonalater this yearso this is the question i got for youwhy are so many oil and gascompanies and maybe they are maybe it'sjust my perception that they aren'twhy aren't they seeing this this seemslike such a no-brainerthey're starting to they're all dogsit's hard to teach them new tricks butbut we're we're working hard at greatamerican mining and other companies likeupstream data and crusoe are also doinga good job athelping to educate the producers in theoil and gas industry andthey're coming around they're in such aposition where they're backed in thequarter as an industrybut from a profitability standpoint andfrom a pr standpointwith everybody worried about the climatethat they need to put a verystrong foot forward on both runs to bemore profitableand show the public that they're lookingto eliminate waste and be more efficientwith the fossil fuels they're pullingout of the groundwhat's something that either one of youguys have heard or seen latelyparticularly in this space that has justkind of blown your hair back like oh mygod i can'tbelieve where this is gonna go or thisthing that's going to materialize out ofwhat i just sawi think ross stevens interview withmichael sayloractually surprising to hear himarticulate a theory thati've had and many of us the greatamerican mining have had for some timenow which is thatbitcoin mining operations are going tobe the impetus forfor new sort of hubs to be built areaswhere stranded energyexists exist so bitcoin minor is goingto be sort of placing a flag down on newterritoryand attracting people and communitiesto come build uh cities and small townsaround these mining operations that'ssomething i actually believe is going tohappen andthe opportunity is so incredible andwhen you think about theeffects that i'll have on how thatdistributes society it's pretty insaneto think about and play throughtransparently i totally agree with youmarty like what we work on at gridinfrastructureis basically we take the inefficienciesthat are out therein the grid and we unlock them viabitcoin miningand that's exactly what ross was talkingabout this is why we try to get adjacentto renewable providers who are either indistressed marketsor they're working with sort of anoverproduction or under consumptionof the asset that they've built so wethink about this you know really interms of additionalitywhere this is not how the way to getpeople to develop 50-yearenergy assets is not by offering them abunch of renewable energy creditsit just isn't the way to convince peopleto invest in the massive amount ofenergy infrastructure that's neededis to provide them a robust and thrivingmarket solutionand we believe that bitcoin miningrepresents the best way to bootstrapenergy additionality especially throughrenewables becauseyou know it's really tough to toconvince people to invest intransmissionbut it's a lot easier to get people toinvest in the generation itselfso if you remove the need for thecomplexity and the size of thetransmissionthen you're able to sort of justify anentirely different suite of projectsoftentimes that have better uniteconomics than previously thoughtthe last thing i want to cover and thisreally doesn't relate to mining this ismoreon the full node front and lightning andi'm kind of curious to hear some of yourthoughtson how you see the lightning networkgrowing what that incentive structure isi kind of suspect it has a lot to dowith clearingimmediate clearing and the demand forthat moving forwardbut i want to hear your thoughts on whatyou think is going to drive more andmore people to use the lightning networkand then what are your thoughts also onthe ratesof plugging your bitcoin into thelightning network opening a channel onthe lightning network via your full nodeand collecting fees on that what how doyou guys see that playing out movingforwardi'm extremely bullish on the lightningnetwork myself iuse it every day it's my own podcast andwe hook up oursort of website and our operations evento the lightning network like we use anapp called syncs chat wherethe app picks up our podcast via rssfeed and we've actually plugged alightning network public nodeinto our rss feed and so the appautomatically picks that up and anybodythat listens to tales from the crypt onsphynx chat andthey have a lightning network built intothe erxemia lightning wallet built intothe app and as they listen tomy podcast they stream me sats everyminute sodepending on how much they want tostream me individuals do anything fromone set to 100 setsso this is the example of 10 sats perminute right now it's 5 10of a penny so that micro transaction isis possible on the lightning network andthat use case alone really gets my mindgoingwhere you can sort of fit this in acrossthe internet and so i think thelightning network like you said is goingto be usedfor for clearing and remittance andmoving money around the world around theglobe instantlybut beyond that like i think thelightning network specifically bitcoindid this but i think the lightningnetwork does it better it solvesa hole in the internet stack that's beenthere since the beginning so you knowhow you have a 404 errorwhen you don't get a web page served toyou from a server there's also a 402error which is a payments errorand so when they they architected theinternet and designed it from thebeginning they always thought therewould be a nativepayments layer built in and that'sevidenced by the 402 error which sayshey paymentdidn't go through not until we hadbitcoin and i think more specificallythe lightning network with technologieslike lsatthat lightning labs is working on couldyou actually plug this this paymentslayer into the internet so beyondclearing from a financial perspectiveclearing where remittances and interbanktransactionsi think when this gets applied to theinternet andused as a quasi communications networkvia the internet as well like thepotential for the lightning network isis massivein terms of running your own node beinga profitable routing node i think that'sgoing to be a businessit's not something that you're justgoing to be able to do willy-nilly notany effort into it it's going to take alot of effort and already does but ithinkthings like lightning pool which allowyou to lend your your bitcointhat you that you don't want to spend tolightning channels and get paid apremiumor actually make a paid a fee for thatessentially creating a yieldfor bitcoin you would not otherwisespend but doing it sowhere it's in the lightning channel andyou actually have partial custody ofthat the whole way throughi think that's also going to be massivefor individuals to get yield on theirbitcoin withouthaving to run a routing node per sewhat's the yield if say you would plugin one bitcoininto a channel on lightning today intothis poolwhat would you get on an annualizedyield for doing something like thatwould you estimatemarty right now it's a pretty illiquidmarket becauseit's all being handled without a gui allbeing handledat the command line level with thesedifferent lightning networkimplementationsspecifically lnd but once you get a guiand you're able to have like a bettermarketdevelop i wouldn't be surprised you seeanywhere from8 to 15 depending on demand on thelightning network at any given point intimei think early books are showing aroundthat level right nowthat's totally nuts i mean you don't runinto the lender borrowertype issues too because you're justplugging in your channel and i guess youwould just changethe fee in order to get all your coinsback out of the channel again is thathow that would workyeah that fee is predetermined i believetoo rewrite that into the transactionbut yeahyou're it's like any lightning channelit's a 202 multi-sigwith your counterparty you hold one keythey can never run away with yourbitcointhe worst they can do is tie it up andif you have watchtowers watching yourchanneland they try to steal it they getpunished so like the worstthat can happen at scale and when thisis all fleshed out is that you have towait a little bit to get youryour bitcoin back to the address thatyou want to send toyou'll never lose your bitcoincompletely i don't think thecounterparty risk is significantlyreducedtalk to us about the streaming partbecause i'm trying to understand the usecase i know you just described it withpeople streaming you sats but that'sjustout of their own good will to to streamit talk to us abouthow you could see a free and open marketof streaming taking place of peoplereceivingsats over lightning well it's like payper minute right and say so you payfor exactly what you consume and becomemore efficient if yousay somebody spends 15 dollars a monthon a netflix subscription but they onlyever watch one showalready believe they're wasting moneyimagine being able to watch that oneshow and just streamthe amount of value that that showprovided for you and nothing over thatthat's the sort of efficiencies thisstreaming use case can can providespecificallywhat if they listen to it on 2x it's theyeswe need to appreciate just how likepoorly servedthe financial use cases of the internetare why on earthwhy on earth is is stripe a 35 billiondollar business that thing's gettingmarked up to 100 150 billion dollarsbefore it ever touches the public marketso if stripe is worth all that and youjust saw plaid pull out of the deal withvisathey're going to now go public doubledigits of billions of dollars likethese are not complex ideas they'rebasically likehow can i tell different services myinformationand how can and how can i interact witha service these arethings that it should not have taken theinternet 40 years tostart to figure out and it's a it's amassive underservingof sort of the commerce use cases andthe financial use cases of the internetthat lightningis immediately sort of an order ofmagnitude improvement the same way thatbitcoin is an order of magnitudeimprovement on the hardness of moneyand the store of value over time and sowhat you get to seewhen you have sort of a technologyenabled level upis that the total addressable market forwhat what users actually want to doturns out it was way bigger than wethought originally and so we saw thissort of very very obviously with uberrecently likeif you told me in 1995 or 1998how often i'm going to use a car servicei would tell you two times a yearto the airport and from the airport wheni go visit my grandparents in floridathat's it that's the use case for carservices i'll never use it anymorewhat it turned out was i actually wanteda car service all the time i just wantedit to be waycheaper way easier to book way lowerfriction on the payment sideand so it took a tech enabled layer tosit on top of an existing serviceto make it actually start to to achievea discoveryof the of the addressable market and thedemand structurefor it lightning is going to do the samething across dozens and dozens ofinternet commerce functionalitybecause we're already seeing the thetype of premium that's being paid forfintechsi still think that fintechs are like aninning one or twoand that lightning is how we get out ofthe bottom of the second and start tofigure outthat we we actually have so muchcreative white spaceon the commerce internet that is justuntouched becauseyou know we were trying to paint on acanvas with a cudgelmarty i see you shaking your head itlooks like you completely agreeit's insane right like the the incentivestructures that you can set up with thisso you can prevent spamming rightyou make it costly but very cheap stillcostlyso like the sphinx chat that i wasmentioning earlier not only canindividuals streamy stats as they listento my podcast with chat app as well andi can chat with my listenersand the chat app runs on the lightningnetwork when you're chat you'reliterally sending a message vialightning network for one setlike so you're just sending one setmessages between each other and if youthink if youwant to create like a social networkthat doesn't have the twitter bots likewhen you send your tweet out today inoticed like a bunch of twitter botslike imagineif you had a social network that saidhey if you want to reply to this tweetyou have to pay two sats or whateververy cheap for the individualat scale for these bots it gets costlyand so you disincentivize that type ofactivity right off the batmy lord i think we leave it there thisis this has beenjust an incredibly just denseconversation and i have enjoyed the hellout of thisi think it's my engineering roots tohear what you guys are solvingon the energy side and how it's justcreating to these incentive structuresit's just an insane it's mind-blowingi guess the thing that you see so manypolicy makerstrying to get to how can we save theplanet with the way that we'reuh creating incentives for clean andrenewable energyand i mean my god this is the biggestincentive structure you could everimagineto unlock some of these innovations anddiscoveries in this spaceit's just so exciting guys give
