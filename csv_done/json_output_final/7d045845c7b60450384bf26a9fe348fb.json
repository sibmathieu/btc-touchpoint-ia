this episode I spoke with Seth forprivacy and Bitcoin q a they are repeatguests on the show and I introduced themmore when we get talking I want to sayby means of introduction that thisentire episode is about Bitcoin privacyparticularly for those who alreadyunderstand some of the basicsyou can check out my Bitcoin and cryptoplaylist to catch up on some of theseBasics or buy my Bitcoin privacy coursein the description there are many otherresources out there but just know thatwhile I try to summarize things in thisepisode this is more of an intermediatediscussionsome of you ask why we're talking aboutBitcoin and making it private instead ofusing Monero the answer is that Bitcoinhas its own properties that make itdesirable and it has a huge communityand popularity Monero doesn't needdiscussions about how to use it becauseit is private by default and that'sgreat finally I released this quicklyafter recording because we're in themidst of a potential financial crisis Iwould encourage you to listen to myprevious episodes on economic crisisepisode 21 and 22. now on to the showwelcome everyone to the Watchman privacypodcast I'm here with two guests todayand for your reference we are recordingthis on March 152023 I'm speaking today with Bitcoin q aand Seth for privacy they were previousguests on the show q a on episode 27Seth on episode 33. they both work forthe Bitcoin Hardware wallet companyFoundation devices wait a second SethSeth for privacy not the Seth forprivacy who was on my show last Augusttalking about Monero and appearing onvarious Bitcoin shows talking aboutMonero as the superior tool unlessBitcoin fundamentally changes Seth easyfirst question for you how much did theypay you to sell out the Privacy causeand out of curiosity was it worth thecost of your soulI'm glad you've been even keeping upwith the drama it's been it's been aninteresting transition I have kind ofbeared my soul in a blog post and I'vegotten a lot of positive feedback a lotof negative feedback and a lot of peoplefeeling like a betrayed Monero betrayedprivacy with this jump butyeah it's been interesting it's been along journey kind of traveling throughBitcoin to Monero spending to four yearsworking on Monero with most of my freetime and obviously than jumping in andjoining foundation in October to work onon bitcoin mostly full-time it's beenpretty crazy but uh I do still have mysoul contrary to popular belief and I dostill care about privacy contrary topopular belief so okay uh all right so Ihave a new nickname for you we can callyou uh Seth for surveillance coins ormaybe just for short just for for uhshortness sake Seth for surveillance soum all right let's uh let's get into itand so you know both of these gentlemenare great Educators on the topic of ofBitcoin and and privacy generallythey're both very active on Twitter uh qa has a website bitcoiner.guide whichhas been a fantastic resource for a lotof people just getting into self-custodyBitcoin and doing it through a non-kycAKA a private manner uh q a has been avaluable teacher for me in learningBitcoin Seth has a website Seth forprivacy.com he also has a podcast theopt out podcast he's talking about thisstuff as well and I'll just say ifyou're not on Twitter or telegram youare missing out on a huge conversationabout uh Bitcoin and some of theseprivacy topics so you definitely need tobe part of that if you want to be at TheCutting Edge just watching videos on youYouTube and just checking out websitesis not going to necessarily get you tothe uh the bleeding edge of a lot ofthis stuffum and so I wanted to start uh Seth ohby the way uh said Thank you a welcomewelcome to the show um how are you guysdoingdo pretty well thank you I was uhchuckling at the pre-preparedsurveillance joke I think that's gotsome like so I'm gonna keep that runninginternally when we go back to work ohyeah that one's gonna be gonna be hardto get rid of so I'm looking forward tothat let's start on a somber note hereand the reason why I want to I think I'mgoing to release release this one prettyquickly is we are at the precipice ofseemingly uh potential financial crisisthere have been a number of bankbailouts recently we we know that thiscan have a domino effect anybody who isin listening to this show and involvedin in our sphere understands has a redpilled view of Economics they understandthat we have built uh built oureconomies on uh House of Cardsessentially and there's a lot that couldhappen that could quickly unravel it weknow that this could be could be thestart of chaos potentially maybe they'llfind a way to Kick the Can down the roadfor longer who knows what will happenwe're gonna Focus mostly on bitcoinprivacy in in this episode but I do wantto start with a very practical questionbecauseself-custody Bitcoinum is potentially one of the solutionsfor this kind of Crisis that's that'skind of what it's been built up to beand so uh first of all if you don't knowwhat self-custody Bitcoin is uh go backand watch some of my other shows checkout some of the resources if you don'thave it you need to get that first ofall you can check my Bitcoin course inthe description so Seth and Q a let'ssay there is a crisis the banks shutdown people are looking for alternativesto keep paying for things and acceptingpayments assuming that people startusing Bitcoin more for day-to-day thingshow can how can people go about doingthat you guys already have a head starton some of that I wonder if you couldexplain some of the tools you alreadyuse to make Bitcoin part of youreveryday everyday life that we couldpotentially fall back on if things uhbecame magnified and we did need to usesomething like Bitcoin yeah I can I canjump in there uh I think for me whenwhen I kind of look at the financialmess over the last few days uh and lookat what Bitcoin was built to be and whatit can beum it really it has brought a uniquepeace of mind uh that I think wewouldn't have before Bitcoin and I thinklike if we look back at the 2008 crisisthere there weren't Alternatives thereweren't other options uh and Bitcoin iscreated as a direct response to that Imean Satoshi even inscribed in the TheGenesis block a headline about a bankbailout so this was this type of thingwas top of mind for him when he createdthisum but I love that you pointed out thatself-custody Bitcoin is the answerum because I think some people thinkthat just treating Bitcoin like a stockand buying some having it on an exchangeand just trusting that price increasewill protect them from Financial crisesuh is is good enough they're reallymissing the point and missing thebenefit of what Bitcoin can be soactually actually buying that Bitcoinwithdrawing it having it in your ownwallet and understanding how to use itis uh is is really important and thatreally is the the first step to togaining any Financial sovereignty fromBitcoinum but once you have your Bitcoin Ithink the the two most valuable toolsfor me have been uh and I mean I don'twant to Shell our own product but I Ijoined foundation and I I like ourHardware wallet because it's it'sactually very accessible and very usefulbut has been a good easy to use Hardwarewallet which essentially just helps youto be able to secure your Bitcoin anduse your Bitcoin in a way that that issecure without introducing too much of ahurdle so passport is that's a hardwarewallet that I use all the time it makesit really easy to actually spend I'm notone of the people who just kind of buysBitcoin and hoddles for the uh the oldMeme and the Bitcoin Community but I'mactually very focused on spendingBitcoin using it as often as humanlypossibleum constantly buying things with itselling things for it um trying to tobuild up a circular economy around it sohaving a tool that lets me keep myBitcoin secure but still be able tospend it easily is importantum and then the other main tool that Iuse is a desktop wallet called Sparrowwallet uh and it's it's just a man it'sa fantastic wallet that's been developedby a single guy who just has a passionfor building something where there wasreally a gap in the the Bitcoinecosystem beforeum and he's built a fantastic walletthat makes it very easy to use Bitcoinit has very good privacy defaults builtin it haseasy support for all the major Hardwarewallets out there it's easy to usewithout a hardware wallet if you don'tdon't want to buy harder wall or don'tuse oneum it has direct integration with thesamurai wallet set of privacy toolsthings like Whirlpool which provideprivacy andum lots of other like spending tools mayactually go to spend Bitcoin it'lldefault try to to do it in a way that'smore privacy preserving it's just verywell built very intuitiveum it's it's built to both serve thebeginner user and someone who's more ofa power users you you dig in and youstart to learn some more of the tools soI think those are probably my my go-to'sI don't know how much we want to getinto it but I've also been digging intothe lightning Network a lot more overthe past year or so um so that's been abeen a big go-to for me as well butthings can get a lot more complex whenyou talk about actually running alightning node managing liquidity andall that so maybe we can maybe we leavethat off yeah we might get intolightning a little bit later q a um sopeople are doing what you say what I saythey they have their self-custodyBitcoin in their Sparrow wallet let'ssayum what are some of the ways that you'veused Bitcoin to buy just kind ofday-to-day things any any websites anyany resources any suggestionsyeah so the the first and very broadsuggestion uh and I said this uh on onour podcast yesterday evening um is thatjust make sure that you are spendingBitcoin at any opportunity that you haveso I think as as Bitcoin is of action Iknow that's one of the Seth's uhtaglines which I'm very fond of is thatwe should feel a certain obligation toyou know if we're if we're shopping at amerchant and they're offering to spendBitcoin as painful as that can be if yousee it as predominant predominantly asavings vehicle then you should take theopportunity to spend that Bitcoin atthat employer sorry at that um at thatMerchant to start to drive this circulareconomyum because ultimately you know there's abit of a chicken and an egg problem herethat nobody wants to spend their SATsfor you know and I would tend to agreeyou know that's probably for good reasonum if you look at past performance of ofhow the asset is performedum well that's only one aspect of of youknow of Bitcoin as using that as asavings vehicle and the other oneum you know being sent ship resistantpeer-to-peer digital cache only reallycomes true if we take self-custody whichShasta is covered off and if weum start to have this digital cacheflowing around between merchants andthen you know if Merchants start tomerch and start toum you know build up a a store ofBitcoin and then try and uh they'll takethe next step and try and get theirsuppliers toum to take Bitcoin first so they canreplenish their stock so rather than youknow it just being me spending Bitcoinat this supplier and them then sellingit back onto an exchange and then wejust go back the Bitcoin just goes fromone person to an exchange and back againand acts very much like a stock againlike Seth said earlierumif we can start to to use this this toolat Merchants that are going toappreciate the asset for what it is andhopefully utilize it in a similar waythen we can start to drive the circulareconomy soum some of the common things that I'lluse uh Bitcoin for will be paying for mymorvad VPNum subscriptionum that's not something I'd want to dowith it with a credit card even though Ihave the option toum mainly from a privacy perspectivebecause you know I don't want uh thepeople at movad to know you know theyjust see an account number and they getpaid by some uh Whirlpool SATs uhwhereas if I was to pay with my creditcard uh immediately my account is taggedto my real world identity which is youknow it's not great for a VPN providersoum that's a great one uh more recentlyum and a little bit more in a of aexperimental phaseum been testing out more of the likelynetwork with zaps on on a new protocolcalled nosta which I'm sure we'llprobably get into later it seems to beHot Topic at the moment but yeahgenerally just just spending wherever Icanum there's a there's a really great umproject that I want to share calledbtcmap.org which is essentially uh justa world map with loads of different tagsof merchants be they online or in personwhere you can just hop on look at yourlocal area and see what type ofmerchants there are that umthat take Bitcoin so that you can startto spend those stats and drive thatcircular economy uh that's a projectthat's popped up in the last six monthsor so and anybody has the ability to goon there and tag different Merchants youknow if they go in and they Orange Peelsomebody that sells beer uh in a localpubum as soon as they've got set up you cango on you can hop onto b2c map it'lltake you two minutes and you can addthat Pub onto the map so that otherpeople in your area can see that and gooh cool I'm going to go to that Pubthere because they take Bitcoin insteadof uh the one down the road that justonly takes credit cards so really greatproject and you know urge everybody toto go and check that out and outside ofthat the the other way that I wouldspend Bitcoin is is kind of a moreindirect wayum which would be through the use ofgift cards at at companies like bitrefill uh or the Bitcoin company uhwhere essentially they buy in big uhthey buy in gift cards from hundreds andhundreds of different retailers anywherefrom you know Adidas or Nike toStarbucks or McDonald'sum you name it if you want to buysomething you'll be able to find a giftcard on there soif you're somebody that's living on aBitcoin standard and earning in Bitcointhen you're gonna have to offload someof that somehow and to pay your bills tobuy to put food on the table Etc andwhilst you can do that via the variousPHP methods like base Cobble huddle Etcum another easy way you know especiallyif it's a you know well-known store uhwait let's say Walmart where you justneed to go and spend 100 on your weeklyfood shopum buying a gift card is a really greatway to do that you can get the gift cardinstantly and send over your SATs andthen just walk into the store and payfor your weekly shop so that's a reallysort of a roundabout way to spendBitcoin indirectly at you know almostany retailer in the world very goodoptions very good resources there's allkinds of of websites and resourcespeople talking about how to use Bitcoinday to day there's one video that comesto my mind for me there's a there's agreat uhcontent creator BTC sessions and he hasa video called I live on bitcoin whichis a couple years old at this point butthat one was uh pretty eye-opening justhow much you can actually do withBitcoin okay so I wanted to especiallysince the last time that the the threeof us talked uh was about you know ayear ago and there have been some newdevelopments Etc especially when itcomes to uh private uh self-custodialBitcoin and I think that maybe the bestway to get a sense of maybe where thingsare right now is just to ask each of youwhat is your current bitcoin setup andwhat I mean by that is your your desktopwallet your phone wallet what nodes ornode are you running and what's yourmain method to acquire non-kyc Bitcointhese days Seth you want to go firstyeah I can jump inum somy setup right now I mean I'm a hugeself-hosting uh nerd I'd love to be ableto to host everything that I can to runevery piece of the the stack if I canand thankfully that's a shared ideologywith a lot of the the Bitcoin space soit's pretty pretty straightforward I'mtrying to help where I can make it morestraightforward but it's prettystraightforward to run a lot of thesetools yourself so desktop wallet Imentioned already is is Sparrow walletuh it's just it's without a doubt myfavorite Bitcoin wallet across the boardprobablyum it just works incredibly well it'svery easy to connect to your own node tobe sure that you're not you're notleaking information about your usedaddresses about your balance about yourtransactions to a third party uh if youdo need to use a node that you don't ownit's very easy to use tour with ittowards integrated and uh default soit's a really really powerful tool itsimplifies things there's really gooddocs there's lots of good guides thatwalk you through how to use it uh it'sdefinitely highly recommended for meum on the mobile side I've kind of beenbouncing around mobile Bitcoin walletsum I know I mentioned a little bitearlier that I've been focusing more onthe lightning Network so where possibleI've actually been using lightning whenI'm on mobile and not on chainum mostly just to kind of force myselfto to deal with issues of lightning tolearn more about it to learn more of theins and outs so on mobile I've mostlybeen using a wallet called Zeus and it'sa fantastic open source Wallet app theunique thing about it is that it is kindof different than most wallet apps inthat you're actually just controllingyour lightning node when you use it soit's basically like a controller foryour node rather than a a full wallet onyour phone but it acts similarly to awallet it's just connected back to yourown node so that one works really wellthe other one I can recommend forlightning if you're not using zoos or ifyou're not running your own node is onecalled Phoenixum but that's that's I think my main oneon mobileum yeah yeah so definitely runningrunning my own note of of lots ofdifferent kinds so running my ownBitcoin core node which kind ofunderlies everything else that I run andthen on top of that I'm running afulcrum server which it's a it's adifferent approach to what people may befamiliar with is electrum but it's thesame protocol it's just created bysomeone else done in a different waythat actually makes it really reallyperformant especially for likeindividual users rather than likeEnterprise usageum so I'm running fulcrum on top of myBitcoin core node and that's what all ofmy Bitcoin wallets connect back toum that's what like uh Sphero walletwill connect to that's what if I'm usinglike if I'm using another on-chainwallet on mobile maybe like stack walletor our wallet Envoy that'll connect backto my fulcrum node again because the thenode piece of privacy in Bitcoin is veryvery important and often understated sousing your own node provides a strongmeasure of privacy that's that's reallyreally important so I'm running fulcrumthere that's how most wallets willactually connect back and use my nodeand then on top of thatI guess it's not really a node butanother important piece of software forme is actually running your own blockExplorer so that when you need to lookup a transaction or check an address orsomething like that you're not having togo to some third-party website that youmay or may not trustum so I run an instance of of theblockchain Explorer called mimpool.spaceobviously I run it locally so that's notthe URL but it's the same Explorer withall of the same great features the sameUI but I just run that locally all thisis run in Docker we can dive in a littlebit more to the technical side if youwant but that's kind of kind of my coresetup one other one that I'm running isfor the lightning side I'm running corelightning as my my lightning Daemon andthat just connects back to bitcoin corefor the actual like Bitcoin networkcommunication and what is the primaryway if you're willing to say that youaccumulate non-kyc Bitcoin these daysyeah so the primary one for me I bouncedaround a lot because I kind of like toto try them all outum more and more I've shifted to justhaving people that I know well that needto offload Bitcoin and just kind offorming a more peer-to-peer directeconomy there it's not even goingthrough the sites but when I am usingthose normally it's going to besomething like bisque which I've usedquite a bit in the pastum another one that is a is a favoriteof mineum both because of how it works andbecause they're they're big Monero fansand have supported them in our communityfor a long time is the one called Agoradesk which is it's very similar to oneslike huddle huddle or to the old uhlocal Bitcoins which is is now dead mayit rest in peaceum but it's a really good centralizedsite that just helps you to be able tofind people to trade directly withhandle arbitration that sort of thingthose are usually my go-to's I knowthere's a lot of new ones that have beenpopping up like Peach Bitcoin and thenlocal SATs is another one that justpopped up but I haven't used either ofthose yet so usually for me it's it'sbisque it's Agora desk or it's uh justpeople that I already have connectionswith relationships with and and uh justbuy and sell Bitcoin directly that wayexcellent and by the way listeners checkout my episode 37 running a Bitcoin fullnode for privacy that's a goodexplanation of full nodes and thePrivacy importance of them what aboutyou q a yeah so unfortunately Seth and Iare two chips off the very same block sopretty much an identical setup to Sethum things I can addum I run a couple of nodes just becauseI like to Tinker and I do the occasionaluh support call for people who like toset up and and Tinker with differentnodes so I kind of have a couple ofthose bubbling away in the backgroundand I've got a custom built oneum on a sort of like an Intel Nook typedevice a little small desktop PC thatjust runs Bitcoin core and Fulcrumserver again same as Seth and justrunning on slightly different hardwareand also run a raspy Blitzum which is another great open sourceproject that kind of offers a simplesetup with lots of differentapplications packaged in mortgagetowards around the lightning Network andbut that's another one that I in thebackgroundand for my on-chain mobile wallet theonly one that Seth didn't mention that Iuse regularly is Samurai walletum very long-standing wallet uh gearedtowards you know the kind of they holdthe flag for Bitcoin privacy and havedone for quite a few years nowum super super feature packed um Androidonly uh Mobile Wallet that comes builtin with its own coin join implementationas well so you can actually get the thebenefits of um on-chain privacy withoutuh running your own nodeum I will caveat that with saying thatyou know the most private way to do sois is with your own node so if you havethe means and the ability to to do thatfirst that would be fantastic but thegreat thing about Samurai wallet is thatyou can gain some good levels of onechain privacy without actually having toconnect back to your own node so andbeen a big fan of their work andcontinue to support them in any way thatI can but other than that yeah verysimilar setup to Seth uh have somelightning stuff to Tinker around withum I've got the my Intel nuc which issort of the closest thing to a propercomputer that can cope with some uh youknow with lots of queries whereas theraspberry pies uh a little bit more forthe for the tinkering types of things soum yeah but otherwise very very similarto setup to Sethum in terms of my no kyc stuffum been a long-term user of huddlehuddle more of a European uh Centricum Market on hobble huddle I think theymay actuallyum just want toI think they do sorry block um AmericanIPS unfortunately so um it does seem tobe more of a european-centric one um butyeah it works again it's a centralizedwebsite type thing with a built-inescrow system that kind of brings buyersand sellers together in a private wayand it ensures that uh that that thebuyer and the seller both acts in goodfaith so that you know if you are theseller you're not going to have yourBitcoin stolen and if you're the buyerthen you're you're not going to haveyour Fiat stolen depending onum which one of the the various you knowthere's hundreds of different methodsthat you can choose to to take on atrade there so big fan of their work umand more recently keeping my eye onagain uh Seth mentioned Peachwhich is uh one of the newer apps Ibelieve there's a company behind thatthat are based in Switzerland so theykind of uh fly under the the Thousand uhSwiss Francs rule um where they don'tneed to to ask for ID but it is stillpeer-to-peer I believeum and there's also interestingly alightning Network native peer-to-peermarket now called robo-sats which hasbeen come on it's just come on in Leapsand Bounds in the last uh it's probablybeen out for less than 12 months andthey have a mobile application and theyalso have a tour onion website where youcan goum and meet other buyers and sellers andagain it works on an escrow system butcrucially this time it's the escrowsystem is all Native to the lightningNetwork so um yeah use that a couple oftimes and had really great greatexperienceum so it is a bit of a newer one so youknow I would generally speaking use itfor smaller amounts just for whilethey're sort of building up thatreputationum but yeah great experience and we'llbe watching what they come up with inthe next couple of years because I knowthere's a pretty cool team behind thatone right we'll talk more about thepeer-to-peer websites that these twomentioned in a moment Seth you wanted tosay something yeah I just wanted to harpon the kind of the Raspberry Pi pointnow this is one thing where I feel likethe recommendation for a long time inbig parts of the Bitcoin Community hasjust been to to get a Raspberry Pi anduse that for all of your self-hostingfor running your Bitcoin node runningyour lightning node running yourelectron server all of those thingsum but it's actually a pretty bad optionfor most people especially with howexpensive raspberry pies have havegotten over the past couple of yearsum and I I love that q a mentioned thathe's also running on the Intel Nook ornuc which that like that form factor isfantastic and one of the things thatI've found is you can go on sites likeeBay sites like uh Craigslist just allthe kind of the the used Hardware sitesand as companies buy small form factorcomputers for their employees and thenthey replace them every three or fouryears they'll get rid of their older oneyou can usually get them really reallycheap like I run everything that I Ihost at home off of a little LenovoUltra small small form factor uh PC thatbasically is like a very powerful laptopbut in a very small form factor uhdesktop platform and it provides areally really good way to host anythingman it's not just Bitcoin stuff butrelated to self-host anything becauseit's much more powerful than a RaspberryPi much more RAM it has proper uh SATAand pcie support so I can plug in annvme drive directly on it I can plug ina say to 2.5 inch SSD directly on it Idon't have to deal with all the powerconcerns because it comes with a properpower adapter it's it's just a muchbetter platform for actually runningservices that you want to be reliablethat you want to be performant andespecially as you integrate things likea lightning node or an electrum serverlike fulcrum that performance will makeyou actually enjoy the process a lotmore than hate the process because Iknow a lot of people have run pies theyrun into issues or they have performanceissues and it just makes it makes thehassle not worth it for them wherethere's this very cheap Hardwarealternative that's out there I meanthese Ultra small form factor PCS canusually be had for a couple hundreddollars at most often even less sothey're a really good one to to look forto use that and then thankfully all ofthese pre-built node Solutions like uhrazzpi Blitz they're all expanding tosupport x86 which is the normal computerarchitecture rather than just RaspberryPi's so even if you get this third-partyHardware that's not a pie you canusually install these pre-built nodesystems on there so you get all thatSimplicity you get the ease of use butyou're also on way more performant morereliable more long-lasting Hardwaresorry yeah I was just going to say Ithink the the original kind ofcollective recommendation for the thewhole Raspberry Pi pie piece for runningyour own Bitcoin node and first came tolight around you know 2017 2018 wherethe blockchain was significantly smalleruh the lightning network was in itsinfancy so nobody you know there was nohome sinkerers running that and wedidn't have the plethora of you knowadd-on apps that we do on most of thesecommon node packages so back then in aRaspberry Pi could you know it could itwould take a while to do the initialblock download but you'd get thereeventually and then once it was done itwas fairly stable now we're in acompletely different world where some ofthese no packages have got like 50different apps potentially that you caninstallyou've got lightning Network which isvery heavy in terms of read write andstatus updates and whatnot so there's alot of networking going on as wellum so it the the Raspberry Pi isunfortunately have quickly uh met theirdemise in trying to deal with all thissorts of stuff especially if you're evenjust a a mediocre user of a node soum it's been a pleasure to see the thekind of um small fact the real computerI guess they're using in inverted commasuh become a more of the de factoum setup process or you know the go-tooptionum one of our uh good friends katana'sgot a great uh great guide on hiswebsite if you just go to k3tam.comum and he talks about a very similarsetup to to what Seth and I have got ona proper x86 x86 system and I think theonly hole in in kind of what Seth wasjust just saying there was that the ifyou are going for a plug and play optionwhere it's kind of you know a load ofin-store scripts that gives you thisnice UIunfortunately I think the only uh onethat's available right now to to run onx86 that isn't kind of completelyexperimental is is umbrellaum but yes that's right I'm saying thatthere are lots of the other projects areheading that way because they've they'verealized the need to to be able toinstall this on some real Hardware butthe main note that my audience isfamiliar with if they're just listeningto my show is the uh Ronin Dojoum I noticed you guys didn't mentionthat am I missing something no I I justcompletely forgot yeah I do have a Tantorunning downstairs and I will say thatthat has been uh in terms of the uhsingle board computer uh installationsthat I've done uh that is the only solidone and that's probably why I forgot tomention it because I kind of it justsits in the corner of my office and itjust works I never ever have to Tinkerwith it and there's probably two reasonsfor that number one is built by afantastic team that really know whatthey're doing in the backgroundum and number two it doesn't have uhit's very Bare Bones and focused ondoing Bitcoin node and privacy toolsvery well so there's no lightningNetwork there's no add-on apps I thinkthere's only a couple of apps that youcan have in terms of an Explorer amentor viewerum and Whirlpool after that there'snothing so the actual stress thatthey're putting on this single boardcomputer is much less than somethingsome of these other approaches that kindof throw the kitchen sink at it soum yeah that's probably why I forgot itbecause it just sits there and works andunlocks super beautiful yeah and theyhave the two options they have thepre-built that you can buy which is onthe the hardware that they've kind ofcustomized there which is a it's builton at Rock Pro 64 which is a lot morepowerful form of a Raspberry Pi similarapproach but a lot more more powerfuland they have like a good SSD integratedthey've kind of taken that single boardcomputer concept to the max so thepre-built works really wellum and I I think they have plans to havex86 support which means being able toinstall the software on like a regularcomputer I don't think that's out yetthat's the reason why I didn't mentionit initially but those so kind of thetwo options right now you can install ityourself on your own Raspberry Pi RockPro 64. but once they do have x86 sportthat'll be a great option for gettinglike one of these old Enterprise Ultrasmall form factor computers andinstalling run in Dojo interesting goodpoint and check out episode 38s we Iinterviewed the co-founders of roninDojo that's a that's a great episodeSouthern q a how about this question soI haven't talked to you guys for about12 months what are some of the and whenwe did before let's say q a some of thePrivacy advice about Bitcoin was okayobviously self-custody be careful whereyou get your uh Bitcoin from to beginwith put it in a sparrow wallet uhconsider doing someum coin join whirlpooling on the sparrowwallets obviously be careful with yourcoin control we'll get to some of thatin a moment but that was kind of thethat was kind of the general advice forfor privacy stay on chain uh bereluctant to touch lightning what aresome of the developments in the lastlet's say 12 months or so in terms ofself-custody and particularly privateBitcoinyeah I think uh keeping with on chainfirst off the the biggest one for for mepersonally would be Sparrow walletintroducing their Whirlpoolimplementationum so Whirlpool is originally the thesamurai wallet um implementation of uhzero link coin join uh to access thatyou had to have an Android an Androidmobile phoneum and you could then connect that backto your node to kind of make things runa bit smoother if you wanted toum so if you were an iOS user or you hada laptop and you didn't have a phone sayyou couldn't access Whirlpool um the theprerequisite was this Android phonesince then uh Craig raw with his projectspiral wallet which is a desktopapplication that um most people are inthe space are huge fans of myselfincluded uh he's came onto the space andessentially just implemented that all onhis own uh the exact same client in thebackgroundum but opened it up to essentiallyanybody with a computer spiral walletcan be installed on all operate systemsWindows Mac Linux you name it it's thereum so he's essentially opened the doorto Whirlpool for anybody with a computersoum he's opened the opened the floodgatesa little bit and we've seen the the postmix liquidityum off the collective Whirlpoolum pull I guessum all of these users are combinedtogether now so everybody that's everbeen a Whirlpool user has benefited fromthis implementation which has beenabsolutely fantastic to see and andwe've seen what we call the the post-mixliquidity go through the roof um sothat's kind of the the pool of mixedutxos that are kind of sitting thereremixing and that's grown exponentiallyin the last couple of years and I thinkum I'm on record publicly and I'msticking by it to say that I think we'regoing to hit 10 000 uh BTC by the end ofthe year in that liquidity pool which ishuge for Bitcoin privacy becauseessentially anybody that's ever mixedthrough there and has their coins mixingum looks exactly the same so the thecrowd in which that you're hiding whileself-custing your Bitcoin is evergrowing which is absolutely fantastic sothat's beenum by Far and Away the the biggestum the biggest implementationalImprovement that we've seen for me foronshe for the past uh 12 months or soit's been absolutely huge okay Seth yeahum It's tricky because like I I loveBitcoin I love Monero I I'm hopefulabout Bitcoin privacy but it does feellike it it moves pretty slowly so I wastrying to think of what's happened inthe last year and I think a lot of ithas been like what q a mentioned ofsparrow wallet really getting built outand I think there is a lot more socialtraction behind Bitcoin privacy in thecommunity now I think more and morepeople are starting to wake up to thatneeding to be a focus Withinthe apps that we build on top of Bitcoinbecause when we look at Bitcoin like ifwe look at Bitcoin and Monero Monero isfocused veryvery uh almost solely on building outdigital cash that's private at theprotocol level whereas Bitcoin in myopinion unfortunately we won't probablyget any kind of protocol level privacyso what that means is that for privacytools to improve on bitcoin it meansthat basically app developers and thecommunities that use them need to pushfor building out for trying new thingsfor implementing new ideas in theapplications that we use the actual likemobile apps desktop apps nodeimplementations all of those things soit really does come down to the the applayer stuffum I think just not to harp on the samepoint as q a but focus on something elsethe kind of the big change for me hasbeen as I have Dove back into thelightning Networkum while there are absolutely privacyissues with lightning and specificallyon the receive side there is a lot ofconcerted effort to improve that privacythere's people doing really really goodresearch there's a new site called likelightingprivacity.com that walks througha lot of the the issues at a kind of aLayman level really good graphics veryeasy to digestum so I think that's been veryencouraging to see that there'sunderstanding there and that there areimplementation changes that will improveon those privacy issues things like bolt12 which will help on the receivingprivacy side there's things like routehiding which will mean that when youactually receive funds and lightning youcan hide where the the funds actuallyend up even from the the senderum there's things like Alias seids whichessentially mean that when you create achannel with someone else in lightningNetwork you're not revealing all of youron-chain Bitcoin utxos to that personand to the rest of the network so it'sgoing to be a really big Improvement aswell and as I've jumped back into thatand started using lightning a lot morefrom a usability perspective it's gottendrastically better since I last tried soI kind of have always had the the worstcase uh user experience when usinglightning and it feels like I'm a littlecursed sometimes there but I've actuallyhad a very good time using it and on thesend side the Privacy is very very solidso I've been using it more and morerunning my own node like I mentionedcore lightning is the specificimplementation that I'm using uhcontrolling that with Zeus on my phoneand it's been it's been a prettyfantastic user experience whilepreserving privacy and Q a brief imageand Noster as well before I think that'sbeen a good stress test and has opened alot of people's eyes to the need forbetter privacy and lightning as wellbecause the lightning network is sodirectly integrated into Noster as a wayto to tip people for the content thatthey create so that that's driving ittoo so a lot of it really for me is notnecessarily things that have beenimplemented that have changed things butrather a lot of research shifting tofocus on privacy a lot of developerresources shifting focus on privacy anda lot of kind of social consensus andCommunity Focus shifting to focus onprivacy which encourages me that thatthose things will come and that theywill come sooner rather than later whenthere's that social pressure behind itto incentivize uh devs to build thosethings so yeah one other thing that'sswitching back to one chain has poppedinto my head that's been a cooldevelopmentum that's kind of going to lay thegroundwork for more future development Iguessum there's a Anonymous uh Team I guesscalled straylight that have released arust-based Whirlpoolum implementation or client I guess andthat's completely open source so it'snot actually a Whirlpool implementationon its own it's kind of the buildingblocks for anybody using a rust-basedapplication to kind of plug into so thatthey can essentiallythrow Whirlpool into their applicationand just build a UI around itso what this is essentially going to dois ungate any applications that arebuilt around rust to have a turnkeysolution to implement whirlpool and I'mnot a developer hold my hands up but umI know rust is very popular at themoment and we've got we've got projectsin the Bitcoin space like BDK Bitcoindevelopment kit which again is is like awallet framework not necessarily awallet itself that's built in Rust andso I know that's quite a popular one andthere's a number of wallets being builtout around that framework again in Rustthat will also be able to leverage thisstraight light implementation ofWhirlpool as well soum this is another one that's kind ofum backing my 10 000 BTC uh Postmatesliquidity by the end of the year is thatwe now have a turnkey solution forWhirlpool for any wallet developerbecause it's completely open source tokind of grab and Implementum and just wrap a UI around it so it'snever been easier to to add coin jointinto your wallet so that's been a hugedevelopment and we we know personally ofa couple of projects that are going tobe leveraging thisum I know stack wallet which is across-platform application has beenpublicly on record to say that they'rethey're looking to implement that and uhyeah pleased to say that um Envoy ourmobile application is is built on BDK aswell so you can bet your bottom dollarthat will be looking to leverage that uhrust based Whirlpool implementation inuh hopefully by the end of the year Ithink that'll be uh an exciting one yeahso you guys are definitely at the uh TheCutting Edge of a lot of this stuff andyet some of the things that kind ofregular or kind of intermediate Bitcoinor privacy people land on is just kindof the the consensus things it's good toknow that that Sparrow is still kind ofstanding strong it has all the thingsthat we're looking for in a Bitcoinwallet um you know it's free and opensource software has active developmentsuh strong privacy stance tourfunctionality coin control uh elementsin it and the whirlpoolingum but we don't also don't like relyingon single things uh what would you sayis the best backup for Sparrow at thispoint that's a good one uh I guess thesecond most popular desktop applicationwould be Specter desktop and but itdoesn't come with the same privacyfeatures a sparrow and it requires youto use your own Bitcoin core back endand more recently they've added supportfor you to be able to use an electronserver which will make the the wholewallet far more performant than it everused to beum so yeah the the default I guessbackup would be would be Specter whereyou can you can have hot wallets you canhaveum you can back your Hardware walletswith that as well you can do multi-sigsingle Sig all of the basic features arein there including coin control andpreventing address for use all of thosegreat basic features are in there but ifyou're looking for something moreadvanced with uh you know let's sayspend algorithms like Stonewall or orWhirlpool features like coin joinum then sparrows you know in terms ofdesktop is is kind of the only option atthe moment so which is probably why he'sgaining so much uh usage let's let'sstep back for a moment for a lot ofpeople when they're interested inprivate Bitcoin it's not necessarily allof the The Cutting Edge stuff they'rejust trying to acquire Bitcoin in anon-kyc manner I wanted to get yourthoughts on that for a moment so itseems to me that the the best method toacquire non-kyc is the method that youguys mentioned earlier on which ispeer-to-peer and you can check out awebsite like kyc not DOT me or kyc notme and see various options for p2bservices and basically what happens isyou go to the website or in the case ofthe top one bisque you're actuallydownloading something that that isdecentralized and it's very programmingum and you find somebody else in theworld who is selling a Bitcoin and thenyou simply engage in a privatetransactionum with them and the application willhave a kind of kind of multi-sig walletwhere once once where that person theseller puts their Bitcoin into thewallet and once you have paid them andthey confirm that then the Bitcoin isreleased to you and you can do whateveryou want with that Bitcoin so it's ait's it's fairly easy in the sense thatyou're using Legacy finance a lot oftimes right you're using either Applepay or Zell or PayPal or revolut to paythis person uh but it it is well let meask you this so there seems to me inthat process to be a trail in that ofcourse you have the Legacy Financetransaction with somebody else and thewebsitethat you've used has a record uhpotentially of the details of thistransaction q a what am I missing in inthat yeah so uh depending on the servicethat you use so I use huddle holders inthe gamble it's one of my favoritesum the huddle huddle itself as the kindof uh arbitrator of the of thePittsburgh trade and never actually seesyour bank in detail so let's say I'mgoing to use revolut and I'm going tobuy from you Gabriel as a sellerum I'll initiate the trade that you'vekind of uh you've put up your sell offerI'll go on and say yep I'm going to takethat trade I like the the numbersum you'll get a notification uh you'llthen which will require you to deposityour Bitcoin uh into this multi-sigescrow wallet as soon as that'sconfirmed on the Bitcoin blockchainwhich you can go and verify yourself andyou will then uh send let's say yourum payment information across to me nowthat again depends on the the paymentinformation so it could be just the usera REV tag in in revolute which would belike it could be anything you want itcould be you know at John goltz7 orsomething like thatum doesn't necessarily have to be yournamethat'll come through to me and then I'llsee that and go off on my revolute appand pay you the required amount of Fiatand then just confirm that I've donethatum huddlehold doesn't learn anythingabout me doesn't know my revoluteaccount or anything at all as the buyerand so I go on confirm that I've sentthat you'll see that come through toyour app and and confirm that and sayyep it's done and release the Bitcoin tome so as a buyerum in the whole case and I know most ofthem are very very similar and operatethe same way they don't see anything interms of my banking Trailum the only person that sees that is youreceiving the transaction from me soum whilst you know using these bankingservices is not the most 100 private wayto do that because you're still sharinga small amount of information with asingle person which would be you in thisinstance as a seller when you comparethat to go into a centralized exchangethat asks you to take a selfieum they sometimes they want to do videoor voice recordings of you you have tosend your driving license passport allof that that's get that gets kept onrecord for essentially all of eternityfor governments to to kind of ask to seeat any point in the future there's aquite a stark difference between thatamount of information versus uh Gabrielseeing my revolute account numberum so that's where the kind ofdifference is I mean depending on howfar you want to take it you know if ifsharing your online banking informationwith one other person is still too muchinformation then these services do offermore private options that come with alittle bit more risk so and two examplesof that would be US postal money orderswhich again are obviously very U.SCentricum or you can still do cash in the mailtradesum through all of these uh differentum trading platforms now obviously theycome with different trade-offs andobviously if you're going to be sendingcash in the mail you ain't going to getthis trade done in in 30 minutes likeyou would with a a typical you knowusing revolute as an example so there'strade-offs depending on what you wantyou know do you want a speedy trade andsharing information with one person uhare you not bothered and you're justgoing to go to a centralized exchangeand you know get your SATs reallyquickly but have to give your life storyto get that and for that to be on recordin perpetuity or are you willing to waita week and you can send cash in the mailit's you know you can kind of chooseyour path and depending on thetrade-offs that you're willing to makeright and just just a couple of pointsbased on what q a was saying he has agood explanation here so when you'reselecting one of these peer-to-peerexchanges make sure obviously thatyou're going in using Tor make sure thatyou're going in using a burner email ifyou do have to sign up for it make surethat is a service that has an escrow sothat if you did want to send cash youhave some kind of protection that thisperson is not just going to pretend thatthey never received your stuff rightthere the Bitcoin is put into an escrowaccount by that seller from thebeginning so there's a little bit ofprotection there make sure that theperson you're selling to is not askingfor ID of any kind or is not asking foranything exceptto give you right to give you theirlet's say revolute information and thenyou pay them outside of that website soyou're not interacting with with them atall except to say here's how much I wantand I've paid it like that's the onlything that you're saying to this personif you encounter anything on thesepeer-to-peer exchanges that does notinvolve that process you back away likeyou you back away because that is that'snot private at that point I wonder Sethif your experience using peer-to-peerexchanges do you have any concerns aboutsome of the trail maybe using whateveryou're using apple pays LEtc do you have any concerns about someof the Privacy consequences of of thatwhole processyeah when when I look at it I kind ofbreak it down into two categories anddepending on you the listener and whatyour preferences are you may want to goone way or the other I think the themost important thing with getting off ofa centralized exchange that requires IDis that you're you're regaining privacyand some level of anonymityum but really you were getting privacyand that there is no Central entity thatis storing your ID and connecting thatID directly to multiple Bank transfersmultiple Bitcoin transactions towithdrawal addresses to the things youeven do after you withdraw there's a aline that you sever between your exactidentity and a direct link to your usageof Bitcoin and your ownership of Bitcoinso shifting from that to any of thesepeer-to-peer methods is always going tobe a massive win from the Privacyperspective and potentially fromanonymity but I think there's then kindof a Choose Your Own Adventure like q asaid where you can either choose to gothe the simplerrelatively private way which is usingthings like cash app like revolute likeACH transfers in some sense in someplaces uh where yes there is a record ofa transaction that happened between twopeople but there's no direct tie on thebank side between that and your usage ofit to actually buy Bitcoin there's nodirect tie on the The Exchange that youuse uh that that ties a specific Bitcointransaction to a specific bankingtransaction on some of them if they cansee chat maybe they can see like youryour revolute tag like q a said and thatyou did a Bitcoin transaction but theydon't know the loot details you'rebreaking a lot of those direct ties soagain it makes it so that there's not aa chance for Mass surveillance it makesit so there's not a chance for a hack tooccur where your your identity is stolenbut protects you a lot there but if youwant to go a step further like q a saidand you want true anonymity when you'rebuying a big coin when you're avoidingkyc you do need to doI mean really you have to do cash insome way or in the US as you mentioneduh USPS money orders because those onlyways where you can actually make thattransfer in a way that doesn't revealwho you are to even the otherparticipant in the tradeum it absolutely doesn't reveal anyinformation about who you are to the thethird party service that you're using sothat's where it gets trickier andobviously there's going to be more of abarrier to entry of doing that I mean Ipersonally love face-to-face cash Ithink it's a fantastic option and inmany places especially if you're near abigger city you can do face-to-face cashpretty readilyum but if that's not an option yeah it'sjust understanding that you're choosingbetween having a strong privacy baseeven if you're using something like cashapp or something like that becausethere's no direct ties between that andBitcoin or going the full Anonymousroute which makes sense and doing itwith face-to-face cash cash my mailmoney ordersrightum and so before you engage in P2P uhlisten to some of our previous episodesuh you can check out some of Q A's workas well on his website bitcoiner.guidenow let's say that we do acquire ourBitcoin and from a P2P website we haveit we send it to our um our Sparrowwallet and at that point we um are justsitting on a chunk of Bitcoin now thisis where people are they're using theirspare wallet they need to getcomfortable understanding the thewhirlpooling withinum within the sparrow wallets and let mejust kind of ask this question what doeswhirlpoolingin the sparrow wallet give us as privacySeekers yeah so in the scenario whereyou've just bought from a Pittsburghmarket and you've got I don't say acouple of million stats that you'vebought and only one person essentiallyon the planet knows that you've boughtthat which is that your trade partner uhif you were to then send that throughthe whirlpool serviceum what that would essentially mean isthat your trading partner uh who knowsthe your Bitcoin address because theysent you the Bitcoin and you would breakthose uh ties or what we call in the inthe business deterministic links suchthat the your trading partner would notbe able to follow where your Bitcoin hasgone after the the whirlpool mix iscompletedum which is obviously great for from aprivacy perspective because if the ifyour trade partner does turn out to besomebody who likes to sell yourinformation to somebody who's far moreinterested in it like a three-letteragencyum when that information is passed onthen they also have come up against thesame difficulties in terms of trackingthat Bitcoin on chain so you can thinkof it as giving your Bitcoin kind oflike a fresh start or a fresh historysuch that pretty much nobodyum even sophisticated actors are unableto to trace your Bitcoin once it's beenthrough the whirlpool service so yeahthe best analogy is is just a freshstart such that you are then free to goand spend as you like as to anydifferent service and your Bitcoin looksidentical to anybody else that's in thisWhirlpool post-mix liquidity poolI just want to kind of ruminate on on alittle bit more about the spare wallbecause I know a lot of people are veryinterested in in some of the mechanicsof that because this is kind of the thebread and butter uh private Bitcoinright now so when you when you when youstart when you take your your chunk ofBitcoin that you've received fromwherever and you decide you're going toWhirlpool it which is a way of combiningit with other Bitcoin without actuallygiving away your custody of itthroughout the processum and you want to do that as many timesas as you can before you start using itare there benefits uh well actually letme ask this once let's say we choose apool and you can choose different poolsyou can spit them out into 100000um sat chunks or 1 million uh fivemillion and and 50 million so you canget different chunks of Bitcoin what wecall utxos now at that point when let'ssay we have 10 10 utxos that are spitout at the end of the whirlpoolingprocess is it okayto combine those utxos if we need to uhto purchase something that requires morethan more than we have with just oneutxo yes it is I mean a lot of peopleget scared about combining gtxos becauseit it shows what we call commonownershipum which basically you know if ifthere's a transaction being constructedand there's more than one input beingusedum then it's by default because of howBitcoin works it kind of gives away thatall of those inputs in that transactionbelong to the same person the beautifulthing about uh spiral wallet and alsoSamurai wallet is that they have uhcomplex spend algorithms that will allowyou to doum a combination of inputs to say let'ssay in your example you've got 10 100000 sat utxos I need to buy somethingthat's 400 000 SATs the only option youhave is to combine at least four ofthose to make up enough value to to makethat purchasewith these complex spending algorithmsthe wallet will add additional inputsand create multiple additional outputsas well such that your transaction lookslike a coin join and So for anybodywho's watching your utxos and kind ofseeing that you're making thistransaction rather than them just seeingyou combining those four utxos into oneaddress on the output side which lookslike you're you know a normal spendum this Stonewall transaction the spendalgorithm will have multiple outputssuch that it's not clear to anybody thatlooks Unchained to say well hang on aminute we've got let's say five oninputs on the inside on the input sideand then we've got four on the outsideon the output side sorry soum what the hell is going on here is itis it one person paying four differentpeople is it five people paying threedifferent people you know the number ofcombinations grow significantly when youuse these types of spend algorithms andand that's what just all geared towardsbeing able to add a lot of ambiguitysuch that anybody that looking on chainat this transaction can't say with anydegree of certainty where the floods offunds have flowed from and two and sothese uh are great tools and thebeautiful thing is that they're all onby defaultum within Sparrow uh all you need to dois click on privacy when you're creatinga spend and it will do it all for youum so Fantastic Toolsum and there's also collaborativeoptions as well that where if you'remore of an advanced user and you knowlet's say another Spiral wallet user youcan create a similar looking spend toum to create again more obfuscation andmore confusion as to the the true flowof funds in any given transaction butthe only difference between the way I'vejust explained it and the collaborativeversion is that rather than it being allof my utxos that make up thistransaction it will be some of mine andsome of yours Gabriel and so again justadds uh more obfuscation and more sortof potential outcomes as to what'sactually happened and The crucial thingand the really cool thing is that thesetwo different options the collaborativeone and the non-collabative one lookabsolutely identical and change soyour if even if you know the roughfootprint of what looks like it could bea still more spend it could actually betwo people or it could be oneum or it could be somebody doing amanual thing and it could be fivedifferent people ultimately you can'tsay with any any great deal of certaintywhich is the whole point of thesetransactions one more specific questionhere and just to lay it out for thepeople listening if you're new to thisso you acquire your Bitcoin in a non-kycmanner ideally you're sending it to yourSparrow wallet you're engaging theirWhirlpool functionalityum to break the deterministic links ofof that Bitcoin in the end you have youhave various chunks of Bitcoin what wecall utxosum unspent transaction outputs so youhave these unspent transaction outputsat the end and even when you go to spendthem within the sparrow wallet now atthe bottom left there will be a anoption called the Privacy option andwhen you select that you're using whatis called the The Stonewall featurewhich creates more obfuscation of thattransaction even when you do it sothere's all kinds of cool featureswithin the sparrow wallets if people arenot seeing the Privacy option at thebottom left q aum what what are the conditions thatneed to be in place for that privacyoption to be in place at the bottom leftbecause I know some people have itgrayed out yeah so very roughly speakingum you need to be spending rough roughlyjust under half of the total availablebalance of your postmix wallet and soyou need to be there needs to be somesort of spare inputs available to beused in this transaction again toprovide that obfuscation and so it'sit's yeah just under half or less of theamount total balance and and generallyspeaking the more utxos that you haveavailable the more likely Sparrow orSamurai will be able to conduct thistype of spend algorithm so if you'vejust got say two mixed outputs andyou're trying to spend half of thebalance it's not going to be able to doit because it doesn't have enough uhdifferent inputs to choose from but ifyou've got say 10 or 15 then you'll beable to do this type of spend easily andso yeah that'll be one of the reasonsthe main reasons why is there's just notenough utxos or you're just spending toomuch as a percentage of your balancewhat I've tried to do uh with with q aand set in the last 10 minutes or so isjust to show you some of the kind of thebasic way to get some decently privateBitcoin Seth I know that this issomething that you've been focusing onwhich is how to get people who are justnew to bitcoin using it with decentprivacy uh practices uh just kind offrom from the jump using something likeMonero you don't have to worry about anyof this stuff with Bitcoin you do haveto jump through some of these hurdles ifyou were explaining to somebody who justwants to get into Bitcoin and use itwith kind of the the best bang for yourbuck privacy what do you tend torecommend these things I think the thebiggest one when I approach it is thatavoidance of kyc I mean we've we'veharped on that so we'll go to detailsbut that that is the biggest one becauseif you bring break the link betweenidentity and your on-chain activity youalready have a huge step up you alreadyprotect yourself against trivial Masssurveillance you already protectyourself against a lot of the thesimpler ways that you can be surveilledin Bitcoin so that that's the mostimportant so that is like that's almostI mean I would say that is essential tousing Bitcoinum so that would be the the first onefor me is not using a centralizedexchange but avoiding kyc um obviouslywe've gone into details there the thenext one isit's choosing between right now eitherSamurai wallet or Sparrow wallet if youhave an Android phone I think Samuraiwallet is is reasonably approachable andand usableum some parts of the user experience aregreat some parts are a little bit moreconfusing something that they've beendoing a lot of work on on improvingrecentlyum but I do think that Sparrow wallet isis easier and more straightforward andreally just the the use of it on acomputer that's always on our computerthat's on most of the time simplifiesthe process a lot because one of theproblems with doing things likewhirlpool and mobile is that your phonehas to be on that whole time to be ableto join those mixing rounds it has to beable to to do that constantly where whenyou're on a desktop it's a lot simplerto Just Launch Sparrow set it up choosewhat you want to do with mixingminimize the tab minimize the window andjust go about your day come back inwhatever amount of time check what'sgoing on clear status on everything it'sa lot more straightforward to use thereso that is generally my next step I meanthis is one of the things that I that Istruggle with with Bitcoin is it's veryhard to just give someone a here threesteps that are super simple and you'llhave great privacy on bitcoin because itis relatively complex that's one of thereasons why I'm trying to focus onbitcoin again is because I want to beable to to help us get closer to thatmodel of hey you've bought your Bitcointhe right way you've used one of thesepeer-to-peer exchanges you avoid kyc nowjust download this one mobile app thiswill help you to do Whirlpool it'll helpyou to do it in a way that's automatedthat takes away the majority of the thepain points that takes away a lot of thekind of decision paralysis that canhappen and all these things itsimplifies the lingo where it willmanage the majority of the privacy andyou just need to give it the basics ofwhat you want out of it and thenlet it do the hard work for the user andthen the user just be able to say likeokay I want privacy check that boxwhile it handles the hard things andthen you're just given the the actualspending tools the actual receive toolsthe the simple functionality that mostpeople who have ever touched Bitcoin arefamiliar with but doing in a way that isprivacy preserving by default um so Ithink that's where we have to get likethat if I didn't think that was possibleI wouldn't be touching Bitcoin I wouldnot be working on bitcoin full time sothat is really the big thing for me iswe need to get to that place where I canjust tell someone use this peer-to-peerexchange these are my favorite paymentmethods use this one mobile wallet thatsimplifies this process uh maybe you geta hardware wallet or maybe run a node aswell because running a node is veryimportant but that's usually a furtherstep down the line and what we need toget there to where it is easier but fornow I do think the sparrow wallet is isgenerally the the best tool there andone little tip before we move on is justthat whenever you're doing somethingwith Bitcoin almost every wallet outthere supports something called testnetand I don't know how much you've gotteninto that in the past with uh previousguest Gabriel but essentially it's justa a worthless version of the BitcoinNetwork that you can do whatever youwant on you can get uh Bitcoin on andthat's it's not has no value so you'reable to do things to test things out totry out things like Sarah uh Samuraiwallet Sparrow wallet uh to actually getyour hands dirty playing around with thetools without having to put any of yourfunds at risk just in case you'reworried about losing funds or messingsomething upum and there's a lot of really good waysto be able to actually try using Bitcointhat way get your feet wet and that canbring the peace of mind that okay I cando this like I can do this with myactual Bitcoin so that's that's kind ofa general tip as wellright and if you're a little bitoverwhelmed by what you've heard so farthere is a huge benefit just to gettingself-custody Bitcoin um you know we talkabout the private stuff there is a hugebenefit just to having self-custodyBitcoin so maybe if you're overwhelmedjust start there and as Seth was sayingyou can experiment with I find that oneof the best things to do is just toexperiment with some of these thingswe've mentioned on bitcoin you can usevery tiny amounts um of SATs right yeaha satis one 100 millionth of a Bitcoinso you can use very small amounts tokind of send them back and forth untilyou get familiar withum some of these techniquesso you guys are part of a companyFoundation which makes a hardware walletbut you also have a an app that is thatconnects with it Envoy a q a does envoyhave any solutions for our privacycrisisso at the moment we on voice kind oflike in its first release State uh wherewe get it towards being a companionapplication for passport which is thehardware wallet that we we make afoundation and we we built it with aview to making using your super simpleHardware wallet even easier through youknow a guided onboarding uh tit uhtowards uh passport it's custom made forpassport so don't currently support anyother Hardware whilst on the market withit I'm sure that'll come in time but wewanted to you know we live in a mobilefirst world and we wanted to make surethat people buying our Hardware producthad you know their handheld for theonboarding process so that goes fromeverything down to you know turning thedevice on to creatingum carrying out the security checks topairing it so that you can transact withBitcoin it takes you through fromabsolute Step Zero and so in terms ofprivacy the features areum pretty basic at the moment we wedefault all to all of our communicationover the tour Network such that when ifyou connect to our default back endthat's run on our servers we we don'tlearn anything about your IP address oryourum your rough location or anything likethat so we we defaulted to that umjust to make sure that we give our userseven if they don't know what the TorNetwork is we're kind of protectingtheir privacy without them even knowingit the the next stage in our developmentis going to bring some moreum privacy features so we're going to beintroducing a thing called coin controlwhich is the ability to select whichpieces of Bitcoin or which utxos thatyou control within your wallet that youcan be to construct all of yourdifferent transactions So currentlycurrentlyum all when you've receive a transactionit just goes into kind of one big partwithin envoying you can't um you can'tdictate which ones of those you want tospend when you'reum you know going to the shops payingGabriel for his podcast whatever thatmay be so that's going to be the nextbig thing for us is is making um isgiving the option for users to be ableto select those gtxos but doing it in areally simple way becauseum coin control or utxo management asit's also called it's quite a can bequite an overwhelming thing so we'recoming up with quite a unique take onthis in how we present those differentetxos and how we afford the use of theability to label these different utxoswhich is another crucial part of of thiswhole privacy pieceum you know if I've got a wallet that'stwo years old and I have the ability tocoin control but I don't know where anyof them came from then I'm kind ofshooting in a dark room when I'mspending those utxos and choosing whichones to combine so labeling is a reallycrucial part of this whole piece soagain we're kind of building that outcurrently such that our users are goingto have a really simple time in doingthat and be able to kind of arrangetheir utxos into different um intodifferent pots that are essentiallystill within the same wallet such thatwhen they make those future spendtransactions you know as theyum progress on their Bitcoin journey andstart to realize the importance of moreprivacy features like coin control thenthey're in a good place with a simple UIto be able to manage those differentpieces of utxo so that's on the shortterm Horizon for us I'm going to be thenext kind of big privacy feature withinwith an Envoy I do want to talk aboutwhat Foundation is doing we can we cansave that for the last chunk of timehere and what q a was mentioning aboutcoin control is also very importantsomething we miss we missed when talkingabout the basics of Bitcoin privacy itcan be overwhelming but it's not justacquiring non-kyc that's good for That'sessential for privacy removing thedeterministic link using whirlpoolingthat's excellent for privacy but movingforwards you also have to be in controland be very selective of not reusing uhutxos so that's what we call coincontrol it's another whole actually havehave either of you come up with kind ofjust a basic basic explanation forpeople to start to have more controlover their utxos yeah the I think thesimplest approach and the simplestconcept which I I again want to kind ofsee become the norm iswhenever you receive funds putting inthe description or in the tag orwhatever the wallet you use uses forthat field memo is sometimes that's whatit's calledum putting in there where you receivethe funds from or what the funds werefor so that you can have an easy way todistinguish likeuh These funds I got from a peer-to-peerexchange where maybe these are connectedto my my bank account details or maybeif you are using like a centralized kycexchange These funds came from that sothey're directly tied to my real lifeidentityum being able to do that and making surethat whenever you receive funds you havea kind of a record in your wallet ofwhere these funds came from is it'sreally the first step and that that'simportant because it helps in the futurewhen you go to spin the idea is reallyjust thatideally your wallet will make the rightchoices for you to provide good privacyand that's a lot of where the theStonewall spin method that the thing insparrow that we talked about beforecomes in handy in that it does its bestto provide strong privacy by default butif the coins that you're spending arecoming from different places like let'ssay for instance you do use centralizedkyc exchange so your identity is tieddirectly to that Bitcoin output uh andthen you also have gotten some funds offof a peer-to-peer exchange like we'vetalked about you don't want to make atransaction that spins from both ofthose sets of funds because if you do ittells the kyc exchange that you also ownthis output that you're also the ownerof the address used there that uh thatyou're the same person and so it allowsthem to to do what's called walletclustering where they they keep tyingthings together to try to get a betterpicture of of who you are about whereyou spend about where you get funds fromso you want to keep all of thoseseparate pools uhdistinct when you're spending that'sreally like the Crux of coin control isyou're trying to make sure that you'renot revealing more information tosomeone than you have toum and most commonly it's really aboutseparating those funds those Bitcoinoutputs that are directly tied toIdentity and those that are not and alot of times the simplified to do thatis just using two separate wallets twoseparate accounts for those funds sothat they're they're never mixed bydefault it's something that like we dowith our our Hardware wallets you canjust create a second account or howevermany accounts you want and if youreceive funds to a different account forlike your kyc funds your non-kyc theycan never mix you can never make atransaction that combines those fundswhich provides good privacy butultimately labeling uh every time youreceive labeling what those funds wereforum and then when you go to spendspending from the account that revealsas as little information as possibleagain if we can make this easier whereit's very simple to choose where coinsare coming from in a transaction wherewe can make it where it's very simple totag funds to keep track of those thingsthings to see details on what utxos aregetting spent that will help and thatwill make it easier because right now itis a lot of extra manual work but it'sone of those things where the groundworkhas been laid the foundation is there sowe really just need to build out on topof it a more simple more user-friendlyuh a more pretty and approachable UIaround it to make it so that it'ssomething that just becomes part of thenorm that's just maybe one extra verysimple step in a transaction but givesyou full control from a privacyperspective on on how you spend funds Ithink that was a a very good explanationof coin control and if you're listeningand you don't know what we're talkingabout coin control labels utxos it'sprobably because you're not using awallet that actually lets you see yourBitcoin in the trunks that it actuallyarrived to you in so that's why werecommend using something like thesparrow wallet where it forces you tolook at all the different chunks thatyou have and it has certain things inplace that ensure that you're you're notmixing the streams as it were why don'twe move on and have just a quick palettecleanser here I want to ask for peoplewho are just getting into Bitcoin forwhatever reason economic crisis or needfor privacyetc etc I wonder if you could just givea few maybe just a few each of yourfavorite uh resources Twitter telegrampodcast where do you get your updatesand information about Bitcoin uh q a doyou want to go firstyeah sure so to stay up to date with thelatest uh weekly uh news I guess in inand around the Bitcoin world would belistening to uh tftc uh or Tales fromthe Crypt which is kind of like a weeklynews showum if for more kind of actionablecontent around the latest developmentsuh with let's say developers ordeveloper teamsum Matt O'Dell hosts a great podcastcalled Citadel dispatch which kind ofDives more into the weeds and getsreally into the nitty-gritty of howthese new protocols or you knowdevelopment changes application changeshow they're all working and gettingstatus updatesum another great technical one and asyou can tell I'm a big fan of podcastsis the Stefan lovera show again slightlymore technical but a great one forstaying up to date he always has the thelatest guests on that are coming outwith the the most recent let's say uhhot application or protocol developmenttype thing so they're really great andif you are kind of want to get in yourown time in under the the nuts and boltsof this stuff some great books that I'veread would beum mastering Bitcoin by AndreasAntonopoulos we'll hold my hands up andsay that's quite a technical bookum and as a non-technical background guyyou know I had to come back to this bookthree or four times but um if you arewilling to do that and kind of learn howto to gain an understanding of how thisprotocol works that's a fantasticresource and it's still one that I goback to todayumand he's also with the help of a coupleof other people uh also done masteringlightning uh which is uh exactly thesame principle but just for focused onthe lightning Network again so fairlytechnicalum but if you want to gain a goodunderstanding of of how this goes onum both of those books have kind ofstood the test of time and become a defacto reference implementation for meexcellent I'll just shout out to onebook I read recently called the basicsof Bitcoin uh Bitcoins and blockchainsby Anthony Lewis I thought that had somepretty good insights I've read all theBitcoin books and I thought that one dida pretty good job of explaining thingsmaybe maybe towards more of anintermediate audienceum Seth what are some some of yourfavorite resources yeah I mean with q aand I being pretty similar I I Echo alot of his um especially Citadeldispatches is one of my favoritesum they're pretty long forms so I don'tI don't necessarily listen to all ofthem or to to the full length ofeveryone but that's usually a reallygood place to to kind of keep up withwhat's happening he's very kind oflong-formed detailed discussions withwith developers and so that's definitelyone that I'd Echo the recommendationthereum another really good source for me hasbeen a kind of a community and feedthat's that's popped up in the last sixmonths or so called The Sovereignbitcoinerum and they they do a really good job ofthey have a Blog that's uh kind ofopenly published to by lots of people intheir community so there's a lot ofvaried content there that focuses onlike self-hosting Bitcoin privacydevelopments lots of things around thatthey really good RSS feed telegram roomthat has lots of content well wherethey'll show they'll share links and uhthings that they're they're reading orlearning from so that's a really goodkind of all-in-one feed for a lot ofcontent it's not just Bitcoin but itdoes focus a lot around Bitcoin andBitcoin privacy so they do a really goodjob thereum I think the other two plugs that I'dgo with areumselfish in that they're a podcast thatI've been making for our companyfoundation called Journey thesovereignty where we're getting a lotinto kind of the the basics ofself-sovereignty of uh privacy ofBitcoinum and so we'll be covering a lot ofkind of the the basics the entry-levelstuff and getting into a lot of the kindof The Cutting Edge research and topicsthat are happening around that so that'sone of them and then also our blog whichis just phonationdevices.com blog uhwhere I've been trying to write a lotmore about what's been happening in thespace again especially with an eyetowards privacy it's like recentlyfocused on the concept of stealthaddresses or reusable payment codes isthere they're also sometimes calledum we'll have a post about Peter pairexchanges coming out as well so that'llbe one where like I'll be trying to domy best to keep up with the things thatare happening and explaining explainingthem in a very approachable wayum but I think for Content feeds Citadeldispatch and The Sovereign Bitcoin aretwo of my favorite yeah the the otherone I neglected to mention and probablythe place that I've learned the most inmy four maybe five years in and aroundBitcoinum is telegram communities or Twittercommunities just literally just speakingto people each and every day and beingin the telegram groups of uh Samuraiwallet spiral wallet there's literallythousands of people across those groupsand there's a small number within thatgroup that are very very helpfulum all too kind with their time inhelping new users understand how to usethese tools or even just broaderum Bitcoin privacy topics I I've learnedthe most from people like that in the inand around those communities than I everhave by listening to podcasts or readingbooks because most of the the content isis tailored towards whichever tool it isthat represents that telegram Communityuh the same with Matrix there's a coupleof great Chats on Matrix as well butjust just learning from other people andhaving conversations becauseum what you'll find is if you thinkyou're the first one to make a mistakethat's almost never the case andsomebody's been there before and knows ashortcut to fix it so and yeah very veryuh always try to push people to to getinvolved in the community and makefriendsum and to just learn from from othersyeah one last one that I'd add too uh welike briefly mention it in the podcastbut there's a new protocol which uh areally interesting approach to socialmedia is being built on top of calledNoster uh and there's a lot of reallygood high signal discussions happeningthere as well I think partly becauseit's pretty Bitcoin Centric and built bybitcoiners so there's a lot of uh moreum like Bitcoin focused content on thereobviously uh but it's it's been a reallygood place for me that I've beenenjoying more than Twitter uh normallyover the past month or soum so that may be a good one to get setup on uh I can give you a link to aguide that I just made on how toapproach using Noster privately withlinks to to clients and all that funstuff butum there's really good mobile clients oniOS called domus d-a-m-u-s and then onAndroid called amethyst which I've beenusing amethyst and it's a it's a veryinteresting new approach to socialnetworking it's very much focused on youthe user having controller of your datauh it integrates Bitcoin lightning as adirect way to tip people for Contentjust straight in your feed it's a reallyreally interesting chance I think toredo social media and along with thatcomes a lot of the kind of Cutting Edgediscussions happening there since a lotof bitcoiners are starting to use thatso I think that's another good tool thatthat can be useful and will grow and howuseful it is as more and more peoplestart to use it excellent I was going tohave a discussion about nostal but Ithink you've given us the some of thebasics there well did you say you'vewritten that article yet or you're rightyeah yeah I've written that I'll sendyou the link it's it's on our companyblog yeah we'll we'll link that and andsave a fuller discussion of that foranother time let's wind down the showhere by talking about Foundation thecompany uh been around since 2020 theymake the passport Hardware wallet if wewant to call it them that's still ahardware wallet a signing device isprobably what I would prefer to to callthem um to prevent the illusion thatthis thing is actually storingum your Bitcoin and so you guys bothwork for foundationuh the passport wallets is definitelyone of these excellent Hardware walletsthat that are out there I've typicallyrecommended the cold card in the pastbut the passport is just as easily agreat recommendationum and you know what I love about the uhthe passport is it's this is a littlebit shallow but it's it's veryattractive you knowum and it is named after uh Isaacasimov's Foundation Trilogy I justrealized this the other day actually andI'm a sucker for anything sci-fi andsymbolic and so this is a this is agreat option if one wants to have coldstorage that is you want to create youryour seed phrase on a dedicated devicewhere you have a little bit moreum security than if you did it on yourcomputer uh maybe you guys could justtalk about Foundation the foundationpassport where have things how arethings developed in the last year wherewhere are you guys at and where do yousee the passport stacking up in the uhthe market of of a hardware wallets orsigning devices if we want to call wateryeah so firstly we we appreciate thatyou recognize the beauty of the deviceand you know at the heart of it we weare definitely kind of a I guess aBitcoin security companyum but where we like to come indifferentlyum and this stems from zakar CEOum is to we're a firm believer that youcan have a secure device that doesn'thave to look like crap or be scary touse or difficult to useum so we place designum almost as importantly as Security inin everything that we doum such that you know we feel like wecan fill a gap in the market that peoplecan have these secure offline dedicateddevices to manage their super importantBitcoin keys but they don't need to havea difficult time to do that and theydon't need to go and sit and read themanual for three hours before they feelcomfortable enough to to turn the thingonso uh yeah so we came up with with uhwith passport which is our take on aBitcoin Hardware walletum with uh but the different take thatwe we've kind of come aside from thedesign thingum is like a nice big screen so you cansee what you're doing without having toto squintum night a proper what we call it a T9keyboard which will be quite analogousto anybody that's uh off of the 90s orearlier and recognizes old kind of Nokiastyle mobile phonesum that makes kind of interacting withthe device super easy you know you canbig bright vivid screen easy to type inpassphrases or seed words or pinswhatever it isum such that you can interact with yourBitcoinum easily without kind of having to likeyou say read the manual or anything likethat so the the way that the device iscompletely offline and and it interactswith theinteract with the outside world or ordifferent clients like Spiral is a greatexample or Envoy our mobile companionapp it interacts through QR codes andit's got a camera on the back of thescreen sotransactional information is passed backand forth in a couple of seconds byanimated QR codes and that's how itcommunicates with let's say Internetconnected devices like your computerrunning Sparrow so you would pair it upwith with Envoy or Sparrowum and that sort of client would monitorthe uh the Bitcoin blockchain so thatyou can receive Bitcoin and then anytimethat you want to authorize or spendBitcoin and that's where passport comesin as your sort of secure an offlinedevice to be able to ingest all of yourtransactional information you can readthat on the nice bright vivid screencheck that everything is uh as expectedand you know there isn't an extra hiddenamount somewhere confirm that on thedevice and that's access your yourauthorization and so that you can thenpass that back across to the client soum all geared around making self-custodyBitcoin in terms of Cold Storage as easyas possibleum whilst having a device that you'renot ashamed of having on your on yourdesk as well soum we're on our second iteration of thedevice now what we're calling the thebatch 2 which has been shippingum since late last yearum which added some additional featuresthat improved on our initial device suchas a removable rechargeable lithium ionbatteryum charging via a USBC cable so that youdon't you don't need to be Tethered to awall to use this device the device willlast for like 10 to 12 hours on a singlecharge battery again standard formfactor battery so you're not kind ofreliant on foundation so if we disappearin five or ten years and your batteryeventually uh meets its device and youcan just go on anywhere like Amazon orAlibaba and find this standard formfactor batteryoutside of all that and I'll let Sethhave a go in a sec and we prideourselves on doing absolutely everythingin a free and open source nature that'severything from the hardware designsthat we makeum right down to the firmware or thesoftware that runs on this device aswell anybody can go and see all thelines and code that are running on theirdevice they can verify that they canpass it to an independent verifier andhell if they've got a manufacturingbrain they can go and download all ofour Hardware schematics and electronicsand build this device themselves if theywanted to I'm not saying they'd have aneasy task because you know it's quite acomplex device but they're free to dothat if they wanted to as well soum all in the spirit of true free opensource which is at the heart ofabsolutely everything that we do so wepride ourselves on on maintaining andupholding those standards and makingsure that passport is compatible with uhall of the Bitcoin uh Wallets on themarket as well so that our users havethe most amount of choice decided to dowhat they like with this device be thatbuild the build their own or just choosewhich wallet that they want to use itwith we're all about openness atFoundation yeah the only minor thingsI'd add are just that like when weapproach building things I think one ofthe words that I've loved that has beena core piece of what we do is reallylike optimism I think there's a reasonwhy our design is actually likepretty and nice to hold and nice to useis that it's really approaching Bitcoinfrom the sense of like we have thisamazing tool to be able to opt out itgives us power it puts power back in thehand of the individual um so we're veryoptimistic about the future and I thinkthat shows in the way that we design andbuild our toolsum obviously q a harped on reallyaccessibility and ease of use that's ahuge one for me because like we talkedabout throughout the show I I reallywant people to be able to to approachBitcoin to do it in the right way toself-custody to gain privacy withouthaving to be technically Savvy withouthaving to understand a command lineinterface and Linux or something likethat I want it to be something whereit's really like you can you can helpyour grandma to use Bitcoin in a aproper way um so that's that's reallykind of like a lot of the goal with whatwe're doingum and then just the third minor thing Ijust want to harp on it's just likewe're very much about freedom of choicewe do not and will not lock you intousing our mobile app we won't lock youinto usingum any specific wallet our aim is tosupport as many different options foryou the user as possible so you can usewhatever wallet you love we have directIntegrations with guided steps on thedevice or with walkthroughs and amazingvideos that the Q a has has put togetherthat help you to connect and use prettymuch any of the popular wallets outthere as new wallets come out we shipsupport for those as quickly as possibleand we really focus on usinginteroperable standards in the Bitcoinspace so that again we're not lockingyou into anythingum ultimately because we want you tohave that choice and even as you theuser if you're approaching Bitcoin Forthe First Time versus you've been herefor five years the things that you wantto do with Bitcoin will change a lot ofthe more advanced things will beinteresting to you so we also want tosupport that so even though it's a veryapproachable very accessible tool wealso have very Advanced power userfeatures that generally we try to kindof put in a settings menu so they're notcausing problems for new users andconfusing them but we have strongsupport for things like Whirlpool thatwe talked about where when you want toto mix funds you can do it directly toyour passport from Sparrow wallet verysimply without having your passport onor anything like that um so it's a it'sa big Focus for us that we can buildthings that will grow with you as you godown this journey of self-sovereignty ofdigital sovereignty of financialsovereigntyum but yet things that don't lock youinto our ecosystem we're going to kindof give you the the Apple like userexperience without the Walled Garden isa lot of our Focus yeah I like that thatlast point and I'll just say to peoplelistening again we're talking aboutHardware wallets if you're just gettinginto Bitcoin this has always been mystance just download sparrow and learnfrom there and once you get arespectable amount of Bitcoin then umthen you can move to the the hardwarewallet the foundation passport iscertainly I'd say that and the cold cardare up there at the top and the uh thepassport while more expensive is is veryattractive and has some some nicefeatures such as you can use the QR codeit has a has a camera built in you canuse the QR code scanning that is veryuseful can you use that Seth to kind oftreat it as a mobile wallet with withthat kind of functionalityyeah definitely and I mean that the QRfunctionality is key to using it withwith our Mobile wallet or with with anyother real Mobile Wallet because likewhile you can use MicroSD on mobilethat's obviously not an ideal userexperience you have to have an adapterand you have to pop it out of the deviceput it in your phone and it's just it'sa more complex back and forth so it issomething where you can definitely useit as a mobile wallet and I mean one ofthe one of the key pieces of the designis we wanted it to be as physicallysecure as possible so like I've traveledwith mine I'm not necessarily sayingeveryone should do that a lot of timesit's best to leave yours at home and notworry about it on the go and use a hotwallet but it's one of those thingswhere if someone grabbed my passport andran off with it grabbed my backpack andit was in there or somethingum they would essentially have no chanceat getting funds off of this and I couldvery easily restore a backup on a newpassport that I get from for foundationor something so it's one of those thingswhere like I think you can generallyfeel safe about using it on the goobviously there are security concernsmaybe you don't want to do that but it'ssomething where that we did want toenable and so like using with with ourmobile app Envoy or with a popularwallet like blue wallet it's really easyto do on the go really easy to actuallymake transactions and that's anotherthing that I love is like we're not justfocusing on helping you to to lock yourBitcoin away in a way that makes it hardfor you to actually get to them or useBitcoin but we want to make it reallysecure but also make it really easy whenyou want to actually spend funds sobeing able to do it on mobile isdefinitely a piece of that uh and when Iam kind of on the go I'll use mobileapps just use those QR codes to pass thethe transaction data back and forth signit and and roll with it and it's it's avery straightforward processnow acquiring a passport just real quickwhere where do they goum are and what is the best way toacquire one of these privately are theyavailable in shopsum and uh do you what kind of paymentmethods do you accept and customer datajust kind of the basic privacy uhpurchase questions yeah I could say thatone so um the most private way in termsof purchased it would be to use Bitcoinwe accept Bitcoin on our online storeum so yeah if you've come through allthe steps that we've talked about todayand you've got yourself a spiral walletand you've done some coin doing withwhirlpool and you've got some post-mixstats there you can use those to spendwe do actually have a guide on how youcan do that uh using another tool thatwe haven't talked aboutum called pageoint which is essentiallyanother type of coin join which weaccept on our store as well so you canactually uh coin join again after you'vedone your original code during whenyou're making a purchase from usin terms of the delivery you know thethis is the the kind of the difficultbit is getting physical items deliveredto to your home location or to alocation that you controlum in a way that's uh you know dependingon how much information you want toshare with us at Foundation we obviouslyneed some form of address to get that toyou we do support sending to PO Boxes ifyou do have access to oneuh outside of that the the obvious uhoption is to kind of get it delivered toa workplace where you have sort of aquote-unquote anonymity set of everybodythat works at your uh your work locationwhich is kind of like a bit more of anapproachable one if you have the optionto you and I know uh all employees notall employees do thatum but yeah those in terms of privacythose are the two uh best advice that wecan giveum if you actually want to go and seewhat this thing looks like you can headto foundationdevices.com passport andyou'll be able to see uh how beautifulit is and see why Gabriel uh likes thelook of itum and the final thing that I was goingto mention oh yeah data data managementsoum we take our customers data managementsuper super seriouslyum you know we're big Advocates ofprivacy big Advocates and non-kyc Etc soum 60 days after your device ships fromour Factory which is currentlyimmediately essentially we ship almostsame day 60 days after that is completeduh we automatically Purge all yourinformation that's gone forever and sowe are limiting the threat and exposurethat if you do have no choice but togive us your home address and your nameand your phone number because you don'thave any alternatives to give us thenyou can rest assured that that's beendeleted from our systems after 60 daysum mainly because we don't want the riskof holding it so we keep it as long aswe need to for returns or any shippingissues and then after that it's goneforever so that you know we don't haveto manage that information yeah thereare two other options too where if youdon't want to purchase from Us online orif you want to be able to purchasephysically so we do have uh resellersboth in the US and throughout a goodpart of the world so you can go throughthose resellers especially if there'sone locally to you within your countryor even within your city that would beobviously a great way to buy it buyingphysically with cash or with Bitcoin isa great way to buy a hardware walletbecause then No One Ever Knows Your yourhome address or anything like that sothat is a really good wayum one other way that I'd mention is issince we do have passport in stock andshipping immediately this year when wego to conferences throughout the year wewill have passports with us for sale soif you're planning on going to bitcoinconferences like Bitcoin 2023 in May oruh there's quite a few that are going onthis year but throughout the year theconferences will be at we'll be sellingthem in person for cash for Bitcoin howquickly do you sell out of thosetypically is it like first first 30minutes or somethinguh this will actually be the first timethat we'll have them in stock to be ableto take the conferences so we'll see Ihope that they'll sell out very quicklybecause I think it's uh it's one of thebest ways to be able to buy a hardwarewallet for sure so I'm hopeful it'll bea really good way to to sell them whilepreserving the privacy of the the buyeras much as possible so that will bereally really cool to do this year umand then the third way that you can buythem in a way that's privacy preservingor that you can give passport as a giftis to be able to buy gift cards um forour online store so you can get thosethrough I think bit refill the Bitcoincompany and coin cards are the threegift card vendors uh that have giftcards for our store so you can use thoseto either just be the payment method somaybe you want to pay with Monero orsomething like that you can buy a giftcard with Monero use the gift card onour store and you actually get I think a10 discount as well if you do gift cardsso it's a it's a good option as well ora really good way to gift a passport tosomeone else especially because againyou don't need them their address toship it to them or something you justbuy the gift card give it to them theythey can handle actually ordering it soit keeps you from learning their addressor details about them so I think thoseare the last main options but lots ofdifferent ways that you can bypass forand lots of different ways you can buypassport in a way that is privacypreserving that's excellent I think it'sa testament to Foundation the companythat they have two of the two greatoutspoken uh Sovereign private Bitcoinpeople in southern q a working for themand so Foundation has come a long waysas well recently they have an entirepart of their website entire webpagetalking about how you can buy thepassport privately using coin joint andthey have various resources on theirwebsite blog a lot of good informationon there about their their corephilosophies and as Seth was sayingthey've started a podcast so there's allkinds of good things coming fromFoundation I was just the other day inone of their Twitter spaces where theywere having these regular meetups sothere's a lot of fantastic things comingfrom Foundation it seems like anexcellent private Bitcoin company inconclusion then thank you so much Sethand Q a there's obviously a lot morethat we could have talked about butwe've gone on for a while as well and Ithink we've we've given some usefulinformation we'll have all theseresources for people to track downyou're always invited back to the showanytime and how about just some somefinal thoughts either about what you'redoing or about Bitcoin or just finalthoughts for the audience sure yeah Ithink the biggest thing for me is isreligious that I'm optimistic about thestate of privacy on bitcoin there's alot of really good work going on but areal key piece is that that each of usif you're a bitcoiner if you're outthere using Bitcoin really put pressureon the developers of the tools that youlove put pressure talk about publiclyconstantly the uh the privacy issueswithin Bitcoin and the ways that we canfix them today and really bring socialconsensus together to support betterprivacy on bitcoin and better privacywithin Bitcoin apps because that'sreally the the way that we're going toensure that we continue to be able touse Bitcoin in a way that's privacypreserving and get better and better atit because privacy is a it's always anarms race so it's something where weneed that pressure and as people see itas a priority for Bitcoin users it willget built into Apps um so I'm excitedfor what the future is going to holdexcited for how lightning is going toimprove on privacyum and and really looking forward towhat's in the store for the the Bitcoinspace thankful for for tools likeBitcoin that allow us to really opt outof a broken system so it's it's excitingtimes times to be optimistic even inspite of the world being as crazy asalways yeah for me uh just want toreiterate that I I'm a firm believerthat everybody has got some kind of uhcontribution that they can give back tothe the overall Bitcoin space dependregardless of your background uh youknow obviously if you're a technical youcan get involved with the differentprojects and contribute some code ifyou're non-technical you can just simplyget involved in the communities offersupport use the different tools andoffer you know provide some constructivefeedback to the developers uh oftentimessome of these developers are doing thisfor free and they've got their head headdown you know smash washing out codeleft right and Center and they can kindof miss that feedback from more basicusers that don't have the level ofunderstanding that that they might haveso you feedback from basic users thatmay not understand the concepts ortopics that these developers areimplemented into their various tools itcan can prove absolutely invaluable sojust by being in the community usingthese tools and saying you know I don'tquite understand this conceptum you'll be helping indirectly to todrive whatever that project is whereveryou canum favor free and open source tools andsoftware and Hardwareum because that's how we we truly startto continue to spread the spread thismind virus um but yeah super optimisticit's going to be a big year for Bitcoinand even bigger bit year for foundationso thank you once again for for havingus on Gable been real fun[Music]thank you[Music][Music]foreign",
