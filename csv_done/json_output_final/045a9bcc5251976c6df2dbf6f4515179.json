If you want to have a good idea of how well an untested device will perform, read my Treatise on Bitcoin Seed Backup Device Design.    You may also find this sortable spreadsheet useful.DeviceOverall GradeHeat GradeCorrosion GradeCrush GradePriceAttenuoAAAA£50BitkeeAAAA$40Bitplate DominoAAAA£70.50Bitplate Domino GrandeAAAA£80.50Black Seed InkAAAA$27BlockplateAAAA$79Bravo Seed CardAAAA€40Bravo Seed CoinAAAA€60Bulletproof Bitcoin (DIY)AAAA~$50Codl Punchplate IIIAAAA$30Codlkeys SAAAA$30Coinplate AlphaAAAA$79Coinplate GridAAAA$75Coinplate PunchAAAA$65Coldbit SteelAAAA€82CRYOAAAA$50Crypto KeysAAAA$30Crypto Key StackAAAA$45CryptoetchAAAA50 CHFCryptoNumeris Board SA-ABA$32CryptoNumeris Plate SAAAA$35CryptoTag OdinAAAA$200CryptoTag ThorAAAA$350CryptoTag ZeusAAAA$130DIYSeedAAAA$20HodlinoxAAAA€30Hodlinox InterlockingAAAA€34Hodlinox Single PlateAAAA€13Hodlrock Rock96AAAA$74qreg-hrAAAA€149Quadrat Register 11AAAA€149Quadrat Register PAAAA€366Safe SeedAAAA$28Secret Seed EnigmaAAAA$49SeedSteelAAAAN/ASeedplateAAAA$50SimbitAAAA$110SmallseedAAAA48 CHFSteel Wallet (DIY)AAAA~$20SteelwalletAAAA€65TinyseedAAAA€199Tjernlund CC3PAAAA$40Willi's Recovery Seed PlateAAAA€27CipherSeks Double PlateA-ABA$60CipherSeks Single PlateA-ABA$60Coldbit PassphraseA-ABA$15Cryptosteel CapsuleA-AAB$109CryptoVaultA-ABA$35Hodlr SwissA-AAB€119ImpressSeed TitaniumA-ABA$30Keyois CapsuleA-BAA$99SAFU Ninja (DIY)A-AAB$15SteelKiA-BAA$24CypherwheelB+AAC$250CryptoSteel CassetteBBAD$90Keystone Tablet PunchBADA$24BillfodlCCAD$55Cobo TabletCFAD$39Cold Storage CoinsCFBB$20ColdTICDCA$21Keystone Tablet PlusCFAA$49Copper Seed SafeC-BCF$14Blockstream MetalDAF-$80CipherTagDAFF$6The HODL WalletDAF-N/AThe SteelyDFAF$70Ballet CryptoFFFF$35BitHD Frozen ArmorFFF-$30BunkeroidFFF-$130Ellipal Mnemonic MetalFFF-$50SteeldiskFFF-N/AThere are too many choices, how do I choose?Avoid using devices where the device manufacturer may know your private key. Such as Keyois Capsule, Cold Storage Coins, and Ballet Crypto. In some cases it’s possible to have a manufacturer create a BIP38 encrypted backup, which is safer but I wouldn’t recommend it.Simpler is better - more pieces means more potential points of failure.The best bang for your buck are the single plates with grids for center punched dots such as Bitplates, Blockplate, CodlKeys, Smallseed, or Steelwallet.The most durable devices I’ve tested are the Quadrat Register variants.NOTE: this is an open source project!
