about mining heat Iwill not hesitate what have I gotbye-bye heat no not the 1995 Al Pacinomovie although that one's pretty goodthe Bitcoin protocol is essentiallyprotected via thermodynamics you areputting a tremendous amount of energythat is converted directly into Securityin cyberspace but in the real world it'sjust making a tremendous amount of heatand that's where our business modelcomes inthe heat you take for granted today isthe product of years of engineering fromcavemen smashing rocksto fireplaces baseboards and thermostatswith more RAM than an iPhone 3. butheating at home works much differentlyin scale than Heating and apartmentbuilding a factory or a school thedemand for heat of that magnituderequires big industrial heaters orboilers closed-headed vessels that canprovide both heat from an energy sourceor exchange heat from one medium toanother these can be complex and highbandwidth machines and they aren'talways purchased outright but least on acontract basis by District energycompanies to deliver a set amount ofheat over a specific duration for arelatively fixed cost alright so wheredoes Bitcoin mining Colin and hiscompany mint green fit into all of thisthe difference really comes in toeconomics to run an electric boilerlet's say it's very low carbon butyou're just basically burning electronsand there's no sort of abilities turnthat into anything useful with Bitcoinmining you are essentially burningelectrons for the purpose of defendingthe Bitcoin Network and earning Bitcoinas yield on that as well as harnessingthe entropy to you know have anadditional purpose so the energy reallygets used twice in our application midgreen designs and builds electricalboilers and heat recovery systems allpowered by Clean energy and BitcoinMiners and quick pause if you don't knowwhat Bitcoin mining is or how it worksgo check out the video in the top rightcorner that's going to pop up now likecan Bitcoin miners really provide thatmuch heat I had to check that one formyselfyes believe it or not the same babykilling atmosphere intoxicating an oceanboiling machine known as a Bitcoin minerhow dare you creates essentially thesame amount of heat per

accepting Bitcoin overecological concerns and Elizabeth Warrenhates it so it's got to be evil rightenergy use has never had to be defendedlike if you are watching videos on yourcomputer if you are playing video gamesif you are lighting your Christmas treeI think Bitcoin is the only use ofenergy that's ever had to articulate whythat use is appropriate use of energy isessentially how maybe from a sciencefiction level but we look at theadvancement of societies in general solike the Kardashian scale looks at howmuch energy is consumed by society andthat's an assessment of how advanced itis we're always going to consume moreenergy that's just a sign of theprogress of the species in general so wenever want to move backwards on that butwe can always do it better and I thinkthat's what we're doing and I thinkthat's what the space is doing ingeneral better than most Industries manycountries in Europe took center stage inthe news last year for havingastronomical electric and gas pricesmaking heating through the winterprohibitively expensive and forcing afew districts to move back to burningcoal for the first time in decadesbut in places like Canada for the firsttime thanks to a robust renewable energyGrid it's actually becoming cheaper on along-term basis to heat usingelectricity versus traditional fuelsources like oil or natural gas the costis usually prohibitively expensive touse electricity if we can offset some oftheir costs through other revenuestreams with Bitcoin mining we canincentivize the electrification anddecarbonization of their line so in thecase of well as the energy Corp we arebasically supplanting the incumbentwhich would be natural gas to the tuneof 1900 tons of CO2 per megawatt peryear being prevented from going to theatmosphere but I thought Bitcoin was badfor the environment I know this is amajor narrative violationin theory Bitcoin mining couldeventually become one of the most costeffective ways to provide heat fromelectricity
