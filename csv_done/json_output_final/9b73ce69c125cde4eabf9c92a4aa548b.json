  "text": "What if I told you that with one clickof one app that is already availableon your nodes app store, you could addhundreds of new and incredible featuresto your Bitcoin lightning network node,including the ability to use Bitcoindebit cards, the ability to distributeBitcoin, the ability to run a lightningnetwork jukebox and much, much more.And that if you are not already runningthis app proficiently, you are missingout on honestly, the vast majorityof the cool things you can do withyour Bitcoin lightning network node.Well stick around because in thisvideo, I'm gonna walk you throughthat exact app that can do allof this and much, much more.Greetings everyone, Jonathan Levi.And recently, if you follow me onTwitter, you've seen me talk aboutthe project and collaboration that I'mdoing with members of the Kwa-Meyi,Sterkspruit village in South Africa.For those of you who don't know, thisis a relatively rural village witha lot of agricultural workers, andmost importantly, for our purposes,They have about 50,000 people livingin the village who are unbanked.And so we've been working together,myself and a member of the village, aswell as Voltage, the cloud node provider,to set up a node for this community andhelp onboard as many people onto Bitcoinand lightning network as possible.And by the way, make sure that you aresubscribed if you're not already, becauseI'm gonna be sharing lots of amazingupdates on how you can help us in thisproject, how you can be a part of it,and of course, hopefully some incrediblesuccess stories of lives changed.Thanks to Bitcoin and lightning network.Now, as part of that process, I recentlygot the opportunity to sit down withBen arc, the creator of LNbits, andreally dive deep into this incredibleprogram that I'd really only playedwith at a cursory level before.Now if Ben looks familiar to you,it's because you've probably alreadyseen his incredible videos wherehe's developed some awesome projects,including offline lightning POSterminals, devices for people to be ableto use a hardware wallet for only $8.Offline Bitcoin ATMs using lightningnetwork and much, much more.He's really an incredible hacker andtinkerer, and I had no idea that theperson making these incredible devicessuch as hardware wallets, such astouch-to-pay, Bitcoin bolt devices, andall kinds of other crazy stuff,  wasthe very same person who started LNbits.So it was a huge privilege for me to beable to sit down with Ben for an hourand a half or more, and just pick hisbrain, not only about all the differentfeatures that I'm gonna share today, thatfrankly I didn't understand before,but also about how we can apply thesein the project that we're doing inKwa-Meyi, Sterkspruit and how we canhelp roll out lightning network fasterto more people while keeping controlof the Bitcoin within the community.Now, of course, some of the featureshere are not gonna be relevant foryou or for me, or really for anyonebesides the person who built them.But I think you'll find that thereare some incredibly cool featuresthat can expand the capabilityof your lightning node, and Iwanna walk you through that app.Make sure to use the chapters belowif you wanna skip around and seesome of the different features.Let's go ahead and dive intothe screencast and I will walkyou through LNbits and whyit is so mind blowingly cool.All right.So diving into our node software, youcan see here, I'm running Citadel, notUmbrel, and if you haven't seen my videoon why I'll link it for you right here.The app we are talkingabout is called LNbits.You can actually install it right fromwithin the app store on Umbrel, on manyof the other devices such as RaspiBlitz.It can even run on a server, a clearweb server, and you can connect it overTor to your very own lightning node.Here you can see LNbits, andI've already installed it so I'mgonna go ahead and open it up.Now, one very important thing and caveatthat I wanna explain first is that ifyou wanna open these features app toother people, you will need to eitherhave a reverse proxy set up so that youcan make this available on the clearweb, or both LNbits and Citadel arecurrently developing paid services wherethey will use CloudFlare to redirectthe traffic so that you can use the Tor,not the clear web address, onyour node and direct peopleso that they can actually viewthis on a normal web browser.Of course you could give people theTor address, but if you wanna make thiseasily available and accessible, likewe're going to be doing in the villagein South Africa, you'll probably wannaget this set up on the clear web.Of course you could, uh, like I said, useTor, but let me know in the comments belowif you're interested in a video explaininghow to do these reverse proxies, sothat you can make different apps onyour node available on the clear webwithout making the entire node available.I'd love to hear in the comments belowif that's something thatinterests all of you.Diving back into the demo, here youcan see we have LNbits on Citadel,and the first thing I need to isgo ahead and just create a user.Okay.Now I happen to also have an adminpassword and we are going to reallyquickly blur this so that I can login, but ostensibly, what you could dohere, if you're providing this domain toanyone out there, is not give them theadmin password and they could just maketheir very own wallet by putting intheir username here, and literally thatquick they are able, we'll blur thatof course, that quick, they are able tocreate a wallet right on their device,and I will just show you really quicklyhow that works.Now, the core functionality of LNbitsis that it allows you, as the nametells you, to break your lightning nodeup into little sub-wallets, basicallyproviding people with sub-accountswithin your lightning node, andbecoming the custodian or the bank forthem as they use lightning network.And that's really, really cool,especially if you want to give yourfamily lightning network wallets, but youdon't want them to custody on somethinglike BlueWallet or Wallet of Satoshi.Now, one of the first cool featuresthat I wanna show you is that you canexport this QR code to your phone andit gives them a wallet with full access.Now, currently I'm usingthe Citadel dot local URL.So it is, uh, obviously notgoing to work on the entire web.But why don't we go ahead reallyquickly, and I'll screen record hereand show you all, obviously blurringthis QR code, show you all how thisworks, so I can now export this.And as you see on the screen of myphone, I have actually created awallet which is mobile light, mobilefriendly, and does everything.I mean, I can send, receive scan.This is a full functioning lightningnetwork wallet, and if I want to, I caneven add it as a bookmark right on myphone by going to, add to home screen,and now I literally have a lightningnetwork wallet, which is using my nodeas the infrastructure, and I can receive,pay, it all just works that quickly.Now of course, there are other ways, Ican export it to a more fully functioningwallet if I want to such as BlueWallet,but at the base, I mean, this is it.Like, I already have a wallet.I think that's so incredibly cool thatyou can provide people with wallets.Now, again, this won't work becauseI'm doing it over my local network,but if you had them connect via Tor oryou had them connect on the clear web,that would be all, it would take forpeople to set up a wallet on your node.Now, you might be fooled into thinking,okay, well, that's cool, but I don'twanna be a bank, like what's the pointof this software, and that's exactlywhat I thought and that's why I had noidea just how powerful this software wasuntil I sat down with Ben, and he startedtelling me about all of the extensions.And as you can see, thereare a ton of extensions here.So many, that it would be an hourlong video to go through each andevery one of them and how they work.But I do wanna really quickly walkyou through each and every one ofthese, and explain what they do foryou and why you might wanna use them.Now, admin is, uh, just somethingthat has to do with Citadel andyou don't have to worry about it.I will note by the way that I am ona slightly outdated version of thisapp, because I haven't updated Citadeland Citadel also has not yet updatedto the latest version of LNbits.So if you're watching this, most of thefunctionality will be the same, and Iapologize if some of it is not the same.By the way, really cool fun note,is that you can skin this and set updifferent skins and different looks forpeople in their wallet, if you want to.And by the way, as I show youthese different apps, I want you toknow that these apps are not justfor you, the owner of the server.In fact, many of these things youcan offer as services to otherpeople who set up a user on yournode.So think about it this way, I can givemy kids a login here on my server, andif my kids wanna do this, they wantto sell event tickets, or they wantto stream on Twitch and get paid, thatcan all happen because they have accessto the features that I set for them.So as we're going throughthis list, just remember,this is not just for you, the node owner.This can be, if you allow it, for anyuser using your node, and that justblows my mind that I can give someonea URL and they can set up a lightningcapable wallet that does these 50different things I'm about to show you.Now, diving into theactual features themselves.Let's just go from the top to the bottom.Bleskomat allows you to create, basicallyconnect a Bitcoin ATM to LNbits, andit allows you to pay from a sub-wallet,meaning you can set up a sub-walletfor that ATM, and that sub wallet onyour node can do the buying and sellingand commerce, if you want to set upyour very own Bleskomat Bitcoin ATM.And again, Ben has some really amazingstuff that he has done for opensourcinghardware around Bitcoin ATMs.The Discord Bot allows you to generateusers and wallets by lightning network.So people can pay to set up theirusername and they can also usediscord and set up wallets, I think.I'm not a big Discord user,but really, really cool.DJ Livestream allows you if you'redoing a live stream of music and DJingon the internet, for people to payand download that livestream rightaway, automatically, which is cool.Again, let me remind you, a lot of theseare not gonna be relevant to everyone,but some of them like the ones coming uptowards the end are really freaking cool.Events allows you to literally sellevents and check people into thoseevents, all over lightning network.It allows you to generate an invoicewhere people can pay for the event.You can set up different events onyour server, and people can actuallygenerate those events, charge peopleand check them in with a QR code.Hivemind.Right now, as far as I was told is just aplaceholder, it's not gonna work until BIP300, so check back when that comes out.Invoices is not what you would think,it is not lightning network invoices.It actually allows people to create areal invoice, like an old fashioned paperinvoice that pays into their wallet,and we can configure it, putin all the different namesand whatever we want to do.And this is cool if you're runninga brick and mortar business, andit will generate an invoice, jellybeans for $1, and it will create aninvoice that I can then print out andhand to someone, which is so cool.There's the invoice.Someone can pay the invoice,and it will pay directly intothe sub-wallet on my node.That's a really cool thing to be ableto provide to your family members orfriends or local businesses if youwant them to support lightning network.Let's go on to Lightning Addresses.Now, I've previously done a videoon lightning addresses and how youcan set them up quickly and easily,but what's cool here is you can actuallysell lightning addresses for your domain.So let's say you manage to buy areally, really cool domain, like pay.meor something like that, this servicewill actually allow you to sell peoplelightning addresses, it handles all thepayments, it handles all the setup, andthey can set that up in such a way thatthey actually deposit into your lightningaddress on your node, which is so cool.Right?LndHub is another really cool feature.It allows you to access your LNbits walletfrom BlueWallet or Zeus, if you prefer theuser experience there, you can do that.Now here's another one that I didnot understand at all and had tohave explained to me, LNURLDevice isbasically an app that allows you tocreate offline lightning network devices,such as physical cash registers, pointof sales, ATMs, or whatever else,and those use an offline systemof verification pins that youknow, and which basically you'repiggybacking off the person's device.So they pay or they deposit, andthey give you a word and you knowwhat the word should be based onthe list that you've printed out,and basically without internet, youhave made a way to do a lightningnetwork ATM point of sale or whatever.Now, this is gonna be totallytransformational for the folksin Kwa-Meyi, Sterkspruit.Although they have mobile internet andsmartphones, sometimes that can be spotty,sometimes internet's not available,  andjust imagine that they can go and theycan sell their wares at the market andnot even need internet access to do it.By the way, one of those features thatI don't yet have, but which has alreadybeen released and will be updatedsoon is the bolt card extension, whichliterally allows you to make your veryown bolt credit card, a tap-to-pay NFCcredit card with limitations on it.All you need is an NFCchip and your phone.And if you wanna see me do a videowhere I create a 3D printed creditcard of my own and pay with it, letme know in the comments below, becauseI've been working on doing it, I justdon't know if anyone is interested inseeing it, but the feature has beenadded to LNbits, it is called Bolt.Another one that I didn'treally fully understand,and I had to re-record this part ofthe video a few times is LNURL Pay.LNURL Pay is very, very simple.It's like a lightning address.It allows you to put up a QRcode, but for lightning network.So one of the complaints that people haveabout lightning is that it's a little moreconfusing to have to generate an invoice,as opposed to onchain transactions whereI can just post a QR code and someonecan pay me, albeit that is a reallybad way to do it because of privacy.While LNURL Pay gives a QR codethat you can put up near the cashregister, put it on your shirt, putit on your business card, whateveryou want, and it will allow peopleto pay that link whenever they want,and you can specify different, uh,amounts, or you can just say, hey,here's my LNURL Pay scan this, youcould even embed it on your videosif you're a YouTuber, on your socialmedia, and people can pay you by justscanning a QR code, which is really,really cool and an awesome feature tohave set up so easily on your node.And what's also cool is because thisis done on sub-accounts, you can seehow much different sources or differentplaces, for example, if you put one onyour YouTube, one on your social media,one in your storefront, you can actuallysee which wallet they're coming into andtrack where the payments are coming from.All right.Let's talk about LNURL Withdraw becausethese are a little bit confusing,but they are so freaking cool.So LNURL Withdraw basically allowssomeone with a QR code or a string ofinformation to withdraw from your wallet.Now you might say, well,why would I wanna do that?Why would I wanna allowsomeone to do that?Well, first, if you have an app andyou wanna allow people to withdrawfrom your app, that's really cool.But also imagine a scenario in where youwant to reward people for doing something.For example, every person who comesinto my store today will get athousand Satoshis, and all you haveto do is put that QR code up andthey can then withdraw that amount.Now, I know what you're thinking.What, what limits are there here sothat I don't lose a lot of money?They can specify frequency, howmany times each person can useit, how often it can be used.So you can say it can only beused once every five minutes.You can specify an upper limit,a number of times per day.So there are, even a total amount ifyou want, and obviously this goes into asub-wallet, so that's another way to putcontrols and checks and balances here.So there are tons of ways that you canlimit this, but it's really, reallycool that you could print out vouchersfor people or give people your businesscard and say, hey, scan this and you'llget a thousand Satoshis or 10 Satoshis.You could put this on your livestreamand say, thanks for tuning in,here's a bunch of Satoshis.Really, really cool stuff.Really, really cool way to, uh,get people using lightning network.Another cool thing that you coulddo with LNURL Withdraw is say thateach person can only claim theircode once a month or once a year,and that's a really cool way toreward people for doing something ormaybe incentivize certain behaviors.All right.Offline shop.Really interesting is a coolway for people to receivepayments for products offline.It kind of works similar to the offlinedevice that I mentioned before, butoffline shop literally allows you tohave a system where people can pay, andbecause you know the code that's supposedto be generated and the word that's gonnabe generated if they make a successfulpayment with just a piece of paper,you can validate that payment was made,and that is just so cool, and thatis gonna be such a transformationalfeature for this project we're doing.Onchain wallet.If you want people to be able to pay youonchain in the features that I'm gonnaexplain a little later, such as TPOs, youcan do that and you can add your onchainwallet's xPub, meaning the public key,you can even sync it with yourhardware device or your $8 hardwaredevice that Ben has created, and itwill allow in the point of sale forpeople to choose similar to BTCPay,but a lot lighter and a lot simpler.It'll allow people to chooselightning network or onchainand then pay you onchain.That might not make sense yet, but whenwe get to the TPOs, it'll all make sense.Paywall, really, really cool.You can post a link and peoplehave to pay in order to getredirected to a link of content.If I wanted to, and I weren't doingYouTube memberships, which by the way,make sure to check out below becauseit helps support the channel and you'llget exclusive access, early accessto content, the ability to influencethe videos that I make next and more.But if I weren't doing that, I couldcreate a Paywall and people would haveto pay a certain amount of Satoshisto be redirected and find the link.Really cool.Sats Dice is pretty muchwhat you would think.It's the ability to offer gamblingwith odds that you can configure,however you want, right on your node,and people can earn Sats.It's basically you're running agambling ring right on your node.SatsPay Server.Okay, this is another one thatI totally did not understand,but basically it's like BTCPay.It allows you to generate an invoicefor people quickly and easily.If you're on the go or you're justsitting at your store and you want peopleto be able to pay you, you can createa new charge such as sweet potatoes.And this is again, similar to the invoice,but it's just, you can host it right thereand it's connected to the internet, unlikethe invoice, which is more of a PDF deal.Set it up, say a mil, uh,you know, a thousand Sats.You can connect it to a webhook, so itcan connect to your Zapier or whatever.Completed button URL canredirect, completed button text,and you can even allow onchain,as I demonstrated before, you canset it up so that people have theoption, if you connect your xPub forpaying you onchain, let's do that.And you can create a charge and youcan now share that link with someoneand allow them to pay you, and theycan pay right here on this hosted page.It's just a much easier way to givesomeone a clear understanding of whatthey're paying without setting up aheavy BTCPay installation which, I loveBTCPay, but it is a little heavy, uh,and a little kind of intense to set up.Scrub.All right, Scrub, really interesting.Scrub stands for self-custodialremittance something.And what Scrub does is allow youthat any payment that comes intoyour LNbits wallet can automaticallybe redirected to your other wallet.So say, uh, you wanna redirect it toWallet of Satoshi or say, for example,uh, you have your own node and you'rejust using someone else's LNbits,I don't know why you would do that,but you can do it, this allows youto automatically pull the paymentsand push them right out into theother wallet of your choosing.Split Payments is pretty cool.It allows you to split incomingpayments across wallets.So if you have some businesspartners in your store or yourjuice stand or whatever, you canautomatically split the paymentsso they go into differentwallets, right within LNbits.Really, really cool.You could also offer services where youtake a 1% fee, uh, if people get paid.Kind of a neat thing, uh, to set up andreally, really cool ways of, you know.If you wanna pay all your kidsequally, then you could set up onewallet, pay their allowance to thatone wallet, and it would split equallyto all their different wallets.Really cool.Spotify Jukebox is exactlywhat you would think.It's a jukebox that runs on Spotify andpeople can pay in lightening network toselect their song instead of old school,quarters and coins who uses these anymore.This was originally set up for barsthat are running the node locally, butyou could set this up as a livestream,if you're live streaming on Twitch,and people could pay to choosethe song that's gonna be on next,and I think that's really awesome.Stream Alerts is a little bit ofan outdated one, which has to dowith people paying you on Twitch.Ben wasn't sure if it works or not, sodon't worry about that because we haveStreamer Copilot and Streamer Copilotallows you to create QR codes, embedthose QR codes right into livestreams,and when someone pays that QR code it doesa cool little animation on this screen.I'm gonna try that out pretty soon.Let me know when the comments below ifyou'd like to see me do a livestreamwhere I try this out, and we seehow it actually works 'cause I thinkthat is so cool to be able to havean automated, this stuff is so coolyou guys.Subdomains.All right.We talked about selling lightningaddresses, what about sellingsubdomains of your domain?Let's say you have areally, really cool domain.You wanna sell subdomainsfor it, you can do that here.I think most of you are probably notgonna be in the domain selling business,but it's pretty cool to be able tosell subdomains on your domain if youhave a really, really cool domain.Support Tickets is exactlywhat you would think.It allows you to set up a full-fledgedsupport ticket system on your node,and people can pay in lightningif they wanna submit a ticket.Really awesome.Tip Jar.All right.This is the one that I think most of youare going, gonna want to use the most.Tip Jar enables you to accept Bitcointips very, very easily unlike some ofthe other solutions that are out there.Uh, and if people don't know how touse a lightning address or their walletdoesn't support lightning address,this is gonna be a whole lot easier.You can select the wallet that you want.You can allow chain if you want, anddonatee name we can just put this, andthe webhook URL if you wanna send itto a Zapier or IFTTT, and that's it.You can create that Tip Jar, and thatis set up and you can send this link topeople, put it on your website, put itin your social media, people click it,and what's cool about this, thatlightning address doesn't alwaysoffer or usually doesn't offer, ispeople can give it a message here.I love getting all of your lightningnetwork tips, but I don't know whothey're from and I don't know whyyou're sending it to me most of thetime, unless you send it on Alby.So it's really cool to be able to givepeople this link, and I think once Ihave this set up on the clear web I'mjust gonna give this link, 'cause I wannaknow who to thank in the next video.So, uh, if you do tip me, you cantip me on Alby and if you say who youare, well, thank you and I will do mybest to thank you on the social media.All right.Oh my God.This video is getting really, really long.I'm sorry.I hope you're skipping with thechapters below, but let's keep going.Almost done here.And we're getting to the, what I think isreally the coolest one, and this is TPoS.It is a shareable point of saleterminal that anyone and everyone whohas a account on your node can use.It's kind of like Breeze oreven BTCPay has a POS terminal,point of sale terminal,but this is like dead simpleand really, really easy.I can set up a new TPoSright, and let's just say,Kwa-Meyi Sterkspruit, I'm quitesure I'm misspelling that.I'm sorry guys.And the wallet, we can select anyof the wallets that we've set up.I only have this one wallet, let'ssay USD, and the tip wallet ifthey wanna leave a tip, and wecan put the options 5%, 10%, 20%,whatever, and we create that TPoS.And now this is a hostedPOS that I can pop up,like if I'm a store I can usethis on the local network.I don't even need toconnect to the clear web.I don't need to use Tor.And this is it, this is my cash register.I can even make it pretty, styleit like this, and this is it.I mean, I can put in an amount, I need3,500 or let's say $3.50, hit okay,and that's it.Now, you all see thislittle icon down here?Really cool, right?That icon is NFC, and NFC will work ifyou are using this wallet on a smartdevice, such as your iPhone or Android.So switching over here and recordingthe screen, you can see how.All I have to do, if I want to become alightning-friendly merchant, is I go here,I go to my TPoS,and just like that, without downloadingan app, without setting anythingup, without running my own node,I can set up a POS just like this.I have it.Here's my TPoS.And watch this, $25.It gives me the invoice.And now if someone has, apparently theNFC isn't working on my iPhone, butif someone has a lightning credit cardor they have an NFC-enabled wallet orsmartphone, we can just tap to pay,and that's it.Of course we could scan the QR code, oldschool style, and that works, but on manydevices and I think on Android, I thinkmy iPhone's just not allowing permissionto the NFC chip,  you can actually havetapped to pay between people on your node.So those are the many,many features of LNbits.I really hope I didn't lose youguys along the way on this video.I would love to know in the commentsbelow, what features do you think aregonna be the most impactful for you?What features would you like to see?I'm sure that the LNbits team is goingto see this video and read the comments.And I wanna remind you of courseto like and subscribe.Still about 70% of you are not subscribedto this channel, and it really doesmake a huge difference if you reallywanna support the channel, and youwanna see me make even more videos, goahead and check out our memberships soyou can get access to exclusive contentand direct access to me for problemsolving, troubleshooting, and more.Thanks for watching, andI'll see you guys next time.",
