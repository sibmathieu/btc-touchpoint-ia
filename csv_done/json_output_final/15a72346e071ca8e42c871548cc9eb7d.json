youhave the larger anonymity set than I do[ __ ] sake I was gonna be in Disguisemy name is Ben actually my name is Benoh[ __ ] that shit's too hot I don't know heyou and Gigi do thisoh manhow are you brother I'm doing reallyreally good thank you thank you forhaving me I'm a big big fan of your showso it's greatgreat to be here well thank you forcoming to Bedford cool you're uh you gotto be the uh first Bitcoin who came tomy bar yes I was at your bar and I wishyou a lot of success with it I thinkit's gonna be a success story I hope soI hope so I hope so rightum oh and you're coming to the footballtoday as well I forgot even about thatyou're basically going full Bedford fullprogram I saw most of Bradford today I'mgonna see the football match today whereyou're gonna winright wow so yes we're gonna win yeahbut I don't know if we'll win the leaguetoday but if we win we've kind of wonthe league it's very step by step stepby step so listen Ben Ark is a huge fanof yours we're uh we're big fans of BenBen's been on the show how many timesnow two three guys twice yeah he'scoming down to bed for forever next weekhe's like dude you gotta get you gottaget Kelly on the show that is so coolI'm I'm also a big fan of Ben myself heis basically my mentor in a sensehe's such a he's such a nice guy as wellhe's like a nice bitcoiner yeahabsolutely and so I got involved withBen because I started contributing toAlan bits a lot the project that he'sworking on and at some point he justasked me to join the team basically andwe started working togetherBen is really like in the beginning heheld my hands showed me a little bit howto you know how to get involved andprobably the reason why I'm sitting heretoday so I'm very very grateful he's anamazing personI agree I think he's an amazing personoh God I sound so deep the voice todaysound like Matthew majinski I wasn't inthe face I'm trying to go down as wellcan you hear that pleaseum uh so we also yesterday we hadum phobia with us uh from fetty mint anduh we got you out together last nightwhat a coincidence no fights no nofights at all no we had an amazingconversation actually I'm very friendlywith with the guys from famousespecially uh Eric uh known himum before I met Obi as well Eric isactually the person who uh ecash told meso I I also my Thanks goes to him he heearned a lot of respect in the communityfor that so he taught me what ecash isand that's the reason why I startedlooking into it and made thisalternative project cashew which uhtogether with fediment are the I thinkthe hottest ecash projects out there I'mvery happy that these projects are onbitcoin and not on any other kind ofsystem well let's get into that let's Imean there's so many things we couldtalk about with you today I know Dannytalked to you about all kinds of [ __ ]last night he's like Pete we could makethree shows for Kelly todayum but let's talk about ecash that's uhpertinent to bitcoin is right now uh bigup to David charm a bit of a bit of alegend in the digital currency spaceyeah absolutely I actually got to meethim in London a couple years ago oh uhwhere did that go that was good reallyinteresting uh I met a guy who was aperiod of reflectionum but uh just it was just incredible tobe with such a prominent person in theuh I would call him a bitcoiner reallybecause even though he worked onprojects previous to bitcoin obviouslyhe inspired the work he's uh cited inthe white paper you know he nearlycreated bitcoin maybe you know he nearlydid and as far as I know he doesn't likeBitcoin that much today I I couldn'tappoint a self-reflection and I I thinkhis dislike for Bitcoin is probably notdisliking Bitcoin it's more uhif there was another Bedford team thatcame up behind us and were reallysuccessful and it was great for the townI would probably struggle to enjoy itbecause it wasn't the one I didyeah maybe I I hope if he knows aboutcashew that he would be just proud tosee that his ideas are flourishing todayso he's he's should we just go into howhow it all started with him yeah pleasedo yeah so uh David charm is thisum legendary cryptographer and he hepublished this paper in 1982 so it's wayway before anything with Bitcoin it'sactually the first cryptocurrency likehistorically speaking is the firstcryptocurrency invented before you wereborn before way beforeI was a little boy I was just about tostart school so yeah and they had thisidea and it was way before also theinternet became a thing really right soum it was called you know makingsomething like making a payment systemwith blind signatures and what thisbasically allows you is to create anelectronic cash system that is perfectlyprivate uh it is not a decentralizedsystem like Bitcoin is it is more likehow to build a bank that's that's theway they thought about it before becausethere was no other way thinking about ithow to make a bank that doesn't know whoyou are how much you have and who you'retransacting with which is a completelyrevolutionary ideaand so that was 1982 and this idea justfloated around I guess for almost adecade and then they started thiscompany called digicash digicash is wellknown for its attempt to bring ecash tothe world well you say it's well now andsome people here won't realize thehistory of the project or why it failedso maybe you should tell a little bitYeah so I think digicash itself it had acouple of products I think the mostsuccessful one was uh toll booths so uhyou know you would have some kind of acard that you could use to drive throughthe toll booth and just pay anonymouslyso that was the idea I think that wasalso the cash cow for the company butthere were many other uh businessopportunities for digicash for examplelike the stories are crazy Microsoftapproached them to us you know theywanted to put in ecash wallet into everyWindows 95 copy just imagine that yeahthere was before before credit cards onthe internet took off that was beforepay people was there it was they almostput it into every home computer on theplanet just a bit before every uh homeMac had a copy of the Bitcoin whitepaper put on it yeah exactly yeah beforethat yeah exactly so um but that thatdeal never went anywhere so it probablyand that's when you when you startresearching it it's because DavidCharmed and just changed the terms ofthe contract and wanted more thanMicrosoft was able to giveuh that was Microsoft Visa alsoapproached him or them and wanted tobuild it into their payment system tomake a completely Anonymous paymentsystem probably an alternative to payingwith credit cards today on the internetalso didn't go anywhere so these arejust one two examples and there are acouple more where ecash could havebecome a de facto standard of how we payon the internet before any of thesepayment processors even came about butit didn't didn't happen probably andthat's again when you start researchingit it's about David Shaw I'm not notreally agreeing to the terms of these ofthese companies so yeah PayPal campscomes credit cards come now we have themand so total [ __ ] show everyone knowsexactly what you're doing you can becensored you know your accounts arebeing closed at a win and your creditcards are insanely bad you basicallyenter your private Keys every time youmake transaction into a website justimagine that you give the website theability to take all your money just formaking a 150 dollar payment or somethingso the state of payments on the Internetis absolutely bad and then no nothinghappened we just have these Legacypayment rails ecash is dead for 20 30years no one cares about it untilBitcoin comes about and with Bitcoin Ithink it kind of refreshed interest foryou know going back looking at these atthese Technologies yeah and David Chamis it was it was and is a huge advocateof privacy always discussed how is oneof the fundamental pillars of democracywithout privacy you don't have democracyand Bitcoin has a interestingprivacy story in that if you're smartenough if you're Cali or you're MattOdell you probably you know maxillabrand you understand privacy youunderstand the mistakes you can make butI would say from 99 of Bitcoin isthey're going to make a mistake andthey're going to give up their privacyand I think real privacy will come tobitcoin when it's taken out the hands ofthe user to actually figure it out itjust comes inherently and so myunderstanding of ecash is that it kindof does a lot of that for you yeah so abig disclaimer here because I don't wantanyone to confuse this ecash is acustodial system so it's a way to makecustodial apps like wallet of Satoshiand I'll just let's take what it doesSatoshi for the example because everyoneknows what it is to make something likewallet of Satoshi in a way that itdoesn't know what you're doing with allthese privacy benefits so it is you knowit could be as easy as using walletSatoshi but you don't hold your Bitcoinuh but I agree with you I think privacycan only win if it happens on a veryvery large scale that's basically youknow the requirement for privacy is thatyour anonymity set is large enough andas long as it is so easy to [ __ ] up yourprivacy in Bitcoin it's not really youknow useful for everyday folks I thinkthis is very important actually and alsothe reason why I'm working on this is tomake it kind of a defaultthere's been a lot of criticism recentlyfor the state of uh of custodial walletswithin lightning in that the majority ofpeople are using custodial walletsespecially some Nostra people are usingsomething like the Wallace of Satoshi Iused to use blue wallet I have a rangeof wallets I use now but custodialSolutions are a lot easier than runningyour own lightning notes significantlyeasier as uh significantly less frictionum is that something we should beworried about and I'm going to tee thatby saying I don't worry about it becausethe Majora the vast majority of myBitcoinis base chain Bitcoin I keep a verysmall amount uh in a custodial lightningwallet an amount where if I lost itwould be annoying but I wouldn't care abit like if I lose my money on my cashin my pocket on a night out it'sannoying but it does it's something thatsignificantly changed my life how do youfeel about the whole custodial versusnon-custodial uh I see it very similarlyso no one should store their theirwealth in a custodial service you justyou know we we should work all togetherto to explain it to everyone the walletof Satoshi is not your real Bitcoin youdon't hold the keys you can lose it andthe value proposition of Bitcoin itselfthat you're the sole cust you're thesole owner of your Bitcoin you have fullcontrol and sovereignty absolutely butstill I agree with you that custodialServices just it's de facto it's beingused not because people are stupid butbecause it gives them some certain valuethat other wallets cannot give it givethem so for example lightning addresslightning typical example that that issupported by many many custodial walletsbut not so much by non-costalia onesgetting tips on on Twitter just uh onNoster you you cannot you know you wouldhave to run your own server somewhere inyour basement to be able to receive tipswhile you're you know offline basicallyand that's why custodial services areused now the way I approach this youknow it could be formulated as a problemI just the way I approach this is thisis a realitythe biggest used the most used lightningwallet today is wallet of Satoshi nowwhat I'm proposing with cashew or withecash General generally is to justimprove the privacy of these users thatalready opted in for something like thatand they kind of they use they're kindof their their reasons why they want touse it I don't want to judge that but ifthey do and if we have a way to improvetheir privacy without any you knowdecrementing their user experiencethen we should do it okay cool okay solet's talk about ecash explain to mewhat ecash is and how it works and youknow where is it within the Bitcoinstack yeah so ecash is completelyseparate from Bitcoinyeah it works very very differently Ithink for bitcoiners it's a very uhAlien concept because what we are usedto is we have a blockchain that issomewhere in The Ether and you hold yourkeys on your wallet and then you make atransaction and you publish it to thisblockchain and then it gets getsrecorded in the blockchain right soecash works completely differently andwith ecash you basically hold not thekeys to your money but the money itselfand is represented as a piece ofelectronic data so it is you know I Itold Danny the story yesterday it is howI imagined Bitcoin to be when I firstheard about Bitcoin wrongly because itwasn't explained well to me but when Ifirst heard about Bitcoin I thought heywell that's that sounds like a torrentfor money it's a network of computerssharing some something and what Iimagined was that you hold kind of themoney in your hard drive and then whenyou want to pay something you take apiece of it and send it over a wire justyou know like you would send someonecache through an envelope for example uhbut yeah I was corrected that's not howBitcoin Works Bitcoin is the signing ona blockchain etc but that's actually howe-cache Works which is fine because Irediscovered this idea when when Idiscovered rediscovered ecash so ecashis a piece of electronic data that youhold on your device like your phone forexample that represents the money thatuh could be something on your Satoshiaccount and then you send it throughtelegram through email through someencrypted Channel or whatever to someoneelse and then so you're sending them apiece of data and then they hold thatpiece of data and that's the money yesexactly so that's why that thingyesterday with ob showed us with youwere able to send it hopefully offlineyeah so last night Cali did an examplewhich maybe at some point in the showyou should do for Pete you should sendhim some so just do it now how do I doit yeah we can do it I don't have myphone with it though there you go whatdo I needso you can send do I need to downloadsomething no you can send him the e-cashthat you sent me last night all right soall right let's do thisyou open your Safari browser and you goto cashew dot me that is one cachewallet there multiple cache walletscashier.me uh just disclaimer foreveryone listening don't put your moneyin there it's just for experimentationthis is still in development but I'mgoing to show you how your cash workshere so I have one SEC sorry I just needto go do I need to do receive e-cashum not yet so first you know it's a pushsystem it's in uh you know it doesn'twork like the lightning where you pull apayment I need to push your money overso I have now Dennis found there are a1024 satoshi's on there I'm gonna presssend ecash and just enter an amountlet's say 64 64 satoshi'ssend tokens so um Let's do let's do theuh the messenger way yeah you can opentelegram and send it to people I'm gonnalook so I get this random string nowthis is the money so I'm going to copythis just a normal copyI'm going now to Telegram and let's seeif I can I'm scrolling through this isuncomfortable for me but here we go Ifound you and now I just paste ityou just received a message I think yeahwith this random looking string you copythat that is the moneycopy thatand then you go to your to your cashierwallet and you say receive e-cash andpaste it in receivepasteah there we go it's gone that was itthat's that's really quick really coolvery cool zero Satoshi for you no tracesleft no one knows what just happenedand no there's no sending to anotherperson so there's no connection okay ithappened off bent we just send it to youthrough Telegramand so the the code I put in knowshow does that know what amount of moneythat is is that just an encrypted amountof moneyum so it's been signed by the server soI can I can explain centralization rightyes exactly so uh for for anyonelistening who might now wonder why can'tI just copy paste this money and send itto other people as well right so how doyou suppose yeah and that is theinvention of e-cash how it works is thatin order to complete the transactionwhat I just did I took my e-cash fromthe hard drive I sent it over to you andwhat you did upon receiving you justsend it to the server and said here are64 satoshi's burn them and give me a newone and yeah that burns it's invalidatedit cannot be double spent anymore butthe key point is here this ecash what Ijust sent you cannot be correlated towhat you sent back to the server sothat's the Privacy the server doesn'tknow that when it receives ecash fromyou to be recycled it doesn't know thatit's the same ecash that it gave mebeforethat's a blind signature thing I canactually there's a beautiful example onhow to imagine this how it works if youlike I just give you this example it's aphysical example andsoimagine you have a let's say a bankaccount right you have um and you wantto get ecash from your bank account andwhat you would do is you take the youtake a contract you write a contract onwhich it says Bank you owe me one BTCright if I get one BTC uh it says on acontract now you take the contract andyou put it into an envelope that is madeof carbon paper you know carbon paper isthe one where you're right on top of itpress it through right so you take anenvelope made of carbon paper and youput your contract inside that envelopeyou close it right and then you send theenvelope the closed one to the bank tothe mint we say and then mint says okayyou want to have a signature on theresend me one Bitcoin you send one Bitcointo the mint and the Min says okay yousend me Bitcoin and takes a pen andsigns it on the outside of this envelopeso on the closed envelope it makes thesignature and sends you back theenvelope now because this wasn't realpaper it was actually encryption you'rethe only one who can open the envelopeagain when you open the envelope whatyou get is a contract that you'vewrittenon which it says you're only one Bitcoinwith the signature of the mint but thekey point is that the mint has neverseen the contract this is a blindsignatureso when you can now this is the moneythe contract is the money you can nowsend me this contract via telegram forexample and I can take it and I can goto the mint and say hey mintyou know pay me one Bitcoin out andhere's the proof that I deserve itand then the mint will see this contractand say well I've never seen thiscontract before but I can see mysignature on there so I must honor thisI choose to honor this there is no wayto make sure that they will honor it butif they're if they're uh you know ifthey're honest and they they would butthe key point is they don't know thatthis contract would what I give them isthe contract that you made them to signokay that's how it works it's very coolvery cool um so the e-clash protocolthere's an e-catch protocol or is therea cashew protocol which is animplementation of Eco yeah ecash is amechanismum and cashew is a protocol to implementthat and so there would no be therewouldn't be any interoperinteroperability between say uh cashewand fediment no although they have verysimilar uh way of working it's not butthere's interoperability because it's aprotocol that there's interoperabilityacross casual wallets this is just onewallet that I showed you there like fourdifferent wallets so essentially we havethis uh blossoming ecosystem where wehave our base chain Bitcoin we have ourlightning whether it's custodial ornon-custodial we have liquid we havefedi mint we have cashew like a wholevariety of ways to now start using yourBitcoin elsewhere and in different waysyes absolutely yeah I've got a questionon that so you just sent 64 SATs youcould do that through lightningreasonably privately like why why shouldpeople care about cash so you can dothat about lightning and you should alsodo that about with lightningnon-custodially if you can and if youhave the ability and everything goesokay but there are a couple of problemswith that already first of all right nowwe don't have receiver privacy forlightning yet so if I pay you the 64sets and you make an invoice on yournote I know exactly what you notice andI can infer your balances and so on solightning has privacy issues on thereceiver side send aside it's excellentprivacy so you you have that and theother thing with lightning is that it isnot fully reliable yet so once you startstreaming sets for example you want tomake a payment every 10 seconds it'svery likely that one of these paymentswill get stuck and in the worst case youwill have to wait two weeks until youcan get it back so that's just howlightning works it's you know sendingthis hdlc across different nodes and ifone of them goes just offline in themeantime then you wait so althoughlightning is great and I urge people tolook into how to use it non-custodiallythere it doesn't cover all the differentways of how to use Bitcoin and withecash you can you know start doingthings that you cannot do with lightningfor example I could just put this ecashinto a data package from let's say Idon't know uh I want to make uh I wantto stream a video on Netflix right Icould I could design a Netflix where youdon't pay a monthly fee but you top upyour e-cash balance so you downloade-cash from Netflix by paying withBitcoin for example and then you justfor every minute that you want to streamyou just send them a bit of e-cash andthey can just see okay this is ecash Iissued this this person has the right toreceive one minute of video and you canjust keep on doing that with the kickwith the twist that they don't know whoyou are you don't even need an accounton Netflix in that model you just buythe tokens and then you spend them asyou as you use it and if you don't wantthem anymore you say please it out againon bitcoin on lightning or whatever yousend them the tokens they burn it andgive you back your Bitcoin that they oweyouvery cool so how far away is cashew frombeing uh live and able we're able to useit in a live environment so what we justdid was using it in a light environmentyes but you said uh you said it's uhbeta did you so cashier isum not even half a year old that Istarted working on this and a couple ofpeople who joined working on this withme so we're very very young but it's outthere you can try it and you canimplement it that's that's even waybetter than just you know trying it outthere if there are developers out thereso they're actual sets this isn't uh theactual real sets this is actual realecash that you can exchange for actualreal sets on Lightning see I always findthis use of the I was talking to Obiabout this e-cash term uh a distractionI think it's it misleads people intothinking they're using something elseand I know it's not actual SATs it's arepresentation of sets yeah but it saysokay then to me I agree with you I agreewith you becauseum it makes it makes it way easier to totalk about it and to imagine it but Ihaven't created a wallet here like Ihaven't signed up there is no there isno user accounts there are no wallets sobasically the server doesn't even knowthat you exist the server just said uhsomeone paid this lightning invoice I'mgonna give them ecash but if I lose thisphone then the money is gone oh okaythere's a way to back it up though thereis a way there's a way to back it up anduh we're also working on better ways toback it up so if Pete tried to send thatto me to like a moon wallet now wouldthat work yeah that would work reallyyeah what you do is you create aninvoice on your moon wallet and then youask the mint to pay the invoice for youand for that you have to give them thesetwo videos I want to see this okay buthow does how does thiswallet no it's made is it is there someis it an ID in my phone no but how do soif I close this browser and come backwill it still know those 64 cents itwill be stored in your browser browserdata there and that's it but it's likecash like when you make a cashtransaction no one knows who you areright pay invoice so I've got a 64invoice I'll make it a bit less becausethere will be fees yeahall right do 50 Cent invoicethere we goMoon Moon is notoriously slowis paying anyone listening to pay hisword holy [ __ ] that's [ __ ] cool thatis really cool okay what you just didthere is you burned ecash and you saidyou told them and please pay thisinvoice for me the mint doesn't have aconcept of you it doesn't know thatyou're one person or whatever and thelightning invoice that you just paidcannot be correlated back to any personso basically it's a pool of money youput it in and someone takes it out againcan he send me sets from my from hisMoon model into my e-cash wallet yes anddoes it and it's at the reverse yes itburns them and turns them into exactlyokay I wantjust because I'm me I want an app orsomething that I knowthat if I lose my phone I still got it Iwant I feelit's weird just going to a browser yeahbut Cali put the browser to my homescreen now so I have like a cashier uphere okay it's effectively in that butyou're using it is a browser I need aback I need a backup yes yeah yeahyou'll have just a seat phrase thathelps you to restore your cash it's notit looks like a Bitcoin seed phrase butit's not really the same thing but justby storing a seed phrase you'll be ableto just restore your ecash in case youlose the device and the Beautiful thebeautiful thing about it it's so simplelike money in that all it does is thatyou send it and receive it that's what Ineed to that's all I need that's that'sall you need from my pocketliterally my pocket does the same I haveit stores the money I have and I eithergive it or receive it and if you lose itit's gone yeah yeahit's so beautifully simple yes it is andso what we're looking at these walletsI've built I've built this for people tobe able to imagine what ecash is butthat is not really the goal for me withcashew itself cashew is supposed to be aprotocol it is already a protocol thereis a spec out there you can read it youcan start building stuff on it what Iimagine is that you know there will beand there are hundreds and thousands ofweb services out there who will you knowjust give you some service for yourBitcoin your website I don't know youwant to read news payroll news forexample then you top up your balance andthen you start reading the news and theproblem with that is the website thatallows you to do that can track exactlywhat you're reading because it knows itit's related to this one payment thatyou did they need to do it that's howthat's how custodial Services work yeahso uh cashew is basically a drop inreplacement you can almost all of thecustodial Services I know of today youcan take out this classical all databaseLedger where it says you have this andthis much money and whatever you canreplace it with the cache protocol andbuild something that has the samefunctionality but with this improvedprivacy for example you're you're miningright I am mining you have a you have aminer in a pool every Miner in a pool isa user of a custodial service right theyhave your Bitcoin and they send it outto you regularly when you join so thispool knows exactly how much you minethey know how much you earned yeah thatand they send it out on a daily basisyes you can do that with ecash and theydon't they don't know anything about ityeah I also wonder I've always wonderedon that because they paid on a dailybasis how much money is being wasted infees having a daily payout on my bit myI hope they're batching theirtransactions I don't know yeah no ideaum okay very cool how do you differ fromfediment so ferment is an excellentprojectum you know people also should look intothat cashier is not really trying tocompete with thatum rather as far as I understand I'm Imean I I don't want to talk too muchabout other people's projects theyshould do it but as far as I understandfediment's approach is more aboutCommunity custody so what they focus onand this is Eric's work and it'sexcellent like I'm a big fan of his workand they focus on this Federated aspectso you have multiple custodiansbasically they all share the keys to themulti-sick where the Bitcoin is storedand what we just did basically they doit with not only one mint like there isnot only one party controlling the mintbut there are end parties controllingthe mint which makes things a bit morecomplicated to build and to integratebut it gives you the increased risk adecreased risk of getting Rapportbasically you would have multiple peoplehave to collude in order to take awayyour your Bitcoin your real Bitcoin thatyou deposit it there so I guess that isthat is the fundamental differencebetween sediment and cashew but apartfrom that they as far as I can see usethe overall same concept yeah so they'resolving uh multisig for communitiesthey're becoming almost like a CommunityBank you're someone's pocket full ofcash yes and uh I I can see cashew justtaking over the entire web becauseso not only a package not only the cashin your pocket but every website thatyou use that has some kind of a balanceyou can use cashew and that will be it'svery easy to implement we just made itvery easy to implement again I can alsothink about like when we run ourconference Next Year everyone having acashew app and that being the paymentsystem for at the conference whereyou're buying tickets buying merchandisebuying beers it'd be like a I wasthinking about it with regards to verymint you could have a short-termFederation I can think of these usecases for everyone come to theconference has privacy at the event forall their interactions with each otherand it works kind of offline so youcould do it on a conference where youknow internet connectivity is bad forexample you can just use casualinternally because you have themidsomber listening to everyone anddoing these transactions and when youexit the conference again you go to thecounter and you say I want my Bitcoinback you give them your e-cash they giveyou a bigger Bitcoin I really like it itdoesn't make it doesn't make you anymoney doing it though there's noservices on there absolutely not this isa protocol and we're writing a protocolthat people can use to build stuff on II'm not you know I'm not running acustodial service or whatever I'mworking on this uh this this idea whoruns the mintum you can run a mint today there aremultiple mints uh there is an Ellen bitsplugin an extension that you can youknow when you install Olympics it givesyou this ability to do many manydifferent things with your lightningwallet one of the things that you can dois just three clicks literally andyou're you're running mint so if youwant to run a mint for your bar or yourcommunity or your website uh it's veryvery easy to set up you just need alightning node in the back end that doesthe lightning stuff and use one of thesewallets that we've writtenand is there an issue like a regulatoryissue for the whoever's running them inum I don't know I don't careI love it good answer why don't you whydon't you care it's not my business Idon't know I mean the world is Big thereare many different places out there youcan do stuff here but you cannot do itthere I mean why would I care peopleshould do whatever they think is best[ __ ] yes okay uhwhat criticism have you received anycriticism yesum definitely so first of all uh toavoid criticism and because I'm a realbitcoiner and I know what the value ofof holding your own Keys is okay I sayit again cash is a custodial servicedon't use it if you don't want to usecustodial services that is the mainpoint of criticism because people kindof assume uh that anything that iscustodial is bad per se I can understandthat they shouldn't touch what it doesSatoshi either right I'm just proposingthis strict Improvement on privacy onthings like well it is Satoshi thenthere are multiple other problems withcustodial Services themselves thatcashew also inherits for example it'shard to prove that you don't inflate thesupply so how do you know that ae-cashment didn't print more e-cash thanit has in Bitcoin reserves right it's akind of Unsolved problem we're literallyworking on it right now and there arepromising ways to do that but unsolvedbut solvable oh uh theoreticallyunsolved yet so there's no one I thinkout there who really knows how to do ityet but we're very close at it I hopewe'll do it so the moment that we knowhow to do it theoretically we will buildit practically but at the same time noone knows the same thing about what itis Satoshi you don't know if they holdthe Bitcoin that they say that they owedit to their customers that's very that'svery true it's the same problemcould youinstantlyum could you instantly burn all SATsreceived into lightning yes andtherefore you would at least knowif the ecash you receive is real becauseit they would I assume there's someerror when you send it toa lightning wallet there would be anerror if if they weren't real exactlythis is this is where the ideas actuallygo through this is a very fun funny thatyou actually follow this path becausethis is the way that you could try toimprove these Services have some kind ofan Epoch like a regular window timewindow where the supply has to be provenbasically publicly reserves kind of thatyou own the Bitcoin basically by cyclingit around in a you know uh in regularintervals basically you could do thatand once that doesn't work anymoreeveryone would know that there issomething fishy going on with the mintso in that regard you need to trust themand also I mean we've been talking aboutthis yesterday I'm not a big uh I don'tknow much about the Free banking ideasthat some Bitcoin is really know a lotmore about it and I think you've beenalso talking to people who who do but uhwe covered it yesterday with Matthewmajinski he's a huge fan of the the eraFree banking yeah exactly and there area couple of bit I'm learning from themas as we're building this uh thisprotocol uh which you know there's theidea that having a Level Playing Fieldwhere you can uh you allow uh differentmeans to pop up and offer these Servicesthe idea is that in in a world wherecompetition is free you would see anincrease of efficiency so uh the naturalselection would basically get rid of thebad guys and the good guys would remainthe ones with the lowest fees and thehighest Trust basically that they haveand once you allow them to do to dothese things if you don't I mean this isthe system that we live in today if youwant to you know become a bank or acustodian you have to jump through allthese hoops and you're not allowed tocompete freely basically in the marketand if you [ __ ] up you get bailed out soyou're allowed to take riskor I I've um I I positioned it toMatthew that I said well we do have freebanking at the moment actually we do wehave it with Bitcoin that is actuallyFree banking yeah this is why people areexcited about this exactly that's thereason because now we have thefundamental this is also the reason whyI think ecash is coming back now becauseit needed big Bitcoin ecash is almostworth nothing if you don't have a freeSovereign monetary layer below it basemoney yeah you need to base money and wefound the base money of the internet sowe needed Bitcoin uh we needed Bitcoinin order for these ideas to come backI'm very convinced of that imaginebuilding something like that like withfull privacy on the Fiat rails we werejoking about this yesterday I mean it'sbasically you know you go to jailstraight to jail basically I could offerthe same service with my bank accountright have the Euros flow in and thenissue ecash to my friends so they canuse my bank account uh privatelybasically but once you start doing thatit's game over so no one will no one isinterested in giving you privacy in theFiat world it's just not not only youknow it's possible but no one would doit no one would dare do it and withBitcoinwe don't ask for permission we justbuilt on top of it and this is why youcan see these things pop up again andevery wallet service built on top of uhcashew so for example the one I've JustSeen on my phone is that have a separatemint is it one mint per service or canthere be multiple mints no there can bemultiple mints and all of the walletsthat are there today can use multiplemints so basically what you can imagineis you have this this app on your phoneand it's connected to many manydifferent mints you have ecash fromdifferent mints and once you want tomake a payment from you know you'reyou're the customer of mint one I'm thecustomer of mint 2 how do I pay you isthe answer to that is lightninglightning connects all the minutesbasically it's like a connecting tissuebetween them it's the clearing layerbetween mints basically they use Bitcoinfor their intermittent clearing that'swhat they do intimate clearing um sowhat is the incentive to set up a mintwhy would somebody do itum to I mean what is the incentive torun a wallet like well it's a Satoshiwell I've seen where the people operatewhatever Satoshi make a small amount offees yes that's probably what they doand this is what you could do also withthe cashew mint oh so so there'll beoptional feesthis is a it's a business question thatsomeone has to figure out I mean uh Ilove how you answer your questionsyeah I mean it's it's not directlyrelated to the technique itself rightit's possible so that to give you theanswer yes that could be but you couldalso offer it for free what we just usedwas for free you're basically ananarchist without being annoying whichis which I quite likethat can be annoying if you like I don'tI don't imagine you can be okay so couldI so could I build a cbdcholy [ __ ] soum there is a project called gnu tallerit is a Swiss project it's a researchproject LED in Switzerland but it'sacross Europe people are researching itin different universities it's calledglutala and it's I think with fedimentand cashew the third ecash project thatis significant on the planet so gnuTaylor is an attempt to build an ecashsystem for Fiat and they actuallyapplied for the ecbs uh you know how doyou say when when they're looking forsolutions for cbdc Nutella is one of theapplicants and so they applied on theirtender yeah so uh in the PrivacyCommunity I think it's it's fair to saythat amongst all the different cbdcproposals that there are the ecash oneis the least worst so that is the onethat people would prefer if we if we geta cbdc I'm a very big you know I'm verymuch against cbdc's themselves but it isfair to say that if we have to get onewe should probably get an e-cash one anduh glue Nutella is applying for that buthere's a Twist they kind of [ __ ] upthe protocol because they need to makeit compliant with the regulations uhwhile in cashier you have perfectprivacy for you and me for the receiverand the sender in Nutella they built aback door for the receiver so the statecan still text the the uh the the Idon't know the business or whateverreceiving money so what they offer isperfect privacy for the sender you as acustomer but no privacy for the receiverfor example the merchant but as asolution that's way better than thesystem we have right now it is waybetter than than these normal you knowdatabase entries where it says this saysDanny's money yes so your bank accountis is definitely worse than what Nutellawould dothat's quite cool they're never gonnaallow it now exactly this is also my myview they're not gonna allow it I thisis my I would bet that and I think likethey would probably take uh the proposalof a very large bank that has theresources and doesn't care about privacyyes okay obviously privacy is hugelyimportant to youum you're um an orange faced sunglasswearing this is something like thatwe're in uh individualum but how much can you tell me how muchcan you tell me about your background interms ofwhat are the triggers to get you towhere you've become how you've becomewho you are somebody you know we'vespent 24 hours with you now understand alot more about what you care about whatyou don't care about your you care aboutprivacy uh you care about free marketsbut you're very practical about it allas well you're not uh I don't feel likeyou're ideologically driven you're justuh almostyou've almost driven by uh fairness andproper incentivessounds about right so like what late howdid what led you to herewell I'm I'm uh I'm a child of theinternet andum I've been I've been around on theinternet for a long time and I've cycledthrough identities over and over and Ithink it's a very good thing to do onthe internet because you just openyourself up to toto the world basically and you leave atrace whatever you do I mean all myposts from back in the years or whateverthey're still there so for me that isimportant because I spent much a lot oftime there I need to just assure thatyou know I I keep my secrets that I wantto keep and share with friends that Iwant to share them withum but I'mI'm also a bitcoiner and I think thatBitcoin is extremely important uh forfor the freedom of of humans I think youknow governments come and go ideologiescome and go and but Bitcoin itself issomething that will probably outlivethese cycles of you know groupaffiliation and trying to impose yourviews onto someone else I think it'sit's a technology that we need toprotect andthe most important thing that we can dois to assure that everyone who wants toparticipate in it will be safe so thatmeans uh we they can they can stayprivate if they want to that everyone isinvited to join we need to be able towelcome every developer in Bitcoin Ithink it's literally the lifeline ofBitcoin is education and development andI think the education part is goinggreat I think on the development side wecan do a lot better to to increase treesto make better incentives for people tojoin this this community basically andstart working on it what do you think ofthe loss of developers over the lastyear or so is that concerning youabsolutely yeah it's a very very bigconcern especially I mean as a developerit's myself uh it's it's a it's verydangerous for Bitcoin to see this Iwould rather see the number ofdevelopers go up steadily because weliterally need every single person outthere also you know this is an outcroyou know I'm calling everyone listeningif you know a little bit of coding andyou just didn't do anything yet forBitcoin then start looking into it startlooking into cash you start looking intowhatever you want but start contributingbecause that's how you start and everysingle contribution I think is valuablewe need to increase the number ofdevelopers just exponentially in orderto make this project a success I'm veryconvinced of that and so seeingdevelopers leave for different reasonsfor example being sued by somepsychopath for example is one of thereasons why people choose to leave ornot join Bitcoin four years into alawsuit myself I can testify that it'shorrific and a horrific process to gothrough so we need to end that but and Ihope more developers come on anonymouslylike yourself so that threat doesn'texist butum I've been concerned by the number ofdevelopers leaving my brother keeps mybrother's a researcher on the show andhe keeps bringing it up saying we shouldbe talking about this more I knowthere's some people out there doing goodwork to try and recruit and incentivizedevelopers but there's a lot ofcompanies or individuals who hold enoughBitcoin uh to be able to support moredevelopers and I wish they would itsounds like a no-brainer to me I mean itsounds like the or the best way tomanage your risk if you're a largeholder of Bitcoin is to invest indevelopment this is you know it's whatkeeps your money alive basically I thinkfor me it's a I think many many whalesout there don't know exactly how to helpI've heard that over and over again thatyou know they would wish but they don'thave the rails or don't don't know whereto go and where to startum probably that that's also somethingthat we can improve a lot there's opensets for example it's a foundationthey're multiple like you can go toBrink and give them money and they willdistribute it to developers I think it'syou know just from a risk managementperspective if you're just imagineMichael Saylor has now 140k Bitcoin howmuch of that should I mean just rationalthinking how much value is in thatit must be well it's like buying a caryou need to keep it maintained right 3.6billion or something something like thatyour calculator as he tell you yeah hetweeted it yesterday uh 4.17 billion4.17 billion souh it's uh it's loose change for MichaelI mean I'm not I'm not going to call himout here I mean I don't know if he is Imean he's doing a lot of stuff forBitcoin I'd be interested to know howmuch he's contributing towardsdevelopers because those developers arelike Guardians for his 4.175 Bitcoin noit's not calling anyone oh just thinkabout it it's just the rational choicethat you should consider if you holdenough Bitcoin then you should give itto the developers that keep your moneyalive this is what every person withcouple of brain cells should reallyconsiderum I recently had Sergey from bitrefillon the show and he he was very practicalwith his opinions on bitcoin and uh hewas very much uh taught very muchtalking about utility over ideology andI know this is something you tweetedabout Danny's give me do you want tobring up the tweetum I'm going to read your Tweet mine yesif you're the reason a pink hairedcommie they them doesn't joinuse or develop Bitcoin you're probablyan enemy of Bitcoinyou may not think of yourself in thatway but it's true you failed to separatetiny personal and significant ideologyfrom the bigger goaltalk to me about thisI mean Bitcoin I think goes through thecycle that every movement goes throughwhich is once it grows it attracts manymany more people that start projectingtheir ideologies onto the movement thisis has happened to the hippie movementto the anarchist movement to anybasically any movement that became largeenough and it's happening with Bitcoinas well so this is a very natural thingto happen I thinkbut I thinkyou know once once the newcomers startconflatingthe core idea of Bitcoin which is to bethis immutable monetary system thatwe're building to escape the Fiat systemonce you start conflating that with yourideology you're putting off potentiallyhalf of the planet and this is justabsolutely not compatible with the goalsof Bitcoin which in my mind is to growas fast as possible before states canco-opt it and take it away from usbasically so if you're increased andthis is also again just a purelyrational choice I think if you'reinterested in the success of Bitcoinwhat you should do is is to welcomeeveryone who can join and you know thisis just a joke if but if you if you'rebasing that on the color of the hair orthe pronouns they use or whatever thenyou're clearly missing the point whatyou're doing is you're fighting for yourown ideology and not for Bitcoin becauseif you thought of Bitcoin you would besaying I don't care what you look like Idon't care what you believe if you wantto support Bitcoin you're my friendthat's that's all I think of it wellthis is why we've worked so hard to tryand bring as many progressives intoBitcoin which sounds counter to whatyou're doing but actually is to try andmake Bitcoin as open and uhunideologically driven as possiblebecause there is there is certainly a aright wing slash libertarian bent to alot of uh to bitcoin itself and a lot ofthe ideas regarding Bitcoin and I thinkso we've tried to we've tried to movethe education away from that but tryingto have as wide a range of voices aspossible on this show but I mean I Icertainly think I've been guilty of thatsometimes what you said there and Ithink taking it back to immutable moneythat's all we're trying to do is isprobably a very good thingum we will be stronger if we canseparate these ideologies also from theoverall goal because that makes youvulnerable it can basically this is alsosome of the reasons why people leave isbecause people start talking aboutideology so much instead of the you knowthe bigger goal of growing Bitcoin Ithink again the most important thing isthat the number of bitcoiners goes upand I don't care what they believe in intheir daily lives I literally don't careI mean because it's not interesting Ilove thisokay can we talk about AIlet's talk about AI all right Dannyyou're going to lead this one well wewent out last night with ob and yourselfKelly and we were talking a little bitabout um so I thought I was using AIturns out I'm not even scratching thesurface so we got into uh you're justusing a clever database like barelyum but we started talking about is itbaby GPT I think it was talking aboutbaby GPT and something called Auto GPTso this came off the back of you knowthe um letter that Elon Musk assignedbasically saying we need to pausedevelopment while we figure out what'sgoing on yeah because we might all dieyeah but it sounds like that might betoo late can you explain what that babyGPT or whatever it's called is uh so I Idon't know exactly what baby GPT is Ijust heard about it yesterday as wellbut what I can imagine it is is thatit's it's something on top of chat gbtso chat GPT is basically this you knowstupid machine where you put in a promptand it gives you text out but so this isjust single module what it does but uhfrom what we know about you know fromcognitive science basically is that ahuman brain is built out of differentdifferent modules doing different thingsone of them is to generate text forexample generate speech in your brainbasically but there are other parts thatwill just take the generated thoughtsand evaluate them for example introspectthem just criticize yourself before youspeak for example you know you have athought then you rethink it again andyou improve it and then you speak andjust building these um I don't think Ihave that part yeah it can be turned onand off and it depends also on severaldifferent let's say neural chemistry inyour brain happening whether that partis strong or weak but once you once youbuild these more intricate or moresophisticated systems with you know thecore generator in the heart but allthese different feedback loops into itthat can take different data for examplevisual data again and also evaluate itwith the generated text and so on youend up with truly you know frighteningor magical things depending on how youwant to look at it and the other thingthat Obi was saying is that these nowthese systems that have been developedwhereinstead of relying on like open Ai andchat gbt and you can create like apretty dumb AI a very basic Ai and getchat gbt or whatever other system toteach to teach itand then you can run that on your owncomputer and within I think you said 30hours you can get to like 95 as good asTech GPT so theand then that's completely like out ofokay that's out of the bag yeah yeahthis is why this this letter that thesepeople are assigning to stop developmentfor six months uh in open AI or whateveris absolutely useless because uh even ifyou make open AI stop their developmentthere are already multiple guitarprojects out there that you can justdownload on your on your computer youcan run something like jet GPT on yourMacBook uh just leveraging the fact thatopen air has already spent so muchresources in training their AI youbasically spin up a stupid small AI onyour computer and make it learn from theAI that just you know needed so muchresources to to learn about it in thefirst place so the future will be thatit will be running on your computer itwill be your non-custodial AI basicallyrunning on your computer and there isthere's going to be no way of stoppingthis like literally no way and also SamAltman yeah [ __ ] him butum same[Music]AI but um he sold a large chunk of hislike equity in open AI Microsoft at likefairly low valuation for what thatcompany isand Obi was saying basically he knowsthe gigs up and in six months likethere'll be just a million differentimplementations that you can run on yourcomputer yeah it depends like whetherthese companies manage to keep theirMonopoly on AI or not okay so what Iwant to know is you know you said youcan spin up an AI on your computer Iwant to know if an AI has gone out thereand spun up its own AI will it tell youor it might it might go look I've donethis you can't stop me do you see what Imean whether it's made a decision to goimagine giving an AI some Bitcoin andmaking it you know able to to orderstuff on the internet by a server justreplicate itself on the server pay forthat server with Bitcoin spin up us spinup a shop a web shop selling a service Idon't know uh uh this is the end ofTerminator three have you have you seenthe end to terminate three I've not seenterminate three not seen the start of itI meango on YouTubeso I've got a question for you you knowhow there's likeum we can teach a computer to beat us atchess every single time will an AI learnto trade Bitcoin better than everyBitcoin trade in the world and just winevery single trade that's literally whatall the Traders are doing today I meanhigh frequency trading is basically AItrading no one I meanno one should trade manually becausewhat happens when AI isn't competingwith AIS which is the better yes youknow what they do in the New York StockExchange there's this interesting storyso they have these computer programstrading in New York Stock Exchange bythe way a fun fact the property aroundthe New York Stock Exchange is the mostexpensive property latency because thelatency it's the latency with your[ __ ] internet cable from yourcomputer to The Exchange that makes adifference I do because I've seen amovie that's all about trying to reducethe latency of like for hyper frequencytrading I can't remember so the New YorkStock Exchange when you buy a serverthere or rent a server they give you theguarantee that your cable no matter howfar it is from the outlet will be thesame length as everyone else's Cable inthe same room [ __ ] have you seenTerminator yeah of course have you seenTerminator three I'm not sure if yousearch for the end of Terminator threeI know it's going to be uh it's a threeminute video is that about right yeahprobablythis is just a brilliant bitwhy didn't he tell uswhy did he lead us down herethank youto livethat was his missionpretty slow endI was never really stopping itJohncould justLet It Gois it a bomb yeah[Applause]can somebody hear methere's High type machines[Music]John Connorit's John ConnorCrystal Peakwhat the hell is happeningwho's in charge thereI amConnor can you help usI really know what's happeningdid you know him say there was never anystopping them yeah by the time Skynetbecame self-awareit had spread into millions of computerservers across the planetordinary computers and Office Buildingsdorm rooms everywhereit was softwarein cyberspacethere was no system corecould not be shut downthe attack began at 6 18 pmjust as he said it wouldJudgment Daythe day the human race was nearlydestroyed by the weapons they built toprotect themselves[Music]I should have realizedour destiny was never to stop JudgmentDayit was merely to survive ittogetheruh-huh so Mr Summit 2023. uh he tried totell usbut I didn't want to hear itmaybe the future has been writtenI don't knowall I know is what the Terminator taughtmenever stop fightingand I never willthe battle has just begunpriming the communityah it doesn't have the music it's likebut do you understand why I brought thatup right yeah yeah so and then so plotplot I'm gonna give away the plot so umif you haven't seen Terminator and youwant well first you haven't seen ityou're a [ __ ] but if you haven't seenit you want to see it uh just skip thisbit but Terminator I think I think asMatthew was talking about this was itMatthew no Freddie yeah Freddie Freddieso Terminator one is based on infiniteLoopand so you come back and you stop theTerminatorum but you never really stop it so it'sjust the infinite loop I think theTerminator 2 was based on linearand I think Terminator 3 was based on Ithink there's a continuation of linearbut it was like you could never stop ityou're never going to stop it but youhad to be ready so be so be prepared andbe prepared to survive to fight backyeah do you think this is realistic Imean it sounds a bit fatalistic actuallyto assume that things will go wrong fromthe get-go not from the get-go but Ithink who has explained to us that thinkof it in terms of uh errors and bugs solet's not be fatalistic about AI butthere will be bugs and what if what if abug in AI is the fact that it tried tokill usyeahum I mean I think before something evenremotely to what we've seen can happenthere needs to be a human that needs tomake the decision first to build an AIthat should kill all humans so you needsomeone with a bad intent first a humanwith a bad intent I think to to get intoa situation like that I I think it's youdon't think you see you don't think anAI if it is an AI that itself becomesself-aware that makes its decisionitself yeah isn't that the point of AIit thinks for itself yeah I think thisis generally known as AGI thisartificial general intelligence wherepeople assume that it will be able tomake decisions and has motivation to dostuff which you it hasn't been told todo right like a human you would just sitin a room and then just come up with agoal like I want to move somewhere andsee something but an AI wouldn't do thatlike a classical AI wouldn't do it youwould need to have a human that tells itsome first initial goal that initialgoal could be just survive no matterwhat no matter what happens survive ifyou give an AI that goal which soundsfirst I mean it's a dangerous goal togive then it might start you know takingconsiderations of you know maybe I killall the humans that's how I survive sous humans are we given a goal to surviveis that inherent within our biology orour Evolution does our brain developwith goals there's a that's anunanswered question I think but there'sthere are theories that say that youknow the entire brain and everythingthat we have is just something for theDNA to actually replicate so the theactual goal of life is in the DNA itselfwhich is to replicate the DNA so thenreplicate improve and survive yeah andeverything follows from the replicationjust you know everything that even thatthe fact that you go seek food but alsomaybe even the fact that we travel tospace to explore the universe might becaused by this initial goal that kickedoff this development which is for DNA toreplicate so this is this is one of theideas oh we're gonna go deep now I kindof need some weedum so this so I would question then wasour DNA programmedto evolve orand to replicate or did it Sparkfrom a primordial soup and it was afluke of that it could have been a happylittle accident and it could be thatmany happy little accidents happened butall of them died and just one survivedwith this property of being able toreplicate so perhaps even withoutsomebodytelling an AI to survive it could belots of hundreds of thousands of littlehappy accidents and one of them has thesurvival Instinct it could be it couldbe that if you just generate many manydifferent AIS with different goals thatthe one with the you know the drive tosurvive will be actually the one thatsurvives because it will kill off allother AI yeah if it's if it's necessaryfor survival maybe yes but again I thinkin that you know it's like saying wehave Gene editing now with crispr forexample yeah right so people arefreaking out about it because it willprobably kill Humanity it could happen Imean we could produce a virus I mean weshouldn't but someone could produce avirus that just kills everyone it'spossible but in order for that to happenyou need you need a person that has thisgoal I don't think that or an AI withaccess to crisprdoing what and whyso just to survivewhat does what would that mean to the AIdoes that mean current threats or futurethreatsI mean so if an AI recognizes that itwas created by humans it might recognizethat only humans can end it therefore itkills off the humans before the humanscan end it and that's part of itssurvival does it plan its survival aheadyeah it probably plans it because I meanit needs to know the outcomes of itsactions that's how you make good actionsbut uh I mean why are why aren't wediscussing the the possibility of a goodsymbiosis with an AI maybe that's theway the AI survives is to have the bestkind of symbiosis with humans justliving along with them and improvinghuman life so it can still persistbecause maybe we will be able to youknow turn it off and it realizes that inorder to be not turned off it needs tobe actually useful I think we're cynicaland fatalistic though and life imitatesI think yeah it does and I think youknow these these stories are onlyinteresting if they are you knowfatalistic like that yeahumoh yeahI think we're I think we're all gonnadie I do well on that note look at thisoh great you're going to show us howwe're gonna die yep uh so this issomething Obi showed us again last nightthis is like I don't know what I don'tknow what you call that a basically arobot that's going to enter it's anAndroid yeah an Android there you go andlook when this is going to be releasedwell it's number 23 this is called 1Xtext for tech for anyone listening youknow what this is it's like iRobot it'siRobot do you remember the go to YouTubeIf you must have seen iRobot do you knowwhat I think I Robot shouldn't haveworked and it worked the movie I meanyeah it shouldn't have worked but it didwork but do um find you know the scenewhere it's got them all together and allthe robots yeah it moves yeah can youfind that sceneum but you were not so uh you're a bitskeptical on this thing right yeahI amum detective what are you doing he saidthe evolving program with three laws sothat means we have 1 000 robots thatwill not try to protect themselves if itviolates a direct order from a humanI'm that one who willto check to put your gun down why do yougive them facesfriendly them all up make them look allhuman these robots are not you can makea great meme oh yeahare you as our propertythese things are just lights andClockwork[Applause]let me ask you something docjust thinking you're the last sane manon the face of the Earth make you crazybecause if it doesmaybe I am[Music]no that's itlove it I just absolutely love this Imean the film shouldn't worked when it'sexplained it shouldn't worked when youwatch the trailer it shouldn't work butit actually did work so when you seethis uh do you get afraid of itumI would have designed it differently Ican't figure out if he's just got like apair of like smart trousers and shoes onyeah I'm a bit skeptical that this thingwill actually be as agile as they saybecause as far as I know the state ofthe art is Boston Dynamics and that islike a bunch of uh hydraulic motors thatreally you know you can you can hear themotor uh running and there's weird dogwalking there have they got any video ofthis yeah I don't I don't know there'sNeo and Eve I don't think no I thinkit's called Neo Eve are you sure I thinkwhat's the most impressive about this isthe set of investors well that's wayless cool yeah that's like that beam youknow the meme with the like is it thehorseexactly this is how they will look likeI think so they're on Wheels they can'teven walkokay I'm way less scared of it now yeahthat's proper budget look at his facebut actually I think before before thesethings will become I mean it's beingdemoed here as well but I think theserobots will be much more important inproduction and then com you know in infactories uh doing doing manual work youcan buy the Boston Dynamics robots can'tyou no yeah can you on the websiteshould we buy one I think like 100 Grandwhat ah [ __ ] I kind of want one man thedog yeahknockoffs I mean Chinese knock-offsreally something yeah yeah for theBoston Dynamics yeah for the dark itselfhave you seenum Metal Head oh what's the series uhBlack Mirror yeah of course I mean it'sbasic it's literally Metal Head yeahwhich by the way I think that's the bestBlackBerry episodebut they're have you seen the video ofthe one where they gave her a gun yeah Idid have you seen it I don't think so ohmy God go to YouTube search for BostonDynamics dog gun it's [ __ ] insanethese things can run fast yeah this isgonna blow your mind and freak you outthat one watch this this is absolutelyinsane[Music]this is a knockoff this is not fromBoston myself so it's even worselaughsisn't that [ __ ] freaky it's so weirdimagine you went to your front door andthat was outside I mean this is what thewars of the future would look like nowfor sure for sure so that's not even aBoston Dynamics one right can we get itcan we let's go and buy onethat's creepy can you get the BostonDynamics website up thereyeah you just gotta contact yeah butwhat does it sayuh I want one let's get oneso sookayobviously AI we believe we can do somegood things we're already using versionsof AI That's not real AI uh it is it isit's not our artificial generalintelligence it's not AGI but it'sdefinitely AI have you told him howyou've been using it yeah but again likeI say it's we're not even scratching thesurface so Cali was telling meum there's this website that's likeGitHub for AI projects I don't know yeahum and there's a program called Jarvis Ithink did he say Microsoft's they'vecreated this well there there are AISalready that can make use of other AISso you can have like one Central AI thatknows you know that has the ability toGoogle uh to recognize images torecognize speech produce speech thedifferent AIS and then you can buildlike something like a meta AI thing thatknows how to access these other AIS soonce you start putting these thingstogether which we didn't start yet we'rejust barely you know seeing how open AIcan do text recognition and imagerecognition at the same time whichalready is very powerful but once youput these things togetherjust goes exponentially from there soyou can ask one AI to do it to do a taskfor you and it'll go out and like useall the other AIS to complete that taskthen come back to you with the completedtask what about the task that we need atthe moment uh I think that file's goneor ask AI I have I was literally goingthrough like troubleshooting with GPTwhat's your task uh so we had a filecorrupt and I've lost itum and I've confined the file but theaudio is like cut off halfway throughum well I don't know if I can find theoriginal file basically I'm trying tofind a recover a file for my computerthe file recovery software won't workand I was like going through ittroubleshooting which actually was T3 itgave me some good options but I stillcan't find it so what we were thinkingcan we use we've got the audio from thecamera but it's not this quality it'snot this mic quality it's from thecamera so I sound a bit echoey and tinnybut we also do have my voice patternsfrom this so could we take the two andget AI to uh uh basicallytake my voice from thistake my uh the words I said and redothem can we go yeah I think we canfantastic idea I don't know if there isan AI that can do that just uh let meshow you this this is insane now all youhave to do is record reference vocalsand replace it with the train model thatany musician you like which is exactlywhat I did I found this Kanye style beaton YouTube I wrote eight bars and I'mgonna record them now and then I'm gonnahave ai Kanye replace me I got a fantasythat's beautiful that's dark and twistedbut I attacked the whole religion allbecause of my ignorance what was Ithinking that was some [ __ ] [ __ ] I lostAdidas but I'm still Yeezy back in thekitchen man I'm a genius boys in thehood just like I'm easy Kanye Wheezysouth side of Chicago life ain't easyall praise be the Lord Jesus dondaplease rest easy all right let me cut itthere let me cut it there so let's hearthose vocals I just recorded now withKanye over them I got a fantasy that'sbeautiful that's dark and twisted but Iattacked the whole that sounds perfectit's insane isn't ithonestly this stuff the speed of changewe're seeing with everything at themoment it's like almost every daysomething news coming out yeah it's inthe last couple of months and it's beengoing crazy you can close your eyes fora couple of days and you won't recognizeyour environment anymore it's insaneyeah it's literally insane and wealready know they're replicating aroundthe world on computers connected to theinternet and they could be well whatevertheir AIS are talking to each other Iwonder if two AOS I'm like oh yeah mateI've got an idea well that's like theplot of her isn't it that yeah andthat's the plot ofum Terminator Okay so you could havethey'd be like all right I've got anidea we need to get rid of these humandickers but I'm very very uh optimisticabout it I think it just solves so manyproblems at once it makes work so mucheasier people are also concerned aboutall the jobs job loss and thateverything that it will lead to I thinkI think it's good that it leads to jobloss which is have to find a way to dealwith it yeah no I agree with that I meanthe the kind of I mean we made adocumentary here in Bedford and part ofthat was driving up to one of the Amazonwarehouses these places are Grim I meanthey're they're I think they are wellwe've essentially replaced bookshops onthe High Street where you're going andyou would speak to somebody like a alocal and they'd talk to you about thebooks and you've you know you throughsome and buy one to these giant [ __ ]warehouses where people were clockingclock out and they're just doing arepetitive manual job but everythingthey do is tracked to the minute to thesecond to be as efficient as possiblethankfully we will replace those withrobots and get people out to enjoy thelife they were they were gifted ratherthan doing this [ __ ] [ __ ] forminimum wage I I agree with you but buthow my fear is this like kind of likedark side of Silicon Valley wherebyum we concentrate the wealth into a fewand fewer people and there isn't anopportunity for them to use that timefor other productive things that's myfear the other side is potentially whatwe do is we we make things moreefficient for being able to provide forother people so you know we head towardsthat Singularity on energy so energy canbecome cheap and plentiful I just don'tknow which one I don't know which whichway we go I I I'm always cynical andskeptical of humans so maybe we shouldbe more optimistic about AI maybethey'll fix our yeahthoughts are faultsGod it's fascinating I think as humanswill be faced with a lot more with ournature even closer than we are actuallyalready are once we don't have to do allthe physical work anymore to survive soonce you don't have to go to workanymore because Society has evolvedthere you need you really need to askyourself what you want to do with yourlife I know many people and I respectthem a lot doing a lot of really heavywork with their bodies and they go towork because they need to in order tosurvive and sometimes they also say thisis you know this is the best ofrealities because what would I dootherwise and this is a question that weall need to ask ourselves right once youcome to a place where you don't have towork then you really need to askyourself what do you want to do I thinkscience and art and you know these theseuh things that we do in our minds aregoing to be much more important in thefuture because it you know the thenecessity of doing physical called workwill be lifted from our shoulders I'mreally looking forward to that it'sgoing to probably cause some kind of anexistential crisisbecause now we're faced with you knowwith the question what you want to dowhen um I used to work in advertisingLondon when I quit I had a year off workand I just said I'm not going to workfor a yearand the first month was really really[ __ ] hard because I did not know whatto do with my time when you can get upevery day and do what you wantit's filling that time at first becomesreally difficult I was like what am Igoing to do andyeah to begin with I kind of watched alot of TVsat on the couch and I was like I can'tcarry this on so I started going to thegym and then I would go and do any classwhatever there was I'd do I was doingPilates with a bunch of old ladies ateight in the morning and then I'd swimand and then what happened I started tofilm my time with exercise outsidecooking and I was probably 30 40 poundslighter than I am now I look great Ifelt great honestly life was [ __ ]brilliant and over the last five yearsI've refilled that with more and morework for some reason I've I've got ridof that amazing life I had to fill itwith a different life which is amazingin other ways but but it was brillianthaving that time have you ever had a lotof time off not like that now it wasamazing it was also at a time when mymum was dying so I got to spend a lot oftime with her and you know spent herlast year with her when you know notworking which was you know a gift tohave that time but it was good and Isometimes I I look back on that I thinkwhat am I doingwhat are you gonna do with your timeum I think I'm gonna keep working onbitcoin this is for me you know it'ssimilar to what I just described I thinkit's something that I could identify formy life as a very you know as this giantproject it's a worldwide project thatwill outlive myself and it it just needsmany people building the foundations ofit for maybe hundreds of years and Ithink it's it's a beautiful thing to beable to participate in something that isbigger than you I think this is what youcan end up with if you have enoughfreedom in your life to look around andlook for things that interest you andBitcoin is is the thing that I found Ithink there are many other things thatyou could do I really respect everyonedoing Arts and Sciences I think theseare these are the things that that justcarry us humans furtherum but I I will be probably justspending my time working on bitcoin likeso many others as well that's beautifulman what would you do Jenny keep workingon bitcoin too we're working on Bitcoinin a weird little way yeah you aredefinitely absolutely football for me itwill be focused on football but anywaywe've got a football match to go to areyou excited yes I amKelly you're an amazing human and uh I'mreally glad we got to meet and I want tospend more time with you and I want todo this againum thank you as soon as possible uhyou're an amazing asset to bitcoin anduh anything we can ever do to help youhave our details you reach out to uswhere do you want to send peopleum I'll send them over to my Twitterit's Kelly BTC and uh send them over tocashew.space if you're a developerplease look at it if you want to supportcashew then go there you'll find ways tosupport it and just look into Bitcoinplease help us build Bitcoin be adeveloper in Bitcoin look into how youcan contribute to open source projectsthank you brother you take care thankyou tooforeignmorning Kelly good morning Peter I'm not[ __ ] hell are you just giving me awayyou just gave me away as well you youCali's a secret name Peter is a secretname as well no that's my real name youhave the larger anonymity set than I do[ __ ] sake I was gonna be in Disguisemy name is Ben actually my name is Benoh[ __ ] that shit's too hot I don't know heyou and Gigi do thisoh manhow are you brother I'm doing reallyreally good thank you thank you forhaving me I'm a big big fan of your showso it's greatgreat to be here well thank you forcoming to Bedford cool you're uh you gotto be the uh first Bitcoin who came tomy bar yes I was at your bar and I wishyou a lot of success with it I thinkit's gonna be a success story I hope soI hope so I hope so rightum oh and you're coming to the footballtoday as well I forgot even about thatyou're basically going full Bedford fullprogram I saw most of Bradford today I'mgonna see the football match today whereyou're gonna winright wow so yes we're gonna win yeahbut I don't know if we'll win the leaguetoday but if we win we've kind of wonthe league it's very step by step stepby step so listen Ben Ark is a huge fanof yours we're uh we're big fans of BenBen's been on the show how many timesnow two three guys twice yeah he'scoming down to bed for forever next weekhe's like dude you gotta get you gottaget Kelly on the show that is so coolI'm I'm also a big fan of Ben myself heis basically my mentor in a sensehe's such a he's such a nice guy as wellhe's like a nice bitcoiner yeahabsolutely and so I got involved withBen because I started contributing toAlan bits a lot the project that he'sworking on and at some point he justasked me to join the team basically andwe started working togetherBen is really like in the beginning heheld my hands showed me a little bit howto you know how to get involved andprobably the reason why I'm sitting heretoday so I'm very very grateful he's anamazing personI agree I think he's an amazing personoh God I sound so deep the voice todaysound like Matthew majinski I wasn't inthe face I'm trying to go down as wellcan you hear that pleaseum uh so we also yesterday we hadum phobia with us uh from fetty mint anduh we got you out together last nightwhat a coincidence no fights no nofights at all no we had an amazingconversation actually I'm very friendlywith with the guys from famousespecially uh Eric uh known himum before I met Obi as well Eric isactually the person who uh ecash told meso I I also my Thanks goes to him he heearned a lot of respect in the communityfor that so he taught me what ecash isand that's the reason why I startedlooking into it and made thisalternative project cashew which uhtogether with fediment are the I thinkthe hottest ecash projects out there I'mvery happy that these projects are onbitcoin and not on any other kind ofsystem well let's get into that let's Imean there's so many things we couldtalk about with you today I know Dannytalked to you about all kinds of [ __ ]last night he's like Pete we could makethree shows for Kelly todayum but let's talk about ecash that's uhpertinent to bitcoin is right now uh bigup to David charm a bit of a bit of alegend in the digital currency spaceyeah absolutely I actually got to meethim in London a couple years ago oh uhwhere did that go that was good reallyinteresting uh I met a guy who was aperiod of reflectionum but uh just it was just incredible tobe with such a prominent person in theuh I would call him a bitcoiner reallybecause even though he worked onprojects previous to bitcoin obviouslyhe inspired the work he's uh cited inthe white paper you know he nearlycreated bitcoin maybe you know he nearlydid and as far as I know he doesn't likeBitcoin that much today I I couldn'tappoint a self-reflection and I I thinkhis dislike for Bitcoin is probably notdisliking Bitcoin it's more uhif there was another Bedford team thatcame up behind us and were reallysuccessful and it was great for the townI would probably struggle to enjoy itbecause it wasn't the one I didyeah maybe I I hope if he knows aboutcashew that he would be just proud tosee that his ideas are flourishing todayso he's he's should we just go into howhow it all started with him yeah pleasedo yeah so uh David charm is thisum legendary cryptographer and he hepublished this paper in 1982 so it's wayway before anything with Bitcoin it'sactually the first cryptocurrency likehistorically speaking is the firstcryptocurrency invented before you wereborn before way beforeI was a little boy I was just about tostart school so yeah and they had thisidea and it was way before also theinternet became a thing really right soum it was called you know makingsomething like making a payment systemwith blind signatures and what thisbasically allows you is to create anelectronic cash system that is perfectlyprivate uh it is not a decentralizedsystem like Bitcoin is it is more likehow to build a bank that's that's theway they thought about it before becausethere was no other way thinking about ithow to make a bank that doesn't know whoyou are how much you have and who you'retransacting with which is a completelyrevolutionary ideaand so that was 1982 and this idea justfloated around I guess for almost adecade and then they started thiscompany called digicash digicash is wellknown for its attempt to bring ecash tothe world well you say it's well now andsome people here won't realize thehistory of the project or why it failedso maybe you should tell a little bitYeah so I think digicash itself it had acouple of products I think the mostsuccessful one was uh toll booths so uhyou know you would have some kind of acard that you could use to drive throughthe toll booth and just pay anonymouslyso that was the idea I think that wasalso the cash cow for the company butthere were many other uh businessopportunities for digicash for examplelike the stories are crazy Microsoftapproached them to us you know theywanted to put in ecash wallet into everyWindows 95 copy just imagine that yeahthere was before before credit cards onthe internet took off that was beforepay people was there it was they almostput it into every home computer on theplanet just a bit before every uh homeMac had a copy of the Bitcoin whitepaper put on it yeah exactly yeah beforethat yeah exactly so um but that thatdeal never went anywhere so it probablyand that's when you when you startresearching it it's because DavidCharmed and just changed the terms ofthe contract and wanted more thanMicrosoft was able to giveuh that was Microsoft Visa alsoapproached him or them and wanted tobuild it into their payment system tomake a completely Anonymous paymentsystem probably an alternative to payingwith credit cards today on the internetalso didn't go anywhere so these arejust one two examples and there are acouple more where ecash could havebecome a de facto standard of how we payon the internet before any of thesepayment processors even came about butit didn't didn't happen probably andthat's again when you start researchingit it's about David Shaw I'm not notreally agreeing to the terms of these ofthese companies so yeah PayPal campscomes credit cards come now we have themand so total [ __ ] show everyone knowsexactly what you're doing you can becensored you know your accounts arebeing closed at a win and your creditcards are insanely bad you basicallyenter your private Keys every time youmake transaction into a website justimagine that you give the website theability to take all your money just formaking a 150 dollar payment or somethingso the state of payments on the Internetis absolutely bad and then no nothinghappened we just have these Legacypayment rails ecash is dead for 20 30years no one cares about it untilBitcoin comes about and with Bitcoin Ithink it kind of refreshed interest foryou know going back looking at these atthese Technologies yeah and David Chamis it was it was and is a huge advocateof privacy always discussed how is oneof the fundamental pillars of democracywithout privacy you don't have democracyand Bitcoin has a interestingprivacy story in that if you're smartenough if you're Cali or you're MattOdell you probably you know maxillabrand you understand privacy youunderstand the mistakes you can make butI would say from 99 of Bitcoin isthey're going to make a mistake andthey're going to give up their privacyand I think real privacy will come tobitcoin when it's taken out the hands ofthe user to actually figure it out itjust comes inherently and so myunderstanding of ecash is that it kindof does a lot of that for you yeah so abig disclaimer here because I don't wantanyone to confuse this ecash is acustodial system so it's a way to makecustodial apps like wallet of Satoshiand I'll just let's take what it doesSatoshi for the example because everyoneknows what it is to make something likewallet of Satoshi in a way that itdoesn't know what you're doing with allthese privacy benefits so it is you knowit could be as easy as using walletSatoshi but you don't hold your Bitcoinuh but I agree with you I think privacycan only win if it happens on a veryvery large scale that's basically youknow the requirement for privacy is thatyour anonymity set is large enough andas long as it is so easy to [ __ ] up yourprivacy in Bitcoin it's not really youknow useful for everyday folks I thinkthis is very important actually and alsothe reason why I'm working on this is tomake it kind of a defaultthere's been a lot of criticism recentlyfor the state of uh of custodial walletswithin lightning in that the majority ofpeople are using custodial walletsespecially some Nostra people are usingsomething like the Wallace of Satoshi Iused to use blue wallet I have a rangeof wallets I use now but custodialSolutions are a lot easier than runningyour own lightning notes significantlyeasier as uh significantly less frictionum is that something we should beworried about and I'm going to tee thatby saying I don't worry about it becausethe Majora the vast majority of myBitcoinis base chain Bitcoin I keep a verysmall amount uh in a custodial lightningwallet an amount where if I lost itwould be annoying but I wouldn't care abit like if I lose my money on my cashin my pocket on a night out it'sannoying but it does it's something thatsignificantly changed my life how do youfeel about the whole custodial versusnon-custodial uh I see it very similarlyso no one should store their theirwealth in a custodial service you justyou know we we should work all togetherto to explain it to everyone the walletof Satoshi is not your real Bitcoin youdon't hold the keys you can lose it andthe value proposition of Bitcoin itselfthat you're the sole cust you're thesole owner of your Bitcoin you have fullcontrol and sovereignty absolutely butstill I agree with you that custodialServices just it's de facto it's beingused not because people are stupid butbecause it gives them some certain valuethat other wallets cannot give it givethem so for example lightning addresslightning typical example that that issupported by many many custodial walletsbut not so much by non-costalia onesgetting tips on on Twitter just uh onNoster you you cannot you know you wouldhave to run your own server somewhere inyour basement to be able to receive tipswhile you're you know offline basicallyand that's why custodial services areused now the way I approach this youknow it could be formulated as a problemI just the way I approach this is thisis a realitythe biggest used the most used lightningwallet today is wallet of Satoshi nowwhat I'm proposing with cashew or withecash General generally is to justimprove the privacy of these users thatalready opted in for something like thatand they kind of they use they're kindof their their reasons why they want touse it I don't want to judge that but ifthey do and if we have a way to improvetheir privacy without any you knowdecrementing their user experiencethen we should do it okay cool okay solet's talk about ecash explain to mewhat ecash is and how it works and youknow where is it within the Bitcoinstack yeah so ecash is completelyseparate from Bitcoinyeah it works very very differently Ithink for bitcoiners it's a very uhAlien concept because what we are usedto is we have a blockchain that issomewhere in The Ether and you hold yourkeys on your wallet and then you make atransaction and you publish it to thisblockchain and then it gets getsrecorded in the blockchain right soecash works completely differently andwith ecash you basically hold not thekeys to your money but the money itselfand is represented as a piece ofelectronic data so it is you know I Itold Danny the story yesterday it is howI imagined Bitcoin to be when I firstheard about Bitcoin wrongly because itwasn't explained well to me but when Ifirst heard about Bitcoin I thought heywell that's that sounds like a torrentfor money it's a network of computerssharing some something and what Iimagined was that you hold kind of themoney in your hard drive and then whenyou want to pay something you take apiece of it and send it over a wire justyou know like you would send someonecache through an envelope for example uhbut yeah I was corrected that's not howBitcoin Works Bitcoin is the signing ona blockchain etc but that's actually howe-cache Works which is fine because Irediscovered this idea when when Idiscovered rediscovered ecash so ecashis a piece of electronic data that youhold on your device like your phone forexample that represents the money thatuh could be something on your Satoshiaccount and then you send it throughtelegram through email through someencrypted Channel or whatever to someoneelse and then so you're sending them apiece of data and then they hold thatpiece of data and that's the money yesexactly so that's why that thingyesterday with ob showed us with youwere able to send it hopefully offlineyeah so last night Cali did an examplewhich maybe at some point in the showyou should do for Pete you should sendhim some so just do it now how do I doit yeah we can do it I don't have myphone with it though there you go whatdo I needso you can send do I need to downloadsomething no you can send him the e-cashthat you sent me last night all right soall right let's do thisyou open your Safari browser and you goto cashew dot me that is one cachewallet there multiple cache walletscashier.me uh just disclaimer foreveryone listening don't put your moneyin there it's just for experimentationthis is still in development but I'mgoing to show you how your cash workshere so I have one SEC sorry I just needto go do I need to do receive e-cashum not yet so first you know it's a pushsystem it's in uh you know it doesn'twork like the lightning where you pull apayment I need to push your money overso I have now Dennis found there are a1024 satoshi's on there I'm gonna presssend ecash and just enter an amountlet's say 64 64 satoshi'ssend tokens so um Let's do let's do theuh the messenger way yeah you can opentelegram and send it to people I'm gonnalook so I get this random string nowthis is the money so I'm going to copythis just a normal copyI'm going now to Telegram and let's seeif I can I'm scrolling through this isuncomfortable for me but here we go Ifound you and now I just paste ityou just received a message I think yeahwith this random looking string you copythat that is the moneycopy thatand then you go to your to your cashierwallet and you say receive e-cash andpaste it in receivepasteah there we go it's gone that was itthat's that's really quick really coolvery cool zero Satoshi for you no tracesleft no one knows what just happenedand no there's no sending to anotherperson so there's no connection okay ithappened off bent we just send it to youthrough Telegramand so the the code I put in knowshow does that know what amount of moneythat is is that just an encrypted amountof moneyum so it's been signed by the server soI can I can explain centralization rightyes exactly so uh for for anyonelistening who might now wonder why can'tI just copy paste this money and send itto other people as well right so how doyou suppose yeah and that is theinvention of e-cash how it works is thatin order to complete the transactionwhat I just did I took my e-cash fromthe hard drive I sent it over to you andwhat you did upon receiving you justsend it to the server and said here are64 satoshi's burn them and give me a newone and yeah that burns it's invalidatedit cannot be double spent anymore butthe key point is here this ecash what Ijust sent you cannot be correlated towhat you sent back to the server sothat's the Privacy the server doesn'tknow that when it receives ecash fromyou to be recycled it doesn't know thatit's the same ecash that it gave mebeforethat's a blind signature thing I canactually there's a beautiful example onhow to imagine this how it works if youlike I just give you this example it's aphysical example andsoimagine you have a let's say a bankaccount right you have um and you wantto get ecash from your bank account andwhat you would do is you take the youtake a contract you write a contract onwhich it says Bank you owe me one BTCright if I get one BTC uh it says on acontract now you take the contract andyou put it into an envelope that is madeof carbon paper you know carbon paper isthe one where you're right on top of itpress it through right so you take anenvelope made of carbon paper and youput your contract inside that envelopeyou close it right and then you send theenvelope the closed one to the bank tothe mint we say and then mint says okayyou want to have a signature on theresend me one Bitcoin you send one Bitcointo the mint and the Min says okay yousend me Bitcoin and takes a pen andsigns it on the outside of this envelopeso on the closed envelope it makes thesignature and sends you back theenvelope now because this wasn't realpaper it was actually encryption you'rethe only one who can open the envelopeagain when you open the envelope whatyou get is a contract that you'vewrittenon which it says you're only one Bitcoinwith the signature of the mint but thekey point is that the mint has neverseen the contract this is a blindsignatureso when you can now this is the moneythe contract is the money you can nowsend me this contract via telegram forexample and I can take it and I can goto the mint and say hey mintyou know pay me one Bitcoin out andhere's the proof that I deserve itand then the mint will see this contractand say well I've never seen thiscontract before but I can see mysignature on there so I must honor thisI choose to honor this there is no wayto make sure that they will honor it butif they're if they're uh you know ifthey're honest and they they would butthe key point is they don't know thatthis contract would what I give them isthe contract that you made them to signokay that's how it works it's very coolvery cool um so the e-clash protocolthere's an e-catch protocol or is therea cashew protocol which is animplementation of Eco yeah ecash is amechanismum and cashew is a protocol to implementthat and so there would no be therewouldn't be any interoperinteroperability between say uh cashewand fediment no although they have verysimilar uh way of working it's not butthere's interoperability because it's aprotocol that there's interoperabilityacross casual wallets this is just onewallet that I showed you there like fourdifferent wallets so essentially we havethis uh blossoming ecosystem where wehave our base chain Bitcoin we have ourlightning whether it's custodial ornon-custodial we have liquid we havefedi mint we have cashew like a wholevariety of ways to now start using yourBitcoin elsewhere and in different waysyes absolutely yeah I've got a questionon that so you just sent 64 SATs youcould do that through lightningreasonably privately like why why shouldpeople care about cash so you can dothat about lightning and you should alsodo that about with lightningnon-custodially if you can and if youhave the ability and everything goesokay but there are a couple of problemswith that already first of all right nowwe don't have receiver privacy forlightning yet so if I pay you the 64sets and you make an invoice on yournote I know exactly what you notice andI can infer your balances and so on solightning has privacy issues on thereceiver side send aside it's excellentprivacy so you you have that and theother thing with lightning is that it isnot fully reliable yet so once you startstreaming sets for example you want tomake a payment every 10 seconds it'svery likely that one of these paymentswill get stuck and in the worst case youwill have to wait two weeks until youcan get it back so that's just howlightning works it's you know sendingthis hdlc across different nodes and ifone of them goes just offline in themeantime then you wait so althoughlightning is great and I urge people tolook into how to use it non-custodiallythere it doesn't cover all the differentways of how to use Bitcoin and withecash you can you know start doingthings that you cannot do with lightningfor example I could just put this ecashinto a data package from let's say Idon't know uh I want to make uh I wantto stream a video on Netflix right Icould I could design a Netflix where youdon't pay a monthly fee but you top upyour e-cash balance so you downloade-cash from Netflix by paying withBitcoin for example and then you justfor every minute that you want to streamyou just send them a bit of e-cash andthey can just see okay this is ecash Iissued this this person has the right toreceive one minute of video and you canjust keep on doing that with the kickwith the twist that they don't know whoyou are you don't even need an accounton Netflix in that model you just buythe tokens and then you spend them asyou as you use it and if you don't wantthem anymore you say please it out againon bitcoin on lightning or whatever yousend them the tokens they burn it andgive you back your Bitcoin that they oweyouvery cool so how far away is cashew frombeing uh live and able we're able to useit in a live environment so what we justdid was using it in a light environmentyes but you said uh you said it's uhbeta did you so cashier isum not even half a year old that Istarted working on this and a couple ofpeople who joined working on this withme so we're very very young but it's outthere you can try it and you canimplement it that's that's even waybetter than just you know trying it outthere if there are developers out thereso they're actual sets this isn't uh theactual real sets this is actual realecash that you can exchange for actualreal sets on Lightning see I always findthis use of the I was talking to Obiabout this e-cash term uh a distractionI think it's it misleads people intothinking they're using something elseand I know it's not actual SATs it's arepresentation of sets yeah but it saysokay then to me I agree with you I agreewith you becauseum it makes it makes it way easier to totalk about it and to imagine it but Ihaven't created a wallet here like Ihaven't signed up there is no there isno user accounts there are no wallets sobasically the server doesn't even knowthat you exist the server just said uhsomeone paid this lightning invoice I'mgonna give them ecash but if I lose thisphone then the money is gone oh okaythere's a way to back it up though thereis a way there's a way to back it up anduh we're also working on better ways toback it up so if Pete tried to send thatto me to like a moon wallet now wouldthat work yeah that would work reallyyeah what you do is you create aninvoice on your moon wallet and then youask the mint to pay the invoice for youand for that you have to give them thesetwo videos I want to see this okay buthow does how does thiswallet no it's made is it is there someis it an ID in my phone no but how do soif I close this browser and come backwill it still know those 64 cents itwill be stored in your browser browserdata there and that's it but it's likecash like when you make a cashtransaction no one knows who you areright pay invoice so I've got a 64invoice I'll make it a bit less becausethere will be fees yeahall right do 50 Cent invoicethere we goMoon Moon is notoriously slowis paying anyone listening to pay hisword holy [ __ ] that's [ __ ] cool thatis really cool okay what you just didthere is you burned ecash and you saidyou told them and please pay thisinvoice for me the mint doesn't have aconcept of you it doesn't know thatyou're one person or whatever and thelightning invoice that you just paidcannot be correlated back to any personso basically it's a pool of money youput it in and someone takes it out againcan he send me sets from my from hisMoon model into my e-cash wallet yes anddoes it and it's at the reverse yes itburns them and turns them into exactlyokay I wantjust because I'm me I want an app orsomething that I knowthat if I lose my phone I still got it Iwant I feelit's weird just going to a browser yeahbut Cali put the browser to my homescreen now so I have like a cashier uphere okay it's effectively in that butyou're using it is a browser I need aback I need a backup yes yeah yeahyou'll have just a seat phrase thathelps you to restore your cash it's notit looks like a Bitcoin seed phrase butit's not really the same thing but justby storing a seed phrase you'll be ableto just restore your ecash in case youlose the device and the Beautiful thebeautiful thing about it it's so simplelike money in that all it does is thatyou send it and receive it that's what Ineed to that's all I need that's that'sall you need from my pocketliterally my pocket does the same I haveit stores the money I have and I eithergive it or receive it and if you lose itit's gone yeah yeahit's so beautifully simple yes it is andso what we're looking at these walletsI've built I've built this for people tobe able to imagine what ecash is butthat is not really the goal for me withcashew itself cashew is supposed to be aprotocol it is already a protocol thereis a spec out there you can read it youcan start building stuff on it what Iimagine is that you know there will beand there are hundreds and thousands ofweb services out there who will you knowjust give you some service for yourBitcoin your website I don't know youwant to read news payroll news forexample then you top up your balance andthen you start reading the news and theproblem with that is the website thatallows you to do that can track exactlywhat you're reading because it knows itit's related to this one payment thatyou did they need to do it that's howthat's how custodial Services work yeahso uh cashew is basically a drop inreplacement you can almost all of thecustodial Services I know of today youcan take out this classical all databaseLedger where it says you have this andthis much money and whatever you canreplace it with the cache protocol andbuild something that has the samefunctionality but with this improvedprivacy for example you're you're miningright I am mining you have a you have aminer in a pool every Miner in a pool isa user of a custodial service right theyhave your Bitcoin and they send it outto you regularly when you join so thispool knows exactly how much you minethey know how much you earned yeah thatand they send it out on a daily basisyes you can do that with ecash and theydon't they don't know anything about ityeah I also wonder I've always wonderedon that because they paid on a dailybasis how much money is being wasted infees having a daily payout on my bit myI hope they're batching theirtransactions I don't know yeah no ideaum okay very cool how do you differ fromfediment so ferment is an excellentprojectum you know people also should look intothat cashier is not really trying tocompete with thatum rather as far as I understand I'm Imean I I don't want to talk too muchabout other people's projects theyshould do it but as far as I understandfediment's approach is more aboutCommunity custody so what they focus onand this is Eric's work and it'sexcellent like I'm a big fan of his workand they focus on this Federated aspectso you have multiple custodiansbasically they all share the keys to themulti-sick where the Bitcoin is storedand what we just did basically they doit with not only one mint like there isnot only one party controlling the mintbut there are end parties controllingthe mint which makes things a bit morecomplicated to build and to integratebut it gives you the increased risk adecreased risk of getting Rapportbasically you would have multiple peoplehave to collude in order to take awayyour your Bitcoin your real Bitcoin thatyou deposit it there so I guess that isthat is the fundamental differencebetween sediment and cashew but apartfrom that they as far as I can see usethe overall same concept yeah so they'resolving uh multisig for communitiesthey're becoming almost like a CommunityBank you're someone's pocket full ofcash yes and uh I I can see cashew justtaking over the entire web becauseso not only a package not only the cashin your pocket but every website thatyou use that has some kind of a balanceyou can use cashew and that will be it'svery easy to implement we just made itvery easy to implement again I can alsothink about like when we run ourconference Next Year everyone having acashew app and that being the paymentsystem for at the conference whereyou're buying tickets buying merchandisebuying beers it'd be like a I wasthinking about it with regards to verymint you could have a short-termFederation I can think of these usecases for everyone come to theconference has privacy at the event forall their interactions with each otherand it works kind of offline so youcould do it on a conference where youknow internet connectivity is bad forexample you can just use casualinternally because you have themidsomber listening to everyone anddoing these transactions and when youexit the conference again you go to thecounter and you say I want my Bitcoinback you give them your e-cash they giveyou a bigger Bitcoin I really like it itdoesn't make it doesn't make you anymoney doing it though there's noservices on there absolutely not this isa protocol and we're writing a protocolthat people can use to build stuff on II'm not you know I'm not running acustodial service or whatever I'mworking on this uh this this idea whoruns the mintum you can run a mint today there aremultiple mints uh there is an Ellen bitsplugin an extension that you can youknow when you install Olympics it givesyou this ability to do many manydifferent things with your lightningwallet one of the things that you can dois just three clicks literally andyou're you're running mint so if youwant to run a mint for your bar or yourcommunity or your website uh it's veryvery easy to set up you just need alightning node in the back end that doesthe lightning stuff and use one of thesewallets that we've writtenand is there an issue like a regulatoryissue for the whoever's running them inum I don't know I don't careI love it good answer why don't you whydon't you care it's not my business Idon't know I mean the world is Big thereare many different places out there youcan do stuff here but you cannot do itthere I mean why would I care peopleshould do whatever they think is best[ __ ] yes okay uhwhat criticism have you received anycriticism yesum definitely so first of all uh toavoid criticism and because I'm a realbitcoiner and I know what the value ofof holding your own Keys is okay I sayit again cash is a custodial servicedon't use it if you don't want to usecustodial services that is the mainpoint of criticism because people kindof assume uh that anything that iscustodial is bad per se I can understandthat they shouldn't touch what it doesSatoshi either right I'm just proposingthis strict Improvement on privacy onthings like well it is Satoshi thenthere are multiple other problems withcustodial Services themselves thatcashew also inherits for example it'shard to prove that you don't inflate thesupply so how do you know that ae-cashment didn't print more e-cash thanit has in Bitcoin reserves right it's akind of Unsolved problem we're literallyworking on it right now and there arepromising ways to do that but unsolvedbut solvable oh uh theoreticallyunsolved yet so there's no one I thinkout there who really knows how to do ityet but we're very close at it I hopewe'll do it so the moment that we knowhow to do it theoretically we will buildit practically but at the same time noone knows the same thing about what itis Satoshi you don't know if they holdthe Bitcoin that they say that they owedit to their customers that's very that'svery true it's the same problemcould youinstantlyum could you instantly burn all SATsreceived into lightning yes andtherefore you would at least knowif the ecash you receive is real becauseit they would I assume there's someerror when you send it toa lightning wallet there would be anerror if if they weren't real exactlythis is this is where the ideas actuallygo through this is a very fun funny thatyou actually follow this path becausethis is the way that you could try toimprove these Services have some kind ofan Epoch like a regular window timewindow where the supply has to be provenbasically publicly reserves kind of thatyou own the Bitcoin basically by cyclingit around in a you know uh in regularintervals basically you could do thatand once that doesn't work anymoreeveryone would know that there issomething fishy going on with the mintso in that regard you need to trust themand also I mean we've been talking aboutthis yesterday I'm not a big uh I don'tknow much about the Free banking ideasthat some Bitcoin is really know a lotmore about it and I think you've beenalso talking to people who who do but uhwe covered it yesterday with Matthewmajinski he's a huge fan of the the eraFree banking yeah exactly and there area couple of bit I'm learning from themas as we're building this uh thisprotocol uh which you know there's theidea that having a Level Playing Fieldwhere you can uh you allow uh differentmeans to pop up and offer these Servicesthe idea is that in in a world wherecompetition is free you would see anincrease of efficiency so uh the naturalselection would basically get rid of thebad guys and the good guys would remainthe ones with the lowest fees and thehighest Trust basically that they haveand once you allow them to do to dothese things if you don't I mean this isthe system that we live in today if youwant to you know become a bank or acustodian you have to jump through allthese hoops and you're not allowed tocompete freely basically in the marketand if you [ __ ] up you get bailed out soyou're allowed to take riskor I I've um I I positioned it toMatthew that I said well we do have freebanking at the moment actually we do wehave it with Bitcoin that is actuallyFree banking yeah this is why people areexcited about this exactly that's thereason because now we have thefundamental this is also the reason whyI think ecash is coming back now becauseit needed big Bitcoin ecash is almostworth nothing if you don't have a freeSovereign monetary layer below it basemoney yeah you need to base money and wefound the base money of the internet sowe needed Bitcoin uh we needed Bitcoinin order for these ideas to come backI'm very convinced of that imaginebuilding something like that like withfull privacy on the Fiat rails we werejoking about this yesterday I mean it'sbasically you know you go to jailstraight to jail basically I could offerthe same service with my bank accountright have the Euros flow in and thenissue ecash to my friends so they canuse my bank account uh privatelybasically but once you start doing thatit's game over so no one will no one isinterested in giving you privacy in theFiat world it's just not not only youknow it's possible but no one would doit no one would dare do it and withBitcoinwe don't ask for permission we justbuilt on top of it and this is why youcan see these things pop up again andevery wallet service built on top of uhcashew so for example the one I've JustSeen on my phone is that have a separatemint is it one mint per service or canthere be multiple mints no there can bemultiple mints and all of the walletsthat are there today can use multiplemints so basically what you can imagineis you have this this app on your phoneand it's connected to many manydifferent mints you have ecash fromdifferent mints and once you want tomake a payment from you know you'reyou're the customer of mint one I'm thecustomer of mint 2 how do I pay you isthe answer to that is lightninglightning connects all the minutesbasically it's like a connecting tissuebetween them it's the clearing layerbetween mints basically they use Bitcoinfor their intermittent clearing that'swhat they do intimate clearing um sowhat is the incentive to set up a mintwhy would somebody do itum to I mean what is the incentive torun a wallet like well it's a Satoshiwell I've seen where the people operatewhatever Satoshi make a small amount offees yes that's probably what they doand this is what you could do also withthe cashew mint oh so so there'll beoptional feesthis is a it's a business question thatsomeone has to figure out I mean uh Ilove how you answer your questionsyeah I mean it's it's not directlyrelated to the technique itself rightit's possible so that to give you theanswer yes that could be but you couldalso offer it for free what we just usedwas for free you're basically ananarchist without being annoying whichis which I quite likethat can be annoying if you like I don'tI don't imagine you can be okay so couldI so could I build a cbdcholy [ __ ] soum there is a project called gnu tallerit is a Swiss project it's a researchproject LED in Switzerland but it'sacross Europe people are researching itin different universities it's calledglutala and it's I think with fedimentand cashew the third ecash project thatis significant on the planet so gnuTaylor is an attempt to build an ecashsystem for Fiat and they actuallyapplied for the ecbs uh you know how doyou say when when they're looking forsolutions for cbdc Nutella is one of theapplicants and so they applied on theirtender yeah so uh in the PrivacyCommunity I think it's it's fair to saythat amongst all the different cbdcproposals that there are the ecash oneis the least worst so that is the onethat people would prefer if we if we geta cbdc I'm a very big you know I'm verymuch against cbdc's themselves but it isfair to say that if we have to get onewe should probably get an e-cash one anduh glue Nutella is applying for that buthere's a Twist they kind of [ __ ] upthe protocol because they need to makeit compliant with the regulations uhwhile in cashier you have perfectprivacy for you and me for the receiverand the sender in Nutella they built aback door for the receiver so the statecan still text the the uh the the Idon't know the business or whateverreceiving money so what they offer isperfect privacy for the sender you as acustomer but no privacy for the receiverfor example the merchant but as asolution that's way better than thesystem we have right now it is waybetter than than these normal you knowdatabase entries where it says this saysDanny's money yes so your bank accountis is definitely worse than what Nutellawould dothat's quite cool they're never gonnaallow it now exactly this is also my myview they're not gonna allow it I thisis my I would bet that and I think likethey would probably take uh the proposalof a very large bank that has theresources and doesn't care about privacyyes okay obviously privacy is hugelyimportant to youum you're um an orange faced sunglasswearing this is something like thatwe're in uh individualum but how much can you tell me how muchcan you tell me about your background interms ofwhat are the triggers to get you towhere you've become how you've becomewho you are somebody you know we'vespent 24 hours with you now understand alot more about what you care about whatyou don't care about your you care aboutprivacy uh you care about free marketsbut you're very practical about it allas well you're not uh I don't feel likeyou're ideologically driven you're justuh almostyou've almost driven by uh fairness andproper incentivessounds about right so like what late howdid what led you to herewell I'm I'm uh I'm a child of theinternet andum I've been I've been around on theinternet for a long time and I've cycledthrough identities over and over and Ithink it's a very good thing to do onthe internet because you just openyourself up to toto the world basically and you leave atrace whatever you do I mean all myposts from back in the years or whateverthey're still there so for me that isimportant because I spent much a lot oftime there I need to just assure thatyou know I I keep my secrets that I wantto keep and share with friends that Iwant to share them withum but I'mI'm also a bitcoiner and I think thatBitcoin is extremely important uh forfor the freedom of of humans I think youknow governments come and go ideologiescome and go and but Bitcoin itself issomething that will probably outlivethese cycles of you know groupaffiliation and trying to impose yourviews onto someone else I think it'sit's a technology that we need toprotect andthe most important thing that we can dois to assure that everyone who wants toparticipate in it will be safe so thatmeans uh we they can they can stayprivate if they want to that everyone isinvited to join we need to be able towelcome every developer in Bitcoin Ithink it's literally the lifeline ofBitcoin is education and development andI think the education part is goinggreat I think on the development side wecan do a lot better to to increase treesto make better incentives for people tojoin this this community basically andstart working on it what do you think ofthe loss of developers over the lastyear or so is that concerning youabsolutely yeah it's a very very bigconcern especially I mean as a developerit's myself uh it's it's a it's verydangerous for Bitcoin to see this Iwould rather see the number ofdevelopers go up steadily because weliterally need every single person outthere also you know this is an outcroyou know I'm calling everyone listeningif you know a little bit of coding andyou just didn't do anything yet forBitcoin then start looking into it startlooking into cash you start looking intowhatever you want but start contributingbecause that's how you start and everysingle contribution I think is valuablewe need to increase the number ofdevelopers just exponentially in orderto make this project a success I'm veryconvinced of that and so seeingdevelopers leave for different reasonsfor example being sued by somepsychopath for example is one of thereasons why people choose to leave ornot join Bitcoin four years into alawsuit myself I can testify that it'shorrific and a horrific process to gothrough so we need to end that but and Ihope more developers come on anonymouslylike yourself so that threat doesn'texist butum I've been concerned by the number ofdevelopers leaving my brother keeps mybrother's a researcher on the show andhe keeps bringing it up saying we shouldbe talking about this more I knowthere's some people out there doing goodwork to try and recruit and incentivizedevelopers but there's a lot ofcompanies or individuals who hold enoughBitcoin uh to be able to support moredevelopers and I wish they would itsounds like a no-brainer to me I mean itsounds like the or the best way tomanage your risk if you're a largeholder of Bitcoin is to invest indevelopment this is you know it's whatkeeps your money alive basically I thinkfor me it's a I think many many whalesout there don't know exactly how to helpI've heard that over and over again thatyou know they would wish but they don'thave the rails or don't don't know whereto go and where to startum probably that that's also somethingthat we can improve a lot there's opensets for example it's a foundationthey're multiple like you can go toBrink and give them money and they willdistribute it to developers I think it'syou know just from a risk managementperspective if you're just imagineMichael Saylor has now 140k Bitcoin howmuch of that should I mean just rationalthinking how much value is in thatit must be well it's like buying a caryou need to keep it maintained right 3.6billion or something something like thatyour calculator as he tell you yeah hetweeted it yesterday uh 4.17 billion4.17 billion souh it's uh it's loose change for MichaelI mean I'm not I'm not going to call himout here I mean I don't know if he is Imean he's doing a lot of stuff forBitcoin I'd be interested to know howmuch he's contributing towardsdevelopers because those developers arelike Guardians for his 4.175 Bitcoin noit's not calling anyone oh just thinkabout it it's just the rational choicethat you should consider if you holdenough Bitcoin then you should give itto the developers that keep your moneyalive this is what every person withcouple of brain cells should reallyconsiderum I recently had Sergey from bitrefillon the show and he he was very practicalwith his opinions on bitcoin and uh hewas very much uh taught very muchtalking about utility over ideology andI know this is something you tweetedabout Danny's give me do you want tobring up the tweetum I'm going to read your Tweet mine yesif you're the reason a pink hairedcommie they them doesn't joinuse or develop Bitcoin you're probablyan enemy of Bitcoinyou may not think of yourself in thatway but it's true you failed to separatetiny personal and significant ideologyfrom the bigger goaltalk to me about thisI mean Bitcoin I think goes through thecycle that every movement goes throughwhich is once it grows it attracts manymany more people that start projectingtheir ideologies onto the movement thisis has happened to the hippie movementto the anarchist movement to anybasically any movement that became largeenough and it's happening with Bitcoinas well so this is a very natural thingto happen I thinkbut I thinkyou know once once the newcomers startconflatingthe core idea of Bitcoin which is to bethis immutable monetary system thatwe're building to escape the Fiat systemonce you start conflating that with yourideology you're putting off potentiallyhalf of the planet and this is justabsolutely not compatible with the goalsof Bitcoin which in my mind is to growas fast as possible before states canco-opt it and take it away from usbasically so if you're increased andthis is also again just a purelyrational choice I think if you'reinterested in the success of Bitcoinwhat you should do is is to welcomeeveryone who can join and you know thisis just a joke if but if you if you'rebasing that on the color of the hair orthe pronouns they use or whatever thenyou're clearly missing the point whatyou're doing is you're fighting for yourown ideology and not for Bitcoin becauseif you thought of Bitcoin you would besaying I don't care what you look like Idon't care what you believe if you wantto support Bitcoin you're my friendthat's that's all I think of it wellthis is why we've worked so hard to tryand bring as many progressives intoBitcoin which sounds counter to whatyou're doing but actually is to try andmake Bitcoin as open and uhunideologically driven as possiblebecause there is there is certainly a aright wing slash libertarian bent to alot of uh to bitcoin itself and a lot ofthe ideas regarding Bitcoin and I thinkso we've tried to we've tried to movethe education away from that but tryingto have as wide a range of voices aspossible on this show but I mean I Icertainly think I've been guilty of thatsometimes what you said there and Ithink taking it back to immutable moneythat's all we're trying to do is isprobably a very good thingum we will be stronger if we canseparate these ideologies also from theoverall goal because that makes youvulnerable it can basically this is alsosome of the reasons why people leave isbecause people start talking aboutideology so much instead of the you knowthe bigger goal of growing Bitcoin Ithink again the most important thing isthat the number of bitcoiners goes upand I don't care what they believe in intheir daily lives I literally don't careI mean because it's not interesting Ilove thisokay can we talk about AIlet's talk about AI all right Dannyyou're going to lead this one well wewent out last night with ob and yourselfKelly and we were talking a little bitabout um so I thought I was using AIturns out I'm not even scratching thesurface so we got into uh you're justusing a clever database like barelyum but we started talking about is itbaby GPT I think it was talking aboutbaby GPT and something called Auto GPTso this came off the back of you knowthe um letter that Elon Musk assignedbasically saying we need to pausedevelopment while we figure out what'sgoing on yeah because we might all dieyeah but it sounds like that might betoo late can you explain what that babyGPT or whatever it's called is uh so I Idon't know exactly what baby GPT is Ijust heard about it yesterday as wellbut what I can imagine it is is thatit's it's something on top of chat gbtso chat GPT is basically this you knowstupid machine where you put in a promptand it gives you text out but so this isjust single module what it does but uhfrom what we know about you know fromcognitive science basically is that ahuman brain is built out of differentdifferent modules doing different thingsone of them is to generate text forexample generate speech in your brainbasically but there are other parts thatwill just take the generated thoughtsand evaluate them for example introspectthem just criticize yourself before youspeak for example you know you have athought then you rethink it again andyou improve it and then you speak andjust building these um I don't think Ihave that part yeah it can be turned onand off and it depends also on severaldifferent let's say neural chemistry inyour brain happening whether that partis strong or weak but once you once youbuild these more intricate or moresophisticated systems with you know thecore generator in the heart but allthese different feedback loops into itthat can take different data for examplevisual data again and also evaluate itwith the generated text and so on youend up with truly you know frighteningor magical things depending on how youwant to look at it and the other thingthat Obi was saying is that these nowthese systems that have been developedwhereinstead of relying on like open Ai andchat gbt and you can create like apretty dumb AI a very basic Ai and getchat gbt or whatever other system toteach to teach itand then you can run that on your owncomputer and within I think you said 30hours you can get to like 95 as good asTech GPT so theand then that's completely like out ofokay that's out of the bag yeah yeahthis is why this this letter that thesepeople are assigning to stop developmentfor six months uh in open AI or whateveris absolutely useless because uh even ifyou make open AI stop their developmentthere are already multiple guitarprojects out there that you can justdownload on your on your computer youcan run something like jet GPT on yourMacBook uh just leveraging the fact thatopen air has already spent so muchresources in training their AI youbasically spin up a stupid small AI onyour computer and make it learn from theAI that just you know needed so muchresources to to learn about it in thefirst place so the future will be thatit will be running on your computer itwill be your non-custodial AI basicallyrunning on your computer and there isthere's going to be no way of stoppingthis like literally no way and also SamAltman yeah [ __ ] him butum same[Music]AI but um he sold a large chunk of hislike equity in open AI Microsoft at likefairly low valuation for what thatcompany isand Obi was saying basically he knowsthe gigs up and in six months likethere'll be just a million differentimplementations that you can run on yourcomputer yeah it depends like whetherthese companies manage to keep theirMonopoly on AI or not okay so what Iwant to know is you know you said youcan spin up an AI on your computer Iwant to know if an AI has gone out thereand spun up its own AI will it tell youor it might it might go look I've donethis you can't stop me do you see what Imean whether it's made a decision to goimagine giving an AI some Bitcoin andmaking it you know able to to orderstuff on the internet by a server justreplicate itself on the server pay forthat server with Bitcoin spin up us spinup a shop a web shop selling a service Idon't know uh uh this is the end ofTerminator three have you have you seenthe end to terminate three I've not seenterminate three not seen the start of itI meango on YouTubeso I've got a question for you you knowhow there's likeum we can teach a computer to beat us atchess every single time will an AI learnto trade Bitcoin better than everyBitcoin trade in the world and just winevery single trade that's literally whatall the Traders are doing today I meanhigh frequency trading is basically AItrading no one I meanno one should trade manually becausewhat happens when AI isn't competingwith AIS which is the better yes youknow what they do in the New York StockExchange there's this interesting storyso they have these computer programstrading in New York Stock Exchange bythe way a fun fact the property aroundthe New York Stock Exchange is the mostexpensive property latency because thelatency it's the latency with your[ __ ] internet cable from yourcomputer to The Exchange that makes adifference I do because I've seen amovie that's all about trying to reducethe latency of like for hyper frequencytrading I can't remember so the New YorkStock Exchange when you buy a serverthere or rent a server they give you theguarantee that your cable no matter howfar it is from the outlet will be thesame length as everyone else's Cable inthe same room [ __ ] have you seenTerminator yeah of course have you seenTerminator three I'm not sure if yousearch for the end of Terminator threeI know it's going to be uh it's a threeminute video is that about right yeahprobablythis is just a brilliant bitwhy didn't he tell uswhy did he lead us down herethank youto livethat was his missionpretty slow endI was never really stopping itJohncould justLet It Gois it a bomb yeah[Applause]can somebody hear methere's High type machines[Music]John Connorit's John ConnorCrystal Peakwhat the hell is happeningwho's in charge thereI amConnor can you help usI really know what's happeningdid you know him say there was never anystopping them yeah by the time Skynetbecame self-awareit had spread into millions of computerservers across the planetordinary computers and Office Buildingsdorm rooms everywhereit was softwarein cyberspacethere was no system corecould not be shut downthe attack began at 6 18 pmjust as he said it wouldJudgment Daythe day the human race was nearlydestroyed by the weapons they built toprotect themselves[Music]I should have realizedour destiny was never to stop JudgmentDayit was merely to survive ittogetheruh-huh so Mr Summit 2023. uh he tried totell usbut I didn't want to hear itmaybe the future has been writtenI don't knowall I know is what the Terminator taughtmenever stop fightingand I never willthe battle has just begunpriming the communityah it doesn't have the music it's likebut do you understand why I brought thatup right yeah yeah so and then so plotplot I'm gonna give away the plot so umif you haven't seen Terminator and youwant well first you haven't seen ityou're a [ __ ] but if you haven't seenit you want to see it uh just skip thisbit but Terminator I think I think asMatthew was talking about this was itMatthew no Freddie yeah Freddie Freddieso Terminator one is based on infiniteLoopand so you come back and you stop theTerminatorum but you never really stop it so it'sjust the infinite loop I think theTerminator 2 was based on linearand I think Terminator 3 was based on Ithink there's a continuation of linearbut it was like you could never stop ityou're never going to stop it but youhad to be ready so be so be prepared andbe prepared to survive to fight backyeah do you think this is realistic Imean it sounds a bit fatalistic actuallyto assume that things will go wrong fromthe get-go not from the get-go but Ithink who has explained to us that thinkof it in terms of uh errors and bugs solet's not be fatalistic about AI butthere will be bugs and what if what if abug in AI is the fact that it tried tokill usyeahum I mean I think before something evenremotely to what we've seen can happenthere needs to be a human that needs tomake the decision first to build an AIthat should kill all humans so you needsomeone with a bad intent first a humanwith a bad intent I think to to get intoa situation like that I I think it's youdon't think you see you don't think anAI if it is an AI that itself becomesself-aware that makes its decisionitself yeah isn't that the point of AIit thinks for itself yeah I think thisis generally known as AGI thisartificial general intelligence wherepeople assume that it will be able tomake decisions and has motivation to dostuff which you it hasn't been told todo right like a human you would just sitin a room and then just come up with agoal like I want to move somewhere andsee something but an AI wouldn't do thatlike a classical AI wouldn't do it youwould need to have a human that tells itsome first initial goal that initialgoal could be just survive no matterwhat no matter what happens survive ifyou give an AI that goal which soundsfirst I mean it's a dangerous goal togive then it might start you know takingconsiderations of you know maybe I killall the humans that's how I survive sous humans are we given a goal to surviveis that inherent within our biology orour Evolution does our brain developwith goals there's a that's anunanswered question I think but there'sthere are theories that say that youknow the entire brain and everythingthat we have is just something for theDNA to actually replicate so the theactual goal of life is in the DNA itselfwhich is to replicate the DNA so thenreplicate improve and survive yeah andeverything follows from the replicationjust you know everything that even thatthe fact that you go seek food but alsomaybe even the fact that we travel tospace to explore the universe might becaused by this initial goal that kickedoff this development which is for DNA toreplicate so this is this is one of theideas oh we're gonna go deep now I kindof need some weedum so this so I would question then wasour DNA programmedto evolve orand to replicate or did it Sparkfrom a primordial soup and it was afluke of that it could have been a happylittle accident and it could be thatmany happy little accidents happened butall of them died and just one survivedwith this property of being able toreplicate so perhaps even withoutsomebodytelling an AI to survive it could belots of hundreds of thousands of littlehappy accidents and one of them has thesurvival Instinct it could be it couldbe that if you just generate many manydifferent AIS with different goals thatthe one with the you know the drive tosurvive will be actually the one thatsurvives because it will kill off allother AI yeah if it's if it's necessaryfor survival maybe yes but again I thinkin that you know it's like saying wehave Gene editing now with crispr forexample yeah right so people arefreaking out about it because it willprobably kill Humanity it could happen Imean we could produce a virus I mean weshouldn't but someone could produce avirus that just kills everyone it'spossible but in order for that to happenyou need you need a person that has thisgoal I don't think that or an AI withaccess to crisprdoing what and whyso just to survivewhat does what would that mean to the AIdoes that mean current threats or futurethreatsI mean so if an AI recognizes that itwas created by humans it might recognizethat only humans can end it therefore itkills off the humans before the humanscan end it and that's part of itssurvival does it plan its survival aheadyeah it probably plans it because I meanit needs to know the outcomes of itsactions that's how you make good actionsbut uh I mean why are why aren't wediscussing the the possibility of a goodsymbiosis with an AI maybe that's theway the AI survives is to have the bestkind of symbiosis with humans justliving along with them and improvinghuman life so it can still persistbecause maybe we will be able to youknow turn it off and it realizes that inorder to be not turned off it needs tobe actually useful I think we're cynicaland fatalistic though and life imitatesI think yeah it does and I think youknow these these stories are onlyinteresting if they are you knowfatalistic like that yeahumoh yeahI think we're I think we're all gonnadie I do well on that note look at thisoh great you're going to show us howwe're gonna die yep uh so this issomething Obi showed us again last nightthis is like I don't know what I don'tknow what you call that a basically arobot that's going to enter it's anAndroid yeah an Android there you go andlook when this is going to be releasedwell it's number 23 this is called 1Xtext for tech for anyone listening youknow what this is it's like iRobot it'siRobot do you remember the go to YouTubeIf you must have seen iRobot do you knowwhat I think I Robot shouldn't haveworked and it worked the movie I meanyeah it shouldn't have worked but it didwork but do um find you know the scenewhere it's got them all together and allthe robots yeah it moves yeah can youfind that sceneum but you were not so uh you're a bitskeptical on this thing right yeahI amum detective what are you doing he saidthe evolving program with three laws sothat means we have 1 000 robots thatwill not try to protect themselves if itviolates a direct order from a humanI'm that one who willto check to put your gun down why do yougive them facesfriendly them all up make them look allhuman these robots are not you can makea great meme oh yeahare you as our propertythese things are just lights andClockwork[Applause]let me ask you something docjust thinking you're the last sane manon the face of the Earth make you crazybecause if it doesmaybe I am[Music]no that's itlove it I just absolutely love this Imean the film shouldn't worked when it'sexplained it shouldn't worked when youwatch the trailer it shouldn't work butit actually did work so when you seethis uh do you get afraid of itumI would have designed it differently Ican't figure out if he's just got like apair of like smart trousers and shoes onyeah I'm a bit skeptical that this thingwill actually be as agile as they saybecause as far as I know the state ofthe art is Boston Dynamics and that islike a bunch of uh hydraulic motors thatreally you know you can you can hear themotor uh running and there's weird dogwalking there have they got any video ofthis yeah I don't I don't know there'sNeo and Eve I don't think no I thinkit's called Neo Eve are you sure I thinkwhat's the most impressive about this isthe set of investors well that's wayless cool yeah that's like that beam youknow the meme with the like is it thehorseexactly this is how they will look likeI think so they're on Wheels they can'teven walkokay I'm way less scared of it now yeahthat's proper budget look at his facebut actually I think before before thesethings will become I mean it's beingdemoed here as well but I think theserobots will be much more important inproduction and then com you know in infactories uh doing doing manual work youcan buy the Boston Dynamics robots can'tyou no yeah can you on the websiteshould we buy one I think like 100 Grandwhat ah [ __ ] I kind of want one man thedog yeahknockoffs I mean Chinese knock-offsreally something yeah yeah for theBoston Dynamics yeah for the dark itselfhave you seenum Metal Head oh what's the series uhBlack Mirror yeah of course I mean it'sbasic it's literally Metal Head yeahwhich by the way I think that's the bestBlackBerry episodebut they're have you seen the video ofthe one where they gave her a gun yeah Idid have you seen it I don't think so ohmy God go to YouTube search for BostonDynamics dog gun it's [ __ ] insanethese things can run fast yeah this isgonna blow your mind and freak you outthat one watch this this is absolutelyinsane[Music]this is a knockoff this is not fromBoston myself so it's even worselaughsisn't that [ __ ] freaky it's so weirdimagine you went to your front door andthat was outside I mean this is what thewars of the future would look like nowfor sure for sure so that's not even aBoston Dynamics one right can we get itcan we let's go and buy onethat's creepy can you get the BostonDynamics website up thereyeah you just gotta contact yeah butwhat does it sayuh I want one let's get oneso sookayobviously AI we believe we can do somegood things we're already using versionsof AI That's not real AI uh it is it isit's not our artificial generalintelligence it's not AGI but it'sdefinitely AI have you told him howyou've been using it yeah but again likeI say it's we're not even scratching thesurface so Cali was telling meum there's this website that's likeGitHub for AI projects I don't know yeahum and there's a program called Jarvis Ithink did he say Microsoft's they'vecreated this well there there are AISalready that can make use of other AISso you can have like one Central AI thatknows you know that has the ability toGoogle uh to recognize images torecognize speech produce speech thedifferent AIS and then you can buildlike something like a meta AI thing thatknows how to access these other AIS soonce you start putting these thingstogether which we didn't start yet we'rejust barely you know seeing how open AIcan do text recognition and imagerecognition at the same time whichalready is very powerful but once youput these things togetherjust goes exponentially from there soyou can ask one AI to do it to do a taskfor you and it'll go out and like useall the other AIS to complete that taskthen come back to you with the completedtask what about the task that we need atthe moment uh I think that file's goneor ask AI I have I was literally goingthrough like troubleshooting with GPTwhat's your task uh so we had a filecorrupt and I've lost itum and I've confined the file but theaudio is like cut off halfway throughum well I don't know if I can find theoriginal file basically I'm trying tofind a recover a file for my computerthe file recovery software won't workand I was like going through ittroubleshooting which actually was T3 itgave me some good options but I stillcan't find it so what we were thinkingcan we use we've got the audio from thecamera but it's not this quality it'snot this mic quality it's from thecamera so I sound a bit echoey and tinnybut we also do have my voice patternsfrom this so could we take the two andget AI to uh uh basicallytake my voice from thistake my uh the words I said and redothem can we go yeah I think we canfantastic idea I don't know if there isan AI that can do that just uh let meshow you this this is insane now all youhave to do is record reference vocalsand replace it with the train model thatany musician you like which is exactlywhat I did I found this Kanye style beaton YouTube I wrote eight bars and I'mgonna record them now and then I'm gonnahave ai Kanye replace me I got a fantasythat's beautiful that's dark and twistedbut I attacked the whole religion allbecause of my ignorance what was Ithinking that was some [ __ ] [ __ ] I lostAdidas but I'm still Yeezy back in thekitchen man I'm a genius boys in thehood just like I'm easy Kanye Wheezysouth side of Chicago life ain't easyall praise be the Lord Jesus dondaplease rest easy all right let me cut itthere let me cut it there so let's hearthose vocals I just recorded now withKanye over them I got a fantasy that'sbeautiful that's dark and twisted but Iattacked the whole that sounds perfectit's insane isn't ithonestly this stuff the speed of changewe're seeing with everything at themoment it's like almost every daysomething news coming out yeah it's inthe last couple of months and it's beengoing crazy you can close your eyes fora couple of days and you won't recognizeyour environment anymore it's insaneyeah it's literally insane and wealready know they're replicating aroundthe world on computers connected to theinternet and they could be well whatevertheir AIS are talking to each other Iwonder if two AOS I'm like oh yeah mateI've got an idea well that's like theplot of her isn't it that yeah andthat's the plot ofum Terminator Okay so you could havethey'd be like all right I've got anidea we need to get rid of these humandickers but I'm very very uh optimisticabout it I think it just solves so manyproblems at once it makes work so mucheasier people are also concerned aboutall the jobs job loss and thateverything that it will lead to I thinkI think it's good that it leads to jobloss which is have to find a way to dealwith it yeah no I agree with that I meanthe the kind of I mean we made adocumentary here in Bedford and part ofthat was driving up to one of the Amazonwarehouses these places are Grim I meanthey're they're I think they are wellwe've essentially replaced bookshops onthe High Street where you're going andyou would speak to somebody like a alocal and they'd talk to you about thebooks and you've you know you throughsome and buy one to these giant [ __ ]warehouses where people were clockingclock out and they're just doing arepetitive manual job but everythingthey do is tracked to the minute to thesecond to be as efficient as possiblethankfully we will replace those withrobots and get people out to enjoy thelife they were they were gifted ratherthan doing this [ __ ] [ __ ] forminimum wage I I agree with you but buthow my fear is this like kind of likedark side of Silicon Valley wherebyum we concentrate the wealth into a fewand fewer people and there isn't anopportunity for them to use that timefor other productive things that's myfear the other side is potentially whatwe do is we we make things moreefficient for being able to provide forother people so you know we head towardsthat Singularity on energy so energy canbecome cheap and plentiful I just don'tknow which one I don't know which whichway we go I I I'm always cynical andskeptical of humans so maybe we shouldbe more optimistic about AI maybethey'll fix our yeahthoughts are faultsGod it's fascinating I think as humanswill be faced with a lot more with ournature even closer than we are actuallyalready are once we don't have to do allthe physical work anymore to survive soonce you don't have to go to workanymore because Society has evolvedthere you need you really need to askyourself what you want to do with yourlife I know many people and I respectthem a lot doing a lot of really heavywork with their bodies and they go towork because they need to in order tosurvive and sometimes they also say thisis you know this is the best ofrealities because what would I dootherwise and this is a question that weall need to ask ourselves right once youcome to a place where you don't have towork then you really need to askyourself what do you want to do I thinkscience and art and you know these theseuh things that we do in our minds aregoing to be much more important in thefuture because it you know the thenecessity of doing physical called workwill be lifted from our shoulders I'mreally looking forward to that it'sgoing to probably cause some kind of anexistential crisisbecause now we're faced with you knowwith the question what you want to dowhen um I used to work in advertisingLondon when I quit I had a year off workand I just said I'm not going to workfor a yearand the first month was really really[ __ ] hard because I did not know whatto do with my time when you can get upevery day and do what you wantit's filling that time at first becomesreally difficult I was like what am Igoing to do andyeah to begin with I kind of watched alot of TVsat on the couch and I was like I can'tcarry this on so I started going to thegym and then I would go and do any classwhatever there was I'd do I was doingPilates with a bunch of old ladies ateight in the morning and then I'd swimand and then what happened I started tofilm my time with exercise outsidecooking and I was probably 30 40 poundslighter than I am now I look great Ifelt great honestly life was [ __ ]brilliant and over the last five yearsI've refilled that with more and morework for some reason I've I've got ridof that amazing life I had to fill itwith a different life which is amazingin other ways but but it was brillianthaving that time have you ever had a lotof time off not like that now it wasamazing it was also at a time when mymum was dying so I got to spend a lot oftime with her and you know spent herlast year with her when you know notworking which was you know a gift tohave that time but it was good and Isometimes I I look back on that I thinkwhat am I doingwhat are you gonna do with your timeum I think I'm gonna keep working onbitcoin this is for me you know it'ssimilar to what I just described I thinkit's something that I could identify formy life as a very you know as this giantproject it's a worldwide project thatwill outlive myself and it it just needsmany people building the foundations ofit for maybe hundreds of years and Ithink it's it's a beautiful thing to beable to participate in something that isbigger than you I think this is what youcan end up with if you have enoughfreedom in your life to look around andlook for things that interest you andBitcoin is is the thing that I found Ithink there are many other things thatyou could do I really respect everyonedoing Arts and Sciences I think theseare these are the things that that justcarry us humans furtherum but I I will be probably justspending my time working on bitcoin likeso many others as well that's beautifulman what would you do Jenny keep workingon bitcoin too we're working on Bitcoinin a weird little way yeah you aredefinitely absolutely football for me itwill be focused on football but anywaywe've got a football match to go to areyou excited yes I amKelly you're an amazing human and uh I'mreally glad we got to meet and I want tospend more time with you and I want todo this againum thank you as soon as possible uhyou're an amazing asset to bitcoin anduh anything we can ever do to help youhave our details you reach out to uswhere do you want to send peopleum I'll send them over to my Twitterit's Kelly BTC and uh send them over tocashew.space if you're a developerplease look at it if you want to supportcashew then go there you'll find ways tosupport it and just look into Bitcoinplease help us build Bitcoin be adeveloper in Bitcoin look into how youcan contribute to open source projectsthank you brother you take care thankyou tooforeignmorning Kelly good morning Peter I'm not[ __ ] hell are you just giving me awayyou just gave me away as well you youCali's a secret name Peter is a secretname as well no that's my real name youhave the larger anonymity set than I do[ __ ] sake I was gonna be in Disguisemy name is Ben actually my name is Benoh[ __ ] that shit's too hot I don't know heyou and Gigi do thisoh manhow are you brother I'm doing reallyreally good thank you thank you forhaving me I'm a big big fan of your showso it's greatgreat to be here well thank you forcoming to Bedford cool you're uh you gotto be the uh first Bitcoin who came tomy bar yes I was at your bar and I wishyou a lot of success with it I thinkit's gonna be a success story I hope soI hope so I hope so rightum oh and you're coming to the footballtoday as well I forgot even about thatyou're basically going full Bedford fullprogram I saw most of Bradford today I'mgonna see the football match today whereyou're gonna winright wow so yes we're gonna win yeahbut I don't know if we'll win the leaguetoday but if we win we've kind of wonthe league it's very step by step stepby step so listen Ben Ark is a huge fanof yours we're uh we're big fans of BenBen's been on the show how many timesnow two three guys twice yeah he'scoming down to bed for forever next weekhe's like dude you gotta get you gottaget Kelly on the show that is so coolI'm I'm also a big fan of Ben myself heis basically my mentor in a sensehe's such a he's such a nice guy as wellhe's like a nice bitcoiner yeahabsolutely and so I got involved withBen because I started contributing toAlan bits a lot the project that he'sworking on and at some point he justasked me to join the team basically andwe started working togetherBen is really like in the beginning heheld my hands showed me a little bit howto you know how to get involved andprobably the reason why I'm sitting heretoday so I'm very very grateful he's anamazing personI agree I think he's an amazing personoh God I sound so deep the voice todaysound like Matthew majinski I wasn't inthe face I'm trying to go down as wellcan you hear that pleaseum uh so we also yesterday we hadum phobia with us uh from fetty mint anduh we got you out together last nightwhat a coincidence no fights no nofights at all no we had an amazingconversation actually I'm very friendlywith with the guys from famousespecially uh Eric uh known himum before I met Obi as well Eric isactually the person who uh ecash told meso I I also my Thanks goes to him he heearned a lot of respect in the communityfor that so he taught me what ecash isand that's the reason why I startedlooking into it and made thisalternative project cashew which uhtogether with fediment are the I thinkthe hottest ecash projects out there I'mvery happy that these projects are onbitcoin and not on any other kind ofsystem well let's get into that let's Imean there's so many things we couldtalk about with you today I know Dannytalked to you about all kinds of [ __ ]last night he's like Pete we could makethree shows for Kelly todayum but let's talk about ecash that's uhpertinent to bitcoin is right now uh bigup to David charm a bit of a bit of alegend in the digital currency spaceyeah absolutely I actually got to meethim in London a couple years ago oh uhwhere did that go that was good reallyinteresting uh I met a guy who was aperiod of reflectionum but uh just it was just incredible tobe with such a prominent person in theuh I would call him a bitcoiner reallybecause even though he worked onprojects previous to bitcoin obviouslyhe inspired the work he's uh cited inthe white paper you know he nearlycreated bitcoin maybe you know he nearlydid and as far as I know he doesn't likeBitcoin that much today I I couldn'tappoint a self-reflection and I I thinkhis dislike for Bitcoin is probably notdisliking Bitcoin it's more uhif there was another Bedford team thatcame up behind us and were reallysuccessful and it was great for the townI would probably struggle to enjoy itbecause it wasn't the one I didyeah maybe I I hope if he knows aboutcashew that he would be just proud tosee that his ideas are flourishing todayso he's he's should we just go into howhow it all started with him yeah pleasedo yeah so uh David charm is thisum legendary cryptographer and he hepublished this paper in 1982 so it's wayway before anything with Bitcoin it'sactually the first cryptocurrency likehistorically speaking is the firstcryptocurrency invented before you wereborn before way beforeI was a little boy I was just about tostart school so yeah and they had thisidea and it was way before also theinternet became a thing really right soum it was called you know makingsomething like making a payment systemwith blind signatures and what thisbasically allows you is to create anelectronic cash system that is perfectlyprivate uh it is not a decentralizedsystem like Bitcoin is it is more likehow to build a bank that's that's theway they thought about it before becausethere was no other way thinking about ithow to make a bank that doesn't know whoyou are how much you have and who you'retransacting with which is a completelyrevolutionary ideaand so that was 1982 and this idea justfloated around I guess for almost adecade and then they started thiscompany called digicash digicash is wellknown for its attempt to bring ecash tothe world well you say it's well now andsome people here won't realize thehistory of the project or why it failedso maybe you should tell a little bitYeah so I think digicash itself it had acouple of products I think the mostsuccessful one was uh toll booths so uhyou know you would have some kind of acard that you could use to drive throughthe toll booth and just pay anonymouslyso that was the idea I think that wasalso the cash cow for the company butthere were many other uh businessopportunities for digicash for examplelike the stories are crazy Microsoftapproached them to us you know theywanted to put in ecash wallet into everyWindows 95 copy just imagine that yeahthere was before before credit cards onthe internet took off that was beforepay people was there it was they almostput it into every home computer on theplanet just a bit before every uh homeMac had a copy of the Bitcoin whitepaper put on it yeah exactly yeah beforethat yeah exactly so um but that thatdeal never went anywhere so it probablyand that's when you when you startresearching it it's because DavidCharmed and just changed the terms ofthe contract and wanted more thanMicrosoft was able to giveuh that was Microsoft Visa alsoapproached him or them and wanted tobuild it into their payment system tomake a completely Anonymous paymentsystem probably an alternative to payingwith credit cards today on the internetalso didn't go anywhere so these arejust one two examples and there are acouple more where ecash could havebecome a de facto standard of how we payon the internet before any of thesepayment processors even came about butit didn't didn't happen probably andthat's again when you start researchingit it's about David Shaw I'm not notreally agreeing to the terms of these ofthese companies so yeah PayPal campscomes credit cards come now we have themand so total [ __ ] show everyone knowsexactly what you're doing you can becensored you know your accounts arebeing closed at a win and your creditcards are insanely bad you basicallyenter your private Keys every time youmake transaction into a website justimagine that you give the website theability to take all your money just formaking a 150 dollar payment or somethingso the state of payments on the Internetis absolutely bad and then no nothinghappened we just have these Legacypayment rails ecash is dead for 20 30years no one cares about it untilBitcoin comes about and with Bitcoin Ithink it kind of refreshed interest foryou know going back looking at these atthese Technologies yeah and David Chamis it was it was and is a huge advocateof privacy always discussed how is oneof the fundamental pillars of democracywithout privacy you don't have democracyand Bitcoin has a interestingprivacy story in that if you're smartenough if you're Cali or you're MattOdell you probably you know maxillabrand you understand privacy youunderstand the mistakes you can make butI would say from 99 of Bitcoin isthey're going to make a mistake andthey're going to give up their privacyand I think real privacy will come tobitcoin when it's taken out the hands ofthe user to actually figure it out itjust comes inherently and so myunderstanding of ecash is that it kindof does a lot of that for you yeah so abig disclaimer here because I don't wantanyone to confuse this ecash is acustodial system so it's a way to makecustodial apps like wallet of Satoshiand I'll just let's take what it doesSatoshi for the example because everyoneknows what it is to make something likewallet of Satoshi in a way that itdoesn't know what you're doing with allthese privacy benefits so it is you knowit could be as easy as using walletSatoshi but you don't hold your Bitcoinuh but I agree with you I think privacycan only win if it happens on a veryvery large scale that's basically youknow the requirement for privacy is thatyour anonymity set is large enough andas long as it is so easy to [ __ ] up yourprivacy in Bitcoin it's not really youknow useful for everyday folks I thinkthis is very important actually and alsothe reason why I'm working on this is tomake it kind of a defaultthere's been a lot of criticism recentlyfor the state of uh of custodial walletswithin lightning in that the majority ofpeople are using custodial walletsespecially some Nostra people are usingsomething like the Wallace of Satoshi Iused to use blue wallet I have a rangeof wallets I use now but custodialSolutions are a lot easier than runningyour own lightning notes significantlyeasier as uh significantly less frictionum is that something we should beworried about and I'm going to tee thatby saying I don't worry about it becausethe Majora the vast majority of myBitcoinis base chain Bitcoin I keep a verysmall amount uh in a custodial lightningwallet an amount where if I lost itwould be annoying but I wouldn't care abit like if I lose my money on my cashin my pocket on a night out it'sannoying but it does it's something thatsignificantly changed my life how do youfeel about the whole custodial versusnon-custodial uh I see it very similarlyso no one should store their theirwealth in a custodial service you justyou know we we should work all togetherto to explain it to everyone the walletof Satoshi is not your real Bitcoin youdon't hold the keys you can lose it andthe value proposition of Bitcoin itselfthat you're the sole cust you're thesole owner of your Bitcoin you have fullcontrol and sovereignty absolutely butstill I agree with you that custodialServices just it's de facto it's beingused not because people are stupid butbecause it gives them some certain valuethat other wallets cannot give it givethem so for example lightning addresslightning typical example that that issupported by many many custodial walletsbut not so much by non-costalia onesgetting tips on on Twitter just uh onNoster you you cannot you know you wouldhave to run your own server somewhere inyour basement to be able to receive tipswhile you're you know offline basicallyand that's why custodial services areused now the way I approach this youknow it could be formulated as a problemI just the way I approach this is thisis a realitythe biggest used the most used lightningwallet today is wallet of Satoshi nowwhat I'm proposing with cashew or withecash General generally is to justimprove the privacy of these users thatalready opted in for something like thatand they kind of they use they're kindof their their reasons why they want touse it I don't want to judge that but ifthey do and if we have a way to improvetheir privacy without any you knowdecrementing their user experiencethen we should do it okay cool okay solet's talk about ecash explain to mewhat ecash is and how it works and youknow where is it within the Bitcoinstack yeah so ecash is completelyseparate from Bitcoinyeah it works very very differently Ithink for bitcoiners it's a very uhAlien concept because what we are usedto is we have a blockchain that issomewhere in The Ether and you hold yourkeys on your wallet and then you make atransaction and you publish it to thisblockchain and then it gets getsrecorded in the blockchain right soecash works completely differently andwith ecash you basically hold not thekeys to your money but the money itselfand is represented as a piece ofelectronic data so it is you know I Itold Danny the story yesterday it is howI imagined Bitcoin to be when I firstheard about Bitcoin wrongly because itwasn't explained well to me but when Ifirst heard about Bitcoin I thought heywell that's that sounds like a torrentfor money it's a network of computerssharing some something and what Iimagined was that you hold kind of themoney in your hard drive and then whenyou want to pay something you take apiece of it and send it over a wire justyou know like you would send someonecache through an envelope for example uhbut yeah I was corrected that's not howBitcoin Works Bitcoin is the signing ona blockchain etc but that's actually howe-cache Works which is fine because Irediscovered this idea when when Idiscovered rediscovered ecash so ecashis a piece of electronic data that youhold on your device like your phone forexample that represents the money thatuh could be something on your Satoshiaccount and then you send it throughtelegram through email through someencrypted Channel or whatever to someoneelse and then so you're sending them apiece of data and then they hold thatpiece of data and that's the money yesexactly so that's why that thingyesterday with ob showed us with youwere able to send it hopefully offlineyeah so last night Cali did an examplewhich maybe at some point in the showyou should do for Pete you should sendhim some so just do it now how do I doit yeah we can do it I don't have myphone with it though there you go whatdo I needso you can send do I need to downloadsomething no you can send him the e-cashthat you sent me last night all right soall right let's do thisyou open your Safari browser and you goto cashew dot me that is one cachewallet there multiple cache walletscashier.me uh just disclaimer foreveryone listening don't put your moneyin there it's just for experimentationthis is still in development but I'mgoing to show you how your cash workshere so I have one SEC sorry I just needto go do I need to do receive e-cashum not yet so first you know it's a pushsystem it's in uh you know it doesn'twork like the lightning where you pull apayment I need to push your money overso I have now Dennis found there are a1024 satoshi's on there I'm gonna presssend ecash and just enter an amountlet's say 64 64 satoshi'ssend tokens so um Let's do let's do theuh the messenger way yeah you can opentelegram and send it to people I'm gonnalook so I get this random string nowthis is the money so I'm going to copythis just a normal copyI'm going now to Telegram and let's seeif I can I'm scrolling through this isuncomfortable for me but here we go Ifound you and now I just paste ityou just received a message I think yeahwith this random looking string you copythat that is the moneycopy thatand then you go to your to your cashierwallet and you say receive e-cash andpaste it in receivepasteah there we go it's gone that was itthat's that's really quick really coolvery cool zero Satoshi for you no tracesleft no one knows what just happenedand no there's no sending to anotherperson so there's no connection okay ithappened off bent we just send it to youthrough Telegramand so the the code I put in knowshow does that know what amount of moneythat is is that just an encrypted amountof moneyum so it's been signed by the server soI can I can explain centralization rightyes exactly so uh for for anyonelistening who might now wonder why can'tI just copy paste this money and send itto other people as well right so how doyou suppose yeah and that is theinvention of e-cash how it works is thatin order to complete the transactionwhat I just did I took my e-cash fromthe hard drive I sent it over to you andwhat you did upon receiving you justsend it to the server and said here are64 satoshi's burn them and give me a newone and yeah that burns it's invalidatedit cannot be double spent anymore butthe key point is here this ecash what Ijust sent you cannot be correlated towhat you sent back to the server sothat's the Privacy the server doesn'tknow that when it receives ecash fromyou to be recycled it doesn't know thatit's the same ecash that it gave mebeforethat's a blind signature thing I canactually there's a beautiful example onhow to imagine this how it works if youlike I just give you this example it's aphysical example andsoimagine you have a let's say a bankaccount right you have um and you wantto get ecash from your bank account andwhat you would do is you take the youtake a contract you write a contract onwhich it says Bank you owe me one BTCright if I get one BTC uh it says on acontract now you take the contract andyou put it into an envelope that is madeof carbon paper you know carbon paper isthe one where you're right on top of itpress it through right so you take anenvelope made of carbon paper and youput your contract inside that envelopeyou close it right and then you send theenvelope the closed one to the bank tothe mint we say and then mint says okayyou want to have a signature on theresend me one Bitcoin you send one Bitcointo the mint and the Min says okay yousend me Bitcoin and takes a pen andsigns it on the outside of this envelopeso on the closed envelope it makes thesignature and sends you back theenvelope now because this wasn't realpaper it was actually encryption you'rethe only one who can open the envelopeagain when you open the envelope whatyou get is a contract that you'vewrittenon which it says you're only one Bitcoinwith the signature of the mint but thekey point is that the mint has neverseen the contract this is a blindsignatureso when you can now this is the moneythe contract is the money you can nowsend me this contract via telegram forexample and I can take it and I can goto the mint and say hey mintyou know pay me one Bitcoin out andhere's the proof that I deserve itand then the mint will see this contractand say well I've never seen thiscontract before but I can see mysignature on there so I must honor thisI choose to honor this there is no wayto make sure that they will honor it butif they're if they're uh you know ifthey're honest and they they would butthe key point is they don't know thatthis contract would what I give them isthe contract that you made them to signokay that's how it works it's very coolvery cool um so the e-clash protocolthere's an e-catch protocol or is therea cashew protocol which is animplementation of Eco yeah ecash is amechanismum and cashew is a protocol to implementthat and so there would no be therewouldn't be any interoperinteroperability between say uh cashewand fediment no although they have verysimilar uh way of working it's not butthere's interoperability because it's aprotocol that there's interoperabilityacross casual wallets this is just onewallet that I showed you there like fourdifferent wallets so essentially we havethis uh blossoming ecosystem where wehave our base chain Bitcoin we have ourlightning whether it's custodial ornon-custodial we have liquid we havefedi mint we have cashew like a wholevariety of ways to now start using yourBitcoin elsewhere and in different waysyes absolutely yeah I've got a questionon that so you just sent 64 SATs youcould do that through lightningreasonably privately like why why shouldpeople care about cash so you can dothat about lightning and you should alsodo that about with lightningnon-custodially if you can and if youhave the ability and everything goesokay but there are a couple of problemswith that already first of all right nowwe don't have receiver privacy forlightning yet so if I pay you the 64sets and you make an invoice on yournote I know exactly what you notice andI can infer your balances and so on solightning has privacy issues on thereceiver side send aside it's excellentprivacy so you you have that and theother thing with lightning is that it isnot fully reliable yet so once you startstreaming sets for example you want tomake a payment every 10 seconds it'svery likely that one of these paymentswill get stuck and in the worst case youwill have to wait two weeks until youcan get it back so that's just howlightning works it's you know sendingthis hdlc across different nodes and ifone of them goes just offline in themeantime then you wait so althoughlightning is great and I urge people tolook into how to use it non-custodiallythere it doesn't cover all the differentways of how to use Bitcoin and withecash you can you know start doingthings that you cannot do with lightningfor example I could just put this ecashinto a data package from let's say Idon't know uh I want to make uh I wantto stream a video on Netflix right Icould I could design a Netflix where youdon't pay a monthly fee but you top upyour e-cash balance so you downloade-cash from Netflix by paying withBitcoin for example and then you justfor every minute that you want to streamyou just send them a bit of e-cash andthey can just see okay this is ecash Iissued this this person has the right toreceive one minute of video and you canjust keep on doing that with the kickwith the twist that they don't know whoyou are you don't even need an accounton Netflix in that model you just buythe tokens and then you spend them asyou as you use it and if you don't wantthem anymore you say please it out againon bitcoin on lightning or whatever yousend them the tokens they burn it andgive you back your Bitcoin that they oweyouvery cool so how far away is cashew frombeing uh live and able we're able to useit in a live environment so what we justdid was using it in a light environmentyes but you said uh you said it's uhbeta did you so cashier isum not even half a year old that Istarted working on this and a couple ofpeople who joined working on this withme so we're very very young but it's outthere you can try it and you canimplement it that's that's even waybetter than just you know trying it outthere if there are developers out thereso they're actual sets this isn't uh theactual real sets this is actual realecash that you can exchange for actualreal sets on Lightning see I always findthis use of the I was talking to Obiabout this e-cash term uh a distractionI think it's it misleads people intothinking they're using something elseand I know it's not actual SATs it's arepresentation of sets yeah but it saysokay then to me I agree with you I agreewith you becauseum it makes it makes it way easier to totalk about it and to imagine it but Ihaven't created a wallet here like Ihaven't signed up there is no there isno user accounts there are no wallets sobasically the server doesn't even knowthat you exist the server just said uhsomeone paid this lightning invoice I'mgonna give them ecash but if I lose thisphone then the money is gone oh okaythere's a way to back it up though thereis a way there's a way to back it up anduh we're also working on better ways toback it up so if Pete tried to send thatto me to like a moon wallet now wouldthat work yeah that would work reallyyeah what you do is you create aninvoice on your moon wallet and then youask the mint to pay the invoice for youand for that you have to give them thesetwo videos I want to see this okay buthow does how does thiswallet no it's made is it is there someis it an ID in my phone no but how do soif I close this browser and come backwill it still know those 64 cents itwill be stored in your browser browserdata there and that's it but it's likecash like when you make a cashtransaction no one knows who you areright pay invoice so I've got a 64invoice I'll make it a bit less becausethere will be fees yeahall right do 50 Cent invoicethere we goMoon Moon is notoriously slowis paying anyone listening to pay hisword holy [ __ ] that's [ __ ] cool thatis really cool okay what you just didthere is you burned ecash and you saidyou told them and please pay thisinvoice for me the mint doesn't have aconcept of you it doesn't know thatyou're one person or whatever and thelightning invoice that you just paidcannot be correlated back to any personso basically it's a pool of money youput it in and someone takes it out againcan he send me sets from my from hisMoon model into my e-cash wallet yes anddoes it and it's at the reverse yes itburns them and turns them into exactlyokay I wantjust because I'm me I want an app orsomething that I knowthat if I lose my phone I still got it Iwant I feelit's weird just going to a browser yeahbut Cali put the browser to my homescreen now so I have like a cashier uphere okay it's effectively in that butyou're using it is a browser I need aback I need a backup yes yeah yeahyou'll have just a seat phrase thathelps you to restore your cash it's notit looks like a Bitcoin seed phrase butit's not really the same thing but justby storing a seed phrase you'll be ableto just restore your ecash in case youlose the device and the Beautiful thebeautiful thing about it it's so simplelike money in that all it does is thatyou send it and receive it that's what Ineed to that's all I need that's that'sall you need from my pocketliterally my pocket does the same I haveit stores the money I have and I eithergive it or receive it and if you lose itit's gone yeah yeahit's so beautifully simple yes it is andso what we're looking at these walletsI've built I've built this for people tobe able to imagine what ecash is butthat is not really the goal for me withcashew itself cashew is supposed to be aprotocol it is already a protocol thereis a spec out there you can read it youcan start building stuff on it what Iimagine is that you know there will beand there are hundreds and thousands ofweb services out there who will you knowjust give you some service for yourBitcoin your website I don't know youwant to read news payroll news forexample then you top up your balance andthen you start reading the news and theproblem with that is the website thatallows you to do that can track exactlywhat you're reading because it knows itit's related to this one payment thatyou did they need to do it that's howthat's how custodial Services work yeahso uh cashew is basically a drop inreplacement you can almost all of thecustodial Services I know of today youcan take out this classical all databaseLedger where it says you have this andthis much money and whatever you canreplace it with the cache protocol andbuild something that has the samefunctionality but with this improvedprivacy for example you're you're miningright I am mining you have a you have aminer in a pool every Miner in a pool isa user of a custodial service right theyhave your Bitcoin and they send it outto you regularly when you join so thispool knows exactly how much you minethey know how much you earned yeah thatand they send it out on a daily basisyes you can do that with ecash and theydon't they don't know anything about ityeah I also wonder I've always wonderedon that because they paid on a dailybasis how much money is being wasted infees having a daily payout on my bit myI hope they're batching theirtransactions I don't know yeah no ideaum okay very cool how do you differ fromfediment so ferment is an excellentprojectum you know people also should look intothat cashier is not really trying tocompete with thatum rather as far as I understand I'm Imean I I don't want to talk too muchabout other people's projects theyshould do it but as far as I understandfediment's approach is more aboutCommunity custody so what they focus onand this is Eric's work and it'sexcellent like I'm a big fan of his workand they focus on this Federated aspectso you have multiple custodiansbasically they all share the keys to themulti-sick where the Bitcoin is storedand what we just did basically they doit with not only one mint like there isnot only one party controlling the mintbut there are end parties controllingthe mint which makes things a bit morecomplicated to build and to integratebut it gives you the increased risk adecreased risk of getting Rapportbasically you would have multiple peoplehave to collude in order to take awayyour your Bitcoin your real Bitcoin thatyou deposit it there so I guess that isthat is the fundamental differencebetween sediment and cashew but apartfrom that they as far as I can see usethe overall same concept yeah so they'resolving uh multisig for communitiesthey're becoming almost like a CommunityBank you're someone's pocket full ofcash yes and uh I I can see cashew justtaking over the entire web becauseso not only a package not only the cashin your pocket but every website thatyou use that has some kind of a balanceyou can use cashew and that will be it'svery easy to implement we just made itvery easy to implement again I can alsothink about like when we run ourconference Next Year everyone having acashew app and that being the paymentsystem for at the conference whereyou're buying tickets buying merchandisebuying beers it'd be like a I wasthinking about it with regards to verymint you could have a short-termFederation I can think of these usecases for everyone come to theconference has privacy at the event forall their interactions with each otherand it works kind of offline so youcould do it on a conference where youknow internet connectivity is bad forexample you can just use casualinternally because you have themidsomber listening to everyone anddoing these transactions and when youexit the conference again you go to thecounter and you say I want my Bitcoinback you give them your e-cash they giveyou a bigger Bitcoin I really like it itdoesn't make it doesn't make you anymoney doing it though there's noservices on there absolutely not this isa protocol and we're writing a protocolthat people can use to build stuff on II'm not you know I'm not running acustodial service or whatever I'mworking on this uh this this idea whoruns the mintum you can run a mint today there aremultiple mints uh there is an Ellen bitsplugin an extension that you can youknow when you install Olympics it givesyou this ability to do many manydifferent things with your lightningwallet one of the things that you can dois just three clicks literally andyou're you're running mint so if youwant to run a mint for your bar or yourcommunity or your website uh it's veryvery easy to set up you just need alightning node in the back end that doesthe lightning stuff and use one of thesewallets that we've writtenand is there an issue like a regulatoryissue for the whoever's running them inum I don't know I don't careI love it good answer why don't you whydon't you care it's not my business Idon't know I mean the world is Big thereare many different places out there youcan do stuff here but you cannot do itthere I mean why would I care peopleshould do whatever they think is best[ __ ] yes okay uhwhat criticism have you received anycriticism yesum definitely so first of all uh toavoid criticism and because I'm a realbitcoiner and I know what the value ofof holding your own Keys is okay I sayit again cash is a custodial servicedon't use it if you don't want to usecustodial services that is the mainpoint of criticism because people kindof assume uh that anything that iscustodial is bad per se I can understandthat they shouldn't touch what it doesSatoshi either right I'm just proposingthis strict Improvement on privacy onthings like well it is Satoshi thenthere are multiple other problems withcustodial Services themselves thatcashew also inherits for example it'shard to prove that you don't inflate thesupply so how do you know that ae-cashment didn't print more e-cash thanit has in Bitcoin reserves right it's akind of Unsolved problem we're literallyworking on it right now and there arepromising ways to do that but unsolvedbut solvable oh uh theoreticallyunsolved yet so there's no one I thinkout there who really knows how to do ityet but we're very close at it I hopewe'll do it so the moment that we knowhow to do it theoretically we will buildit practically but at the same time noone knows the same thing about what itis Satoshi you don't know if they holdthe Bitcoin that they say that they owedit to their customers that's very that'svery true it's the same problemcould youinstantlyum could you instantly burn all SATsreceived into lightning yes andtherefore you would at least knowif the ecash you receive is real becauseit they would I assume there's someerror when you send it toa lightning wallet there would be anerror if if they weren't real exactlythis is this is where the ideas actuallygo through this is a very fun funny thatyou actually follow this path becausethis is the way that you could try toimprove these Services have some kind ofan Epoch like a regular window timewindow where the supply has to be provenbasically publicly reserves kind of thatyou own the Bitcoin basically by cyclingit around in a you know uh in regularintervals basically you could do thatand once that doesn't work anymoreeveryone would know that there issomething fishy going on with the mintso in that regard you need to trust themand also I mean we've been talking aboutthis yesterday I'm not a big uh I don'tknow much about the Free banking ideasthat some Bitcoin is really know a lotmore about it and I think you've beenalso talking to people who who do but uhwe covered it yesterday with Matthewmajinski he's a huge fan of the the eraFree banking yeah exactly and there area couple of bit I'm learning from themas as we're building this uh thisprotocol uh which you know there's theidea that having a Level Playing Fieldwhere you can uh you allow uh differentmeans to pop up and offer these Servicesthe idea is that in in a world wherecompetition is free you would see anincrease of efficiency so uh the naturalselection would basically get rid of thebad guys and the good guys would remainthe ones with the lowest fees and thehighest Trust basically that they haveand once you allow them to do to dothese things if you don't I mean this isthe system that we live in today if youwant to you know become a bank or acustodian you have to jump through allthese hoops and you're not allowed tocompete freely basically in the marketand if you [ __ ] up you get bailed out soyou're allowed to take riskor I I've um I I positioned it toMatthew that I said well we do have freebanking at the moment actually we do wehave it with Bitcoin that is actuallyFree banking yeah this is why people areexcited about this exactly that's thereason because now we have thefundamental this is also the reason whyI think ecash is coming back now becauseit needed big Bitcoin ecash is almostworth nothing if you don't have a freeSovereign monetary layer below it basemoney yeah you need to base money and wefound the base money of the internet sowe needed Bitcoin uh we needed Bitcoinin order for these ideas to come backI'm very convinced of that imaginebuilding something like that like withfull privacy on the Fiat rails we werejoking about this yesterday I mean it'sbasically you know you go to jailstraight to jail basically I could offerthe same service with my bank accountright have the Euros flow in and thenissue ecash to my friends so they canuse my bank account uh privatelybasically but once you start doing thatit's game over so no one will no one isinterested in giving you privacy in theFiat world it's just not not only youknow it's possible but no one would doit no one would dare do it and withBitcoinwe don't ask for permission we justbuilt on top of it and this is why youcan see these things pop up again andevery wallet service built on top of uhcashew so for example the one I've JustSeen on my phone is that have a separatemint is it one mint per service or canthere be multiple mints no there can bemultiple mints and all of the walletsthat are there today can use multiplemints so basically what you can imagineis you have this this app on your phoneand it's connected to many manydifferent mints you have ecash fromdifferent mints and once you want tomake a payment from you know you'reyou're the customer of mint one I'm thecustomer of mint 2 how do I pay you isthe answer to that is lightninglightning connects all the minutesbasically it's like a connecting tissuebetween them it's the clearing layerbetween mints basically they use Bitcoinfor their intermittent clearing that'swhat they do intimate clearing um sowhat is the incentive to set up a mintwhy would somebody do itum to I mean what is the incentive torun a wallet like well it's a Satoshiwell I've seen where the people operatewhatever Satoshi make a small amount offees yes that's probably what they doand this is what you could do also withthe cashew mint oh so so there'll beoptional feesthis is a it's a business question thatsomeone has to figure out I mean uh Ilove how you answer your questionsyeah I mean it's it's not directlyrelated to the technique itself rightit's possible so that to give you theanswer yes that could be but you couldalso offer it for free what we just usedwas for free you're basically ananarchist without being annoying whichis which I quite likethat can be annoying if you like I don'tI don't imagine you can be okay so couldI so could I build a cbdcholy [ __ ] soum there is a project called gnu tallerit is a Swiss project it's a researchproject LED in Switzerland but it'sacross Europe people are researching itin different universities it's calledglutala and it's I think with fedimentand cashew the third ecash project thatis significant on the planet so gnuTaylor is an attempt to build an ecashsystem for Fiat and they actuallyapplied for the ecbs uh you know how doyou say when when they're looking forsolutions for cbdc Nutella is one of theapplicants and so they applied on theirtender yeah so uh in the PrivacyCommunity I think it's it's fair to saythat amongst all the different cbdcproposals that there are the ecash oneis the least worst so that is the onethat people would prefer if we if we geta cbdc I'm a very big you know I'm verymuch against cbdc's themselves but it isfair to say that if we have to get onewe should probably get an e-cash one anduh glue Nutella is applying for that buthere's a Twist they kind of [ __ ] upthe protocol because they need to makeit compliant with the regulations uhwhile in cashier you have perfectprivacy for you and me for the receiverand the sender in Nutella they built aback door for the receiver so the statecan still text the the uh the the Idon't know the business or whateverreceiving money so what they offer isperfect privacy for the sender you as acustomer but no privacy for the receiverfor example the merchant but as asolution that's way better than thesystem we have right now it is waybetter than than these normal you knowdatabase entries where it says this saysDanny's money yes so your bank accountis is definitely worse than what Nutellawould dothat's quite cool they're never gonnaallow it now exactly this is also my myview they're not gonna allow it I thisis my I would bet that and I think likethey would probably take uh the proposalof a very large bank that has theresources and doesn't care about privacyyes okay obviously privacy is hugelyimportant to youum you're um an orange faced sunglasswearing this is something like thatwe're in uh individualum but how much can you tell me how muchcan you tell me about your background interms ofwhat are the triggers to get you towhere you've become how you've becomewho you are somebody you know we'vespent 24 hours with you now understand alot more about what you care about whatyou don't care about your you care aboutprivacy uh you care about free marketsbut you're very practical about it allas well you're not uh I don't feel likeyou're ideologically driven you're justuh almostyou've almost driven by uh fairness andproper incentivessounds about right so like what late howdid what led you to herewell I'm I'm uh I'm a child of theinternet andum I've been I've been around on theinternet for a long time and I've cycledthrough identities over and over and Ithink it's a very good thing to do onthe internet because you just openyourself up to toto the world basically and you leave atrace whatever you do I mean all myposts from back in the years or whateverthey're still there so for me that isimportant because I spent much a lot oftime there I need to just assure thatyou know I I keep my secrets that I wantto keep and share with friends that Iwant to share them withum but I'mI'm also a bitcoiner and I think thatBitcoin is extremely important uh forfor the freedom of of humans I think youknow governments come and go ideologiescome and go and but Bitcoin itself issomething that will probably outlivethese cycles of you know groupaffiliation and trying to impose yourviews onto someone else I think it'sit's a technology that we need toprotect andthe most important thing that we can dois to assure that everyone who wants toparticipate in it will be safe so thatmeans uh we they can they can stayprivate if they want to that everyone isinvited to join we need to be able towelcome every developer in Bitcoin Ithink it's literally the lifeline ofBitcoin is education and development andI think the education part is goinggreat I think on the development side wecan do a lot better to to increase treesto make better incentives for people tojoin this this community basically andstart working on it what do you think ofthe loss of developers over the lastyear or so is that concerning youabsolutely yeah it's a very very bigconcern especially I mean as a developerit's myself uh it's it's a it's verydangerous for Bitcoin to see this Iwould rather see the number ofdevelopers go up steadily because weliterally need every single person outthere also you know this is an outcroyou know I'm calling everyone listeningif you know a little bit of coding andyou just didn't do anything yet forBitcoin then start looking into it startlooking into cash you start looking intowhatever you want but start contributingbecause that's how you start and everysingle contribution I think is valuablewe need to increase the number ofdevelopers just exponentially in orderto make this project a success I'm veryconvinced of that and so seeingdevelopers leave for different reasonsfor example being sued by somepsychopath for example is one of thereasons why people choose to leave ornot join Bitcoin four years into alawsuit myself I can testify that it'shorrific and a horrific process to gothrough so we need to end that but and Ihope more developers come on anonymouslylike yourself so that threat doesn'texist butum I've been concerned by the number ofdevelopers leaving my brother keeps mybrother's a researcher on the show andhe keeps bringing it up saying we shouldbe talking about this more I knowthere's some people out there doing goodwork to try and recruit and incentivizedevelopers but there's a lot ofcompanies or individuals who hold enoughBitcoin uh to be able to support moredevelopers and I wish they would itsounds like a no-brainer to me I mean itsounds like the or the best way tomanage your risk if you're a largeholder of Bitcoin is to invest indevelopment this is you know it's whatkeeps your money alive basically I thinkfor me it's a I think many many whalesout there don't know exactly how to helpI've heard that over and over again thatyou know they would wish but they don'thave the rails or don't don't know whereto go and where to startum probably that that's also somethingthat we can improve a lot there's opensets for example it's a foundationthey're multiple like you can go toBrink and give them money and they willdistribute it to developers I think it'syou know just from a risk managementperspective if you're just imagineMichael Saylor has now 140k Bitcoin howmuch of that should I mean just rationalthinking how much value is in thatit must be well it's like buying a caryou need to keep it maintained right 3.6billion or something something like thatyour calculator as he tell you yeah hetweeted it yesterday uh 4.17 billion4.17 billion souh it's uh it's loose change for MichaelI mean I'm not I'm not going to call himout here I mean I don't know if he is Imean he's doing a lot of stuff forBitcoin I'd be interested to know howmuch he's contributing towardsdevelopers because those developers arelike Guardians for his 4.175 Bitcoin noit's not calling anyone oh just thinkabout it it's just the rational choicethat you should consider if you holdenough Bitcoin then you should give itto the developers that keep your moneyalive this is what every person withcouple of brain cells should reallyconsiderum I recently had Sergey from bitrefillon the show and he he was very practicalwith his opinions on bitcoin and uh hewas very much uh taught very muchtalking about utility over ideology andI know this is something you tweetedabout Danny's give me do you want tobring up the tweetum I'm going to read your Tweet mine yesif you're the reason a pink hairedcommie they them doesn't joinuse or develop Bitcoin you're probablyan enemy of Bitcoinyou may not think of yourself in thatway but it's true you failed to separatetiny personal and significant ideologyfrom the bigger goaltalk to me about thisI mean Bitcoin I think goes through thecycle that every movement goes throughwhich is once it grows it attracts manymany more people that start projectingtheir ideologies onto the movement thisis has happened to the hippie movementto the anarchist movement to anybasically any movement that became largeenough and it's happening with Bitcoinas well so this is a very natural thingto happen I thinkbut I thinkyou know once once the newcomers startconflatingthe core idea of Bitcoin which is to bethis immutable monetary system thatwe're building to escape the Fiat systemonce you start conflating that with yourideology you're putting off potentiallyhalf of the planet and this is justabsolutely not compatible with the goalsof Bitcoin which in my mind is to growas fast as possible before states canco-opt it and take it away from usbasically so if you're increased andthis is also again just a purelyrational choice I think if you'reinterested in the success of Bitcoinwhat you should do is is to welcomeeveryone who can join and you know thisis just a joke if but if you if you'rebasing that on the color of the hair orthe pronouns they use or whatever thenyou're clearly missing the point whatyou're doing is you're fighting for yourown ideology and not for Bitcoin becauseif you thought of Bitcoin you would besaying I don't care what you look like Idon't care what you believe if you wantto support Bitcoin you're my friendthat's that's all I think of it wellthis is why we've worked so hard to tryand bring as many progressives intoBitcoin which sounds counter to whatyou're doing but actually is to try andmake Bitcoin as open and uhunideologically driven as possiblebecause there is there is certainly a aright wing slash libertarian bent to alot of uh to bitcoin itself and a lot ofthe ideas regarding Bitcoin and I thinkso we've tried to we've tried to movethe education away from that but tryingto have as wide a range of voices aspossible on this show but I mean I Icertainly think I've been guilty of thatsometimes what you said there and Ithink taking it back to immutable moneythat's all we're trying to do is isprobably a very good thingum we will be stronger if we canseparate these ideologies also from theoverall goal because that makes youvulnerable it can basically this is alsosome of the reasons why people leave isbecause people start talking aboutideology so much instead of the you knowthe bigger goal of growing Bitcoin Ithink again the most important thing isthat the number of bitcoiners goes upand I don't care what they believe in intheir daily lives I literally don't careI mean because it's not interesting Ilove thisokay can we talk about AIlet's talk about AI all right Dannyyou're going to lead this one well wewent out last night with ob and yourselfKelly and we were talking a little bitabout um so I thought I was using AIturns out I'm not even scratching thesurface so we got into uh you're justusing a clever database like barelyum but we started talking about is itbaby GPT I think it was talking aboutbaby GPT and something called Auto GPTso this came off the back of you knowthe um letter that Elon Musk assignedbasically saying we need to pausedevelopment while we figure out what'sgoing on yeah because we might all dieyeah but it sounds like that might betoo late can you explain what that babyGPT or whatever it's called is uh so I Idon't know exactly what baby GPT is Ijust heard about it yesterday as wellbut what I can imagine it is is thatit's it's something on top of chat gbtso chat GPT is basically this you knowstupid machine where you put in a promptand it gives you text out but so this isjust single module what it does but uhfrom what we know about you know fromcognitive science basically is that ahuman brain is built out of differentdifferent modules doing different thingsone of them is to generate text forexample generate speech in your brainbasically but there are other parts thatwill just take the generated thoughtsand evaluate them for example introspectthem just criticize yourself before youspeak for example you know you have athought then you rethink it again andyou improve it and then you speak andjust building these um I don't think Ihave that part yeah it can be turned onand off and it depends also on severaldifferent let's say neural chemistry inyour brain happening whether that partis strong or weak but once you once youbuild these more intricate or moresophisticated systems with you know thecore generator in the heart but allthese different feedback loops into itthat can take different data for examplevisual data again and also evaluate itwith the generated text and so on youend up with truly you know frighteningor magical things depending on how youwant to look at it and the other thingthat Obi was saying is that these nowthese systems that have been developedwhereinstead of relying on like open Ai andchat gbt and you can create like apretty dumb AI a very basic Ai and getchat gbt or whatever other system toteach to teach itand then you can run that on your owncomputer and within I think you said 30hours you can get to like 95 as good asTech GPT so theand then that's completely like out ofokay that's out of the bag yeah yeahthis is why this this letter that thesepeople are assigning to stop developmentfor six months uh in open AI or whateveris absolutely useless because uh even ifyou make open AI stop their developmentthere are already multiple guitarprojects out there that you can justdownload on your on your computer youcan run something like jet GPT on yourMacBook uh just leveraging the fact thatopen air has already spent so muchresources in training their AI youbasically spin up a stupid small AI onyour computer and make it learn from theAI that just you know needed so muchresources to to learn about it in thefirst place so the future will be thatit will be running on your computer itwill be your non-custodial AI basicallyrunning on your computer and there isthere's going to be no way of stoppingthis like literally no way and also SamAltman yeah [ __ ] him butum same[Music]AI but um he sold a large chunk of hislike equity in open AI Microsoft at likefairly low valuation for what thatcompany isand Obi was saying basically he knowsthe gigs up and in six months likethere'll be just a million differentimplementations that you can run on yourcomputer yeah it depends like whetherthese companies manage to keep theirMonopoly on AI or not okay so what Iwant to know is you know you said youcan spin up an AI on your computer Iwant to know if an AI has gone out thereand spun up its own AI will it tell youor it might it might go look I've donethis you can't stop me do you see what Imean whether it's made a decision to goimagine giving an AI some Bitcoin andmaking it you know able to to orderstuff on the internet by a server justreplicate itself on the server pay forthat server with Bitcoin spin up us spinup a shop a web shop selling a service Idon't know uh uh this is the end ofTerminator three have you have you seenthe end to terminate three I've not seenterminate three not seen the start of itI meango on YouTubeso I've got a question for you you knowhow there's likeum we can teach a computer to beat us atchess every single time will an AI learnto trade Bitcoin better than everyBitcoin trade in the world and just winevery single trade that's literally whatall the Traders are doing today I meanhigh frequency trading is basically AItrading no one I meanno one should trade manually becausewhat happens when AI isn't competingwith AIS which is the better yes youknow what they do in the New York StockExchange there's this interesting storyso they have these computer programstrading in New York Stock Exchange bythe way a fun fact the property aroundthe New York Stock Exchange is the mostexpensive property latency because thelatency it's the latency with your[ __ ] internet cable from yourcomputer to The Exchange that makes adifference I do because I've seen amovie that's all about trying to reducethe latency of like for hyper frequencytrading I can't remember so the New YorkStock Exchange when you buy a serverthere or rent a server they give you theguarantee that your cable no matter howfar it is from the outlet will be thesame length as everyone else's Cable inthe same room [ __ ] have you seenTerminator yeah of course have you seenTerminator three I'm not sure if yousearch for the end of Terminator threeI know it's going to be uh it's a threeminute video is that about right yeahprobablythis is just a brilliant bitwhy didn't he tell uswhy did he lead us down herethank youto livethat was his missionpretty slow endI was never really stopping itJohncould justLet It Gois it a bomb yeah[Applause]can somebody hear methere's High type machines[Music]John Connorit's John ConnorCrystal Peakwhat the hell is happeningwho's in charge thereI amConnor can you help usI really know what's happeningdid you know him say there was never anystopping them yeah by the time Skynetbecame self-awareit had spread into millions of computerservers across the planetordinary computers and Office Buildingsdorm rooms everywhereit was softwarein cyberspacethere was no system corecould not be shut downthe attack began at 6 18 pmjust as he said it wouldJudgment Daythe day the human race was nearlydestroyed by the weapons they built toprotect themselves[Music]I should have realizedour destiny was never to stop JudgmentDayit was merely to survive ittogetheruh-huh so Mr Summit 2023. uh he tried totell usbut I didn't want to hear itmaybe the future has been writtenI don't knowall I know is what the Terminator taughtmenever stop fightingand I never willthe battle has just begunpriming the communityah it doesn't have the music it's likebut do you understand why I brought thatup right yeah yeah so and then so plotplot I'm gonna give away the plot so umif you haven't seen Terminator and youwant well first you haven't seen ityou're a [ __ ] but if you haven't seenit you want to see it uh just skip thisbit but Terminator I think I think asMatthew was talking about this was itMatthew no Freddie yeah Freddie Freddieso Terminator one is based on infiniteLoopand so you come back and you stop theTerminatorum but you never really stop it so it'sjust the infinite loop I think theTerminator 2 was based on linearand I think Terminator 3 was based on Ithink there's a continuation of linearbut it was like you could never stop ityou're never going to stop it but youhad to be ready so be so be prepared andbe prepared to survive to fight backyeah do you think this is realistic Imean it sounds a bit fatalistic actuallyto assume that things will go wrong fromthe get-go not from the get-go but Ithink who has explained to us that thinkof it in terms of uh errors and bugs solet's not be fatalistic about AI butthere will be bugs and what if what if abug in AI is the fact that it tried tokill usyeahum I mean I think before something evenremotely to what we've seen can happenthere needs to be a human that needs tomake the decision first to build an AIthat should kill all humans so you needsomeone with a bad intent first a humanwith a bad intent I think to to get intoa situation like that I I think it's youdon't think you see you don't think anAI if it is an AI that itself becomesself-aware that makes its decisionitself yeah isn't that the point of AIit thinks for itself yeah I think thisis generally known as AGI thisartificial general intelligence wherepeople assume that it will be able tomake decisions and has motivation to dostuff which you it hasn't been told todo right like a human you would just sitin a room and then just come up with agoal like I want to move somewhere andsee something but an AI wouldn't do thatlike a classical AI wouldn't do it youwould need to have a human that tells itsome first initial goal that initialgoal could be just survive no matterwhat no matter what happens survive ifyou give an AI that goal which soundsfirst I mean it's a dangerous goal togive then it might start you know takingconsiderations of you know maybe I killall the humans that's how I survive sous humans are we given a goal to surviveis that inherent within our biology orour Evolution does our brain developwith goals there's a that's anunanswered question I think but there'sthere are theories that say that youknow the entire brain and everythingthat we have is just something for theDNA to actually replicate so the theactual goal of life is in the DNA itselfwhich is to replicate the DNA so thenreplicate improve and survive yeah andeverything follows from the replicationjust you know everything that even thatthe fact that you go seek food but alsomaybe even the fact that we travel tospace to explore the universe might becaused by this initial goal that kickedoff this development which is for DNA toreplicate so this is this is one of theideas oh we're gonna go deep now I kindof need some weedum so this so I would question then wasour DNA programmedto evolve orand to replicate or did it Sparkfrom a primordial soup and it was afluke of that it could have been a happylittle accident and it could be thatmany happy little accidents happened butall of them died and just one survivedwith this property of being able toreplicate so perhaps even withoutsomebodytelling an AI to survive it could belots of hundreds of thousands of littlehappy accidents and one of them has thesurvival Instinct it could be it couldbe that if you just generate many manydifferent AIS with different goals thatthe one with the you know the drive tosurvive will be actually the one thatsurvives because it will kill off allother AI yeah if it's if it's necessaryfor survival maybe yes but again I thinkin that you know it's like saying wehave Gene editing now with crispr forexample yeah right so people arefreaking out about it because it willprobably kill Humanity it could happen Imean we could produce a virus I mean weshouldn't but someone could produce avirus that just kills everyone it'spossible but in order for that to happenyou need you need a person that has thisgoal I don't think that or an AI withaccess to crisprdoing what and whyso just to survivewhat does what would that mean to the AIdoes that mean current threats or futurethreatsI mean so if an AI recognizes that itwas created by humans it might recognizethat only humans can end it therefore itkills off the humans before the humanscan end it and that's part of itssurvival does it plan its survival aheadyeah it probably plans it because I meanit needs to know the outcomes of itsactions that's how you make good actionsbut uh I mean why are why aren't wediscussing the the possibility of a goodsymbiosis with an AI maybe that's theway the AI survives is to have the bestkind of symbiosis with humans justliving along with them and improvinghuman life so it can still persistbecause maybe we will be able to youknow turn it off and it realizes that inorder to be not turned off it needs tobe actually useful I think we're cynicaland fatalistic though and life imitatesI think yeah it does and I think youknow these these stories are onlyinteresting if they are you knowfatalistic like that yeahumoh yeahI think we're I think we're all gonnadie I do well on that note look at thisoh great you're going to show us howwe're gonna die yep uh so this issomething Obi showed us again last nightthis is like I don't know what I don'tknow what you call that a basically arobot that's going to enter it's anAndroid yeah an Android there you go andlook when this is going to be releasedwell it's number 23 this is called 1Xtext for tech for anyone listening youknow what this is it's like iRobot it'siRobot do you remember the go to YouTubeIf you must have seen iRobot do you knowwhat I think I Robot shouldn't haveworked and it worked the movie I meanyeah it shouldn't have worked but it didwork but do um find you know the scenewhere it's got them all together and allthe robots yeah it moves yeah can youfind that sceneum but you were not so uh you're a bitskeptical on this thing right yeahI amum detective what are you doing he saidthe evolving program with three laws sothat means we have 1 000 robots thatwill not try to protect themselves if itviolates a direct order from a humanI'm that one who willto check to put your gun down why do yougive them facesfriendly them all up make them look allhuman these robots are not you can makea great meme oh yeahare you as our propertythese things are just lights andClockwork[Applause]let me ask you something docjust thinking you're the last sane manon the face of the Earth make you crazybecause if it doesmaybe I am[Music]no that's itlove it I just absolutely love this Imean the film shouldn't worked when it'sexplained it shouldn't worked when youwatch the trailer it shouldn't work butit actually did work so when you seethis uh do you get afraid of itumI would have designed it differently Ican't figure out if he's just got like apair of like smart trousers and shoes onyeah I'm a bit skeptical that this thingwill actually be as agile as they saybecause as far as I know the state ofthe art is Boston Dynamics and that islike a bunch of uh hydraulic motors thatreally you know you can you can hear themotor uh running and there's weird dogwalking there have they got any video ofthis yeah I don't I don't know there'sNeo and Eve I don't think no I thinkit's called Neo Eve are you sure I thinkwhat's the most impressive about this isthe set of investors well that's wayless cool yeah that's like that beam youknow the meme with the like is it thehorseexactly this is how they will look likeI think so they're on Wheels they can'teven walkokay I'm way less scared of it now yeahthat's proper budget look at his facebut actually I think before before thesethings will become I mean it's beingdemoed here as well but I think theserobots will be much more important inproduction and then com you know in infactories uh doing doing manual work youcan buy the Boston Dynamics robots can'tyou no yeah can you on the websiteshould we buy one I think like 100 Grandwhat ah [ __ ] I kind of want one man thedog yeahknockoffs I mean Chinese knock-offsreally something yeah yeah for theBoston Dynamics yeah for the dark itselfhave you seenum Metal Head oh what's the series uhBlack Mirror yeah of course I mean it'sbasic it's literally Metal Head yeahwhich by the way I think that's the bestBlackBerry episodebut they're have you seen the video ofthe one where they gave her a gun yeah Idid have you seen it I don't think so ohmy God go to YouTube search for BostonDynamics dog gun it's [ __ ] insanethese things can run fast yeah this isgonna blow your mind and freak you outthat one watch this this is absolutelyinsane[Music]this is a knockoff this is not fromBoston myself so it's even worselaughsisn't that [ __ ] freaky it's so weirdimagine you went to your front door andthat was outside I mean this is what thewars of the future would look like nowfor sure for sure so that's not even aBoston Dynamics one right can we get itcan we let's go and buy onethat's creepy can you get the BostonDynamics website up thereyeah you just gotta contact yeah butwhat does it sayuh I want one let's get oneso sookayobviously AI we believe we can do somegood things we're already using versionsof AI That's not real AI uh it is it isit's not our artificial generalintelligence it's not AGI but it'sdefinitely AI have you told him howyou've been using it yeah but again likeI say it's we're not even scratching thesurface so Cali was telling meum there's this website that's likeGitHub for AI projects I don't know yeahum and there's a program called Jarvis Ithink did he say Microsoft's they'vecreated this well there there are AISalready that can make use of other AISso you can have like one Central AI thatknows you know that has the ability toGoogle uh to recognize images torecognize speech produce speech thedifferent AIS and then you can buildlike something like a meta AI thing thatknows how to access these other AIS soonce you start putting these thingstogether which we didn't start yet we'rejust barely you know seeing how open AIcan do text recognition and imagerecognition at the same time whichalready is very powerful but once youput these things togetherjust goes exponentially from there soyou can ask one AI to do it to do a taskfor you and it'll go out and like useall the other AIS to complete that taskthen come back to you with the completedtask what about the task that we need atthe moment uh I think that file's goneor ask AI I have I was literally goingthrough like troubleshooting with GPTwhat's your task uh so we had a filecorrupt and I've lost itum and I've confined the file but theaudio is like cut off halfway throughum well I don't know if I can find theoriginal file basically I'm trying tofind a recover a file for my computerthe file recovery software won't workand I was like going through ittroubleshooting which actually was T3 itgave me some good options but I stillcan't find it so what we were thinkingcan we use we've got the audio from thecamera but it's not this quality it'snot this mic quality it's from thecamera so I sound a bit echoey and tinnybut we also do have my voice patternsfrom this so could we take the two andget AI to uh uh basicallytake my voice from thistake my uh the words I said and redothem can we go yeah I think we canfantastic idea I don't know if there isan AI that can do that just uh let meshow you this this is insane now all youhave to do is record reference vocalsand replace it with the train model thatany musician you like which is exactlywhat I did I found this Kanye style beaton YouTube I wrote eight bars and I'mgonna record them now and then I'm gonnahave ai Kanye replace me I got a fantasythat's beautiful that's dark and twistedbut I attacked the whole religion allbecause of my ignorance what was Ithinking that was some [ __ ] [ __ ] I lostAdidas but I'm still Yeezy back in thekitchen man I'm a genius boys in thehood just like I'm easy Kanye Wheezysouth side of Chicago life ain't easyall praise be the Lord Jesus dondaplease rest easy all right let me cut itthere let me cut it there so let's hearthose vocals I just recorded now withKanye over them I got a fantasy that'sbeautiful that's dark and twisted but Iattacked the whole that sounds perfectit's insane isn't ithonestly this stuff the speed of changewe're seeing with everything at themoment it's like almost every daysomething news coming out yeah it's inthe last couple of months and it's beengoing crazy you can close your eyes fora couple of days and you won't recognizeyour environment anymore it's insaneyeah it's literally insane and wealready know they're replicating aroundthe world on computers connected to theinternet and they could be well whatevertheir AIS are talking to each other Iwonder if two AOS I'm like oh yeah mateI've got an idea well that's like theplot of her isn't it that yeah andthat's the plot ofum Terminator Okay so you could havethey'd be like all right I've got anidea we need to get rid of these humandickers but I'm very very uh optimisticabout it I think it just solves so manyproblems at once it makes work so mucheasier people are also concerned aboutall the jobs job loss and thateverything that it will lead to I thinkI think it's good that it leads to jobloss which is have to find a way to dealwith it yeah no I agree with that I meanthe the kind of I mean we made adocumentary here in Bedford and part ofthat was driving up to one of the Amazonwarehouses these places are Grim I meanthey're they're I think they are wellwe've essentially replaced bookshops onthe High Street where you're going andyou would speak to somebody like a alocal and they'd talk to you about thebooks and you've you know you throughsome and buy one to these giant [ __ ]warehouses where people were clockingclock out and they're just doing arepetitive manual job but everythingthey do is tracked to the minute to thesecond to be as efficient as possiblethankfully we will replace those withrobots and get people out to enjoy thelife they were they were gifted ratherthan doing this [ __ ] [ __ ] forminimum wage I I agree with you but buthow my fear is this like kind of likedark side of Silicon Valley wherebyum we concentrate the wealth into a fewand fewer people and there isn't anopportunity for them to use that timefor other productive things that's myfear the other side is potentially whatwe do is we we make things moreefficient for being able to provide forother people so you know we head towardsthat Singularity on energy so energy canbecome cheap and plentiful I just don'tknow which one I don't know which whichway we go I I I'm always cynical andskeptical of humans so maybe we shouldbe more optimistic about AI maybethey'll fix our yeahthoughts are faultsGod it's fascinating I think as humanswill be faced with a lot more with ournature even closer than we are actuallyalready are once we don't have to do allthe physical work anymore to survive soonce you don't have to go to workanymore because Society has evolvedthere you need you really need to askyourself what you want to do with yourlife I know many people and I respectthem a lot doing a lot of really heavywork with their bodies and they go towork because they need to in order tosurvive and sometimes they also say thisis you know this is the best ofrealities because what would I dootherwise and this is a question that weall need to ask ourselves right once youcome to a place where you don't have towork then you really need to askyourself what do you want to do I thinkscience and art and you know these theseuh things that we do in our minds aregoing to be much more important in thefuture because it you know the thenecessity of doing physical called workwill be lifted from our shoulders I'mreally looking forward to that it'sgoing to probably cause some kind of anexistential crisisbecause now we're faced with you knowwith the question what you want to dowhen um I used to work in advertisingLondon when I quit I had a year off workand I just said I'm not going to workfor a yearand the first month was really really[ __ ] hard because I did not know whatto do with my time when you can get upevery day and do what you wantit's filling that time at first becomesreally difficult I was like what am Igoing to do andyeah to begin with I kind of watched alot of TVsat on the couch and I was like I can'tcarry this on so I started going to thegym and then I would go and do any classwhatever there was I'd do I was doingPilates with a bunch of old ladies ateight in the morning and then I'd swimand and then what happened I started tofilm my time with exercise outsidecooking and I was probably 30 40 poundslighter than I am now I look great Ifelt great honestly life was [ __ ]brilliant and over the last five yearsI've refilled that with more and morework for some reason I've I've got ridof that amazing life I had to fill itwith a different life which is amazingin other ways but but it was brillianthaving that time have you ever had a lotof time off not like that now it wasamazing it was also at a time when mymum was dying so I got to spend a lot oftime with her and you know spent herlast year with her when you know notworking which was you know a gift tohave that time but it was good and Isometimes I I look back on that I thinkwhat am I doingwhat are you gonna do with your timeum I think I'm gonna keep working onbitcoin this is for me you know it'ssimilar to what I just described I thinkit's something that I could identify formy life as a very you know as this giantproject it's a worldwide project thatwill outlive myself and it it just needsmany people building the foundations ofit for maybe hundreds of years and Ithink it's it's a beautiful thing to beable to participate in something that isbigger than you I think this is what youcan end up with if you have enoughfreedom in your life to look around andlook for things that interest you andBitcoin is is the thing that I found Ithink there are many other things thatyou could do I really respect everyonedoing Arts and Sciences I think theseare these are the things that that justcarry us humans furtherum but I I will be probably justspending my time working on bitcoin likeso many others as well that's beautifulman what would you do Jenny keep workingon bitcoin too we're working on Bitcoinin a weird little way yeah you aredefinitely absolutely football for me itwill be focused on football but anywaywe've got a football match to go to areyou excited yes I amKelly you're an amazing human and uh I'mreally glad we got to meet and I want tospend more time with you and I want todo this againum thank you as soon as possible uhyou're an amazing asset to bitcoin anduh anything we can ever do to help youhave our details you reach out to uswhere do you want to send peopleum I'll send them over to my Twitterit's Kelly BTC and uh send them over tocashew.space if you're a developerplease look at it if you want to supportcashew then go there you'll find ways tosupport it and just look into Bitcoinplease help us build Bitcoin be adeveloper in Bitcoin look into how youcan contribute to open source projectsthank you brother you take care thankyou tooforeign",
