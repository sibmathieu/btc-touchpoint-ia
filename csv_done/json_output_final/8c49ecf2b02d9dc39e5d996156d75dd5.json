that above if you already havea wallet and you've gone through thesesetup stepsthis is how you would access that onceagain through the moon appso i'm going to hit create new walletwe're going to pick a pini'm going to pick an easy one just forthis video one two threefour one two three four i will saydon't use that as your pin picksomething a little bit more robustokay so we've created a new wallet let'sgo now this will work out of the box butone thing you want to do firstthat is you want to make sure you backup your wallet and there's anotification down below to do thisso i can click on that and there areeffectively three waysto back up your moon wallet nowthis one the first one will beum via your email address now you do nothave to use your email address hereit's optional but i just found this is aconvenient way to do so i'm not going togo intothe details as to why these backups aredifferentum in comparison to other walletsbut i will say that uh it is differentyou know you don't have a seed phrase asper usual okayso i'm gonna click on number one hereand so it saysyou back up your wallet you're going tohit start if you don't want to use youremail you skip this step so i'm going tohit startthat's going to ask for my email i'mgoing to put that inright now off screen now when you put inyour email address it will send you anemail to verify that it is the correctoneand there will be a button that saysverify your email address at which pointit will bump you back to the moon appand you will pick a password which i'mgoing to put in now againoff screen okay so i am done that firststep i've entered a password nowuh and it says i understand i will needmy password and access to my email torecover my wallet i understand that mooncan't reset my password if i forget itso the password that i've usedencrypts all of my information and moondoes not have that password so iunderstand both of those and i hitfinishsuccess now next onei can do an alternative backup and whatthis is it's a little bit like your seedphrase but it's actuallya set of numbers um in four digitincrementsand so you need to write these downseparately and it will be just anotherway of backing up your walletso i can click that and it will give methose to write downand again you can see here i'm not goingto show the actual uh phrase or or thedigitsbut it will be a series of digitsin this style and i'm going to writethose downoff screen right now just by hittingstartupon writing that a series of lettersand numbers down i will be asked toconfirm them by typing them in herewhich i will doand then hit continue once again i'mgradinggraded with a screen that says that iunderstandi will need my recovery code if i forgetmy password and i understand moondoesn't keep a copy of my recovery codeand it can't be changed so again theydon't have theinformation to access this wallet if imisplaceboth my email and password or therecovery phraseokay so i understand that and i can hitfinishokay excellent now both of these backupmethodsare compatible with using moon so if ilost my phone or smashed it or deletedthe app or whateverboth of those methods will function withthis wallet however outside of thiswalletthat does not work this is where anemergency kitcan be created to save the informationyou need to recover your money withoutusing moon when you click on thatit's a document it's stored onlineand it gives you complete ownership okayif you combine the emergency kit withyour recovery code which we've justwritten downyou'll have total undisputed control ofyour funds so the way this worksis you have an option to save it viagoogle driveyou can send it to yourself via email oryou can save it manuallyas a file okay andthey do have instructions on how to goabout recovering via this method this iskind of beyond the scope of this videobut a good idea to do this anyways inwhichever way you feelmost secure doing it okay i'm going toleave it at that i'm not going to goahead with this for right now just so wecan dive intousing this wallet i will just hit abortand we'll just jump to the wallet rightnow by the way you can re-access all ofthose backupsby hitting security in the bottom middleand it takes you back to all of yourbackups and you can get that all set upokay so here we are on the main screenof the moon walletvery simple a single unified balancealong with a
