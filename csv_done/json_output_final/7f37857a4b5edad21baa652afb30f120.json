perspectiveon the carnivore diet paul is alsoactive on social media on twitter and oninstagramand has made quite a splash in the dietworldbecause he used to be a vegan and he'sbecome a carnivoreand he's got some very interesting ideaswhich i think a lot of our listeners aregoing to appreciateso paul thank you very much for joiningus todaythanks for having me on safe all rightso umfirst of all let's begin with a littlebit about your uh personal journey soyou'reyou were an md and a vegan both of thosethingsare likely to make you not a carnivoreso how did you end upbecoming a carnivore in spite of beingan md and a veganyeah i was not an md and a vegansimultaneously but i was veganfor a bit of time for seven months i wasa raw veganwhen i was actually a physicianassistant so i had this sort of longprotracted health journey of my own myfather's a physicianmother's a nurse practitioner i wasinterested in going into medicinethroughout college and then took quite abit of time off toexplore the world was ski bum and hikethe pacific terrestrial eventually wentback tophysician assistant school and practicedsome cardiology and quicklyquickly realized that the mainstreammedical establishmentwas not something that i wanted to befullyuh a participant in that it was mostlypharmaceutical based and symptom focusedand it didn't seem like we were actuallygetting through cause of illnessuh and so at that point i went back tomedical school after four years ofworking as a physician assistant incardiologyand then somewhere along that path uhmedical school at the university ofarizonaresidency at the university ofwashington i was in my residency at theuniversity of washingtonthat i finally got fed up with my ownautoimmune illnesses specificallyeczema and i thought you know there'ssomething wrongi'm eating at that point i was eating apaleo diet consisting ofwell-raised meat but also vegetablesfruitnuts seeds mushrooms which were in vogueand continued to be quite involved todayand my excellent was going out ofcontrol i had eczema on my chestmy arms my legs my shoulders my wristsand it was justsuper frustrating because if anybody'shad eczema they know it's quite itchyand it prevents me from doing many ofthe things i wanted to do so i thoughtthere needs something needs to changeand at that point i started thinkingmore about whether i needed the plantsin generalin my diet and then eventually aboutwhich plant foods might be more or lesstoxicand that was the beginning of my owncarnivore journey cutting out the plantfoodsand lo and behold going full carnivorefor a year and a half meat organsfat eczema gets a lot betterpsychologically felt betterand then eventually i did reincorporatesome plant foods which we can talk aboutwhat i might consider to be the lesstoxic plant foods specifically fruit andhoneypeople sometimes get triggered when wetalk about that because of fructose butwe can try and draw somedelineation there and talk about somenuance and fructoseuh thinking within mainstream medicinebut the thethe overarching idea here is that theconsideration ofwhich foods that i was eating weretriggering my immunity wasmassively beneficial for me in my ownlife and i think thatnow we're seeing that it's massivelybeneficial for thousands if not hundredsof thousands and millions of peopleacross the globe and yet it's such afascinating conceptto talk about because it flies in theface of mainstreamideological thinking which is continuingto demonize meatfor a variety of reasons and continuingto hold up vegetables and plantsas these sort of saviors of the worldwhen in fact i think we've got itcompletely backwardsyeah um yeah obviously i agree with youbut yeah we will get to the fruits andhoney in a biti won't agree with you on that i guessbutbefore we get to that uh tell us alittle bit about uh your bookuh what is the hypothesis that youpresent in your bookso the book the book was interesting thebook was written and published justbefore covid which seems likean eternity ago uh maybe a hundred yearsago or soum actually in february of 2020was when the book was published and itis umit's you know it was an interestingcharacterization it wasmy effort toreally talk about the conceptsunderlying thisi started off with a discussion ofanthropology and evolution which is afascinatingreally radical to go down i believethinking abouthow we became homo sapiens umuh how we become humans essentially fromprimates from chimps and bonobosand so it was it was quite interestingto talk about the anthropology to lookat that to look atsort of the growth of the human braintwo million years agoand to see that the human brain reallygrew in size exponentially over the lasttwo million years after probably80 to 90 million years of the same sizeas our primate ancestorsand bonobos and then not a whole lot ofgrowth in the beginning of theaustralopithecineevolutionary timeline as humans and thensomething happened and there's reallygood evidence that something was thehuntingand scavenging of meat and organs theconsumption of meat organs and fatso that was a really interesting thingto kind of lay out for people and sayheywhy do we think these foods might be badfor us just intuitively ifthey in fact probably made us human byproviding unique nutrients uniquesources of caloriesthere's so many nutrients in animalfoods that you can't get in plant foodsthat haveincredible nutritive value in humansanswering taurine carnitine etc the listgoes on and on cholinevitamin k2 riboflavin it's a deep it's adeep well ofuniquely uh robustly representedanimal-based nutrients and then the bookkind of moves into discussions ofplant toxins which are something we hearvery little about and i think that'sprobably the most contentious part ofthe bookmany people believe that plants don'thave toxins or that the toxins don'taffect humans negativelyand i've pretty consistently taken adifferent stance that that i do thinkthe toxins are a factor for humansand that when we look at the net benefitof most plant foodsthe foods i would consider within theplant kingdom to be most toxic would bestems leaves roots and seeds really theparts of the plant but the plant ishighly trying to defendagainst predation unless the plant'sgenetic lineage be interruptedbut but i think that the the risks ofeating those foods outweigh the benefitsand that we can getthe nutrients and the benefits presentin those foods plusmore by just eating meat and organsor if we choose opting for the leasttoxicplant foods and we can talk about that iknow that's going to be a controversialtopic at this groupso um and then you know the the lastpart of the book or the last two partsof the book are aboutall the myths around meat there are somany myths about meat that it's going tocause cancer that it's going to causeheart diseaseand it was fun to really dig into thoseand try and debunk most of those mythsespecially immediate cancer premise andthe meat and atherosclerosis premise sothese are really really bigsacred cows in western medicine that allof thisuh thinking about the supremacy ofanimal foodsflies in the face of really challengesand then the last part of the book isabout regenerative agricultureand i i will tell this to your group andi'll to listen to your listenerswhen i wrote the book i i didn't havethe ballsto question the overarching hypothesisabout carbon dioxideum i figured that if i if i really wentfor the jugular and i really did a deepdive and a deep analysisof environmental impacts of carbondioxide versus what we actually knowfrom engineering and environmentalliteraturethat people would label me a climatedenier and so i really just kind of tookthe easythe easy way out of that equation andtalked about the importance ofsourcing regeneratively and if we if wedoaccept that carbon dioxide is a driverof anthropogenic climate change which isnot something that i reallyhave found a lot of support for wheni've gone deeper down that down thatpath of investigationum then regenerative agriculture iscertainly a solution to that and it'squite scalablethat you know i think most people willunderstand that raising cows grassfinishing grassfeeding and rotational grazing is goodfor ecosystems so we can at least agreeon that andjust trying to obviate many of theplant-based arguments against meat andscalability andethics and the environmental impacts ofityeah yeah well obviously there's a lotthere i wanted to justget back a little bit to the uhevolutionary part of the bookso what are the differences between usand uh chimpanzees and bonobosthat lead you to conclude that we'recarnivores what is the best case thatyou can make for thatwell i think that um i think that let mejustclarify my position um and this issomething that mickey bandursort of helped me clarify people are notfamiliar with his work he's a prettypretty cool israeli anthropologist who'swritten a number of papers on humantrophic levels and i've interviewed himon my podcast which is calledfundamental health and um in his mostrecent paper which actually talks abouthuman trophic level and how toreconstructquote hominin trophic level over thelast few million years he talks aboutomnivorous species and this thisinteresting misconception aboutomnivores thatwhen people say humans are omnivoreswhich isthe widely accepted perspective theygenerally want to sort of have thismichael pollan perspective likeeat food not too much mostly plants butif you if you look at our evolution ashumans i would argue the completeopposite of that or thethe polar opposite perspective which isthat we should that we should eat mostlyanimalsas an omnivore and if you look atzoological literature the majority ofomnivores more than 70 percenteither have a plant-based meaning or ananimal-based leaningthey either eat lean toward mostlyanimal foods or mostly plant foodsand so i think that if you look at thehistory of humans and where we've comefrom from chimps and bonobos thisprimate lineage what you'llfind is that chimps and bonumos primatesaresort of plant-based omnivores andsuddenlysomewhere along the evolutionarytimeline probably around two millionyears agowith the appearance of homorexus andhomo habilisit was much more advantageous for ourancestors our hominid ancestors tobecomeanimal-based omnivores rather thanplant-based omnivoresand that shift i think happened with theappearance ofhunting and these bifacial aschuliantools and the unique nutrients that wegot from hunting but we have thisradical shift from a plant-basedomnivore because we know that chimps andbonobosand many primates outside of our lineagedo eat animals occasionally they willeat otherprimates they will eat small animalswhen they can get them but they make themajority of their diet as plantsand so i think that there's a prettycompelling argument to be made thatthat for the majority of our evolutionhumans have made the majority of theirdiet or sought to make the majority oftheir diet animal foodsand that sort of puts into perspectivethis hierarchyof the importance of different foods inour historical past as humansi think that it's it's pretty hard tomake an argument that humans have alwayseatenonly meat and organs but i think it'squite easy to make an argumentuh fairly cogently um fairlyyou know fairly robustly as well thatthatour ancestors and currently livinggroups of hunter-gatherersprize meat and organs and animal foodsabove all other thingsand that's really been what we have doneas humans formillions of years and that probably wasa huge playerin making us into the humans that we aretoday allowing our brains to growif you look at the differencesphysically there's a fascinating set ofpapers by leslie ayellocalled the expensive tissue hypothesiswhich posits thatas our brains were growing our guts wereshrinking there's probably an energetictrade-off here and also a nutrientdensity trade-off and so we getwe get much larger small intestineswhich are uhevolved for uh absorption of moreanimal-based nutrients higher up in thedigestive tract and we get much smallercolons which means that we can getsix-pack abs we have muchmore acute angles of our ribs we don'thave these sort of comodius colons andbulbous intestines that many primates dobecause we don't need thatwe have much smaller large intestinebecause we're not fermenting you knowkilogram quantities of fiber every dayinto short-chain fatty acids like ourprimary ancestors and with thatwe have this energetic trade-off whichallows for a growing brain and probablya nutritiontrade-off which allows for the thegrowth of neurons andglia these myelin sheaths and neuronsand unique nutrients that probably allowour brains to grow which we obtainedfrom animalsand which are then absorbed moreefficiently in the larger smallintestinesof our gut and we know that so many ofthese animal based nutrients do getabsorbedmuch higher up in our gut and so we seeall of these interesting energetictrade-offs and we see parallels in theanimal kingdom there's afascinating fish called the peter'selephant nose fishwhich is a carnivorous fish that has thethe largest brain and the smallest gutof any fish that we know of i believeand it's the same sort of energetictrade-offs like when the brain getsbigger the gut needs to get smallerbecause there's sort of this caloricceiling we don't just evolution isn'tgoing to favor a speciessuddenly increasing its caloricrequirements byhundreds of calories or you know tens ofpercentage points that's going to makeit much harder toto survive but if we can trade thingsoff we can become a different speciesand adjust so we see thatthose transitions and then i talk aboutall of this in the book there's allsorts of other transitions in humansthat really point to us as primarilyhuntersthe shoulders that can throw a fastball100 miles an hour or throw a rockat something or throw a spear or pullback a bow these hips the pelvic girdlethe way our hands are shaped opposablethumbs the way our feet are shapedeyes that are in the front of our headsthe whites of our eyes this is afascinating conversation that i had withbill von hippel in my podcast as wellthe idea that if you look at chimps andbonobos or you look at primates ingeneral i did not know thisthey the sclera of their eyes actuallydarkit's brown and ours are white and dogsare white and so there's a hypothesisthatwe sort of co-evolve with canines beingable to look at each other andcommunicate with our eyesas opposed to primates when they see theeyes of the primate they can't reallytellquickly which direction that animal islooking and so we're very keyed into theeyes of our other humans andbill suggests in his book the socialleap that this is oftenthis is suggestive of cooperativeculture in humanspotentially connected with group huntingand other activitiesrather than competitiveness in primingcultures where they're sort ofnot really working in groups to takedown a big animal but we have all ofthese adaptations which appear to reallypoint us the direction ofhumans are hunters first and foremostalways have beenand yet that's not the um that's not soin vogue todaywe're sort of encouraged to be um i'mnot sure what we're encouraged to beperhaps we're just encouraged to be uhpsychophantic uhyou know um yeah rule followersyeah yeah i mean i i find it interestingyou look at a gorillathey they're strong and big but theyhave a massive stomach and they spenttheir entire day eating plants anddefecating basically because plants aremostly indigestible matter so you'rerunning your digestive system all dayat full load in order to try and geta small amount of nutrients and thatends up meaning that the majority oftheir daysare spent just eating and i thinkit's very clear that they're just youknow the reason they don't eat as muchmeat as wedo is because they're not good athunting i don't think a chimpanzee wouldturn down a ribeye steak if you gave itto them there's absolutely nochance and it's you know if you couldget 100 generations of chimpanzees toeat ribeye every dayi think you'll see the chimpanzees getstronger andsmarter um obviously you know they won'tcatch up with usvery quickly but it's clear that youknow theirenergy goes toward digestive systembecause they can't hunt whereasbecause we can hunt we have a muchsmaller digestive system and we eatanimalsthat essentially um outsourcethe digestion problem for us you knowcowis just out there doing 24-hourdigestion a cow is justbasically a digestive system on tinylittle legs that take it around so thatit can get food andkeeps eating and pooping all day andyou're just getting the very tinyamount of nutrients that it gets frommassive quantities of plantsso i definitely think uh that i buy thatand it's you know it's interestingi don't think there's any species thatwould turn down a steak i don't thinkthere's anyanimal that would not eat the steak it'sfull of nutrients they would alleat it i think the difference is theones that can huntand can secure meat than the ones thatcan't and if you look at the ones thatcan huntyou'll see they generally have smallstomachs because they don't need thembecause they eatanimals that have that are full ofnutrientsi think there are probably i'm trying tothink i ii'd have to dig into the zoologyliterature but i'm not sure how manypurely herbivorous species there arelike i said i think there's a lot ofplant-leaningomnivores but i agree with you i thinkif you gave a steak to most of them theywould eat it and there's thesehilarious videos i mean i don't know whyanyone considers thissurprising but you know canines areclearlyanimal-based omnivores umand people say oh my dog is a vegetarianhe loves vegetables and i saw this onthe talk show he was a british talk showand they're like well we'll see aboutthatand they bring the dog and they have aplate of meat and a plate of vegetablesand the dog just goes straight for themeatafter these people are just waxingpoetic and just you knowsinging the praises of their vegetariandog who clearly is just so virtuousthe dog just tears into the meat andit's just built into us andthere's a study here that uh i shouldtell your audience about that i think isone of themost fascinating ones i've ever comeacross and i think itit basically ends all discussion ofhumans as herbivores or humans asplant-basedor any any discussion of humans is notessentially uh very meat focused inorganisms and they did they put eeg sothey put electro encephalographthat's the photography leads on people'sheads and they took a bunch ofvegetarians and a bunch of omnivoresso they could look at the neuronalfiring patterns in different regions ofthe brain they could look at the cortexwhich is more highly evolved reachingthe brain where there's all thethe invasions and all the folds and thenthey could look at the deeper regions ofthe brain the thalamus or thebrain stem and they can look at sort ofthe motivational salience so therelevance ofthese images that they're showing peopleto the vegetarians and the omnivores andwhen they show the omnivorespictures of meat the omnivores have botha corticalconscious positive reaction and a sortof deeper positive reactionuh more of a limbic or moreevolutionarilyancient positive reaction to the meatbut in the vegetarians they have thiscorticalaversion they have this sort ofprogramming that says oohme not good it's bad for me or i don'tlike it butthe the deeper regions of the brainpersist with a positive reaction to themeat which to me is just like you cannotout evolve you know you vegetariansdidn't out-evolve their programming formillions of years the deeper regions oftheir brain that haven't beenbrainwashed or propagandized realizedthat isstill the most nutritious mostnutritionally denseuh most sort of deterministic foodlike uh in in a human's life if a humangets more meat a human is going tothrive by meat i'm sort of saying thatin theroyal sense and i mean meat and organsbecause when you look at hunter-gatherertribes they do eat gnostic tailand when you visit honor gatherer tribeslike the hodzo that's exactly what theysay thatthe most important thing in their lifeis meat they dream about meat the bestday of their life is when they hunt andkill the biggest animalthe selection of males by females isbased on who's the best huntereverything revolves around meat it'sbuilt into our sort ofdeeper brain regions and vegetarians cantry and programum and propagandize their out of thatbut the deeper brain regions never lieyeah i think it's it's fascinatingthat's all the species that have everexistedand all the humans that have everexisted have managed to figure out whatto eatexcept for the people who have learnedmodern nutrition science you knowthe only species that was dumb enough tocome up with an entire sciencein order to justify horrific dietarychoices and then give itself all kindsof diseasesis humans at least not all humans but itreally takes something special becausefor the vast majorityof all humans and animals you know theyjust follow their instinct when it comesto food and that serves them fineyou know your body knows what it wantsyou listen to your instincti remember you know when my kids areborn it's actually astonishing to watcha two-minute old childuh know how to feed you know it's it'sit's one of the most amazing things i'veseen in my lifeuh to to see that how this is justprogrammed in them and i thinkum you know being a carnivore has kindofmade me turn me off from readinganything about nutrition science becauseit's just find it to beum it's it's something that's veryinstinctiveand you know how to do it and you knowyou just eat as much meat as you canand then you'll be healthy and happy andstrong andin my mind if you you know there aremore interesting things for your mind tobe doingthan looking for all the new stuff onpubmedand figuring out you know what thisstudy says about the interaction betweenthisplant food and that plant food or theother like just eat a goddamn steak isthe motto that i've had in my life forquite a while and it's served me wellsaved me a lot of time in readingnutrition books and pubmed andyou know getting into internet warsabout articles at this point there'sabsolutely nothing that can be writtenin an academic journal article by anutritionistthat could change my mindi mean maybe not absolutely nothing butit's going to be very hard for me tothink thatyou know the conscious medical andnutrition establishment that istrying to consciously rationally figurethe answer out for what we should eati don't think they can do as good a jobas my instinctand i think many people can do thatyou also write about western price i'm abig fan as well and imentioned him extensively in extensivelyin myforthcoming book the fiat standard whichis now available for pre-orderso um what do you think of westernprices work and what it tells usi think western price was sort of thisfascinating nutritional detective wholives this interesting time thisintersection of sort of western cultureand what was left at the time ofindigenous cultures around the worldunfortunately in the last 90 or 100yearssince his time we've seen thedisappearance of many of the culturesor at least the recession of many ofthose cultures to to a broad degree buti mean his work was striking and is aclear indicationof the dental health the jaw structureand the overall healthof indigenous cultures throughout theworld who are eatingnon-processed non-westernized foods of avariety of sortsand in comparison to the umthe rapidly introduced westernized foodspredominantlyprocessed flowers processed sugars andprocessed seed oils which were makingsuper large inroadsinto quote-unquote civilizationand so that's just such a fascinatingthing i mean his pictures in his booksarestriking and speak for themselves andyou know unfortunately there's only alittle bit of that lefttoday i i mentioned this earlier but iwent to tanzania in february of thisyear to spend time with hazai kind of wanted to do my own miniwestern price journey this culturehas probably less than a thousandremaining true hunter-gatherers leftand they do live in lake esse region oftanzania and you can go visit themuh you go with a a guide organizer butif you are connected well enough you cantell the organizers that you want themost legitimate experience possible andthey will take you on12-hour hunts and they will let you hangout with themfor 16 hours a day and they'll let yousit by the fire and let you ask themwhatever you wantand you really get a sense of how thesetrue hunter-gatherers are livingand it was it was fascinating and itmirrored a lot of the things that i'veread in western prices work and that i'msuspicious about based on the work ofotherslike frank marlowe i studied the hadzaextensively andthis is what i was mentioning earlierwhen you sit with the hajja and i havesat next to them there's pictures on mysocial media of thisand ask them they clearly are focused onme every day they think about itin their free time they're making arrowsto kill animals they're not makingtools to farm or daydreaming aboutiphonesor thinking about how they can help thewomen dig the best tuberum they're thinking about how to killthe biggest animal and how to getpoisoned to put on their arrows to killa bigger animal and they're a little bitworried about the encroachinguh other cultures like the toga or themessiah who have become mostlypastoralists on their land which arelimiting their ability to hunt butyeah it's quite clear i think thisanthropology perspective is a veryvaluable one and if you look atuh appraisals appraisals of their healththey're quite healthy metabolicallyum and so i just don't know howum how people ignore this they find allsorts of mental gymnasticsi mean i appreciate what you said itdoes get a little tedious for mesometimes arguing with people onlineuh about these things and maybe i'm inthe wrong line of work but for me as aphysician it feels important that i atleast try and champion this causeand talk a little bit about this healthwith others who just can't can'tunderstand it buti appreciate your point and i think thatum the proof is in the pudding for mostpeople and when they tryshifting their diet for a moreanimal-based perspective they generallyfeel much betterand i think that the other piece of thisequation that's often been left out isjustplain common sense and intuition whywould the foods thatthat we appear strongly to have eaten asthe majority of our diet have alwaysthought out preferentially be bad for useven if a gasp they raise ldlyou know there's just so manyinteresting things here why would a comwhy would a little protein like ldlbe killing us when it when it goes upwith what appears to be a veryancestrally consistent diet wewe never shied away from animal-basedsources of saturated fat evolutionarilyso why should we nowand yet you know most of the people onnutrition twitter would say like clearlysaturated fat is bad for you it'sraising your ldl and killing you andyeah you know the list of names is longpeople who are in that camp and it'sjust i don't understand it but theintimate i just i don'tthey've not i think that the problem isthey've not spent enough time in thewilderness and they've never spentenough time they've never spentany time with any group of humans that'sliving in any way that resembles the waythat humans might have lived and ofcourse the hazaare not a perfect uh indication of thatii've sort of flippantly referred to themas like a deloreanlike a pseudo time machine that goesback 50 000 years or 100000 years they're not perfect they havebeen influenced by humansbut they're pretty darn good they'relike the best proxy that we have and sothat's exactly the kind of stuff thatwestern price was doingyeah no i agree with you and i thinkthere's an element ofa majority of people i think formulatetheir view of the worldby reference to what other people thinkin other words you look around at peoplewho look like they know what they'redoingand who have positions of authoritypeople who are socially prominentand you just hear what they're sayingand you think this is the safe thing todo and generally i think a lot ofum a lot of our history is just humanbeings going alongwith um you know because there's safetyin numbers at the end of the day youdon't want to rock the boat too muchand it kind of works as a shortcut youknow why think about things when you canjustfollow the leaders and do whateverybody's doing for the vast majorityof things it works really well you knowdon't jump off a cliff you don't need totry it out and think about it too muchyou know if people tell you don't jumpoff the cliff it turns out well but ofcourseyou know people take it too far and ithink modern sciencesum modern nutrition in particular hasjust goneway too far in that direction of havingset up theseum thought substitutes i like to callthem that are justuh accepted as dogmas that you just havetostick to them and they're repeated sooften that the vast majority of peoplejust take themuh at face value and never question themso ldl is one of theseum a balanced diet being good thing isone as another one it's justthese are completely nonsensical like ifyou wanted to actually trace the storyof ldland think about it critically you'll beable to dismantle it with somebody who'sthinking about it honestly in 20 30minutesand i think the same is true about theconcept of balance diet well what'sbalanced you knowhow much heroin should you smoke on yourbalanced diet in order for it to bebalanced why should you include highlyaddictive things that are very hard toquityou know why should you have heroin orpringles or all of thesevery addictive things um and then ifsomething is actually good for you whyshould you limit it you knowwhy should you be sticking to a specificamount of soit's it's um yeah these things just uhit's frustrating how they just surviveand it's actually quitesad how many people's lives are ruinedbecause they believe in this stuff andthen they stick to it it'slike the the fear of fat for instance isone of the things that's just mostamazing for me i've traveled a lotaround the worldand you know it doesn't matter howeducated you are how wellread you are how much you follow thescience everybody's afraid of fat youknowmeanwhile they're guzzling liters ofcola anduh eating all kinds of junk which youthink oh well it's just a snack it'sfineand they don't see anything wrong withthat but they do see a lot wrong withfat which i think is is absolutelyuh amazing as a uh as a as an idea andand nobody mentions the problems ofplants so tell us about some of thebiggest greatest hits of plan or beforei get to that the point i wanted to makeis thatyou know being a carnivore is one of thethings that umrequires you to break out of that kindof thing you know people are alwayssaying ldl is bad andbalanced diet and this and this and thatbut you need to sit backand think through it from firstprinciples and you'll arrive atdifferent conclusions and then itrequires a lot ofum a lot of mental independence to beable for you know the open mindedness onthe one hand and then the independenceto be able tostand up to an endless array of idiotswho are just constantly pointing at youand laughing and sayingyou don't know what i learned in myfancy university degree whichmakes me know much better than you andconstantly justbeing willing to take all that and thatismy complicated way of saying that thatthat that explains why paulis also a bitcoiner so after becoming acarnivore he's also taken the orangepill recently and he had me on hispodcast to talk about bitcoinum so do you have any thoughts on a lotofa lot of parallels there uh and i'veseen it you know and asyou know it's funny i was talking to oneof my friends about this actually thefriend that that orange killed meand i was saying to him that uh there'sso many parallels and of coursei'm a neophyte in the world ofcryptocurrencies and especially withbitcoin butlisten to a lot of your podcasts andothers and i just feel likewow this is maybe this is the way thatpeople feel when they're trying tonavigate nutritional sciencethere's just all these different voicesmost of whichappear to be generally well informed andfairly coherent at the surface but wheniwas talking to my friend and listeningto your stuff and othersthe more i thought about it just like iagree i like this first principlesapproach justdoesn't make sense to be printing abunch of money to not have hard moneyto have a corrupt central banking systemandto have all of these issues with youryour central financial structure it justmakes absolutely no senseand it allows for massive amounts ofcorruption and disparity thatum could easily be remedied there's somuch force that bitcoin can do for goodin the world andi see so many parallels with nutritionalideology and it's totally true i meanthere'speople just curling the most ridiculousvitriol bitcoin sayingwe told you so when it goes down fivepercent and then they'resilent when it goes up 14 in a week andthen you know in a year when it'sprobably more than a hundred thousandwho knows they'll be very silent andthey'll continue to criticize it when ithas another drop andit's there's so many parallels and iagree it's just you have to be willingto think outside the box andand if you're just always going tofollow the the school of fish thenyou'll end up offcliff at some point with the rest of thelemmings and you're justa sheeple person which is where manypeople are comfortable but it's fun tobeat the edges of that or at least tryingto challenge that in the nutritionalspace and it's fun to learn about theother side of the cryptocurrencies inthe financial worldum otherwise yeah there's a lot ofparallels there yeah absolutelyall right so tell us some of the uhgreatest hits on thatplants have done on us how have plantsbeenharming human beings over the pastexecutive summary of the last 10000 years of human agriculture oh mygosh well i meanwe have to go back a little bit furtherprobably 400 million years further backto think about the fact that plants andanimals have co-evolved for a very verylong timeand there's been constant chemicalwarfare between plants and animals theentirety of that evolution and you knowit's noti don't know why people imagine that allplants are edible and all plants arebenign it's sort of thisit's the sort of pantheistic philosophylike plants are wonderful and plants areplants are sacred and i don't know whereit comes from and anything from theearth is good for you and it can'tpossibly hurt you until youstep on a scorpion or get them by asnake or try and eat a plant or amushroom that'sgoing to kill you dead in five minutesum you realize that's just a fairytaleideology but you know it's i've oftenthought about this like the scene fromcharlie the chocolate factory where theywalk into the candy roomand everything is made of sugar andthere's like lollipop trees and achocolate riverif if that was the way the plants wereif you could really just walk outsideand everything was nutritious and icould justtake a handful of this plant and ahandful of that plants thenthere would really not be many plantsleft there would be there would be noecosystemsand this coevolution of uh differentkingdoms of life would never haveproceeded asuh delicately and as in balanced fashionas it did and soyou know it's not willy wonkas likechocolate candy room everything isn'tyou know just edible and sweet andwithout anyuh overt poison obviously there's a lotof philosophical problems with that thatanalogy when you think about theproblems withfructose and candy and what they wantbecause room but you get what i'm sayinghereand so plants have by necessity had todevelopdefense chemicals of all sorts allshapes and sizessome of them are you know digestiveenzyme inhibitors some of them are frankpoisons for animals some of them are youknow hormonal analogues that are goingto affect us negatively some of themaffectthe absorption of certain nutrients butgenerally they're all aimedat dissuading animals from overconsuming them andlike you said we as higher levelpredators we as apex predators get tobenefit fromherbivores doing most of thedetoxification for us and doing most ofthevery careful selection of differentplants for usand there's some fascinating literaturemostly by fred provenza and some othersabout uh animals wild animals ordomesticated herd animals ruminants likecows or buffalothat are limited in their paddocks attimescausing them to over consume certainplants leading to mass die-offs ormassive sickeningof these animals i mean even animalsthat are herbivorouslike a ruminant for instanceuh like a cow or a sheep or a goat or abuffaloor bison understand that they they'renot just going to eatone plant all day every day they'regoing to eat a little bit of one plant alittle bit of another andyou know mostly cows eat grass but ifyou look at sheep they're grazing thefields and they're eating a little bitof this plant a lot of that plants andif you lookcarefully at what's in the fields it'snot just pure grassit's grass and other plants if you'veever been to an actual farm where theydo grass-feeding of animals and sothey're they're already understandingthat these plants have alkaloids andother toxinsand they're being very careful to selectthem and not over consumecertain degrees of these and then youknow if you look at the specificsthe big ones that i see and that i'veoutlined in the book are things likethe isothiocyanates which is a wholeseries ofcompounds um along with othergoitrogenic compounds found in thebrassica familythere's things like lectins which arecarbohydrate binding proteinsthere's things like phytic acid which isa large chelating moleculethat creates negative mineral absorptionandnegative mineral flux things likeoxalates which aredicarboxylic acids which appear to beproblematic for humanssome things uh are problematic forhumans even beyond that like potentiallysalicylates in some people though ithink salicylates are not quite asproblematic inmany people but the list goes on there'sjust so many of these and many of thesearepolyphenolic things like uh alkaloids orterpenes or flavonoids and they can havea variety of different effects in thehuman bodythe most probably the most well-knownexample would be something likeresveratrolwhich is a polyphenolic compound presentin the skin of peanuts and grapesand a few other foods andthe the compound resveratrol is producedin response to a fungus the botrytisfungus so it's sort of a plant sayinghey get off of me this is a defensechemicaland it got popularized by david sinclairand a few others when they realized thatit activated a set of genes calledsirtuins whichmaybe were connected with longevity inmouse models or maybe could normalizeuh mice on like really crappy diets butumin most of the human trials that it'sbeen done that's been studied and itdoesn't do much of anything good forhumansand they're using doses that are muchmuch higher than anything you'd ever getby eating normal foods and in fact ithas some apparent negative effects likedecreasing androgen precursorsspecificallyuh dehydroat the endosterone sulfatedhes a few others in studies soin one study it actually worsenedmetabolic conditions anddoesn't seem to really have any effecton preventing prostate cancer and yetit's probably still a multi-uh billiondollar industry for resveratrolso it's it's a plant compound thatprobably would have been exposed tosmall amounts of in our diet but nothingthat our body couldn'tdetoxify with the phase one and phasetwosystems in our liver but when we domassive amounts of it just because we'retrying touh crowbar open the door of sirtuins andlongevity which i think is afool's errand um we end up with someapparent negative consequencesand then the isothiocyanates i mentionedare like ronda patrick's belovedsulforaphane andum i have called her out before and i'lljust respectfully say that i appreciateher work and i wish she would show upfor a debateat some point in our lifetimes but ithink that she willnever do that but sulforaphane is acompound that's produced whenglucoraphanin which is a precursor inbroccoliand other brassicas combines withmyrosinase and these are locked in twodifferentcompartments of the cell in a plant andso these are only combinedlike a booby trap like super glue whenthe plants are chewed so it's veryclearlya boogie trap it's very clearly like heygotcha you're going to eat my plantsyou're going to eat my stems or myleavesor my roots i'm going to make a toxinthat doesn't exist normallyand that's going to be problematic foryou in the case of sulforaphane it'spretty strongpro-oxidant and it also iswell known to be part of this series ofcompounds known widely as questions andisothiocyanates thathave varying activities at the level ofthe thyroid with the absorption ofiodineisothiocyanates like sulforaphane areperhaps not strongest there's anotherone called goitrinwhich occurs in things like brusselssprouts which is much strongerand actually proven to have some prettysignificant effects ofthe level of the thyroid iodine but theintention of plants is pretty clear herethey're not trying to help you they'retrying to get youto not eat their leaves because theywant their leaves to be thereso that they can photosynthesize andmake roots and then make seeds whichthey will spread the next generation soi again i just intuitively i'm not surehow people get so confused aboutthis it's not to say that you can't findsome benefitsthese compounds if you study them inisolationwith sort of a myopic perspective or a averytightly framed experiment like lookingat dna damagebecause as a pro-oxidant compounds likesulforaphane will trigger our endogenousantioxidant systemwhich is driven mostly by nrf2 and keepone and so we'll make more glutathionebut we can do that normally and this isthe problem is that if you look atpeople contextually wholead a good life and are in the sun anddoing maybe a moderate amount ofexercise and crazyand have enough nutrients predominantlynutrients from animal foodsto make glutathione in their own bodyvitamin b6 riboflavin folate and theessential amino acids necessary to dothat then it's pretty hard forresearchers to actually show that so farif it does anything positiveso this gets to be fairly nuanced andi'm sure your audience kind ofunderstands this because they're sort ofin thiscarnivore space and they may have heardme or someone else talk about it so iapologize if this isredundant or overly involved but the theargument that i make with these plantcompounds is generally thati ask people to really show me a netbenefit in humans who are already eatinga healthy dietum because there's all of thiscontextual nuance like it's one thing toshow that a compound can do somethingbeneficialin an isolated study in a populationthat's unhealthy but we really know thatit does anything gooduh net uh in a population that's eatinga healthy diet that already has thenutrients they need andwhere are the people who are looking toweigh the risks versus the benefitsand there's very little literaturelooking at the negative side effects ofthese plant compounds soit gets a little confusing in literaturebecause everybody wants to point outsaying hey this plant compound does thisand this plant compound does thatbut if you dig into the other side ofthe literature most of these compoundshave a big dark side you know you couldsay oh resveratrolis going to activate sirtuins whichappear to have a reasonablybeneficial effect on the human body butthen it has all these other negativeside effects maybe it worsensglycemic control maybe it actuallyworsens metabolic health a little bitmaybeyou know decreases androgen precursorssulforaphane the same way like maybe youcould get a little bit more of anantioxidant effect quote unquote at thelevel ofuh nrf2 and keep one but when youactually dig into the net benefitis it anything and then you'reinhibiting the absorption of iodinethyroid do we need any of thesecompounds we're often ignoring thecollaterally damaging side effects sothe list goes on and on but there aremany of these compounds andi didn't even talk about lectins whichare really problematic for humansum mostly occurring in seeds nuts grainsand legumes so the plant seedsand and those appear to have some prettydarn disruptive effects on the level ofthe gut which isas many people may understand that he'swidely hypothesized to beground zero for most autoimmune diseaseand most chronic illnessso if there's anything there you'd likeme to elaborate on i can do more or wecan move on to talking about somethingelsewhich is broad swath of the plantcompoundyeah i mean i'll be perfectly honestwith you as far as i'm concerned it'sjust all plansand i just stay away from it all right imean uh yeah we spent a lot of timestudying this and i think you know it'sgreat that people like youum have all of the arguments to confrontthe others with buti'd be lying if i said that i couldfollow because you knowi'm a very practical person and so itake the lazy way out and so i justi just don't eat all plants and thatallows me to uhto to not have to memorize all of thehorrors that they uhwell and then and then let's go backbriefly to the anthropologyand and um you know this is a littletricky because i haven't spent yearswith the hatsa like frank marlowe didfor his phd thesis butchoose to do some other things with mytime sometimes but it's pretty clearthat these hunter-gatherer groups dohave a hierarchy in their foods and wesaid theythey favor meat organs they favorhunting of animals and then they reallythey will eat honey uh when they can getit and they will tend to gather fruitwhen it's available and seasonalbut they don't really go out celebratingthat they can get pumpkin leaves ortubers i mean they'll eat them butthey're not really excited about themand they don't eat the seeds of thebaobab fruit very often unless they'reuh really not doing well in hunting andso this is anothersort of nuanced thing to just add to thediscussion that many people will pointto these hunter gatherers and saylook at all the plants they eat and youkind of say well actually if you askthem like which do they preferthey always prefer meat and i suspectthat a lot of times and this isfairly well corroborated by the researchthey're only eating the plants becausethey'rethey're not able to hunt the animals sothey're doing what omnivores do they'redoing what humans have probably done formillions of years which is be veryadaptableso that we can survive periods ofscarcity and i think thatthese small small groups of remaininghunter-gatherers are looking at more andmore scarcity and smaller and smallergains because they're being squeezedout and so um if they do eat pumpkinleaves icei've gotta think that there's areasonable argument to make that that'sjust like a survival foodas opposed to like a really preferentialfood for themyeah and i think this is where the umyou know we go from the kind of thementality where let's uh ape everythingthat uh traditionalhunter-gatherers do versus a morepractical way of thinking about it whichisit's not about aping everything thatthey do it's about seeing how they'reable to thrive on a predominantly meatdietand then understanding that you knowthey're humans after all they're nodifferent from all of usand so they will have you know they willeat whateveris necessary they get hungry they don'talways haveready game on tap to tap intothey sometimes have to make do withterrible things but i thinkthe the number that the 20th century hasdoneon us is that it has convinced us thatyou know the things that we havehistorically usedas aas a substitute for food to tie thisover which our body can digest but it'snot ideal for usit has turned things around entirely inorderand convinced most people that what isessential for our health which is meatis actually bad for you and what iscompletely inessential andlikely quite harmful is what you need tobegoing after and this is the tragedy ofmodern people because a lot of peoplethink that you knoweating healthy is expensive actuallyeating healthy is really cheapi i you can do it and i've met you knowi've written anessay on my website on safety.com meaton what i've learned as in in five yearsas a carnivorei wrote it last year and you know i giveit's quite practical it contains allkinds of cooking advice andwhat to eat and i i explained that youcan do the carnivore diet on practicallyzero dollars a dayif you go to your butcher make afriendship with your butcher uh he'llgive you some bonesand um you know you can buy them forvery cheap close to nothingand you can boil the bones and you caneat them and they're actually extremelynourishing and even delicious you know alittle bit of saltthey taste great after a lot of boilingand they'll bequite mushy and they're extremelynutritiousit's and and you know butchers throwaway the most nutritious food likethey'll throw awaya lot of the fat and a lot of the bonesthey'll throw it away orsometimes it's actually used in farmingso they sell it to farmers whowill um make uhessentially plant feed from it and putit on in the soilbecause it's got a lot of nutrients butit's amazing you know you go to thesupermarket and you think abouthow much nutrients the butcher shop inthe supermarket throws awayversus how much nutrients exist on allthe rest of the shelves of the processedfoodand you the supermarket might bethrowing away more nutrients thanit sells every day outside of thebutcher shop like all the plant foodat least all the processed foodsdefinitely you know all the stuff thatcomes inshiny plastic wrappers definitely hasfewer nutrients thanuh all of the stuff that the butcher inthe same supermarket throws awayand if you look at the cost analysis iagree with you completely i meanhow much nutrition is there in a poundof meat and how much nutrition is therein a pound of chocolatepound of wheat or a pound of uh you knowkaleit's not even a question you know apound of meat even if you getgrass-fed grass-fished meat six dollarseight dollars a poundwell good luck getting anywhere nearthat amount of nutrition in eightdollars of wheatyou just won't do it you can eat wheatuntil the cows come home and you won'tachieve the same amount of nutrition andbut when the cows come homeand then you'll be all right what's thatwhen the cows come home you can just eatthe cows and then you'll be all rightyes yes exactly so your point i mean theorgans are also a super cheap way forpeople to get you know very uniquenutritionif you go to a butcher they'll oftensell you liver for five dollars a poundor lessum and you only need i mean a halfan ounce of liver per day will willradically changesomeone's life nutritionally even ifthey're not eating meat soum one of the things that my companyheart and soil does is we make thesedesiccated organ supplements for peoplewhodon't want to be fresh organs and ithink the thing that makes me thehappiest is when i get a message from avegetarian or a vegansaying i don't eat meat but i want totry your supplements as likestepping up stone and i think that'sreally cool because i really believethatby them investing a dollar a day or lessin in liver or heart or spleen or kidneyor pancreas or organs that very fewpeople are going to eatum but that are very cheap and areeasily obtained throughout the worldthey're going to feel differently andthat may help with their mindsetchange and i think that's such a hugething that it's and you're right like ifyou go to your butcher you can get freemeatassuming you can get free fat you couldprobably get nearly free bones you couldprobably getnearly free liver um and then if you buythe cheapest type of meat which isground beef gosh there's a lot ofnutrition there and you're going to doreally really good for i've got to sayten dollars a day or less and um i thinkthat most people listen to this couldspend ten dollars a day on their foodand if they can't um then we have abroader discussion of like what thepriorities areuh in their life for their finances yeahabsolutely and i thinkum you know one common complaint is thatwelldon't you get bored eating ground beefevery day and the answer is no like ifyou justknow how to get your ground beef mixedin the rightquantities of fat and meat that you likeand you know how to grill it or fry itor whatever it isit's it's actually astonishing howlittle you get bored of it likeuh in my mind honestly you get bored ofeating plant foodand then the need for variety in food isbecause plant foods are boring you can'teatthe same plant food three days in a rowit gets reallyum tedious and boring for you and that'swhypeople who eat plants have this ideathat food has to beinteresting and innovative everythingit's like meeting a new person every dayand havingand it isn't you know food is nutritionit's like building a house in my mindyou know when you're building a houseyou're not looking for varietyand you're not looking for entertainmentyou're looking to build the house whichwill then allow you to experiencevariety and entertainment in all kindsof other things that you doinside the house but first you got toget serious about making the roofand making sure the roof doesn't leakand the foundations are strongand then the amount of fun that you canhave in ahouse that's well built is orders ofmagnitudes largerthan the fun that you can have if youtreated uh the building of the house asthe fun activity you know if you treatedthe building of a house as a partyyou're gonna have a dysfunctional housein which you won't be able to have funand i think the same goes for the bodyif you treat your body as you know ifyou treat your digestive system as anentertainment organ as a way for yourbody toexperience pleasure that's an enormouswastebecause this is essential for yoursurvival you're not going to be healthyand you're not going to be able toexperience other kinds ofentertainment and fun you can have somuch more fun when you're healthy thanyou can if you're not eating healthy andthat appliesacross all aspects of life you knowwhether you like to do exercise whetheryou like to do outdoor activitiesuh whether you're sexually active allthese things become very different whenyou'reuh when you're healthy and so it'syou know if you get bored from groundbeefthe reason is you need moreentertainment in your life than food youneed to findbetter ways of you need better nutritionand better entertainment in your lifeyou need to separate the two it's how iput iti couldn't agree more i think that if wechoose to use food as entertainmentthat's any individual's right as asovereign humanbut uh you're you're then sacrificinganything you could buildwith a a more intentional dietand so i think people want both and ithink honestly eating a lot ofanimal foods gives you both uh it'squite enjoyable and it will createhealthbut i like your analogy with building ahouse but i agree with youthat if you treat eating food asentertainment you will not obtainoptimal healthand that's just a conscious trade-offthat every human needs to choose but ithink peoplewant to believe that it's possible tojust always eat the food that gives themthe most dopamine in their brainmost of that being processed food orfood cooking restaurants often in seedoilsand that's just not going to work formany people and to your other point orto preventfor anyone for that matter to your otherpoint i i think that plant foods alsoget boring because of the alkaloidsum and this is something i experiencedwhen i was a vegani was convinced that wheatgrass and ijust makes me nauseous even tell thestory but i'll do it because iappreciate you guysi was convinced that wheatgrass wasamazing and so i grew wheatgrassin my house and i had a wheatgrassjuicerand every day after i got home from myrun i would juice wheatgrass and make awheatgrass shotand i don't think it took more than twoweeks before i came home andliterally as a vegan somebody whosecorticalresponse to this was positive my limbicmoreprimal brain was like put that downthat is not good for you that and i hadclearly accumulated way too manyalkaloidsfrom the wheatgrass um the wheatgrassjuice it was just like and to this day ishudder i wouldnever drink another shot of wheatgrassin my life and so i think that plantfoods also get boring because we starttowe're like the cows we have thismechanism and we start to accumulatetoo many alkaloids too many plant toxinsand our body says you better eat adifferent plant food or you're going toget way too much of this and you're justgoing to start getting nauseousand so this is the problem is that wetry and make these plant foods disguisedand people want to make these greensmoothies where they combinesuper bitter horrible tasting leafygreens that are not food for humanswith fruit which you know is sweeter andwe can talk about the fruit andit makes it a little more palatable andthen people are getting way too manyleafy greens and other things they'recuttingcreating all sorts of problems for themand so i think thati i love what you said there that ithink that many people are coming froman omnivorous perspectiveof getting bored with plants quitequickly because plant foods arequite boring and they can't wrap theirhead around the fact that you could eatmeat every single meal as i have forman it's got to be definitely more thanthree plusfour or five years now um and never getbored of it never say oh man another ribeye for dinner tonighti can't do it or more burgers andthere's a great company here in costarica that makesgrass-fed grass-fish beef and i've got areally nice grill hereand i love those burgers i would eatthose burgers every single dayum and i you know i'm fortunate to beable to alternate with a rib eye or askirt steak or whatever i want butit's not you don't get bored of animalfoods andthe last thing i'll mention is my ownpersonal experiencei when i threw like the pacific cresttrail uh many moons ago in the year 2000i was a young man and i didn't reallyunderstand the way that all of this sortof connected with each otherand i was trying to bring a lot ofvegetarian foods on the trail so i madea gruelin the morning of oats and buckwheat andflax seeds and milletthinking that this will be my breakfastevery morning and um and then i hadlots of other plant foods on the tripwhether it was like dates that i broughtor peanut butter i mean you know as a 20year old which is how old i was mycrest trail or a 22 year old umwho who in their early 20s doesn't thinkpeanut butter is like the best thing inthe world likethat would be the most that's like apornographic fantasy just to get eatspeanut butter every single day as muchas you wantbut lo and behold after probably a monththe pacific crest raili was absolutely sick of that morningoat gruelum i threw it out for the rest of thetrail i didn't ever want to eat anotherspoonful of peanut butter in my wholelife but i could not wait to eat my beefjerkyand the cheese and the animal productsnever ever got boring on the pacificcrest trailbut the plant foods got ridiculouslyboring and i threw outso much of what i made i dehydrated abunch ofapples a bunch of things and they justgot to be so bland and boring for methat i didn't even really want to eatthem but i always wanted the animalfoodsand i don't do cheese now i think dairydoes bother me butit illustrates the fact that like thismeat and this cheese these animal foodsnever ever got boring um after days anddays of christmas this ismy own personal experience unfortunatelyuhand not intelligently i i shifted towardeating more processed food at the end ofspecifici'm not a i'm not a saintly human and atthe end of the trail i remember i waseatinguh literally like eight ounces of creamcheese at a timeon bread and pop tarts that was my foodum because i just needed something thatwas palatable and if ijust could just go back and talk to my20 year old self i would just sayjust eat more if you just need more meatman you'll always like the beef jerky onthespecific crust trail just needs to makea shitload of it yeah wellyou know since we're tellingembarrassing food storiesi'll confess that when i was 20 year oldi used to drink something like twoliters of coca-cola a dayevery day and i was just you know mehaving a normal healthy balanced dietat that time and you can get away withit when you're 20. um but thenuh when i moved to the u.s in my uh iwas 24 when i moved there but by 27in the us that's when i started notbeing able to get away with it i thinkit's particularly because the usfood is um it's a lot of high fructosecorn syrupand all of this highly processed stuffand that's when i started waking upand uh eventually ended up going fullcarnivorebut i will say i've always loved organmeatand so you you get a lot of flack frompeople because youtalk about organ meats i'm a huge fan oforgan meat and i urge everybodylisteningwherever you are in the world there'sprobably uh a lebanese butcher withindriving distance of youthe lebanese butchers are all all overthe world the lebanese are all over theworldand their butchers are over all over theworld and theyi think have the best umculture for preparing uh organ meats andraw meatsit's uh it's absolutely amazing whatthey do with them they prepare themreally really wellso if you go to your local lebanesebutcher um ask them forsauda which is the raw liver they cut itupreally nice and they clean it up andthen they you eat it raw with littletiny chunks of fatit's it's even before i was a carnivorethis was for a very long time this wasmy favorite dish in the worldit's uh it's really really delicious butyou have to clean the liveruh quite properly and still eat it allthe timeum and i like to eat brains i like toi like all organ meats well iprobably haven't had them all yet but ii'm pretty closeso um i'm wondering do you think organmeats are essentialbecause i i enjoy them i eat thembecause i have to but i know a lot ofpeople don'tenjoy them and it seems that quite a fewcarnivores seem to be thriving withouthaving to eat uh organ meatswhat do you think you know i'lli'll start the answer to that questionwith again a throwback to theanthropologyi've there's no tribes that i've everread aboutheard of or visited that only eat themeat and throw out the organs i'll tellyou when wekilled animals and i hunted ahunted a baboon with the hodge and wekilled a goatand in both of those situations theliver was the first thing eaten and itwas treated likeuh like a bitcoin uh to be honest as itcame out of the organanimal you know it was it was held withtwo hands and gently placed on a rockand you know guarded it was like it wasin the mostyou know secure wallet you could everfind and everybody got a little piece ofitand it was like wow and the same thingwith the heart andthe the kidneys and the spleen and theorgans were the first thing eating theyneverthrew out or wasted the organs they didgive theum small and large intestines to thedogs but they ate the stomachso the dogs are sort of the companionsof the hadza on their hunts andi suppose they have to eat something sothey'll give the intestines to the dogsbut every other organ gets eaten fromthe testiclesto you know the ears the tongue to theeyeballs to the brain iate i ate uh baboon brain with thehazard one morning and look at me idon't evenseem to have any symptoms of prionpoisoning yet so uhtalk to me in six months see if i'mdrooling but um it wasit was great and and they they clearlytreasure it andso that that to me is a good indicationofthe importance of organs in the diet andthen if you actually lookat the brass tax nutritional uhcontent of organs they're often quiteunique relative to muscle meat musclemeat is amiracle of nature and is incrediblynutritious andthere's not a whole lot of folate inmuscle meat there's notprobably not enough ribosome for mostpeople in muscle meat there's not enoughthere's not a ton of biotinin muscle meat there's not much copperin muscle meatbut when you start to eat muscle meatwith a few of the organsum whether it's heart or liver both ofthose havemuch higher amounts of ribosome and muchhigher amountsof some of these other fat soluble andwater-soluble minerals that reallycomplete the picture and the interestingthing about organs is you don't have toeat a lotbut a little bit goes a long way like isaid even half an ounce of liver or theequivalent in a desecrated organsupplementis going to be really pretty much thesweet spot for most people and it makessense because when you have a liver ofan animal it gets divided among 15 or 20hunters they're not going to get a tonbut they might just get a little bitbut then you get into these uniquepeptides which are less than 50 aminoacidsignaling molecules and they're they'revery unique in different organs as welland so the muscle has some butone of the ones that's in vogue nowthat's injected exogenously is bpc-157and that's present in the stomach so forinstance if you're eating tripeor an extracted trite you're going toget naturally occurring dtc157and then you can look at other um manyother peptides there's peptides presentin the liver there's no that's presentin the heart peptides present in thetesticles andall over the place which i think areprobably uniquely beneficial for usnutritionally soum i i find organs to be quite uniquelybeneficialum and if people don't want to eat thefresh organs that's why we do thingslike desiccated organs that harden soilobviously if you're eating fresh organsyou're great but but that was why ibuilt the company just to make it moreaccessible for people and to help themget as much nutrition as they canin just the freeze-dried organs but ithink that if you if you're with thehazzaor the uh or any other tribe you'llclosely realize that the organs areprizedand they would never waste them and theywould gladly take your share of liver ifyoujust share it with them yeah i'll gladlytake the liverum i i think it's great that i umbrains as well are absolutely deliciousprobably the most deliciousorgan um to have is maybe the brain wellnever probably it's it's tough to decidebut i'm i'm still not 100 sureon it being essential becausei i'm sure you've seen a lot ofcarnivores on the carnivore groupsand on the carnivore blogs they swear byyou knowyears and decades even of just rib eyesor just burgers a lot of them have beeneating thisand they seem to be thriving do youthink they could stillum and i think here you know there'swe can think about individual nutrientsand according and think aboutum the individual nutrient requirementsbut in my mindperhaps that is influenced too much bylooking at the averagestandard american diet victim andyou know maybe their requirements forsome of these nutrients are much higherthanwhat carnivores need because standardamerican dieteaters are eating a lot of toxic stuffand sothey might require more nutrientsbecause their absorption of thenutrients might be lessso that's why organ meats arevery beneficial for them but perhaps youknow if youquit eating the plants and you're justgetting the muscle meati think as far as i can see you know ifthe person is thriving thenmaybe that's more important than the uhwhat we then what we see in theum you know in in the labs and in the uhmetrics for how much uhof this or that nutrient they should getyeah i think definitely if somebody'sthriving it's hard to argue with thati always wonder could they feel betterum if they add a little bit of organsyou know is there another gear that theydon't even know that they have yet wehear about that sometimesthis is sometimes like a vegan argumenttoo likelook at rich roll he's clearly thrivingon a vegan diet i thinkthat's a joke but i'm pretty sure thatwhatever gear which roll has right nowhe would haveuh five more if he added meatto his diet and so um i can't help butthinkthat many of these meat based carnivoreswould do would do better with organs andto me i just don't quite understand itit does seem evolutionarily consistentit almost seems to be this like dogmaticbattleground that i don't engage inwithin the carnivore community which ithink is already too dogmatic and closedmindedwhere people are like no you don't needit and why would you not even try it ithink it's going to feel betterand then to be honest with you i'veworked with a lot of clients personallyand seen their blood work again this isnot this often does correlate with theirsymptomatology and how they feel overallsubjectively but i i do see their bloodwork going a negative direction theydon't eatliver or at least some source of folateand riboflavin i see homosystem go up isee serum levels and folate go downand i just can't i have a hard timewrapping my head aroundrising levels of almost 16. there's somepretty decent evidence that that's not agood predictor andit just corrects immediately when youaddeven half an ounce of liver with folateand riboflavinespecially people with mthfrpolymorphisms which are quite common inmany ethnic groupsthe methylene tetrahydrofolate reductaseenzyme soyou know i i if people are thrivingi'm happy for them and and i think thata lot of them could do even betterum and in my experience working withpeople just even a little bitof a few organs makes a big differenceuh in terms of laboratory analysis orphysiologycool i guess if i were to uh i think thedrawbackperhaps here is that a lot of people getsqueamish and get turned offwhen you mention uh organ meats and thenthat's uhand and then i think some people seethat it might be more productive to justtell them to focus on getting the meatsthat they likeum because you know there's there's anenormous improvement that can be had ifyou just switch to your favorite steakand if you can just support to have yourfavorite steak every dayyou know you will benefit enormouslywhereasperhaps if you try and uh convince themto have organ meat they'll beless likely to move on to it but yeahi still got to take you to a lebanesebutcher one day and have some raw liverraw lamb river liver specifically andactuallyit has to go here it has to be in themiddle eastin the levant in particular becausethat's where we have what i think isprobably the tastiest uh local lambit's it's the fat tailed awasilam and itcomes with a tail of like three fourpounds of fatand that's really delicious fat andthat's the fact that they cut up andthey put serve with the liver so that'sumit's it's quite different from raw liveranywhere else so i got to have you overin the middle eastin the lebanon somewhere and uh give yousome of thatum all right so now fruits and honeywhat's the deal with thatwell i appreciate that we can have somesome some conversation and shareslightly different opinions on this uhso i'll just i'll start with my ownexperiencewhich may just be my end of oneand that was that you know after a yearand a half of carnivore dietmeat organs and fat exclusively and soldand to be honest in the middle ofwriting my books you can imagine theuh the the no small amount of cognitivedissonance i was experiencingyou know i just i started to feel coldall the timeand my sleep was pretty disrupted atthat pointum and i just thought you know what whydon't i just add backsome honey um it's made by beesi'm sure potentially an animal you couldpotentially you know if you really wantto get into these sort of ideologicalphilosophical argumentsi don't think honey has defensechemicals i don't think bees are tryingtopotentially put defense chemicals intheir honey why don't i just trya little bit of honey in my diet and andi justi immediately felt better and i wore acontinuous glucose monitor fromnutrisense and i continued to check mylabs very closelyand what i saw in myself and what i'veseen in many other people is thatmy fasting insulin actually dropped andmy overallarea under the curve in my cgm actuallydroppedfor daily glucose and so what you get ismy fast blood sugar droppedum from probably the high 90s to the mid70s when i introducedsome honey i would get short quickspikes with very low area under thecurvewhen i would eat honey and then it wouldquickly return to baseline and stay flatvery low glycemic variability throughoutthe day between meals again my fastinginsulin which was probably5.1 or 4.6 then became 3.2 on numerousoccasions connected with a c-peptidethat was i think 0.46so i and the hstrp didn't move and ithe only thing i felt was better and soof course in my mind i'm thinking allright but i've read all of thisliterature about how damaging fructoseisum aren't i harming my liver and it'sgood because i think all of theseexperiments then sendus all down um research rabbit holes andand i founda whole set of literature on thebenefits of honey whether it was on oralhealthor uh you know oral mucositisor oral candida or any of these thingsand then you find i found aseries of articles looking at nitrateprecursors in honeyum and saying and showing that whenpeople were consuming rawsort of organic dark honey they hadincreased nitrates in the urinesuggesting there's increased nitricoxide productionand there's a really interesting studydone in mice which is againa mouse study so it's not perfect wherethey can give things like glucose andsucroseand see indicators of liver inflammationand andsort of negative effects in the liverbut those are abrogated when they givethem ice honey and you thinkman maybe there is something to thiswhole food maybe there's something tothese nitric oxide precursors maybesomething in the honeyis mitigating the negative effects offructose and soi'm quite fascinated now by thisjuxtaposition and nutrition and i try tospeak more and i'm actually going to bespeaking about this more in the futureabout nutritional reductionismand i think that this this gets thisgets levied against us as carnivores andanimal-based leaders as much as it getslevied againstuh me when i'm talking about fructose oranyone but people want to conflatestudies done with fructose and glucoseor sucrose and isolationwith studies done in terms of a wholefood matrix or a whole fruit or a wholehoneyand they do tend to look quitedifferently there's some pretty goodstudies that are doneum with some fruit extracts and this issomething that would have been verychallenging for me to wrap my headaround when i was writing the bookand it's not something i put in the bookso i really feel like i have to uhcontinually evolveand you know maybe write a a part two orapart a second version but it's just thisidea that like you can givepeople diets with more fruit and seemetabolicindicators get better you're like okayhow does that happen and you can givepeople fruit and see lipid peroxides godown but if you give people diets thatare high in fructose you can see whatthe peroxides go upso he said okay how do i make sense ofthisand i know from my own experience that ifeel better withwith carbohydrates in my diet and i alsofeel better when i don't eat grainswhen i don't get those carbohydratesfrom parts of plants that appear to bemore highly defendedmaybe those seeds nuts grains legumes orplant leaves or plant roots don't reallywork well for meum but it's just this idea again goingback to the hunter gatherer is that theydo eat fruit and honey when it'savailableand when i was with the hadza when wewere hunting the baboonthey came across a hive with honey andthey wentham on it like they they just ate the out of that high with honey andall the larva and the honey and there'sthe video of me on my instagram eatinghoneycomb um from the kazaand it has larva in it and they werejust eating it with me and if you lookat the hajjathey are pretty metabolically healthythey don't get diabetes they don't seemto haveissues and so i thought okay maybethere's something to this now again itkind of goes back to what we're sayingabout meat and organsif you or anyone else is thriving on acertain diet who am ito say no you should include these foodsin your diet but ii think that this is the sort ofoverarching ethos which which i've triedto discussall of these concepts whether it'scarnivore or animal based or anythinghe's like i want this message to be outthere for people who are stillstrugglingwho might do a carnivore diet and end upwith electrolyte abnormalities like ididmassive cramping in the legs or sleepabnormalities orprobably a little bit of hypothyroidismclinically umand and yet they feel like okay i i wentcarnivoreand my autoimmune condition got betterwe hear this all the timemy joints got much better my acne gotbetter my rosacea got better my accentgot betterand i experienced this myself i can'tinclude fruitbut i'm having massive electrolyteproblems i mean there were timesthis is just my end of one but i'veheard it to multiple people now therewere many times that i would wake up inthe middle of the night witharrhythmias and i thought that i wasgoing to diefrom this you know i was probably havingruns of supraventricular tachycardia orsomethingdue to electrolyte abnormalities so i dothink thatfor many people um a purely animal baseda purelyanimal food-centric diet is going to begreat but i want people to also knowthat it'spossible to move beyond that or movelaterally to a space where there aresome what i was considered to be lesstoxic plant foodsthat might solve some of those problemsand it's just been really encouragingfor me to see a lot of peopleemail us at heart and soil or email andsay heyi'm loving carnivore it's been a gamechanger andi wake up in the middle of the night andmy calves are cramping so bad that itwakes me up or i'm having palpitationsor i'm not sleeping well or i just feelcold all the time what should i do andmy answer isadd carbohydrates and more often thannot they're likethat's great i feel i feel fantastic nowthank you it's kind of this like reallysweet spot soit's why i've been talking aboutcarnivore and then this thislateral cousin called animal base whichis still a diet that'salmost entirely meat and organs but justwith some of these plant foodsif you choose to include them knowingthat they are a liver and a lot let'stolerate themnot everybody tolerates them noteverybody's going to tolerate all fruitfor instance squash which is technicallya fruittends to give me eczema again but i caneat bananas here incosta rica and i can eat honey and idon't seem to get any negative effectsand a lot of the things that i wasexperiencingwith long-term ketogenic diets seem tobeum seem to be much uh improved sothere'sthat kind of like interesting middleground and believe me um if i didn'tif you thought i took plaque for talkingabout a carnivore dietlook what happens when the guy thatwrites a book about the carnivore dietuh now says maybe some carbs are okaynow all of my detractors you knoweverybody comes out against thecarnivores hate you and everybody thathated you in the first place saysgotcha see i told you so so i just thinkthat there's there's an interestingnuance here and people can understandthat there's kind of a spectrumwe're all trying to understand how tohelp humans get to better healthand i think you know what you're doingis laudable you're trying to helpeveryone get to you know really solidfinancial freedom andwe're just trying to improve the qualityof their lives and i think thatum though i've always found the sayinglike there's no oneright answer for everyone a little bitpasse and a little bit too generalbecause i do think there are someoverarching principlesuh that will be quite guiding and idon't think that there are somehumans who have this radical geneticmutation which allows them to do well ina vegan dieti think that there is some freedom forlateral movement for people and wheni've dug into the literatureon fructose at least in whole food formit's beenit's been quite fascinating to kind ofum toferret it out and to really say what'sthe nuance here and it is fructosein a raw organic dark honey the same asfructose and sucrose right or sugarcaneorum or any of these things or fruit likeis this really bad for us or isis there something else in there that'sthat's changing the way our body reactsto this which is kind of fascinatingum whole food matrix type talk does thatanswer your questionum yeah um i mean i find it fascinatingumyou know i'm not much for burningheretics so i'm uh happy to discuss thisbutuh i'll tell you like my personalexperiences if i have a little bit offruiti feel a little bit bloated well it'snot that i feel bloated it's more thatuh when i'm when i'm 100 cleanmeat only i feel like uha formula one racing car you know justperfectly optimizedeverything is perfect uh it's it'sit's optimized to make the most out ofthe fuel and it gets the perfect fueland produces the best performance andtheni've not had any single plant food thati've thrown in andnot felt a little bit you know my laptime goes downit's like you you spike the fuel for theformula one carit's just i'm i'm not at my uhpeak level of performance and so i get ii can feel itin my digestive system and i feel youknow it was much smoother when umit was much smoother when things were uhwhen i was 100 uh meat onlybut also i think the other thing is thatit gives me cravings this is the otherthing with sugarand you know i think if for everybody inour generation you know we grew upeating tons and tons of sugar we are alleffectively we're all like recoveringalcoholics for sugar those of us who gointocarbohydrate low carbohydrate dietswe're effectively likerecovering alcoholics and um you knowperhapsi i mean i think um maybe maybethis is the case for uh you know if weif i hadn't grown up eating vegetableoil and tons of sugar in candyup until my late 20s and i've lived myentire life eating meatand fruit maybe maybe this would beoptimal but i thinkthere might be a case in my case wheremaybe the metabolic damage that's beentaking place has gone too farso i'm curious what is it you think thatthe fructose is adding to your diet likewhy does it take away thecramps and how sustainable is itgiven that it is addictive and that it'salways going to make you want moreuh a couple of thoughts about that sowhen i will mention thislike physiologic insulin resistance isrealum long-term ketosis isa very finely tuned evolutionary statefor humansand if we avoid carbohydrates orwe are in ketosis long term the bodygets very good at partitioning glucosetotesticles the red blood cells thekidneys the adrenals the brainand spares glucose the level of musclessothis is really well documented and thisis what is calledphysiologic insulin resistance and thisis the reason that i don't like usingthe terminsulin resistance to describe metabolicdysfunction which iswhat some people might consider to bepathological insulin resistance theregets to be a little nuance herebut the many people in the healthnutrition space havecorrectly pointed out that a ketogenicdiet does make your musclesinsulin resistant this is how we surviveas humansand i don't think that's a bad thingthat's physiologic nowpathological insulin resistance is whenyour body actually wants the muscles toreceive insulin but because the fatcellsare broken um and this is a fascinatingtopic that i've done intomy podcast a bunch they're sort ofspewing out non-sterified fatty acidsand those non-sterified fatty acidssignals the muscleto become insulin resistant improperlyso that's pathological insulinresistance but i think that that's thebestverbiage for that is metabolicdysfunction so when you are in a stateof physiologic insulin resistance andyouintroduce sugar into your diet your bodyis going to have this time when it likepulls into the pit on the nascarand all the tires come off andeverybody's like what kind of tires weput on because we suddenly have atotally different race trackand this may not be the case for you butit's possiblethere is probably about a 48 to 72 hourwindow where your body ischanging and all of this newtranscription happens and you have tosuddenly makeglucose transporters for this membranesand all of your musclessuddenly have to switch to becomeinsulin sensitive and so if you werewearinga continuous glucose monitor which islike one of thesethings that goes in your arm and you'rein ketosis you'll seethis phenomenon where your fasting bloodsugar is i don't know 80 or 90and then if you all day long it's like aflat line some people are at a hundredit's a flat line all day this is whatcarnivore cgm's look likeand then if you suddenly introducecarbohydrates like say you were to havetwo tablespoons of honey which i'm suresounds likea crazy thing but just hear me out thiswas a thought experimentyour blood sugar is going to have quitea significant response the first daybut over time in the course of threedays i think you will see your bodyum change in terms of actual genetranscription and actual physiologyto the point where your body says oh wehave been ina land with no carbohydrates for a longtimeand suddenly we have stumbled into aland where there are lots of berries onthe bushesand your body says oh okay i know how todo this i remember how to do thisbut it takes some time to adjust so ithink that the point of thisis just to say that for some people thetransition from long term to ketosisto including carbohydrates might feel alittle rocky because there is somephysiologic transformation that has tocome outyour little race car gets the tires inthe pit and then when it's good it goesout and it's like oh okaythings are pretty good here um an answertoyour your question which is what do thecarbohydrates addthey they they add a lot in terms oflike you suggested electrolytemaintenance and so there's some complexphysiology here at the level of thekidneybut insulin signaling though it getsvilified is actually very beneficial forhumans now insulin excesshyperinsulinemia persistenthyperinsulinemiawhen you have pathological insulinresistance and the muscles arepersistentlyresistant to insulin is a bad thing youcan get too much insulin there's a sweetspot right it's a u-shaped curve like somany thingsbut targeted bumps of insulin are prettybeneficial for humans theyare involved in electrolyte maintenancethey affect the silence signalinginsulin actually increases glutathionein the human bodyinsulin will also increase a lot of genepathways that kind of say heyyou are in an abundant state right nowyou want to havesex and make babies okay great like wehave abundance it can change hormonesuh so for instance my testosterone wentup maybe 300 points this is again totalum testosterone goes up sexual hormonebinding globulin comes downand electrolytes get much much betterbecause of the signaling of insulinlevel in the kidneyso i think it's really important to benuanced and not black and whiteand i'm not saying you're doing this buti do think it happens in the ketogenicspace sometimeswith regard to insulin signaling thegoalin my opinion is not to have zeroinsulin signaling it's to have insulinsignalingwhich is and tissues which are veryresponsive to insulinand do what they're supposed to do andthen insulin goes off so this one goesoninsulin goes off and that was verybeneficial for humans like i said at thelevel of the kidney at the level ofelectrolytesat the level of hormones and a lot ofdifferent levels at the level ofbiochemistryoxidative reductive balance andphysiology it's not to have a constantdripall day but is to have these specifickind of points in which you introducethese things and insulin signals that'sokay that's normal human physiologyand i think that um everyone may have asubjective experience that is differentand i'm not sureum what your experiences have been withdifferentfoods that have sugar and i think it'simportant that we don't lump them alltogether again i don't think thatthings like a processed sugar are goingto have the same physiologic responseand we know this geneticallybiochemically physicallyas things that are more evolutionaryconsistent like fruitbut i i personally don't find themaddictive and don't find that myclients and people are working find themaddictive now coca-cola completelydifferent storyuh aunt jemima pancake syrup completelydifferent storyright um pancakes at uh you know ihopcompletely different story waffle housecompletely different storybut a banana i think that thatlike i said it certainly may cause somebumps in the road if you're a long-termketo and then you suddenly eat a bananaespecially a ripe banana but generally ithink within 40-72 hours your body'sgoing to adjustand you're going to become the musclesare going to turn back on in terms ofinsulin sensitivitythe last thing i'll say is this and wesee this a lot in womenwho are pregnant and if they are lowcarbwhich can be really helpful for somepeoplewhen they are recovering from a lifetimeof abusethis is nutritional abuse um metabolicdysfunction becausewhat we know is that when the fat cellsare broken and they're sending out allof these non-esterified fatty acids tothe muscle cellsif you put in carbohydrates you're notgoing to do well because your body isjustall over the place with insulin this isnot to say that elimination ofcarbohydrates can't be beneficial incertain situationsbut i don't think that it's the excesscarbohydrates that cause the diabetes inthe first placethere's lots of experiences mineindigenous cultures where they eat lotsof carbohydrates they don't get diabetesi think that again this is anotherrabbit hole the main problem withmetabolic dysfunction has to do with themitochondrial and cellular membranesespecially the fat cellsand interrupted signaling there probablydue to evolutionarily consistent levelsof linoleic acid from things like seedoilsthat's probably the main driver in myopinion and then you add carbohydrateson top of thatbut it didn't cause the fire so you canput when the fire will stop the fire butit wasn't the spark and in the settingof a blazing fire you don't want to puta bunch of wood on it you might want toremove the carbstemporarily or long term but you knowwomenwho are pregnant sometimes go low carband they will failtheir oral glucose tolerance testbecause they are physiologically insulinresistantwhen you're low carb and you could eventake a man who's not pregnant butusually men don't get og ttswomen usually get lgtt's in theirpregnancy so you could do an oralglucose tolerance test on a manwho is long-term keto like myself aftera year and a half carnivore i would havefailed itwhich means quote unquote would have hadan excessive insulin response andexcessive glucose responsebut if you then fed me honey or fruit orany carbohydrate for that matter forthree days i could go back and that ogtwould be completely normalmeaning that i would have suddenly thethethe equipment in my body would be inplace to handle all that glucose so thisis physiologic insulin resistanceif somebody's actually metabolicallybroken and you do that they're nevergoing to get better in those three daysbecause they are broken at a much deeperlevel having to do with cellularmembranes and mitochondria in the fatcellsso i guess again i apologize for thelong-winded explanation butthis is all to say that people who arelong-term keto when they introducefoods with sugars be it glucose fructoseor some combination of those twomay have an excessive response due tophysiological insulin resistance whichwe'll correctshortly and i think that there are somebenefits to a lot of people to havingsome appropriate intentional insulinsignalingand the complete aberration of insulinsignaling isuh problematic for many people at thelevel of electrolytes andhormones and things like that for manyindividuals does that make senseyeah no it's really interesting so uhwould you say like theuh the the actual advice here isgo carnivore for a few months until youfix your metabolism make sure you neverget anyuh seed oils and highly processed foodandcarbohydrates but then after you'refixedso what you have some fruits every daysome honey every day or once a week orwhat do you thinksee how you feel if people are out therethrivingdon't change anything stay carnivore ifthat's what you want to dobut if you're getting muscle cramping orheart palpitations arrhythmiasor you're seeing hormones drop or yoursleep is interruptedor you know any of those things oryou're feeling a little bit coldand yeah introduce try introducing alittle bit of carbohydrates give itmaybeuh three to five days and just see as anexperiment andand then kind of go from there and ifyou want to do more sort ofclose analysis you can wear continuousglucose monitor or you can work with aphysician who willcheck things like your lipids uh you'refasting insulinand all these things and i think whatyou'll see is that your fasting insulinwon't go upit'll actually go down as well yourfasting glucose and any other metrics sobut ultimately the goal is just to getsomebody to the highest quality of lifeand it'salready a good quality of life there'sno need to change anything again it'sjust this lateral move that gives them alittle more freedom if they're nottotally dialed in yeah i mean it'sreally fascinating for me but i'm notsure i'm uhpsychologically ready to startexperimenting with plants againi don't want to stick to my room eyesyou're thriving man don't worry about ityeah all right um kiki who is also an exvegan and a regular here has a couplequestions for youpaul thank you so much for joining ustoday and thank you foryou know going in depth and a lot ofthings that i haven'theard um and yes i am a bitcoincarnivorelike yourself uh thanks to safety'sinfluenceso are you looking at this um kind ofglobal eat lancetpro plan anti-meat movementand what do you have solutions forhow we can preserve our accessto meat in the near and far future andalsohave discussions or what the point ofview would besharing with others why uh cowsare not destroying the planet yeah imean this is such an importantconversation i think i'll take a pageout of savings book and say that bitcoinfixes thisum you know if you can pay your farmerwith bitcoin thengood luck to the us government or anyoneelse limiting that or regulating thatum you can imagine all sorts of problemsdownstream ifif they want to do central bank digitalcurrencies or anything else and they'regoing to tracklike well you can't pay for me or we'regoing to tax that or this is you knowyou have to report that in taxes i meani don't know how this will ever happenit wouldlead to a wide revolt and a lot of morepeople would move to costa rica butum i think that it's uhi think it's it's a lot like bitcoin inthe sense that ii do not think that the us governmentwill ever regulate it to that extreme imeanvery fascinatingly and i posted this onmy instagram when uh th jan from harvardum their school of public health postedthat eat lansing thing that they had todisable the commentsbecause so many people and this is juston th chanharvard's like instagram not even likemy instagramum people just went off on them theywere like this is absurd this isridiculousso i think it's happening um and i thinkthat hopefullythis is why i do the work that i do andi think there's a lot of peoplewho who support this work and whounderstand it who are who have a biggerplatform than ium you know joe rogan others whohopefully will continue to like championthisat a broader level and i'll just keepdoing the work that i do and i think ifa critical masspeople start to realize like oh we'rebeing fedslopped or being fed industrialprocessed slobum then they will just they'll speak outand this will never happenum and that's my hope and i think that'sthat's why the work is so critical tojust educate people to the point thatthey'rethey're awake uh and they see that thisis just absoluteum propaganda and it's wrong and to yourpoint about the environmental stuff imean this is perhaps the mostfascinating conversation to me at thispointand um i know uh safety and had uhpatrick moore on the podcast and alexsteini recently had both of them on mypodcast and i've been talking a lotabout this stuff too so i think thesethese environmental conversations are sorelevant and it'sit's fascinating to me that many of thethings i care aboutanimal agriculture humans eating animalscryptocurrencies sovereign individualsare being regulated under the guise ofclimate you know china moving all thebitcoinmining you know it's bad for climateit's like this is crazy likei've realized that in my own work it'sgoing to be important to reallychallenge this climate zeitgeist and umit's it'smore uh it's at least as entrenched asveganism if not moreum so it's going to be a pretty bigjuggernautto attack but i'm going to try did thatanswer your questionyeah i think i'm quite optimistic aboutthe climate thing i'm i'm going toattack it head-on in my next book in thefiat standard i'm just going to reallycome out everybody's uh usuallytrying to basically feeding thefundamentals of the argument which isyou knowno we are destroying the planet buthere's how we can stop destroying it orhere's how myidea is not so terrible so please don'tcancel you knowdon't cancel my food please it's not sobad for destroying the earth but i thinkit's becoming clearer and clearer thatwe're not destroying the earth withcarbon dioxide maybe there is an impacthonestly i'm i'm a little bit skepticalof even people likeuh patrick moore and i challenge them onthis i'm a little bit skeptical that weknowum what the impact of our emissionsreally isi think uh you know it's probably truethatit's almost certainly true that it leadsto more greeningbut the idea that we're changing thetemperature of the earth in my mindseemsquite outlandish because the earth is areally big thing andthe tiny tiny little carbon dioxideparticulates in the atmospheresuch a tiny concentration really doesn'tmake sense i think variations in the sunin in just the stuff that's between usand the sun that's likely to have a muchmoreuh meaningful impact on temperature andi thinkmore and more people are waking up tothe fact that you can't justyou can't just substitute uh emotionalmanipulation for scientific evidencelike you need to presentyou're asking the planet to stop eatingbeef and to stop using the energysources thatallow us to survive winter you're askingus to go livein an absolutely absurd impossiblepre-industrial vegan dystopia whereum we're somehow not going to be usingall the energy sources that we'vediscovered over the last500 years that make our life possibleyou need to present somepretty compelling arguments for that youknow the boy who cries wolfis he's not just saying you know there'sa wolf hide in your home he's sayinglet's burn down the entire townand um stop there being a town here justin caseso that the wolf won't find us like youneed youneed a far more convincing story ifyou're asking people to basicallydestroy500 years of civilization um out of fearand i thinkmore and more people are waking up forit um md schallenbergerand long-time environmental activistswrote a great book apocalypse neveron this and patrick moore as well andalso steve kunin who was obama'sscientific advisorwrote a book called umunsettled on just and he's a primescientist and you know he'swent into the details on this and hesays yeah the idea that you know this issettled science and you can't argue withthis is absurdobviously whenever you hear that youknow that it's that you'reyou're being tricked um yeah so i'mquite optimistic uh about but then againi'm usually optimistic a lot about a lotof things andi can be quite delusional than myoptimism so uhyou take that to take that warning alittle bitall right um stefano uh what doyou have a question yes yes um thank youthis is the first seminar i'm attendingumand it's great to be part of yourmembership network um andthank you dr saladino very interestingmy question is the following umevery other week or very often there isa new study coming outthat criticizes meat and saturated fatum it's it happens periodically everymonth there is a new one and then itgets broadcasted inyou know the health professionalnetworks by mainstream media and so onso what do you think are the main flawsof these studiesa great question they're they're allobservationalthis is a really really important pointto understand that is never discussed bythe media they sort ofthey always subtly insert the wordassociated withor you know is correlated with or maymay cause and there are nointerventional studies being done withmeatthat are published now there are somepeople likestefan van villiers is doing somestudies with fred provenza looking atthe influence of redmeat in the setting of a of a whole fooddiet that is otherwisequote unquote healthy it's a diet thatwill have vegetables and fruit in it buti think that that will be a step in theright direction but the problem is thatall of these studies are justthey're all observational and that theythe general public unfortunately isnever educated tobe you know really vigilant for thatword associatedor coraline because it just meansnothing um it's the western narrativethat's been in play for 70 plus yearsand it's the same thing i mean i was outsurfing in the ocean yesterday with afriend of mine who's from argentinaand he was talking about his friends whowere argentinians here in costa ricaand he said i was talking to them aboutthe work that you do pauland they said oh yeah i mean of coursewe love meatbut we know it's bad for us it's likethey think of meat as smoking they'rejustthere are people who just choose most ofthe people in the world who choose toeat meatare are going to do other things becausethey love meat so much this this likeyou know lizard brain this evolutionarybrain is so powerful for thembut they say all of your research bedamned i'm going to eat meat because ilove itthe problem is that these people arealso the people who aremore likely to do cocaine or drinkalcohol or smoke cigarettes becausethey're like i just want things thatmake me feel goodand of course the fallacy here is thatthere's no this is not mutuallyexclusive umpeople can eat meat and they can seemeat as a health food perhaps thehealth food but yet they're the peoplethat eat meatin the western world are the people whoare having more unhealthy behaviors liketheseargentinians and so when we look atepidemiology it's no surprise thatover and over and over meat looks badand when we look at interventionalstudieswith meat it doesn't look bad at all andthere's only been a few done but it'svery clear that you can addeight ounces of meat to somebody's dietin you know at the exclusion ofgrain-based carbohydrates and all of themetrics get betterso it's just it's this complete fallacyand it's super frustrating and when ihave debates with vegans they'll saythis but you have to look at themajority of the evidence wellnot when the majority of the evidence isgarbage observational studiesum and it's so funny because joelfuhrman who's a prominentuh uh sarcopenic vegan umwas on my podcast and he used the samelanguage that people useuh when they're talking about climateyou know like well well the majority ofscientists all agree you know well 97of scientists agree that climate changeis is real and it's caused by humans andit's like it's the same thing you know97 of scientists in the nutrition worldagree that meat is bad for humans andplants are clearly goodwell who cares right i've got twomillion years of evidence that humanshave been eating meat that made us humanand uh if you look at hunter-gatherertribes uh nobodypeople are happy to look at anthropologyexcuse me they're happy to look atepidemiology but they just want toignore the anthropology how do youexplain the hardshow do you explain who will often meeteight four and a half pounds of meat perdayuh when they have a kill and they don'thave heart disease uh you knowany particular amount so there's justthis discordance and this to me isone of the the greatest hoaxes swindlesthat's been done upon the mainstreamconsciousness inour generations is that nobodyunderstands what observational researchis and how misleadingand why do you think there are so fewinterventional studiesbeing done with respect to me fundingfunding okay yeah who benefitswho benefits um i don't see manyregenerative farmers driving ferrarisyou know the like who funds it does themeat lobby fund it because then theplant-based advocates will say oh it'sfun that mightmeet lobby um but you know ii just think that's i mean in the futurei'm building a non-profitan animal-based research foundationnonprofit and we want to fund more ofthese studies that's the goalbut i know i'll be interesting to talkto stefan van velliet about where hegets his funding frombecause i just think that people don'twant to do this research it's not invogueit's just um and again i'm not i'm not aphd bench researcherthink thanks evans um but i think thatif youif you want to do this type of researchyou're not super popular everybodyeverybody knows that meat is bad for youget in line you know give us anotherstudy that shows that vegetables aregooduh please and and don't you darequestion the mainstream narrative aroundclimate eitherthat'll get you canceled in the academicworld too so i hope it's not overlysimplistic answer but i think it'sprobably the correct one as much as ican tell okaythank you yeah well the uh discussion ofepidemiology studiesleads us very nicely to a question thatpeter hasfor you on uh anothercalamity of the pseudoscience that isepidemiologyand that is the covet hysteria peter goaheadyeah thank you paul um so yeah havingread your book i noticed that youdwelled quite a lot on that distinctionbetween interventional studies andepidemiological studies and you werequite critical of the generalepidemiological method for drawing causeand effect conclusionsand so my question was going to be aboutwhat your views areregarding the very prominent role thatepidemiologicepidemiologists now play in all of ourlivesin determining where we can and can't gowhen we can and can't crosscross borders um how we can behavedo you think that are you worried aboutthe kind of prestige that is being givento this thisdiscipline given the limitations youpoint out in your bookare you concerned about the trends thathave taken place over the past18 or so months well yes definitelythe trick is that it's very difficult tostudythe things that people need to makedecisions about with covid withoutroping an epidemiologist you knowpopulationstudies just that is epidemiology um soit's very difficult to do that i thinkthat if we look at the track record ofpeople over the lastuh 16 to 18 months it's been pretty badum you know a lot of the models we knowall aboutclimate models and how wrong those arewell most of the cobin models werecompletely wrongum and yet nobody apologizes they justwait for people to forget you know theywere predicted foryou know 10 to 100x the amount of deathsthat we've hadnot that any loss of life due to covidis okayor you know should be minimized but youknowthe models that were put in place weregenerally very very wrongand i do think it's a problem i'm notsure how to solve it becauseultimately the population dynamics arean epidemiologic question i just thinkwe have to be very carefulabout what we what we do with that i didsee something that came out the otherday sayingagain it was epidemiology it's a vegansthey're 75 73less likely to have severe cobalt so allyou know all the plant basespublished in the plant-based news and ofcourse it's the same old storyright wellpeople who are vegans or vegetarians aremuch more likely to have healthybehaviorsmuch less likely to smoke drink be obeseand have you know probably a bunch ofprocessed food in their life andjust because meat gets associated withthose things because it's traditionallybeen seen as a rebellious foodthen uh it looks bad for us meat eatersin terms of covered outcomes buti think that uh if they were if theywere more careful and there's plenty ofepidemiology out there that doesthat goes the next step and actuallycontrasts vegetarians with omnivores whodo healthy behaviorsthere's a study called the uk shoppersstudy and a few othersthat show this very clearly that whenyou adjust for omnivores with quotehealthy behaviorsall of the benefits of a vegan orvegetarian diet go awaythey look about the same as an omnivorein terms of everythingexcept their muscle mass which willalways be much lessand their overall health but in terms oftheir life expectancy or their longevityyou know any benefits to a vegan andvegetarian diet go awaywhen you include this normalizer foromnivores who havehealthy behaviors so that's the pointthat's always left out of these studiesbuti guess your question peter it's justtrickyto to sort out like how we how we goabout things without the epidemiologistsi'm not sure i have an answer for thatbut i would just say thatit seems like on a daily basis right nowthatthe um the hysteria and the stupiditycan't get much worse it's just i don'tknow what we're doingright now yeah to your credit paul youwere one of the uhvery few people who made the point thatuh perhaps instead of worrying aboutputting diapers on your face and lockingother people putting diapers on otherpeople's faceand locking them at home perhaps youmight want to consider your ownmetabolic healthand this is just one of these awful hatefactsthat uh nobody wants to think aboutfor which i was reported to the medicalboard in california by a vegan physicianon twitter wowand he then encouraged his followers toalso report me to the medical boardnothing ever came of it and i i sort ofuminvited the medical board to have aconversation with me about nutrition buti thought that was particularly ironicwhen in the beginning of covet i saidyou know maybe it's time to think aboutum just like people live their lives andmaybe we should focus them on some otherthingsi said well you and report this guy tothe medical board so it's pretty funnyyeah well um thank you very much paulfor joining us this hasbeen an absolutely fascinatingconversation umand you know um just so that we're cleari did not endorse the consumption ofuh plants and honey and fruits i willhappily entertain and discuss thosethings but you know umif you have some bananas and thenbad things happen to you don't blame iton me you can blame it on me it's okayyou can blame it on meexcellent all right well thank you verymuch and umi look forward to chatting more and morewith you out either on my podcastor yours yeah i can't wait thanks dave iappreciate itcheers thank you",
