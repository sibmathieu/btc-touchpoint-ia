the first level kardashev placedcivilizations capable of using all theenergy that falls on their planet fromits parent starfor us that means the sunthe earth only receives 20 millionth ofa percent of the energy output by thesun we're only able to harness a verysmall portion of thatwe need to advance ourselves as aspecies to be better at energyproduction and transportationbut why would kardashev have chosen acivilization's ability to harness energyas the primary measurement of itsadvancementbecause energy is the means by whichhumans have transformed the basic stateof things not just an unpleasant statebut a brutally inhospitable one into alivable environment civilizationeffectively you could say firstcommenced at the discovery and masteryof fire once we discovered fire we couldcook

makinglife safer easier and betterevery single increase in energyefficiency brings with it an advancementin human comfort productivity basicallymoves us up the advancement chainthinking about your life today andreally thinking about it obviously foodand water are quite important but justconsider for a second what would happento the world if we were to turn off allthe poweryou could probably put a big bet thatfive to six billion people would be deadwithin a week with the remaining billiondying the week followingthere is nothing more critical tocivilizationthan energy energy is everythingand this is why money our main way ofstoring and transmitting value is soclosely linked to energywe're going to see a bank of stone moneyright thereon the micronesian island of yap in the1700s inhabitants quarried and carvedrye huge stones to use as money they'reall arranged in a row in america thewampum shell belts used as currency bynatives and settlers requiredsignificant expenditure of energy incollecting clams drilling them and thenassembling them into belts and pendantsthe carved stones and shell belts workedas money because they existed asunforgeable proofs of the time andenergy expended in creating them andthey are still remembered in today'slanguage clams for example remainsamerican slang for cash100 million clams100 million dollars tomr darwin newfoundland perhaps clams andstones seem strange things to use asmoney but as the nobel winning economistmilton friedman pointed out the stonesof rye are not so different from howgold works today transferring value fromone government to another without everleaving the vault[Music]four tons of rock produce one ounce ofthe most precious metal in the worldgold it doesn't do anything why is it sovaluable partly because it's rare soit's in limited supply you can't keepmaking it the blood sweat and tearsrequired to produce this ounce of goldis the background to one of the mostexciting stories ever filmed the goldhere is a store of valuebut there is another through linebetween the stones of rye wampum andgold bullion that through line is energygold historically has been the way thatwe transport the fruits of our laboracross space and time so humanity wouldexchange their physical labor the fruitsof their intellectual output the fruitsof their physical output um for forthese shiny rocks effectively for goldthat allowed us to transport value thatwe created acrossvast distances of space and time goldcould do this because of what thecryptographer nick zabo callsunforgeable costliness it takes a hugeamount of energy to get this metal outof the earth just as with wampum and thestones of rye this guarantees scarcityand limited supply inherently what goldis is proof of work we put in a ton ofenergy to find the gold deposits to movetons and tons of rock in order to getgrams of gold and then refine that intocondensed proof that all that work wasdone that's essentially what gold is youcan carry these things around as moneyknowing that the time and energy ittakes to make them ensures a degree ofscarcity which preserves their valueperhaps to foreign settlers the time andenergy expended in creating wampum andindeed it was a major industry for somenative tribes seemed wasteful andridiculous yet it was energy the nativeamericans considered well spent inservice of producing reliable moneymoney which held its value absent inessential authoritycreating money can seem like a waste uhto people who are not familiar with theneeds that money serves but once youhave an established form of money thatactually increases the efficiency ofmost other economic transactions whatyou put in in one area of energy youbasically save often several times overin another part of the economy andthat's often the part that's missed whenoutside observers look at commoditymoney or other types of money and findit to be wasteful or arbitrary thenatives wouldn't waste time making moneyif people didn't need it and if peopleneeded it the effort expended in makingit was not wastednatives drilling seashells or hewingstone or miners laboring at a rock facethe energy expended is simply and purelyproportionate to the value people getfrom using itand little is as useful as money one ofthe key human tools in supportingcivilizational coordinationand organization[Music]in 1971 the us dollar broke its formallink with goldbut it was still to remain inextricablylinked with energy i have directedsecretary connelly to suspendtemporarily the convertibility of thedollar into gold or other reserve assetswe must protect the dollar from theattacks of international moneyspeculators following this announcementthe u.s made a deal with saudi arabiathe global oil market would bedenominated in and conducted withdollars ensuring a constant globaldemand for the currency were two sidesto the system one was simply that thesaudis would agree to price oil sales indollars and later that would lead therest of opec to also price the oil indollarson the american side we agreed toprotect the saudis and sell them aninordinate amount of weapons essentiallyand like preserve their role ingeopolitically in the middle eastdoesn't this mean a change in the worldbalance of power between the developingnations like you the producers and usthe developed industrialized nationsyes it will you have to adjust yourselfto the new circumstances and i think youhave to sit down and talk seriously withusabout this new era that allowed thedollar to retain global relevance and todouble downat a time when it's its future was verymuch in question so this was hugelyhelpful for the elites in the us atleast and that was the petrodollarsystem but this commitment to protectand police the persian gulf created amassive new energy overhead for the usdollarif you look at the petrodollarfundamentally it's really backed by theu.s military and the u.s military burns4.8 billion gallons of fuel a yearto protect the petrodollar sothere is a massive cost there and thereis a massive environmental footprint butyou rarely hear anybody talking aboutthat if at allso a single stealth fighter jet costs 1billion dollars and on an average flighti believe it will burn around 16 000gallons of fuel the united states ownshundreds of these and they flyall the time on practice missions onactual missions an aircraft carrierburns tremendous amounts of energy butif we think about just the vast scale ofthe petro industrial war machine and theamount of human life that has caused theamount of ecological devastation we haveseen as a result of western nationstates bombing the [ __ ] out of thirdworld countries to maintain their accessto cheap oil it just absolutely pales incomparisonand because it ties the interests of theunited states to oil the petrodollarsystem may well have functioned topreserve not only the dollar but alsooil production itself one of the mostpolluting forms of energy would we haveevolved away from the oil industryfaster were its interests not entwinedwith those of the us dollarwe have central bankers going ontelevision saying they are concernedabout the esg footprint of the cryptomining ecosystem when they are flyingaround the world on private jetsand using taxpayer dollars to subsidizea highly developed multi-trillion dollaroil and gas industry in order tomaintain the petrodollar status quothose two things are ideologicallyincompatible[Music]and this brings us to bitcoinbitcoin is one of the only industriesthat is extremely transparent about itsenergy usage which i think makes it aneasy targetwhat this transparency means is thatunlike almost any other industry we havea pretty good idea of the bitcoinnetwork's energy useour best guess is around 100 to 150terawatt hours of electricity per yearand this comes from making an informedguess as to the kinds of machines thatare active on the bitcoin network andtheir energy consumption this is anestimate that is relativelyuncontroversial the cambridge center foralternative finance is generallyconsidered to be the most crediblesource on this and that's the range thatthey're projecting or looking at at thispoint it's still rounding our 0.1of global energy usage and yet bitcoin'svery transparency means this minusculeslice of energy has receiveddisproportionate media attention bitcointakes enormous amounts of energy todigitally mine we have warned at thefinancial times now for many monthsthat cryptocurrency is filthy it costs alot in terms of energy probably a smallcountry is the total usage it isprojected to consume as much energy asall the data centers in the whole worldthis year but judging by president usinga great deal of energy is in itself nota crime the cruise ship industry uses250 terawatt hours a year more thantwice the energy of the bitcoin networkand as far back as 2016 the onlineadvertising industry was already usingaround 106 terawatt hours a huge amountof which was spam and in americans ownhouseholds always on devices use 1375 terawatt hours a year 12.1 timesthat of bitcoin's consumption expendedfor the convenience of having a thingrespond instantly rather than after afew seconds some might say christmaslights are terrible use of energychristmas lights in the united statesalone consume more power than theentirety of the bitcoin network yet wedon't have an energy police that'sbanning the use of christmas lightsbecause people are willing to payto use electricity in that way theimplication is that the value of thebitcoin network must be less than luxurycruises christmas lights or a nation ofalexas listening in for our next commandbut even if bitcoin's social value doesrival that of christmas lights why makeminers burn energy to earn bitcoin whyshould a digital currency have to use upany physical resources at allfor the answer we need to return to theshell belts of the native americansto gold a layer of rich ore whichproduces eight million ounces of gold ayear and to the carved rhinestones ofmicronesiabitcoin is part of a rich history ofcurrencies that have embedded proof ofenergy proof of work done over time as astrategy to secure their valuebitcoin actually approximates what moneyalways was in a better way than justabout any other type of money thathumans have ever found it's essentiallya ledger system combined with thisproof-of-work element wampum could onlybe created by spending time and energyand that effort was proof of the valueit had to its makersin the same way bitcoin is rewarded onlywhen a miner can prove that they havedone a certain amount of workthis requires electricityembedded in each bitcoin like a bar ofgold or a string of shells is proof thatthis work was doneno state or authority has everinstructed or forced anyone to minebitcoin mining is an activity carriedout by individuals in response to theorganic emerging demand for bitcoinevery daytens of thousands of people are choosingand the critical word here is choosingto join the bitcoin network to engage inthe bitcoin economy and i think that'swhere the energy use arguments becomereally serious and difficult to followyou know bitcoin is not a corporationthere's no top level organizationdeciding how much energy the bitcoinnetwork should use instead it's thisquilt of millions of decisions bymillions of actors in the ecosystem andso really it's the miners are followingwhat the market's doing in terms ofmillions of people wanting to usebitcoin for a variety of differentpurposes whether it's storing valuewhether it's making payments and sominers are adapting to that marketdemand constantly there are a group ofpeople around the world who have decidedthat for them bitcoin has value that'ssubjective that's not objective soattempts to qualify or quantifythat feeling people have i think is afool's errand why then criticizebitcoin's energy use and not that ofother currencies perhaps again becausebitcoin has such a transparent anddirect relationship with energygold shells and carved stones eachrequire several stages of human andmechanical processing to render them asmoneybitcoin mining requires electricityprocesses and code and of thoseelectricity is more or less the onlyfactor miners can exploit to increasethe amount of bitcoin they earnthe image of thousands of bitcoin minerswasting energy is far less romantic thanthat of native women preparing shellbelts or miners going west in search offortuneonly gold shineslike thatstuck it cute perhaps it's evenanti-romantic but at root it's the sameproof of work scaling up in real time tomeet the demands of an emergent marketdistributed across the entire world andmade possible by the internet whatessentially bitcoin is is a currency ofenergywork put into the blockchain is thearbiter of truth why is gold worth some20 bucks an ounce i don't know becauseit's scarce a thousand men say gosearching for gold after six months oneof them's lucky one out of the thousandthis fine represents not only his ownlabor but that of 999 others to bootthat's uh 6 000 months or 500 yearsscrabbling over mountains going hungryand thirstynow it's a gold mister is worth what itis because the human labor that wentinto defining the getting of itnever thought of it just like that wellthere's no other explanation mistergolden stuff ain't good for nothingexcept making jewelry with gold teethso what is the consequence of a currencywhose production and value is so closelytied to energylet's recapbitcoin miners need to find low-costenergy to get an edge and despite statecoal subsidies in some countries thisnow mostly means efficient clean energywind solar and especially hydro but alsoflared natural gas even geothermalbecause of the way incentives work withminers they have a direct incentive tofind the cheapest energy available andin a lot of cases the cheapest energy isrenewableswe've been seeing miners the last decadeincreasingly shipped towards cheapersources of energy which have beenrenewablethe industry is not specificallyregulated to emit a certain amount ofgreenhouse gas emissions per bitcoinminedthey've been shifting towards renewablesbecause it makes economic sensemore than two-thirds of the energyproduced in the world is waste energybecause it's produced during the hoursof the day when there's not demand toconsume it and it's also produced in aplace where there's not transmission tomove it across space and time and sothat energy goes unused and wastedit is a misnomer that bitcoin is usingall the energy of a country likeswitzerland for example that may betechnically true but that's not the realstory you have to peel one layer of theonion back and realize that a lot of theenergy that the bitcoin network isconsuming is waste energy that otherwisewas not available to be consumed this iswhy the bitcoin industry was so excitedwhen the president of el salvadorannounced the availability ofunexploited thermal energy from one ofthe country's dormant volcanoes here wasa cheap stranded input which couldprovide an edge in the race to mint newbitcoin el salvador's latent naturalenergy may soon create a significantpercentage of the next decades supply ofnew bitcoin and salvadorians themselvesstand to benefit specifically wherethese volcanoes happen to be and wherethese hydro plants happen to be andwhere these wind and solar farms happento be in various countries often they'refar away from population centers so whatthis will allow is electrification ofnew areas and creating new economicactivity so for el salvador you'relooking at these communities in themountains or by the rivers that can geta jump start with economic activity andonce there's like bitcoin mining there'sother stuff oh those people need foodthere might be some housing newcommunities so just like mankinddeveloped along rivers in our historymaybe we'll start to develop moreactivity around bitcoin mining once anindustry begins to grow there's a wholeecosystem that builds around it it's notjust the miners it's the skilled workersworking around energy systemselectricians it's the businessessupporting it whether that's on themanufacturing side or on the skills sidefor the congo only nine percent of thepopulation out of like 90 million peoplehave access to the grid and that causesan enormous amount of deforestationbecause they get their energy basicallyfrom biofuels by cutting down trees andproducing charcoal creates also a lot ofindoor air pollution which kills a lotof children and it's just a disaster allaroundso if all of a sudden you had 90 percentusing hydro electricity instead ofbiofuels man that would be a massivedifference maker both for theenvironment both for people both foreverybody and bitcoin can help us gettherebecause bitcoin miners are always on thehunt for clean efficient energyrenewables already account for 39 of thebitcoin network's energy use a numberthat's increasing all the time against ageneral energy mix of just 11 renewablethe cleanest types of energy are alsothe lowest cost types of energy becauseit's the most efficient types of energyif bitcoin is able tomake those types of energy even morecost effective it should actually helpto promote renewable energy developmentwhether it's clean types of nuclearenergy appropriately place solar energywhether it's hydroelectric energy bymaking all those types of energy sourcesmore efficient it can actually stronglyincentivize the growth of renewableenergyin a way that some of our prior attemptsor top-down attempts haven't been ableto do very effectively cheap power ischeap because it is efficient it isefficient because there is less waste inturning it into a useful form and lesswaste means less carbon less pollutionless negative externalities capturetoday the ocean caught fire in the gulfof mexico just west of the yucatanpeninsula as we have seen bitcoin likeshells and gold uses energy as a meansto establish value but unlike thoseother monies bitcoin's demand for themost efficient power pushes miners toinnovate obtaining power which is eitherwasted like trapped methane strandedlike remote volcanoes or simplyefficient and therefore clean incontrast with gold the search for whichleads to more dirty wasteful mines thesearch for bitcoin appears to lead togreener and more efficient energyproduction i think volcano mining isvery interesting because you have thisenergy source and it may not make senseto tap it for some use cases but bitcoinminers are very mobile we can move towhere the power is you can set up yourmining facility very close to the sourceof power generation so it could be onthe volcano that's something that isunique to bitcoin mining you knownormally when you generate power youneed to move it somewhere else you needto move it to the city or to industrialfacilities or somewhere but for miningwe are able to go where that power isit's a very interesting use case to tapinto their natural energy sources andleverage it for bitcoin miningconsider that since 1992 the year of therio climate summit top-down attempts totransition the world to cleaner energyhave fallen astonishingly short of theirtargets as co2 levels have continued torise these figures show how the carboncredit system these meetings implementedhas proved substantially ineffectiveeach year companies are allocated acarbon allowance which can then bebought and sold via a market if acompany goes over its allowance it canjust buy a bigger allocation permittingit to continue business as usual bycontrast bitcoin has created a marketincentive to do exactly what is nowalmost certainly necessary find andrelease the vast amounts of cleanefficient energy we need to bring abetter life to more people whilemaintaining a habitable planetand bitcoin does this not because itseeks virtue or because it wants accessto subsidies but because the search forcheap power is the search for cleanpowerbut it goes further as in the case of elsalvador's volcano power the guaranteedincome from bitcoin mining makespossible the huge capital expenditurerequired to set up new sustainable powerplants it's de-risking construction ofrenewable energy facilities it'sde-risking it because it is willing tobuy 24 7 365 and when you have apredictable buyer predictable revenuestream it's easy to plan out youroperations and that certainty means thatthat site gets built one thing that youfind especially in emerging markets butalso with new types of energy anddeveloped marketsis that they're building up this proofof concept they don't necessarily havethe electricity infrastructure thedistribution infrastructure to get thatenergy to where it needs to be you knowit's a long distance from populationcenters and so you have kind of achicken in the egg problem where youcan't really build that electricityproduction until you have distributioninfrastructure which is very expensivewe also can't build that infrastructureuntil you are sure that you have somesort of demand in place to make thatwhole project profitable and so what wesee with bitcoin miners is that they canhelp bootstrap new types of energy orestablish types of energy in newlocations especially developinglocations something similar is happeningin wyoming texas and alberta where oilrigs flare off huge quantities of wastemethane bitcoin miners are moving in tocapture this methane with portablemining equipment imagine if you wheel itinto a oil field that's just flaring thenatural gas because they're notcollecting it they're just flaring itinto the atmosphereyou can't live in the smellwell just like an airplane passingthrough and the energy that's generatedis used to mine bitcoin i'm noticingthat the oil wells that used to haveorange flares at night you'd be drivingand you'd see them in the distance andthat was flaring the natural gas themethane that's coming out from the oilproduction process both at plants andalso at the wells themselves and now youstart to see that they're gone and thereason is in most cases that bitcoinminers have cut deals with whoever ownsthe oil well to capture the flaredenergy to turn the turbine to create thepower to run the bitcoin minerand you see these little huts that havepopped up next to the oil wells andthat's where there's a bitcoin minerinside most folks probably don't evenrealize that when they look at themnot only are we taking that natural gasand using it as electricitywe can capture the carbon okay you'renot venting the carbon dioxide andcreating acid rain and co2 we capture itwe put it underground like there's justso many environmental benefits so inthat case yeah we are cleaning theenvironment all energy that's strandedand wasted now potentially has a homeand now it can potentially get rescuedand so portable bitcoin mines right aportable building that can house bitcoinasics and be modular you can move itaround relatively easy and you canset it up and and connect it into anyprimary energy source whether it'shydroelectric or solar or wind ornatural gas and be able to effectivelycreate a market for that energy rightthere on the spot anywhere in the worldwith an internet connection that'sreally bitcoin's killer app flaredmethane alone could power the bitcoinnetwork many times over and by doing sobitcoin would become not just carbonneutral but carbon negative look it's amassive environmental benefit this is abenefit to air quality all around theworld and it's a serious problem sobitcoin should be celebrated considerthis questionhow many other stranded or wastedresources does bitcoin make it possibleto tapcould bitcoin be the engine that willrelease an exponential wave of cleanpower generationthe wave we need to advance ourcivilization what will be the marginalconsumer of energy to get to thoseprojects that become economically viablei think it'll be bitcoin so good goodgoodand this is why we can truly callbitcoin a greening machine a system withthe potential to explode the growth ofrenewable energyas we have seen the energy expended increating bitcoin is one of the key waysit establishes its valuebut that same energy the work in proofof work also secures the bitcoin networkhelping to create a true money of thepublic outside the control of any oneintermediaryno government or billionaire or

deeply remember what it'slike the labor department reportedthursday that consumer prices jumped tofive percent over the past year that'sthe highest inflation rate in the ussince 2008. you write in a new piece forcnn that inflation has actuallysurpassed wages and unemployment as thepublic's top concern about the economyand that the white housecan't actually do much about it sowhat's the planif you look at our fiscal and monetarysituation here we're talking 25 pluspercent year-over-year growth in themoney supply this looks like wartimefinance this was the similar framingthat we had after and during world warii after which we had a period ofmonetary repression in america we'veexperienced inflation for the past dozenyears inflation caused by governmentdebt and easy credit policies which cutthe value of our dollar nearly in halfpeople don't remember what it's like tohave inflationbut that kind of looks like what we'reheaded towards wealthy venezuelanfamilies saw their fortunes

revolution it's ahell of a mouthful to say when you're ontop of that wave and you're surfingyou've got to ride it to the end thatled to the housing bubble and a lot ofit is the responses of central

financial marketsthere are some concerns about thestability of traditional systems becausewe've lived it and what i like aboutbitcoin is the systemic stability it'salmost at a six sigma quality controllevel in terms of network uptime bitcoinas a piece of software is unbelievablystable while we look at the traditionalfinancial system where fiat currenciesmay for now appear more stable theincreaseswill happen then bitcoin we're notsaying they will reverse that's not whattransitory means but the underlyingsystems may not be as stable as bitcoinso there will beinflation but the process of inflationuh will stop that's what i think a lotof folks are sensing and that it is ahedge against systemic instabilitybitcoin crucially is premised not ontrust in legacy institutions but on

bitcoin is 100powered by renewables and wastethis conversationreally the fundamentals of itis people that think bitcoin is usefulversus people who think bitcoin is notuseful if you think it's useful andappreciate its use cases you quicklyrealize that its energy consumption isnothing and on the contrary i worryabout the energy consumption being toolowi want to go to sleep knowing thatsomebody has to overtake the argentiniangrid to manipulate my money i probablywon't be happy until bitcoin uses asmuch energy as america we're still afair ways away from that but that's wheni'll be truly happy

familiar with theneeds that money serves but once youhave an established form of money thatactually increases the efficiency ofmost other economic transactions whatyou put in in one area of energy youbasically save often several times overin another part of the economy andthat's often the part that's missed whenoutside observers look at commoditymoney or other types of money and findit to be wasteful or arbitrary thenatives wouldn't waste time making moneyif people didn't need it and if peopleneeded it the effort expended in makingit was not wastednatives drilling seashells or hewingstone or miners laboring at a rock facethe energy expended is simply and purelyproportionate to the value people getfrom using itand little is as useful as money one ofthe key human tools in supportingcivilizational coordinationand organization[Music]in 1971 the us dollar broke its formallink with goldbut it was still to remain inextricablylinked with energy i have directedsecretary connelly to suspendtemporarily the convertibility of thedollar into gold or other reserve assetswe must protect the dollar from theattacks of international moneyspeculators following this announcementthe u.s made a deal with saudi arabiathe global oil market would bedenominated in and conducted withdollars ensuring a constant globaldemand for the currency were two sidesto the system one was simply that thesaudis would agree to price oil sales indollars and later that would lead therest of opec to also price the oil indollarson the american side we agreed toprotect the saudis and sell them aninordinate amount of weapons essentiallyand like preserve their role ingeopolitically in the middle eastdoesn't this mean a change in the worldbalance of power between the developingnations like you the producers and usthe developed industrialized nationsyes it will you have to adjust yourselfto the new circumstances and i think youhave to sit down and talk seriously withusabout this new era that allowed thedollar to retain global relevance and todouble downat a time when it's its future was verymuch in question so this was hugelyhelpful for the elites in the us atleast and that was the petrodollarsystem but this commitment to protectand police the persian gulf created amassive new energy overhead for the usdollarif you look at the petrodollarfundamentally it's really backed by theu.s military and the u.s military burns4.8 billion gallons of fuel a yearto protect the petrodollar sothere is a massive cost there and thereis a massive environmental footprint butyou rarely hear anybody talking aboutthat if at allso a single stealth fighter jet costs 1billion dollars and on an average flighti believe it will burn around 16 000gallons of fuel the united states ownshundreds of these and they flyall the time on practice missions onactual missions an aircraft carrierburns tremendous amounts of energy butif we think about just the vast scale ofthe petro industrial war machine and theamount of human life that has caused theamount of ecological devastation we haveseen as a result of western nationstates bombing the [ __ ] out of thirdworld countries to maintain their accessto cheap oil it just absolutely pales incomparisonand because it ties the interests of theunited states to oil the petrodollarsystem may well have functioned topreserve not only the dollar but alsooil production itself one of the mostpolluting forms of energy would we haveevolved away from the oil industryfaster were its interests not entwinedwith those of the us dollarwe have central bankers going ontelevision saying they are concernedabout the esg footprint of the cryptomining ecosystem when they are flyingaround the world on private jetsand using taxpayer dollars to subsidizea highly developed multi-trillion dollaroil and gas industry in order tomaintain the petrodollar status quothose two things are ideologicallyincompatible[Music]and this brings us to bitcoinbitcoin is one of the only industriesthat is extremely transparent about itsenergy usage which i think makes it aneasy targetwhat this transparency means is thatunlike almost any other industry we havea pretty good idea of the bitcoinnetwork's energy useour best guess is around 100 to 150terawatt hours of electricity per yearand this comes from making an informedguess as to the kinds of machines thatare active on the bitcoin network andtheir energy consumption this is anestimate that is relativelyuncontroversial the cambridge center foralternative finance is generallyconsidered to be the most crediblesource on this and that's the range thatthey're projecting or looking at at thispoint it's still rounding our 0.1of global energy usage and yet bitcoin'svery transparency means this minusculeslice of energy has receiveddisproportionate media attention bitcointakes enormous amounts of energy todigitally mine we have warned at thefinancial times now for many monthsthat cryptocurrency is filthy it costs alot in terms of energy probably a smallcountry is the total usage it isprojected to consume as much energy asall the data centers in the whole worldthis year but judging by president usinga great deal of energy is in itself nota crime the cruise ship industry uses250 terawatt hours a year more thantwice the energy of the bitcoin networkand as far back as 2016 the onlineadvertising industry was already usingaround 106 terawatt hours a huge amountof which was spam and in americans ownhouseholds always on devices use 1375 terawatt hours a year 12.1 timesthat of bitcoin's consumption expendedfor the convenience of having a thingrespond instantly rather than after afew seconds some might say christmaslights are terrible use of energychristmas lights in the united statesalone consume more power than theentirety of the bitcoin network yet wedon't have an energy police that'sbanning the use of christmas lightsbecause people are willing to payto use electricity in that way theimplication is that the value of thebitcoin network must be less than luxurycruises christmas lights or a nation ofalexas listening in for our next commandbut even if bitcoin's social value doesrival that of christmas lights why makeminers burn energy to earn bitcoin whyshould a digital currency have to use upany physical resources at allfor the answer we need to return to theshell belts of the native americansto gold a layer of rich ore whichproduces eight million ounces of gold ayear and to the carved rhinestones ofmicronesiabitcoin is part of a rich history ofcurrencies that have embedded proof ofenergy proof of work done over time as astrategy to secure their valuebitcoin actually approximates what moneyalways was in a better way than justabout any other type of money thathumans have ever found it's essentiallya ledger system combined with thisproof-of-work element wampum could onlybe created by spending time and energyand that effort was proof of the valueit had to its makersin the same way bitcoin is rewarded onlywhen a miner can prove that they havedone a certain amount of workthis requires electricityembedded in each bitcoin like a bar ofgold or a string of shells is proof thatthis work was doneno state or authority has everinstructed or forced anyone to minebitcoin mining is an activity carriedout by individuals in response to theorganic emerging demand for bitcoinevery daytens of thousands of people are choosingand the critical word here is choosingto join the bitcoin network to engage inthe bitcoin economy and i think that'swhere the energy use arguments becomereally serious and difficult to followyou know bitcoin is not a corporationthere's no top level organizationdeciding how much energy the bitcoinnetwork should use instead it's thisquilt of millions of decisions bymillions of actors in the ecosystem andso really it's the miners are followingwhat the market's doing in terms ofmillions of people wanting to usebitcoin for a variety of differentpurposes whether it's storing valuewhether it's making payments and sominers are adapting to that marketdemand constantly there are a group ofpeople around the world who have decidedthat for them bitcoin has value that'ssubjective that's not objective soattempts to qualify or quantifythat feeling people have i think is afool's errand why then criticizebitcoin's energy use and not that ofother currencies perhaps again becausebitcoin has such a transparent anddirect relationship with energygold shells and carved stones eachrequire several stages of human andmechanical processing to render them asmoneybitcoin mining requires electricityprocesses and code and of thoseelectricity is more or less the onlyfactor miners can exploit to increasethe amount of bitcoin they earnthe image of thousands of bitcoin minerswasting energy is far less romantic thanthat of native women preparing shellbelts or miners going west in search offortuneonly gold shineslike thatstuck it cute perhaps it's evenanti-romantic but at root it's the sameproof of work scaling up in real time tomeet the demands of an emergent marketdistributed across the entire world andmade possible by the internet whatessentially bitcoin is is a currency ofenergywork put into the blockchain is thearbiter of truth why is gold worth some20 bucks an ounce i don't know becauseit's scarce a thousand men say gosearching for gold after six months oneof them's lucky one out of the thousandthis fine represents not only his ownlabor but that of 999 others to bootthat's uh 6 000 months or 500 yearsscrabbling over mountains going hungryand thirstynow it's a gold mister is worth what itis because the human labor that wentinto defining the getting of itnever thought of it just like that wellthere's no other explanation mistergolden stuff ain't good for nothingexcept making jewelry with gold teethso what is the consequence of a currencywhose production and value is so closelytied to energylet's recapbitcoin miners need to find low-costenergy to get an edge and despite statecoal subsidies in some countries thisnow mostly means efficient clean energywind solar and especially hydro but alsoflared natural gas even geothermalbecause of the way incentives work withminers they have a direct incentive tofind the cheapest energy available andin a lot of cases the cheapest energy isrenewableswe've been seeing miners the last decadeincreasingly shipped towards cheapersources of energy which have beenrenewablethe industry is not specificallyregulated to emit a certain amount ofgreenhouse gas emissions per bitcoinminedthey've been shifting towards renewablesbecause it makes economic sensemore than two-thirds of the energyproduced in the world is waste energybecause it's produced during the hoursof the day when there's not demand toconsume it and it's also produced in aplace where there's not transmission tomove it across space and time and sothat energy goes unused and wastedit is a misnomer that bitcoin is usingall the energy of a country likeswitzerland for example that may betechnically true but that's not the realstory you have to peel one layer of theonion back and realize that a lot of theenergy that the bitcoin network isconsuming is waste energy that otherwisewas not available to be consumed this iswhy the bitcoin industry was so excitedwhen the president of el salvadorannounced the availability ofunexploited thermal energy from one ofthe country's dormant volcanoes here wasa cheap stranded input which couldprovide an edge in the race to mint newbitcoin el salvador's latent naturalenergy may soon create a significantpercentage of the next decades supply ofnew bitcoin and salvadorians themselvesstand to benefit specifically wherethese volcanoes happen to be and wherethese hydro plants happen to be andwhere these wind and solar farms happento be in various countries often they'refar away from population centers so whatthis will allow is electrification ofnew areas and creating new economicactivity so for el salvador you'relooking at these communities in themountains or by the rivers that can geta jump start with economic activity andonce there's like bitcoin mining there'sother stuff oh those people need foodthere might be some housing newcommunities so just like mankinddeveloped along rivers in our historymaybe we'll start to develop moreactivity around bitcoin mining once anindustry begins to grow there's a wholeecosystem that builds around it it's notjust the miners it's the skilled workersworking around energy systemselectricians it's the businessessupporting it whether that's on themanufacturing side or on the skills sidefor the congo only nine percent of thepopulation out of like 90 million peoplehave access to the grid and that causesan enormous amount of deforestationbecause they get their energy basicallyfrom biofuels by cutting down trees andproducing charcoal creates also a lot ofindoor air pollution which kills a lotof children and it's just a disaster allaroundso if all of a sudden you had 90 percentusing hydro electricity instead ofbiofuels man that would be a massivedifference maker both for theenvironment both for people both foreverybody and bitcoin can help us gettherebecause bitcoin miners are always on thehunt for clean efficient energyrenewables already account for 39 of thebitcoin network's energy use a numberthat's increasing all the time against ageneral energy mix of just 11 renewablethe cleanest types of energy are alsothe lowest cost types of energy becauseit's the most efficient types of energyif bitcoin is able tomake those types of energy even morecost effective it should actually helpto promote renewable energy developmentwhether it's clean types of nuclearenergy appropriately place solar energywhether it's hydroelectric energy bymaking all those types of energy sourcesmore efficient it can actually stronglyincentivize the growth of renewableenergyin a way that some of our prior attemptsor top-down attempts haven't been ableto do very effectively cheap power ischeap because it is efficient it isefficient because there is less waste inturning it into a useful form and lesswaste means less carbon less pollutionless negative externalities capturetoday the ocean caught fire in the gulfof mexico just west of the yucatanpeninsula as we have seen bitcoin likeshells and gold uses energy as a meansto establish value but unlike thoseother monies bitcoin's demand for themost efficient power pushes miners toinnovate obtaining power which is eitherwasted like trapped methane strandedlike remote volcanoes or simplyefficient and therefore clean incontrast with gold the search for whichleads to more dirty wasteful mines thesearch for bitcoin appears to lead togreener and more efficient energyproduction i think volcano mining isvery interesting because you have thisenergy source and it may not make senseto tap it for some use cases but bitcoinminers are very mobile we can move towhere the power is you can set up yourmining facility very close to the sourceof power generation so it could be onthe volcano that's something that isunique to bitcoin mining you knownormally when you generate power youneed to move it somewhere else you needto move it to the city or to industrialfacilities or somewhere but for miningwe are able to go where that power isit's a very interesting use case to tapinto their natural energy sources andleverage it for bitcoin miningconsider that since 1992 the year of therio climate summit top-down attempts totransition the world to cleaner energyhave fallen astonishingly short of theirtargets as co2 levels have continued torise these figures show how the carboncredit system these meetings implementedhas proved substantially ineffectiveeach year companies are allocated acarbon allowance which can then bebought and sold via a market if acompany goes over its allowance it canjust buy a bigger allocation permittingit to continue business as usual bycontrast bitcoin has created a marketincentive to do exactly what is nowalmost certainly necessary find andrelease the vast amounts of cleanefficient energy we need to bring abetter life to more people whilemaintaining a habitable planetand bitcoin does this not because itseeks virtue or because it wants accessto subsidies but because the search forcheap power is the search for cleanpowerbut it goes further as in the case of elsalvador's volcano power the guaranteedincome from bitcoin mining makespossible the huge capital expenditurerequired to set up new sustainable powerplants it's de-risking construction ofrenewable energy facilities it'sde-risking it because it is willing tobuy 24 7 365 and when you have apredictable buyer predictable revenuestream it's easy to plan out youroperations and that certainty means thatthat site gets built one thing that youfind especially in emerging markets butalso with new types of energy anddeveloped marketsis that they're building up this proofof concept they don't necessarily havethe electricity infrastructure thedistribution infrastructure to get thatenergy to where it needs to be you knowit's a long distance from populationcenters and so you have kind of achicken in the egg problem where youcan't really build that electricityproduction until you have distributioninfrastructure which is very expensivewe also can't build that infrastructureuntil you are sure that you have somesort of demand in place to make thatwhole project profitable and so what wesee with bitcoin miners is that they canhelp bootstrap new types of energy orestablish types of energy in newlocations especially developinglocations something similar is happeningin wyoming texas and alberta where oilrigs flare off huge quantities of wastemethane bitcoin miners are moving in tocapture this methane with portablemining equipment imagine if you wheel itinto a oil field that's just flaring thenatural gas because they're notcollecting it they're just flaring itinto the atmosphereyou can't live in the smellwell just like an airplane passingthrough and the energy that's generatedis used to mine bitcoin i'm noticingthat the oil wells that used to haveorange flares at night you'd be drivingand you'd see them in the distance andthat was flaring the natural gas themethane that's coming out from the oilproduction process both at plants andalso at the wells themselves and now youstart to see that they're gone and thereason is in most cases that bitcoinminers have cut deals with whoever ownsthe oil well to capture the flaredenergy to turn the turbine to create thepower to run the bitcoin minerand you see these little huts that havepopped up next to the oil wells andthat's where there's a bitcoin minerinside most folks probably don't evenrealize that when they look at themnot only are we taking that natural gasand using it as electricitywe can capture the carbon okay you'renot venting the carbon dioxide andcreating acid rain and co2 we capture itwe put it underground like there's justso many environmental benefits so inthat case yeah we are cleaning theenvironment all energy that's strandedand wasted now potentially has a homeand now it can potentially get rescuedand so portable bitcoin mines right aportable building that can house bitcoinasics and be modular you can move itaround relatively easy and you canset it up and and connect it into anyprimary energy source whether it'shydroelectric or solar or wind ornatural gas and be able to effectivelycreate a market for that energy rightthere on the spot anywhere in the worldwith an internet connection that'sreally bitcoin's killer app flaredmethane alone could power the bitcoinnetwork many times over and by doing sobitcoin would become not just carbonneutral but carbon negative look it's amassive environmental benefit this is abenefit to air quality all around theworld and it's a serious problem sobitcoin should be celebrated considerthis questionhow many other stranded or wastedresources does bitcoin make it possibleto tapcould bitcoin be the engine that willrelease an exponential wave of cleanpower generationthe wave we need to advance ourcivilization what will be the marginalconsumer of energy to get to thoseprojects that become economically viablei think it'll be bitcoin so good goodgoodand this is why we can truly callbitcoin a greening machine a system withthe potential to explode the growth ofrenewable energyas we have seen the energy expended increating bitcoin is one of the key waysit establishes its valuebut that same energy the work in proofof work also secures the bitcoin networkhelping to create a true money

expectto keep our trustin the grocery store at the gas pump onthe car lot prices keep rising in theu.s there is virtually nocollective memory of times of highinflation because the last time we sawthis in america was in the 70s and sothere's not that many people alive todaythat really deeply remember what it'slike the labor department reportedthursday that consumer prices jumped tofive percent over the past year that'sthe highest inflation rate in the ussince 2008. you write in a new piece forcnn that inflation has actuallysurpassed wages and unemployment as thepublic's top concern about the economyand that the white housecan't actually do much about it sowhat's the planif you look at our fiscal and monetarysituation here we're talking 25 pluspercent year-over-year growth in themoney supply this looks like wartimefinance this was the similar framingthat we had after and during world warii after which we had a period ofmonetary repression in america we'veexperienced inflation for the past dozenyears inflation caused by governmentdebt and easy credit policies which cutthe value of our dollar nearly in halfpeople don't remember what it's like tohave inflationbut that kind of looks like what we'reheaded towards wealthy venezuelanfamilies saw their fortunes disappearand the poor were pushed even furtherinto desperationa tragedy is unfolding in lebanoninflation has driven

there's no electricityin our homes children need milk no onecan afford to buy it that's why we'rehere we often look at things from aprivileged perspective but a lot ofpeople in a lot of different

suffering double ortriple digit inflation we're talkingbillions of people here we've seen hugecorrections in traditional financialsystems dating back 50 years it seemslike we're on a cadence whereevery certain number of years sometimesit's five years sometimes it's ten yearsthere's an enormous crash it started instocks in the early 70s and it wascommodities with oil then it wasinterest rates and then going to the1987 stock market crash the law ofgravity hit wall street today and asstock prices plunged even more than theydid on black tuesday of 1929 and we sawit in real estate it's just kind ofwhack-a-mole what you seem to be sayingis that there is a very predictable timebomb effect here exactly the 90s a bondmarket correction then we had the therussian defaultand then we had the internet bubble thismoney machine the internet theinformation technology revolution it's ahell of a mouthful to say when you're ontop of that wave and you're surfingyou've got to ride it to the end thatled to the housing bubble and a lot ofit is the responses of central banks tothe previous crashes where they'll justtry to smooth things over by expandingtheir balance sheets and pushing creditinto the economy the federal reserve hasmoved quicklyto uhbring order to the financial marketsthere are some concerns about thestability of traditional systems becausewe've lived it and what i like aboutbitcoin is the systemic stability it'salmost at a six sigma quality controllevel in terms of network uptime bitcoinas a piece of software is unbelievablystable while we look at the traditionalfinancial system where fiat currenciesmay for now appear more stable theincreaseswill happen then bitcoin we're notsaying they will reverse that's not whattransitory means but the underlyingsystems may not be as stable as bitcoinso there will beinflation but the process of inflationuh will stop that's what i think a lotof folks are sensing and that it is ahedge against systemic instabilitybitcoin crucially is premised not ontrust in legacy institutions but on mathand energy it has the potential torender obsolete what may be the leastenvironmentally friendly institution ofall time the petro dollarbitcoin requires no warplanes to sustainit no middle east peace wars no dronefleets no multi-billion dollar armamentdeals like the internet itself it justworks a green machine and a peer-to-peerprotocol for money in the network agethe f-35will only ever run on jet fuelit's never going to be clean everwhereas bitcoin plugs into the wall andwhatever's on the other side of thatplug is what bitcoin is and it won't belong not more than a decade maxwhere bitcoin is 100powered by renewables and wastethis conversationreally the fundamentals of itis people that think bitcoin is usefulversus people who think bitcoin is notuseful if you think it's useful andappreciate its use cases you quicklyrealize that its energy consumption isnothing and on the contrary i worryabout the energy consumption being toolowi want to go to sleep knowing thatsomebody has to overtake the argentiniangrid to manipulate my money i probablywon't be happy until bitcoin uses asmuch energy as america we're still afair ways away from that but that's wheni'll be truly happy knowing that bitcoinlike no one can touch it[Music]do[Music][Music][Music]you",
