why you want oneof these this is a seed plateto back up the uh your backup of anybitcoin wallet that you mayhave in steel so be sure to check thatout anyways let's dive into the tutorialso i have breeze wallet here obviouslyi've already been using it a little bitbut you can pretty much boot this thingupand start using it right away with nosetupnecessary so let's take a look at what'son the screen hereright up top we have our balance here itis denominatedcurrently in satoshi's which is thesmallest unit of a bitcoin there are 100million satoshi'sin one bitcoin but if we tap it willactually changeinto the bitcoin denomination so we cansee it becomes a decimali prefer to watch in satoshi's buteverybody's got their own preferencedown below we have the dollar equivalentof whatthis number of satoshis is worth and youcan actually tapand toggle through various differentlocal currencies i think they have fourheredown below you can see any incoming andoutgoing transactions that i've donedown at the bottom we've got our sendand receive buttons as well asthis little button in the middle thatallows you to scan a qr code in front ofyouand in the top left there is a littlesandwich barthat allows you to open a menu that alsogives your send and receive optionsthere's a marketplace there's a point ofsale terminal which we'll dive into alittle bit and there's your advancedsettingsas well as your uh your profile whichyou can set up you canimport a picture and name your walletwhatever you want okayand then they also have light and darkmodes so if yours looks a little bitdifferent it's probablyin regular light mode i prefer dark modemyselfokay so let's right away dive intoreceiving a transaction because that'sprobably one of the main things you wantto do if you hit receive down in thebottom rightyou can receive via an invoice and thatwould be a lightning transactionor you can receive to a regular bitcoinaddressokay so first we're going to receive avia a lightning invoice okaylightning is different from regularbitcoin transactions because you have toconstructan actual invoice to receive somethingso if i hit receiveand i type in an amount of satoshismaybe i want to receivelet's put something small 500 satoshi'swhich isit's negligible it's very very small i'mgoing to hit createthat gives me a qr code that somebodycould scan with their phoneor i can hit in the top right there's alittle copy buttonand that copies an invoice now for asecond i'm going toget out of breeze and i have anotherwallet here this is blue wallet i'vedone atutorial on it but it's just anotherbitcoin wallet you can use it will autodetectmy invoice but just for the sake of ifyou have a differentlightning wallet we will we willpretend that it didn't detect thatanyways if you're in another lightningwalletand you want to send you would hit asend button wherever that may be in theapp that you're usingand then i can actually paste in theinvoice that it copied and it sees rightaway oh this person would like 500satoshis from mei hit the pay button and that will besent off to my lightning wallet it saysit's done thereso let's head back over to breezeand boom we can see payment approvedi've just receiveda payment of 500 satoshis i clickoutside that andthere it's coming in right away perfectnow what about receiving a regularbitcoin transaction so if we hit receivereceive via bitcoin addressif i hit that it's going to be a littlebit different it's not an invoicingsystemit's just a straight up address whereanybody can send money to it so somebodyagain could scan this withtheir phone or you can hit the copybutton that copies your addresslet's head back over to blue walletand again we're going to pretend that itdidn't see that let's go back to myregular bitcoin wallet herewe're going to hit send andi'm going to paste in that address thatwe copiedokay and then i'm going to send a dollaramount soyou can send dollars or bitcoindepending onthe denomination that you want to do itin or satoshi'sbut i'm going to do a dollar amount justfor something different to look atokay um maybe i'll maybe i'll send overa little bit more maybe i'll send overlet's say uh 25okay so i'm going to hit nextand actually i'm gonna maybe change outmy fee hereum so bitcoin network you can dictateyour feesum and i'm not in a huge rush and itlooks like it would cost me five bucksto send if i want it right away becausethe network happens to be busy right nowso i'm going to set a medium fee insteadi'm paying 31 cents takesyou know much less and then with the waythat this works it'll actually berelatively instant so i'm going to hitnext i'm going to hitsend now and so this sends off mybitcoin transactionand hit done and nowi can see you can see the notificationpopped up right away uhso it says breeze is processing yourprevious deposit you will be able tospendor to add more funds once this operationis completed and i can see that there'sincoming transactions so what willhappen isas soon as that uh bitcoin transactionthat i sent actually confirms on thebitcoin networkwhich can take 10 minutes can takelonger depending and it seems likeuh the network is a little bit busier atthe moment as soon as that's confirmedthose funds will be sat in here and iwill be able tospend them but until that happensthey will be effectively waiting in thewingsto be able to spendnow on the topic of spending and we'llcome back to that transaction when itconfirms in a moment butum on the topic of sending so when youhit thesend button you have a few options againyou canpaste an invoice or a node id and thismeans if somebody has created alightning invoicefor you like we did in the first exampleor a node id in some instances you canactually send to a lightningwallet without them having to create aninvoicenow this is kind of stilllightning is still very early and thesethings are being fleshed out not allwallets will haveavailability for this so we're justgoing to deal with invoices todayyou have an option of connecting to paywhich there areyou can connect to somebody via manydifferent waysand then you have again sending to aregular bitcoin address so let'sfirst do a regular lightning transactionso let's go back toblue wallet we'll go to our lightningwalletand i'm going to hit receive there andwe're going to create aninvoice for a thousand satoshisso i'm going to create that invoiceagain and within uh the blue wallet itwill create a qrthat come somebody could scan or i cancopyby tapping that long string of digitsdown below regardless we're going tohead back over tobreeze now breeze will auto detectany invoice that you have in yourclipboard so you can just do thatdirectly you can hit approve right awayor you could pastein uh directly from uh the the popupbutton if it didn't auto detect i'mgoing to do the auto detect thing i'mjust going to hit approveand that'll just send it out directlyright away without me having to do anyworkokay so that has been sent off we seesuccess let's just double check bluewallet make sure it came throughand we're all good so that was nice andeasy umnow we can also as i said we can send toa regular bitcoin addresswhen we hit send and we hit send to btcaddress down belowthis is where we would paste in abitcoin address so let's just go back toblue walletwe'll grab our bitcoin address so wedon't need a lightning wallet we need abitcoin walletif i hit receive i have a bitcoin walletright here which i can tap to copyand if i go back to our breeze wallet icanpaste in that address i canchoose an amount of satoshi's ummaybe i'll do 50000 satoshi's okay i'm going to hit nextnow at this point it tells me okay i'vegot an option i can do economy regularor prioritywhich means how fast is it going toofficially confirm and be spendable onthe other endi'm not in a huge rush you know to sendthis andand get it approved on the other side soi'm going to go economy umnow it is still go there's a service inthe background that's converting thisfrom lightningto bitcoin on the main chain so it'sstill going to cost me a bit of a feebut it breaks it down um the bolts feeis here and that's thethe the transition between lightning andbitcointhe transaction fee is just on thebitcoin network itself so i'm gonnathat looks fine to me i'm gonna hitconfirm it also gives me a timeline ofhow long it might take and i can seesend to btc address it says pending itdoes a little bit of work in thebackgroundand in a moment it will let me know oncethat hasactually gone through so those are theways that you can sendnow there is one other way when you hitsend connect to payand this is if somebody's in closeproximity or if you want to share viadifferent appsif you have other messaging appswhatever you can send a link to somebodythey will click on that it will connectthem tobree's wallet and you can connectdirectly with the person you'll actuallysee their littleuh avatar and all of that just anotherway to connect and pay directly withsomebodyand have channels between you um so i'mnot going to do that right now i don'thave somebody that i'm i'mwith that's going to be transacting withme but let's explore just a little bitmorenow again if somebody was in front ofyou and you wanted to scan their addressthat little button in the bottom middlethat will open up your camera and youcan scan very easy if it's hard to seeif it's on paper or something you canhit the flash onand there you go don't need that thoughso we'll back out of thatnow in this menu you've got a few otherthings let's investigatea little bit the marketplace this givesyou a bunch of places that you can spendbitcoinvia lightning so bit refill that's giftcards pizzaall kinds of different stuff um yeahthere's a lot this video game like nightis pretty fun soyeah you can check out this is alwayschanging so i won't go too deep intowhat they have therenow the point of sale is actually quiteinteresting if you tap point of saleand then you get out of that menu thisis actually like if you're a merchantsitting there and acceptingum accepting charges from people you canuhbasically do this as your point of saleterminal so it's really coolyou can um decide what you're chargingin in a variety of different fiatcurrenciesor bitcoins or satoshi's of courseyou're accepting bitcoin right you'reaccepting lightning paymentsbut the denomination can vary and solet's say i'm pricing something in usdollarsokay well i'm i'm selling something forfive dollars and yeah i hitcharge okay that will give me an invoicenowif i clear that sale um i can i can do anumber of different things here so let'ssaythere was a five dollar chargeand let's say i also have some itemssitting hereum now i pre-done i've made some itemsin here that i could tap so let's saysomebody wanted to book me for a privatesession i could okay why i sold one ofthoseand then somebody wanted to give me ahigh five notice that the privatesession is priced in dollarsand then a high five i priced insatoshi's i can tap thatgreat i gave somebody a high five theyhad these little icons that you can setup with themand then i can go and i can go to thecarti can see okay i sold an item thatwasn't in mylist for five dollars there's somethingthere for 200 bucks and there's a highfivewhich is priced in satoshi's but inbrackets it says 1.29okay i can go through there i can hitchargeit will bring up an invoice a lightninginvoice anybody can scan thatand pay or i can copy that and send itto anyoneand when it gets paid it will show uh itwill show in my inventoryokay so i can clear this saleand again i can go back out of here ican do this however i want i can gokeypador i can go items and if you want to addan item just down at the bottomokay what am i selling i'm selling uhgum and you can pick like awhatever you wanna there's all theselittle icons for it whateverokay lots of people love gum there we gothat's my iconmy price is in in bitcoin maybe it'szero 0.0001 and then you just you canhave a skew number for it i've only gotthree itemsso this will be number three okay additem now i've got another item in myqueueand they're all priced out differentlyhowever you decided to nominate them ifyou go into themyou can go and like i believe you canedituh edit edit your list and change themaround butreally really cool for those of you thatare looking at acceptinglightning payments in various placesand if you want that off you just toggleit and you're back to your regularwalletnow finally last couple things underadvanced you have a few things sonetworkwould be if you want to connect to yourown bitcoin nodefor referencing the actual bitcoinblockchain this is a little bit moreadvanced butthe setting is here and i've done thisin some other videos but i want to spendtoo much time on thatand then secondly dropping down theother thing i want to touch on issecurity and backup so you can create apin numberfor this so that if somebody gets a holdof your phone they can't just get inright awayuh you can store backups so this is agood thing to dobut i would recommend that you togglethis encryptthing and uh this will give you a listof words and you're going to write themdown and this is like a backupa backup phrase that you keep handy nowyou can store via google drive too andit will be accountlinked to an email address and just makesure if you're doing that that yourgoogle drive is locked down that you'vegot two-factor authentication on thatbecauseyou don't want somebody to get into thatyou knowthey're potential worries of somebodygetting into your funds okay so just bevery very careful with thatmake sure everything is is locked downcompletelyi would recommend doing the encrypt backup data thingum more than anything and that's that'spretty much it we've got we've sentwe've received when we come backwe'll just check on that lasttransaction that's pending and that'spretty much itoh and there's the other transactioncoming through ofuh bitcoin coming intoall the notifications are coming throughhere let's hop over to breeze oh yeahthere we gothere's an incoming transfer that wasthe 25one i had sent andthere we go there's the that one's goingoutyeah so uh we have an incomingtransaction that we had previouslyaccepted we had an outgoing transactionthat we had previously acceptedand everything in breeze is now finishedsettled uh we have the correct balanceand that's itso effectively you're able to seamlesslygo into and out of the lightning networktotake advantage of the low fees whenusing lightning network but if you needto get back to a regular bitcoin walletor somebody that's sending to youdoes not have a lightning wallet wellyou also have the on and off ramps forthatso kind of seamlessly ties everythingthat you need all together in one placewithout having to worry or think aboutall the piping that's
