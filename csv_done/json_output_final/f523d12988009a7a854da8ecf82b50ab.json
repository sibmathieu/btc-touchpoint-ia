twitterumby way of introduction jason is anofficer in the u.s space forcehe's an astronautical engineer and he'sstudying national strategic implicationsof bitcoinat mituh jason man welcome to the showthanks robert i'm a huge fan boy i'vebeenfollowing your writing sincewell before the number zeroum big fanthank you so much dude i'm reallyhonored and i it's just unreal orsurreal to me to see that writing kindof percolating up into the thinking ofothersum you know yourself included becausei'm just i'm so impressed with the wayyou look at bitcoinand you'vewhat started for me with thisenergetic perspective on bitcoin andspeaking with sailor in our initialseriesyou've taken that to like another levelumso that was one level of my mind beingblown and this feels like kind of thecompounding effect of that so i'm reallyexcitedto talk with you um andyou know as is the nature of this showwe're gonna try to gotry to go deep get down to someconceptual bedrockfirst principles whatever you want tocall itumsomaybe you know i would likei think the purpose of thisparticular conversations is to try tolay some groundwork because we're goingto be talking about a lot ofabstract concepts uh andyou knowalternative views of a futureon in a bitcoin world so i think it'sreally important to get definitionssquareokayto build that soas i've seen you offlineit's my understanding that yourthesis is really embeddedin physics you're really coming from theultimate first principles of physicalrealityinsofar as humans currently understandthemummaybe i'll just turn it over to you toexplain that a little bit unpack whyyou're doing thatand uh the floor is yourssure sowhat is physics physics istrying to understand thestructure of how the universe works youtakethe study of structure itself which ismathand then you try to use that math toexplain the phenomenon that you canobservearound youand if you use first principlesit tends to help you kind of uncoverthe structure better than if you try toapproach the same problem froma different line ofof thinkingsothat's the value of first principlesthe reason why i focus so hard on thatfor the angle that i take to explain theprimary value delivered function ofbitcoin is becausemine isuh you know related tothe theory of warfarethe theory ofwhat is effectively violenceand that um has a lot of like baked inemotionthat you know understandablysoif you want to filter all of thatemotion out and just get into anobjective as close to an objectiveway of understanding how this game worksand what it's good fordo it from first principles becausephysics is completely blind tomorals physics is blind to umfeelingsphysics is you know nature is is blindto both of those things so if you canexplainhowthe value of bitcoin the value ofwarfare itselfthrough physics then maybe you canfully appreciate bitcoinas an extension of those thingsbut more importantly you can appreciatethe complex emergent property of acivilization adopting bitcoin which inmy opinionfar exceedsjust havingsupply-capped money[Music]and so that was my journey into studyingbitcoin and i just want to share thatwith peopleand alsoand especially my superiorsthank you for that that's interesting itcalls the mind here thethat statue you know the scales ofjusticewhereas you know justice is blind she'sgot the blindfold on yet she's holdingthe you know presumably honest scalethat's weighinguh weighing things and so that i meanthat is ai guess physics is blind as well rightphysics is just what it is whatever themathour mappingwe're mapping reality in a highresolution way through mathematicsexplainingphysical phenomenasuch that we can and it's veryinteresting like physics is one of myfavorite subjects in collegejust the idea that we can peer throughtime you knowusing a formulafor something as simple as throwing abaseball like you know where it's goingto land you know the ark and all that sounlike uh unlike economicsright like it actually works like[Laughter]people takeyou know likethey'll take a math equation to try todescribe physical phenomenonand using that math equation they'llland a human being on the moon yesyou take the same math to try to explainsome economic phenomenonand paul kruger is sitting thereexplaining whyhe didn't get the inflation thing rightthe internet you just get a punchyeahright you just get a bunch of peopleoh well the reason why this didn't quiteworksothat's like all like that's why i lovedengineeringin general in physics in general andmath in general like that's why istudied it in college is becausethere's less room forerror i guess or like there's less roomfor bsyeah you know youthe a math equation is like a you knowyou either get it correct or you don'tthere's no like weaseling your way outofand andwhat i love about engineeringspecificallyis like yeah you have all these likemath snobs and they're they're they'regreat people you have all these inphysicists right and they can master thestudy of structure and they can masterhow to explain the complex phenomenon ofphysics but all of that is only usefulin so far as you canlike put it to work like okay cool youfigure out linear algebra what can we dowith ityou figured out calculus what can we dowith it you figured outall these things let's actually like usethese equations to build a betterfuture and and like mit understands thisreally welltheir philosophy is men's at monas whichmeans mind and hand likeyeah we can have a lot of smart brainsout there that can conceptualizephysical phenomenon and mathematicalphenomenon but likeput it to use likeyou know let's get practical yeah makethe assumptions figure out how to putpeople on the moon with thisso yeah i love engineering i love allthat stuff yeah and we're alreadyjumping to i think some reallyinteresting points here becauseso in physics engineering we're dealingwiththere are constants in reality that wecan discoverand then we can build formulas aroundright like e equals m c squaredum force equals mass times accelerationyou know theseth and those do not exist in the socialsciencesalthough we have this keynesian economicbody where it's trying tocreate formulas as if there wereconstants in the sphere of human actionbut there simply aren't so there's aphysics envyactually physics has made us so powerfulmath and physics combinedthat we're trying to emulate that inother sciences where it's not relevanteven and this is where i think it'sreally interesting with so maybe onething there is like when you haveconstants as you said we don't need totrust an individual's opinion we canverify right you can verifymathematically that some of theseconstants or formulas work or existand bitcoin's interesting because it'slike what is this thing this is likeperhaps the firstconstant in the sphere of economics orwe've somehowconnected the social sciences into thephysical sciencesum yeah is that one way to think aboutitto quote someone that i think is prettybrilliant likebitcoin isthe number zero of economics right likewe've discovered a constantat the end of the daylike fundamentally speaking thedifference between physics and economicsis a bunch of people trying to use mathequations to describe what they canobservethe difference iswe still use equations invented bypeople 400 years ago because they workand they keep working right and we canvalidate they work and we observe theywork andyou don't do that with economics becausethey stop working or maybe they onlywork underimpractical assumptionsand yeah i think there would be an envythere and it's important it's importantto understand this because like you knowyou get theit's uh what's the word epistemologicalyeah you know the theory of knowledgeitselflikelike you get these people that becomedisingenuous you get theyou know celebs out therewho wield their mathto describe what they can observeand then pretend like because it's mathbecause math isbasically inarguable math is math mathis the study of structure math isstructure itselfthey like try to imply that just youknow because i can make a math equationi must be right and because i know moreabout math than you dobut you know baked into those equationsare a whole bunch of assumptions thathaven't been testedin physicsyou test those assumptionsandthere's been a lot of people who havecome up with physical equations thatdon't work they break righteveneven newtonian mechanics don't work inevery casebut at a macro levelthey're pretty damn effectiveyou cansend people to the moon based off ofjust likeyou know newton and kepler what theycame up withplonk and a couple of othersso yeah it's important to note that it'sjust people trying to describe what theycan observe with mathmath is awesome math is prettyinarguablebut the manner in which they wield thatit can be disingenuous it's importantfor people to understand the distinctionbetween the two and recognize the bs ifit emergesyes yeah no excellent point there umyou knowwhat's jumping out of me here is thisthe language we're already using rightwe're sayingif it worksit's kept right this is evolution in anutshell whatever workssurvives or is keptyeahsobegs the questionwhat is workyeahumthat survivorship bias is prettyinterestingand the the question of evolution itselfis pretty much all i want to talk to youright now aboutumlikewe canwe can trace this all the way back tothe beginning of life and you canwell let's do it soyou know the universe is 13ish 12.8 ishbillion years oldlife itself isaround four billion years old so like athird of the existence of the universethere's beenlife on earthwe're actually like pretty late bloomerstoobecause like for the first two billionyears for the first half of life'sexistencewe were just awhat is effectively a soup a primordialsoup of bacteriaby the way there's likea million trillion more bacteria thanthere arestars in the milky way so likeit's pretty massivecomplexworldthat existed even 4 billionto 2 billion years agoandif you want to likestudy thepractice ofpeople experimenting with stuff tofigure out what worksstudy biologythat is all biology is it's justlife figuring out what works and whatscales yeahand to quote you againuhtechnology is just non-biologicalevolution it's the same game it's justin this case humans use it but we're notthe only animals that use technologyother animals use sticks and stuff yeahso so if you go back to like world waronei'm not talking about like 1917 i'mtalking about four billion years agoworld war one was a bloodbath war worldwar one was a bunch of single cellularorganisms fighting each other constantlycompeting overlimited resourcescompeting over limited space competingoverwhat they needed to surviveandtheyou can frame every major evolution assimply life discovering a better powerprojection techniqueto wield basically a better weapon towield over theircompatriots if you want to call themthatin order to survive better in order towin the this what is effectively a powerprojection game soyou know like this lifewas born into this protocol that itdoesn't have the option to unsubscribefromthe you know the the protocol is physicsthe way physics works isif youproject the most power in the mostclever way youwin the right to set the state and chainof custody of resourceslikeyou knowifif iapply a force in newtons against a massand displace iti've effectively energized the systemi've created powerbecause i'm transferring energy per unittimeand if i do that against anotherbacteriaand i kill that bacteria or i take thatbacteria likei've set the state and chain of custodyof the resources whatever it isandyou know likebecause people get salty about thisit's likeyou don't have the optionto not be eatenif you're eaten like you don't have theoption toit sounds violent it is you don't havethe option not to bleed if your heartgets hit by a bullet rightlike we canwe can imagine a world wherethis power projection game wasn't playedbut likeunless your heartdoesn't bleedif you get stabbed by a swordthen you tacitly complyto thepower projection protocol of physicsit's aamoral unforgiving it doesn't care whatyou believeyes um the you know bacteria don't havebrains right they don't have eyeballsthey can't see or know what they'redoing and all they do is like you knowget a pic like go you know to the oceanand get a teaspoon of water and look atit under a microscopeit's not a friendlysite it is brutalit is just straight upwaryeahthat's thewhat i call the law of natureit's the power projection game i don'tknow what to tell you you can'tunsubscribe from it unless you cansomehow break the laws of physics and soyou know this is what you can observeyou can observe thatanimals will compete over resourcesyou can observe that they will projectpower in increasingly clever ways overeach other to gain more resourcesthat the key evolutions thatthings made from the very beginning likeone of the first major evolutions wasbacteria learned how tobasically have flexible cellularmembranes so they could subsumeanother cell and then like dissolve itand then take its energyokay so like the first weaponor one of the first weaponswas eatinglike cells evolve life evolvedthe way to eatto subsume their you know competitorsand take their stuff like to take theirproperty yeahwas it immoralhave you ever felt bad have you everlooked at like a bacteria eating anotherbacteria they don't even have likethey don't even have like nerve theycan't feel pain because pain requiresmore than one cell rightumso eating was one you know they figuredout uh what are they called philiabasically to grow little hairs thatallows them to swim around in the waterthat was a power projection techniquenow they can swim around find newterritory lay claim to new territory seta new state and chain a custody ofresources they can swim around and findanother bacteria and then use its eatingto eat the thingyou havetails they grow little tailsrightthey can whip around faster they canbreakother bacteria apart if they're powerfulenoughyou get you gotlike some of them were clever andfigured out how to pull energy out ofthe sunso you get bacteria or single-celledlife thatlearn photosynthesis so they can capturemore energy passivelyif you have more energyyou can swim around further and eatstuffright like so photosynthesis well thepat was a power projection strategy[Music]umthis is how the game works you know thisis true because you can observe ithappeningthere's not like a lot of room forumdebating it rightit and and then likeone of the most gangsterpower projection techniques ever likeone of the best predatory tactics everevolved by lifewascooperationbecauseif you want to project more powersummit togethercells fighting togetherprojects more power than one cellfighting aloneand what's interesting is this emergedtwo billion years ago it wasn'tintentionalagain these things didn't have brainsthey didn't have eyeballs they couldn'tsee or know what they were doingthe first examples of life learning howto cooperate togetherwas involuntarytheythere was a mutation that caused theircell membranes to get sticky and so theywere accidentally stuck together so youcan't like fight each other becauseyou're stuck together so you might aswelleat other stuff okay there's thisclusteringscientists canlikecan replicate this experiment you canget yeastyou can put them in a bowl eventuallythe mutation of stickymembrane will emerge they'll startclusteringthey'll start doing forming all kinds ofinteresting clusters some will evolve toliterally diewhy because that'll allow the umyou know that'll allow the cluster tobreak apart so like this concept ofagingwas an evolutionary thingbut that's not the only way you cancooperate involuntarily the other andmore common way is throughwhat iscalled colonizationso if there's a limited amount of spaceand i'm a single cellular organism and ijustpark where i parkand then another one parks next to meanother one parks next to me and we allpark all next to each other sooner orlater we've captured the entireterritoryif anyone else wants access to thisterritory they have to fight us for itall we do is simplymake our cell membrane stronger so it'stoo hardto break us and then we expandthat is ayou know it sounds like a defensive onlystrategy it's not that's athat's apower projection strategy colonizationis how youis probably the mosteffectiveoffensive strategy there iswe know this because80 of the biomass on earthis a bunch ofcolonizers colonizing life what iscolonizing life it's plantsright likewhat did plants do plants figured outhow to stick togetherto develop super strong cellularmembranesand then expand and then just growthey don't like try to maneuver aroundthat much at least not in any waycompared to likeyou know the soft-celled multicellularorganisms they justcolonizeand you knoware plants defensive onlyhave you ever seen what happens if youputkudzu in the north georgia mountainsjapanese kudzu in the north mountains ihave i grew up in tennessee and i'veseen the kudzu out competing in theforest yeah does that look like adefensive only strategy they're notattacking anythingthey're devouring itso it's the it's the strength umin software it's called the stranglerpatternbut it's a colonization attack you justfocus yourself onhaving strongcellular membranes and you grow and yougrow more and you grow more and youclimb up the tree and then eventuallylike that tree's in the shade of yourvine oryou know that tree can't get any morewater because all your rootsyou have 10 times more roots in theground than they do you're absorbing allthe water that they would normallyabsorbthese are called invasive speciesthey're invadingspace 3d spacesoby the way that is the mostgangster and most effectivestrategy that life has used 80of biomass on earth isall these colonization attacks happeningconstantly you walk around all you seeis greenunless you like you knowlive in the desert or something soso it's important to understand thesethings umcooperation was a power projectionstrategy it was an effective one itbegan involuntarily but thento your point earlierthat's what survived that's what workedlike the other animals that didn't dothese things they're not around anymorebecause it didn't work it wasn't aneffectivepower projection strategyhey everybodyas you've no doubt learned by watchingthis show bitcoin is the single mostimportant asset you can own in the 21stcentury and one of the most importantcompanies in bitcoin today is knightigknightig's mission is to get bitcoininto the hands of as many people aspossibleone of the ways they are accomplishingthis mission is by empowering banks andfinancial technology companies to offertheir own bitcoin products and servicesas a true game changer in the industrynaidig is safely unlocking the power ofbitcoin for forward-thinking individualsand institutions alikeled by robbie guttmann yenzao and rossstevens nidaeg has absolutely explodedonto the bitcoin scene recently and hasquickly become a leader in this spacesowhether you are a professional investorlooking for asset management servicesor a company looking to white label yourown bitcoin product or serviceconsider nidig your single sourcesolution for everything bitcoinlet me if i can jump one insert a thinghere so what you just said is greatbecauseand this is so fundamental if it worksit survives right so it's like okay whatis worki think physics the formula for workforceover distanceuhyeah force over distance rightso the ability to exert force acrossspace essentiallyand so evolution itself we could say istheprocessofworking towards greater work like to beable to project more force acrossdistance to be able to harness moreenergy and channel itumthat's what these the strategy you'redescribing this colonizer strategy rightit's out competingthe kudzu vine is getting out competingthe tree for access to resources interms of both sunlight and waterso it can then subsume those resourcesto project its own strategy further intothe worldyep so this is what's so fundamentalit's like the theif the world is just this stack ofpatterns basicallythat we have these strategies competingwith one another and the one thateffectively channels the most energyacross distance wins over time it worksit survivesit becomes dominantum and so in that way likeyou could almost another way of sayinghow you quoted me earlier is we couldsaybiologyis like god's technology in a wayand not god like guy in the sky but godis this creative anti-antropic principleright the whole universe is increasinglyantropic but there's something aboutlife thatcountervails it to use one of yourfavorite wordsyeah one of mine as well take a drink[Laughter]and sothat's something very fun it was likethere's this force right there's a forcewe said work is force over distance sonow it's maybe important for us todefine forcewhich newton's this is newton's secondlaw force equals mass times accelerationuh mass is also energy right mass isfrozen energy e equals mc squared soum again the acceleration of energyrightwe keep coming back to this fundamentalpoint so maybe you could speak to forcea little bitso not to get well this is this is yourpodcast so of course we should get thisdeep oh yeahlifeis uniqueamongst everything else in the universeeverything in the universethe entropy of that thing is moving inone directionlife is the thingis the only thingthat is attempting to reversethat entropy yesit's going to failprobablyit's going to be temporary it's going tobe fleetingbutthat's kind of the beauty of it andwhatbypre by exerting more force by in it byfinding more ways to use energy byprojecting more power which is the timederivative of energyit enables lifeto be better at reversing the inevitabledirection of entropyfor a little longeruh and at least on the case of earth forlong enoughfor life to actuallyunderstand this and observe itselfand say what i just said which is likethe beauty of at least life on earthum but it all to your point relies onour ability to in my so i i say on ourability to project power which is thetime derivative energy soto basically find clever ways ofleveraging energy it doesn't have to bethroughkinetic energy generation which iseffectively whatforce isumyou can do it different ways energycomes from different waysit could be electromagnetic it could besolar which is electromagnetic but itcould be chemical um but the point isenergy is figuring out different ways toor life is figuring out different waysto harness energy to reversethe inevitable course of entropy it willfail but damn it we can have a good timealong the wayand so yeah it's important to know thatnowthe force is probably the most dominantway ofachieving and kind of harnessing energyjust becausewe live in a world that'shighlyyou knowkinetic and mass based and has a lot ofcarbon in it so makes senseumand yeah life in my opinion iseffectively just a bunch of theseself-assembling proteins figuring outhow toapply force in increasingly clever waysbutthe important thing is not just forceitself it's the application of that itiswhat are you doing it forright it iswhat energy is transferred for over timewhat aka what powerwhat are you using the power for and thepowerand everything that i can observe isbeing used toexpand toharness more resources tocolonize to generate more energy andthatand if you follow that whole trail it'sjustself-assemblingprotein structures learning clip moreand more clever ways to project powerto set the state and chain of custody ofthe resources it needs to scalein increasingly effective waysit's not umit's nota pretty sight but this is the universelike rightyou know there's like there's thisepisode of rick and mortywhere like morty sees something horriblelike just like the most horrible thingand rick's like you know breathe it inthis is god like this is how theuniverse works likewe're fighting the inevitable directionof entropyit's not gonna be an easyit's gonna be an uphill unpretty thingthat's just how the law of nature worksif i could drop uh one quote in herethat i think just sums it up beautifullythis is gk chestertona dead thing can go with the stream butonly a living thing can go against itum i love it i love that quote and it'sso this is what life is doing rightharnessing entropy to counter veili'm sorry harnessing energy to counterveil entropyand this all sounds a lot to me likeentrepreneurshipthat's what we're doing right we've gotan idea a strategy something that hasn'tbeen done before let me go test itagainst the uncertainty of the world seeif i can resolve some of thatuncertaintycost effectively right efficientlyif i do then i can sell that strategy toothers in the market enriching myself inthe process and making the marketmore productive allowing it to channelgreater energyacross space and time sosothat's interesting becauselife basicallyevolved anentrepreneurial approach to like amechanism forperforming entrepreneurshipthey eventually had these like prettycomplexcellsand you know they would build themselvesaccording todnaright like the what is dna dna is justthe instructions on how to build thisself-assembling piece of proteinsbut the life that lived the longestwas the life thatwould deliberate likemutating dna was an evolutionarypower projectionsuccessbecause if you just flip a random bit inyour dnayou'll you'll end up growinga tooth like teeth you'll end uplike growing eyeballs you'll end upyou'll also end up growing a bunch ofcrap you don't need that won't make yousucceed right right you'll grow a canceror something and you'll die but that isentrepreneurship the the whole role oflike dna flipping bits mutationshappeningis life forcing itself to try what areeffectively new ideas right trying newthingsin an operational environment and seeingwhat succeed and the result of thatsuccess is what we observe now so likeyou know you you see a peak predator youseeyou see atiger for example yeahtight what like tigers have eyeballsthat was a success successfuluhyou know evolutionary strategies haveeyeballs you can maneuver a lot moreeffectively you seebig musclesyou see sharpteeththat wasn't that was something that wasevolvedlife figured outin multiple different paths life figuredout that teeth are an effective survivalstrategyyes life figured out that if icolor my hair in ayou know likestriped patternit will allow me to increase theprobability of killof my prey because i can get closer tothem beforetheir eyeballs can see metheir passive detectors can see meso camouflageeyeballs teeth brains themselvesthese areall entrepreneurial successes in thefree market of evolutionand that's what we see today those arethe things that succeededumthere's a lot oflife that didn't succeed and you can weyou can study their bonesumi think one of the best examples isis you see this in entrepreneurial shiptoo likewhen a really good entrepreneurial ideaemerges it's so discredited usuallypeople don't appreciate how important itis people call it inefficient or stupidpeople don't appreciate the needso like a good example of that is uhwarm bloodmetabolismback inhowever manylong time ago i can't remember exactlybut likethere was a point where the successfulentrepreneurial strategy was to be alizard to be a cold-blooded lizardto receive all the heat you needpassively through sunlightso these dinosaurs would basically baskin the sun to heat their bodiesum they would to get their energy theywould grow these weird little fin thingsout their backsheat sinksto collect basically solar panelsplants figure this out tooit's just you know kind of away to receive energy passively fromthis big ass fusion reactor in the skythat you should take advantage ofso when the first animal this likesilly looking weasel thingfigured out metabolism figured out howto it was a mutation first of all yeahwasn't intentional probablyyou know you take you your the energythat you get from your food and then youuse metabolism to heat your bloodthrough a chemical reaction rather thanget it passively from the sunendothermic versus exothermic right yeahby the waywho would do that that's stupidwhy would you go like that's superinefficient you're wasting the energyfrom your food to heat your own bloodwhen you can just go outside and receiveitfor free from the sunthat's a stupid ideaweasel you know whatever that thing wascalledyeah it's a stupid idea up until a pointwhere the sun stops shining yeah whenthe asteroid hits 66 million years agoand there's so much debris that there isno sunand then 80 of life on earth whichoptimized around receiving yourenergy passively from the sun freezes todeathand diesand that weaselsuddenly becomesthe success like right you knowthe weasel had by the way the weasel hadto do this i sound like sailor because ijust said by the wayumeither weasel couldn't go bask in thesun because it was a weaselin the world full of dinosaurs it wouldget eaten instantly like right you haveto hide undergroundif you're underground you don't have alot of sunit's going to be cold you're going toneed to metabolize and warm your ownblood if you don't want to freezethe asteroid hits there is no sunall these bad assesthat discredited metabolism and warmblood dienow that weasel can walk around and eatyou know whatever's left and feasts onthe plants and the bugs and and thenthat weaselevolves into bigger and bigger thingsand that's how you get mammals yeah likemammals was like a badassumentrepreneurialplay that worked that wasif you had looked at it66 million67 million years ago you would have saidthis is the stupidest thing why wouldyou do this but once the asteroid hitsonce the environment changes suddenlyyou're in a big deali love thei love thistale i don't know it's not a tell it'strue if it's what happened but what'soccurring to me here is theweasel was employing a decentralizedenergy harnessing strategy right thedinosaurs were centrally dependent onthe sun shining every daythe day that that one thing stopsworking the fragility of their entirestrategyis exposed and they collapsewhereas the mammal could get energy fromall low it could eat all kinds of thingsright omnivorous presumably and couldconvert that into chemical chemicalenergy and heat itself endogenouslyand that made all the difference rightonce the sun actually did go out sothere's there'sthere's a lesson in there i think aboutthe dangers of centralization actuallyright or putting all your eggs in onebasket so to speak yeah the dinosaursput all their eggs in the basket of thesun effectivelysobasicallylife succeeds because it hedges againsttail riskthe reason why it hedges against tailrisk is because it's constantly mutatingat random yesifthe environment changes the asteroidhitsthe stuff that was you know in thecenter of the bell curve of the of therisk profile is going to go downbut lifeis constantly mutating life isconstantly testing new strategies it'sgot the tail risk covered yesthat will be the thing that succeedsinyou know this is something that helpspeople understand likebecause you see it's it sucksyou seelike you know people get sick and peopleget diseases andbecause of some mutationright like but this happens to allanimals they'll get tumors or somethingwill go badthat is lifeitself hedging against that tail riskit's got to constantly test new featuresin a production environment all the timeto make sure it can hedgeum which is pretty cool that is theentrepreneurial spirit right you'reconstantly testing out new ideas to andbecause you do that once the environmentchanges you're more guaranteed to be thewinner of the newenvironmentwe're talking about hedgingtail riskand we know this is something we do insocioeconomic realitybut it's something more fundamental thanthat right it'sagain rooted in biological physicalrealityand i'd say we life or these survivalstrategies we're describing whichultimately i love this connection toothatmost fundamentally that's what life isso thean organ and organism and anorganization these are all just survivalstrategiesright orperhaps power projection strategies eventhere's asorry go ahead i'm just going to saythat there's strategies thatone of the things they do is hedge tailrisk as you've described and they dothat by expanding their optionalityrightjust like the weasel had all the suddenhad more options for energy derivationthan just the sun so it outcompeted thelizard in the event of the tel riskum and so this this idea of theentrepreneurial or thedarwinian pursuit of throwing spaghettiagainst the wall seeing what sticksuh it's really interesting because sothen life is this structured survivalstrategybut it need so it's fighting againstrandomness and entropy but it hashas to have a little bit of randomnessand entropy at the edgesconstantly experiment and make sure it'sproperly fitted to reality becausereality changes all the timeso there's this interesting dance oflikestructureand randomnessand there's this sweet spot between thetwo is lifeto reallytrip you out isso we you know we started thisconversation talking about workthere's a lot of work is just a way tomechanically produce energy but you canproduce energy inways that don't evolve force againstmassyou can do itthrough electromagnetism which is whatthe photosynthesis life figured out youcould do it through chemicalenergy production which is what theweasel figured outat the end of the day what you need iswhat life needs isenergy if it doesn't have energy it'snot life it's a virus like thedifference betweena bacteria and a virus isthe virus isn't alive it doesn't havelike it can't sustainbut but what's crazy isback or viruses also mutateconstantly that's what we're worriedabout right now right with the omicronstuff likeso you don't even need to be living toplay theconstant mutationuh you don't even need to be like aliving thing in fact beforesingle-celled organisms were like avirus justrandom moleculesassembling themselves in random waysusing random protein structuresandsomewhere along the waythoseinanimate random molecule proteinstructures learn how to harness energyand that'sthe distinction the main one as far as ican observe betweenthe virus and the bacteria thenon-living thing and the living thingso even you don't even have to the pointis you don't even have to be livingto play thistry random things and see what succeedsgainsorry what is that line then what isthat what is thedistinguishing feature betweenliving virus and non-living i'm sorryliving bacteria non-living virusumi i i don't know i'm not abiology guy i just the way i understandit is a virus is simplya set of moleculesthat can only reproduceinside of a host maybe that's it maybeit's ability to reproduceand you can't survive independent of thehost so it's like a parasiteyeah kind of yeah okaybut once that random thing ofyou know once that randomself-assembling structure ofprotein and molecules starts harnessingenergystarts swimming around startsreproducing itselfthat way without a host independentlyjust floating around in waterthose are called bacteriathat i probably butchered thatdefinition and if you have anybiologists listening they're probablyclawing their eyeballs out well pleasethrow it in the comments because this issomething i just i'm thinking deeplyaboutbecause as we said earlier right the uhthe technology is non-biologicalevolution it's like where do you drawthe line between living and non-livingi'm really trying to figure that out andi have no ideayeah i mean from a first principlesperspective it's just a bunch of randommolecules all of itin differentforms sothe the only maybe the only differenceisa lot maybe what we said beforethat life is the thing that reversestries to or seeks to reverse theinevitable course of entropy[Music]uh who knows but yeah anyways soyou know like i say all this becausepower projectiontheis the key is like the thing that'salways truehow the energy that is derivedand transferred per unit time to achievepower projection can come from differentsources it can come from work it cancome from force against mass but itcould also come from chemical like theweasel figured outit could alsoyou know by the way there is anothermajorchemical relatedevolution that like humans should bepretty thankful forumsofor examplethe weasel isnowyou know basically 80 of its predatorsare gone it's free to walk around androam the surfaceuh to feast on whatever it can feast onit gets bigger and bigger you look atthe averagebiomass of a mammalafter the asteroid hit and it just takesoffthese things get bigger and biggerbiggermultiple different mutations happen thatmake it more effective projecting powera big one islike opposable thumbs that was a prettythat was a pretty sweet entrepreneurialideaallows you to climb up trees there's alot of trees around because rememberthose are the colonialiststhose you know those are the realum successful power projectors yeahso you can with thumbs you can climbtrees you can break sticks apartyou get a whole bunch of these mammalsthat just swing around in trees all thetimepicking the fruit from the trees anddoing all that stuffand thensomewhere along the waythosethose opposable thumbmulticellular mammal creaturesstart to like notice you know some treescatch on fire because the lightning hitsthemif i uhwhat if i like break off a stickand i capture that fireand what if i put a bunch of stickstogetherto maintain that fire burning this likefire stuff is a pretty useful way ofgenerating more energy it's like prettyuseful energy source it's very very metabecause it's you're now harnessingenergy as a tool itselfyeah you've captured energy itself yeahand thena lot like a lot of these opposablethumb wieldingmammal thingstook that a step further they're likehow's like what if i could start thismyselfwhat if i don't need to find a forestfire and capture it that way what if icould just rub these sticks togetherand likestart fireyeah there were a lot of differentspecies that figured this out it wasn'tjust sapiens we weren't alone in factthis was well before sapiens evenemergedumthey thereand and so once you wield fire itselfthat's interestingdo you know why what do why do you thinkumwhat do you think is the big deal ofbeing able to start and harness fire whydo you think that's usefulthere's two things that jump to mindhere umi'll name them right after i just wanttoreinforce a point you just made it'slike it's one thing to harness the fireit's another thing to realizeyou can create the fire through atechniqueright that we can codify as knowledge wei'm not saying semantic knowledge thatsomeone was saying hey you'd rub twosticks together to start a fire butprocedural knowledge you can showsomeone how to start a fire and thenthat knowledge starts to propagatethrough human beings so now not onlyhave we harnessed energy as a toolbut we have harnessedthe procedure or the technique toharness energy as a tool effectively oncommand so i just wanted to say howpowerful that is again just opposablethumbs rightjust develop thumbs so there supposed tobe this interface between thumbs and andcerebral development so the two points ithink about fire being important oneit was like a form of pre-digestion in away to actually start cooking food wecould liberate more macro nutrientsthrough cookingwhich as i understand it freed up ourdigestiveresourcesto be allocated more towards braindevelopment so by virtue ofpre-digesting food we lightened the loadon the digestive systemwhich let the our internal structureallocate more of its resources to biggerbrains which clearly had a positivefeedback loopthe other thing that i've heard is thatfire allowed us toi mean kill on mass right we could justburn a whole forestto the ground and then just go andtake whatever we want right all thefruit and animals and food and wood andmaterialswe could just clear land you know andit was it was a wrecking ball i guesssomething like thati'm honestly kind of disappointed mostpeople don't get it andwe get i get to play this like gamebecause they'll be like oh it keeps themwarmor oh it helps them fend off predatorsbut noso this is athis is something that we relearned inso i'm an astronautical engineeriwas trained by the air force and and igot a grad graduate degree inastronomical engineering so you learneda lot about how rockets workand somewhere along the wayso rocket works is the way a rocketworks is pretty simple it's just acontrolled explosion you take fuel youtake oxidizer you set it on fire youjust try to point the explosion in onedirection instead of in every directionbut somewhere along the way peoplefigured out hey if we create somethingcalled a pre-burnerwe take the same fuel same oxygen we putit in a pre-burner we preheat itin this pre-burnerand then we take that mixture and thenwe put that in the combustion chamberyou unlock a little bit more energy atvirtually no penalty for size weight andpower you can get more thrustandeffectiveness out of your your energythere your engine so pre-burners areeffectiveso somewhere along the way once wefigured out how to harness and startfire these animals figured it out theyfigured out the same thing it's apre-burner you can pre-burnyour meatby the way how did you get that meat inthe first place through the projectionof power through the clever projectionof poweror whatever you're cooking and so yeahto your point yeah exactly youpre you pre-digest pre-digestion meaningyou pre-burn it meaning you break up andloosen the molecular bonds meaning youcan pull out more energy once it hitsyour stomach at virtually no cost tosize weight and powerit doesn't take any more effort and youjust get like an explosion of extraenergy per everyunit of food that you consumesoyeah and i've heard the i've iunderstand the second one but the firstone is interesting because now we'retalking about we're blurring the linesbetweenwhat is an evolutionary development andwhat is the technological developmentyeah and the the lines get blurred evenfurther because it wasn't because theinvention of fire the harnessing andstarting a fire actually had aphysiological effect on the animals thatwielded it yesyou have so much extra energy nowjust lying around yes that it can go tomuch more energy intensive processes soif a rocket like if you add a pre-burnerto a rocket engine what what do you getyou get the ability to put more payloadon the top of your rocketif you add a pre-burner you know if youstart cooking your food what do you getyou get the ability to add more payloadon the top of your headsoyouyou we were able to put that energy inthe most energy intensive stuff which isthinking so you see the directbecause of this technology it had aphysiological effect the technology firewielding animalshadexplosive growth in the prefrontalcortex in their brains they could thinka lot more they had a lot more energy todo the thinking yeahand that created this whole newassortment ofhumanoidsyesyou had all of these fire startingspecies you had the erectus you hadneanderthals you hadokay there's like dozens of themum you hadsapiensbut then likethree thousand or sorry so that's likeyou know we're nowat about two hundred thousand years agosome point around30 000 years ago the the trail goescompletely coldon everything but sapiens all theseother humanoid fire starting prefrontalcortexcreaturesdisappearthe trail is completely cold and allthat's left is sapience so like whathappenedand at the same timeyou know you carbon date the cavepaintingsandthey're all around you know around thesame time frameso this gets back tolike what was the original gangster wayof like the original gangster predatorytactic that single cellular organismslearnednot intentionallyit was cooperationand so of you know the the main theoryis of the humanoid speciesof the ones wieldingtheir prefrontal cortexes sapiens werethe first to usetheirbig brainsto start developing abstract thoughtthat they united aroundfor them for the function of cooperationthey basically were the only humanoidspecies that was able to conquerwhat is called dunbar's number soyou know we have these bigbeefy prefrontal is but there's still acognitive limit around the number ofnames and faces i can remember likeyou know it's still a cpu it haslimitations you only have so much randomaccess memory you only have so muchmemoryand uhand that's a problem because that meansyou can only scale your cooperation tothe tothe limit of number of people you cantrust or your you know so all thesehumanoid species had tribes they wererunning around 300people deeprightbut humans or sapiens started figuringout okayifif ibelieve the same thing this other sapienbelieves if we believe the same thingi don't have to actually know who thatperson is or trust them i just have totrust that they believe the same thing ibelieveand so you can go back and you can seethe cave paintings and you can seehumans starting to form theseexistential abstract ideas they'restarting to trace their handstrace different hands they're startingto conceptualizethere's something morewe there's something greater thanourselvesyou know you start to have this abstractthought that humans united around andonce they did that they conquereddunbar's number they figured out how toscale if you believe in the same ideathen you can scale cooperation beyondthe cognitive limit of your prefrontalcortexes and they figured it out firstandthe best way to project power is to sumit together to project more power is tosum it together so if i can get athousand sapiens to believe in the samethingeven though they don't have thecognitive capacity to actually know eachthat many people or trust themthen i can roll up to another tribe ofneanderthalswho are still only 200people deep and despite the fact thatthey're strongerand despite the fact that they havebetter rational thinking probablybecause they had much bigger prefrontalcortexes they didn't figure outabstract shared abstract thoughtlike we didand soumthat's when the next you knowmass extinction event happensyeahbecause after that pointthings get ugly andif i could jump in if this is atransition point i just want to try andwhat you just said was sobeautiful and profound i want to try andecho it back a little bit so weit's crazyposable thumbs climbingright gets us tofire as we laid out there's a couple ofother things here that i think areimportant that also um[Music]you know pointingand the opposable thumb it gave us theability to particularizeand gestureand to manipulate the naturalenvironment in very specific ways so itlends it's almost like the hand is theultimate multi-purpose tool when youhave the opposable thumbbecause you get a very fineparticularization of your naturalenvironment which lends itself to toolmaking pointingyou know across distance andas you made the point like okay weharness fire we're considering broaderspheres of space and timethis is leading this isdeveloping the prefrontal cortex rightthe prefrontal cortex is for dealingwithlarge distances or thinking across spaceand timeso we're feeding this thing we'refeeding the growth of this strategyandfrom that percolates upconcept right weleave we leave space and time we go intoconceptual space or abstract spaceand we begin engineering these usefulfictionsreligion morality wisdom traditioncommon beliefand all this is effectively doing isestablishing a common patternamong a larger set of mindsso that we we can scaleuh in terms of concerted action right wecan just believe the same thing versushaving to have these tight knitfem like family like bonds within 150person unit all of a sudden we can justoh they're they're a christian we're allunder the christian flag or whatever itisso this again back to powerthis radically amplifies our ability tocollaborate and what is this isthis is a big wake-up call to me what'sthe root word of collaboratelaborit's right there in the middle of theword it's literally the ability to workright so when we collaborate this is theeconomic division of labor we createthere's a uhan emergent property a synergisticfeedback where more than the sum of ourpartswe it's a positive sum game however youwant to say this like we become morepowerfulacting in concert than we are inisolation this is thebottom of economics basicallyand then the further thing and this iswhere we're at today i think is it okaythe the book sapiens does a great jobkind of crystallizing this wholenarrativeuh we are dominant in the world becausewe can tell and believe these stories wecall useful fictions such as money thenation state civil liberties whateverso nowit seems to me the battlegroundamong humans at least iswho gets to dictate that useful fictionwho gets to make the rules and createthe stories that we abide by tocoordinate this ultimate source of powerwhich is human collaborationyepand that's where we're at today it'slike which useful fiction is most usefulor most true or bestyep or optimal and thenwhich leads us right into bitcoin but umyeah i don't know if we're ready forthat i'll throw it back to you but ijust wanted toyeah so you know where i'm goingum yeah you just likespoiler alert right soumyeah i mean likethe cool thing about sticks arethey burn effectively they can hold firewellyou don't see a lot of things that don'thave opposable thumbs wielding sticksveryeasily like a dog can hold a stick buthe can't rub the stick together tocreate fire he can't break sticks apartand manip you know so likethethe reason why thumbs worked out greatand hands worked out great is because itallowed creatures to handle sticks ifyou can handle sticks you can handlefire if you can handle fire you can getyou can pre-burn your food if you canburn your food you can grow a prefrontalcortex if you can grow a prefrontalcortex you can start to thinkabstractly you can start to share ideasyou can start to park your ideas inother people's prefrontal cortexesand once you have mastered the abilityto park ideas in other people'sprefrontal cortexes you have masteredcooperation you have masteredcollaboration you have mastered thepower projection game at least in so farasit's derived fromworkfrom mechanical energybecauseif you can get people to collaborateyou're effectively summoning powerprojectionto create something massiveandhumans figure this outhumans use this toolto be humans to be predators just likeall other animals arewewe slaughtered everything with this newcapabilityour ability tocooperate at massive scalesis the reason why wewe runyeah like we go to thei keep on saying this people it's likemind-boggling howfreaking brutal humans arehomo sapiens were with this new toolwith this tool of collaboration ofshared abstractionswegolike on the weekend to museums to admirethe bones of all the mammalsthat we slaughtered into extinctionbecauseyou know they represented threats likeoh cool look at that only man holy manif that's that's neat look at thatsaber-tooth tiger that's neat there waslike all kinds of ox and giant moosethings andand thenat you know somewhere aroundlike 10 000 years agowe were like why don't we keep onwasting our energy like hunting downthese massivemean rx to eat them why don't we justhold them in captivity why don't we justcapture themand then why don't we just eatthe mean ones we'll just murder the meanones and we'll breed the nice onesand we do that for 10 000 yearsand you have effectively geneticallyenslaved an animalinto becomingpassive into becoming non-aggressiveand then you get cows like if you if youcapture a predatorand then you genetically enslave it intoa genetic prisonwhere it doesn't even have the genes toput up a fightyou get a cowthat you can then just send to a butcherand you can kill it and eat it withoutputting up a fight that's what a cow isthat's what humans did by the wayif you do it to a wolfyou get a dogyeah right like if you capture a bunchofwolvesand then you kill the mean onesand then you breed the nice oneseventually you get a creaturethat is like your servant yes like i iyou know we know i love dogs i love dogsi agree that dogs are our best friendsdogs were genetically modified to be ourbest friends yeslike the reason why dogs love humans somuchis because those are the ones thatsurvivedlike it's dark but this is artificialselection rightit is itlet me put it this wayi'm a big fan of wiener dogs i justthink wiener dogs are the cutest thing ihave a pinterest board full of wienerdogs just adorableyou put a wiener dog in the siberianwildernesswith a bunch of wolves like do you thinkthat thing is gonna survive likei love wiener dogs i will be the firstto admit they're an abomination ofnaturecreated by humans because we're gangsteras hellif you want to because we're brutal yeahif you want to like you know what knowwhat the peak predator is on an alienplanet just look for the thing thatgrew its own pets right to worship itthat's you know that's a pretty gangsterit's not we aren't i don't think we'rethe peak predator i think of the mammalswe are but you know remember 80 ofbiomass are plants yeahum we are less than like one percent soat least in terms of mammals we havewe're just brutal and it's important toknow why and the main one is because ofthat cooperation thing yesso power so it's it so just to reiteratehowpowerful this is like we havefashioneda psychotechnologicalinfrastructurethat you you know the yuval hararianuseful what does he call them imaginedorders we call them a useful fiction anideological superstructurewhatever you want to call it it's justan imagined orderthat we shareand through thatapparatus that contrivanceit is an amplifier of human energybecause now we can trade collaboratespecializeunify our movements our efforts ourthinking and we just completely run overthe world completely like super dominantspecies of the world up to the point ofhavingyou know breeding wolves into wienerdogsyeah we weaponized itthat's one way to look at it yeahand so if you're a human and you can bethe one toplant your idealor your abstractionand get a bunch of people to agree to itthen you're super powerful and and wheni keep on saying power i literally meanjoules per second likei'm talking physics hereyeah let's unpack that actually so theforms of power because a lot of peoplethink when you say someone's powerful orit's all about power they're typicallythinking political power which has itsroots in physical power but there's alsothe pure physics definition you'redescribing so maybe you could unpackthat a little bit yeah soall my arguments are going to be firstprinciples they're going to be physicsrooted when i talk power i literallymeanjoules per secondlikeyou can generate those joules indifferent ways you can generate themthrough electromagnetism you cangenerate them through chemical like theweasel didyou can harness it through chemicalswhich we did with fire you could do itthrough workso kineticbut at the end of the dayyou were justtransferring energy per unit time it'sjust joules per second right there's youknow people get that confused with likeyou know maybe the political definitionof powerand the sources of that but in myopinion those are stilllike what is political power thepolitical power is just being able toplant ideasin other peopleso that they steer their joules persecond in the direction that you want itto be seared in it's still just summingjoules persecond likeyou know because like i studied powerand negotiation there's a lot of waysyou canuse the non-physics definition of powerbeing attractive is a source of powermore people are going to listen andfollow youand maybetransfer theirjoules per second in the direction thatyou want it to bebecause you're attractivebut it's still at the end of the dayjoules per second like that's it that'sall it takesyeah and thisspeaks tofiat perhaps like when we say commonlyin bitcoin bitcoinworld we say fiat we immediately thinkfiat currencybut it's not that necessarily by fiatmeans you know by decree because i saidso someone in a position of authoritysaid this thing needs to happen so ithappened so even thatit's an amplification of power right itdoesn't take me a lot of physical powertoproject my speech or write a lawor whatever but so long as i am ina position of authority within thehierarchy that constitutesthat organizationi'm now amplifying this little bit ofenergy i put into writing the bill orsaying the thing and it mobilizes humanactionright so so biden can write they couldsign a bill today or what i don't knowwhatever he would do you know betterthan i he's the commander-in-chiefso he could press the button and say goblow up the cityso this little exertion of powerwould then translate into this hugeexertion of physical power that actuallyblows up the city so again it's thiseven political power kind of grounds outin physical reality i guess is the pointi'm getting atso this gets to the next bigi guess technology you could call itthathumans are unique compared to otheranimals because insofar as i know humansare the only ones that write lawsand so what is the law of nature issimple the law of nature isthose who project power in the mosteffective way earn the right to set thestate and chain a custody of resourcesthat's it and it's brutallike lionslook what happens whenwhen a new lion emerges and overthrowsthe other lion it's not a pretty thinglike simba what happens to simba isnot what happens in the lion king it'sbad go look at what happens when likea starving what happened you know whathappens to the baby squirrel when themama squirrel is starving it ain'tpretty yeah those who project the mostpowerin the most effective way earn the rightset state chain of custody of allresources to include energy to includewhateverum this is the gamesobutwhat humans figured out is likeyou knowpretty much ain't nobody got timeto fight over every single thing likethat's pretty much what they figured outit's like we don't need to go to warover who gets to earn for every sandwichyes exactly over every sandwich so whatlaw is iseffectively asurrogatepower projection game legal power isokay listen likehe you know i can destroy you at anytimebecauseyou know my name is robert breedlove andi have much larger upper body strengththan yousowe don't need to go into this fightinggamelet's just create a surrogateand let's just call it and let's writeit down and guess what i'm the kingi s what i say goes just follow what isayand i don't have to kill you you cancontinue to liveright so like these god kings emergedbut it's still like all lawlike the thing that predates all law isthe military that exerts the power toestablish the rule of lawright likeyou know thethe american revolution started 10 yearsbefore the constitutionrighteverythingis dire like the state and chain custodyof everything to include rules of law isderived from power projection the ruleof the law is the thing that happensafter we've won the war and establishedourselves as the dominant thing right soyou know what is law what is the socialcontracts that humans develop themselvesthey're just a surrogate to warbecause ain't nobody got time to fightover every sandwichumandby the way like if you're rule of lawlike if you get oldso you know my name's bobby breedlove ii work out i have the you know bestpower projection capability i'm gonnacall myself a god kingi'm you know appointed to my positionover you through divine whateverwhatever our shared abstraction bs isandum but the problem is you have likeproblem about god kings is they tend todieand then what happens okay well crapwhat's the new rule of law going to benow that our god has died yeahand then you what do you do you revertback to the traditional originalgangster law of nature power projectiongameand then whoever wins that probabilisticpower projection game gets to define thenew rule of lawyou do that over and over again you getgod kings you get kingsyou get nation statesso it's just the samepower projection game that's been playedfor four billion yearsit's just humanscreate a surrogate in between the matethe larger power projection real stuffand then we compete and so i want toemphasize today sorry i just want toemphasize one thing you're saying hereis thata recurrent pattern across human historyis human beings fighting overfighting for control of the rule-makingapparatusyeah who gets to make the rules of thegame we're all going to playand to be able to make the rules of thegame we're all going to play is ineffect the power to win in perpetuitybecause if i make the rules then guesswhat the rules are always going to servemy individual self-interest and thisbecause it gets bigger than that rightas wedecentralize sovereignty from anindividual toan aristocracy to a presume you know arepresentative democracy etc butumi think that's the key point is like ifthe rulesthis is talking about the mutability orchangeability of rules if they'remutable and changeable we fight overthem to control them but nobody'sfighting to control the rules of physicsor the laws of physics because nobodycan change them we just all play bythose rulesbut within within the nesting of thoserules we're trying to control the ruleswe can control so i just i think thatwe'll come back to the importance ofbitcoin laterwhat are laws but shared abstractionswhat is a religion but a sharedabstraction what is the symbol ofcurrency but a shared abstractionthese are all justideas that exist only in the prefrontalcortexes of homo sapiens no other animalcan recognize what you're talking aboutwhat is language but ashared idea living in the prefrontalcortexes of homo sapiensif you can control these sharedabstractionsremember cooperation these sharedabstractionsthat's the key to power projectionthat's the key to winning the game thatwe none of us can unsubscribe fromphysics is physicsif a human stabs you in the heart you'regonna dieso like you better learn this powerprojection gameif you want your shared abstraction tobethe onethat everyone uses yesand sohistory is justa ledgerof property ownershipwrittenby the people who win the powerprojection competitionsounds pretty similarexactly likesounds pretty similar toanother protocolright likeyou engage in a bunch of powerprojection competition and whoever winsget to write the leisuresounds a lot like my namenature doesn't make leapsthe tech likeyou you don'tescape from this game this is howyou achieve permissionless control overresourcesi don't need your permissionto control this resourceso like let's say you know wegenetically enslave arabs into cowswe hire someone to kill the cow for usbecause we don't want to be bothered bythatthey throw that cowthey throw that stake in between you andmeby the law of nature whose fake is thatto be determinedit's probably yoursit depends how clever you areyeah exactly yeah that's true maybe ican nowthat's that's the best shot i have rightit's your steakumnow i have a gunyou don't have a gunwhose steak is itdefinitely yours rightlet me put it this way i don't have toask your permission to eat that steak ifi've got the gun rightyou don't have to ask my permission toeat that steakif we have to you know likejust do the old-fashioned way yeah soand all animals do this you throw thatsame steak in to a pack of wolves whoeats the steak whose steak is itthey've already established who steak itis right they establish that gameconstantly they're constantly snappingat each other they're constantlydetermining who the alpha iswhat the pecking order is the peckingorder is literallylikethe state of custody between the stateof custody of whatever resourcesthat you've discovered rightit is a existential necessityfor lifeto establish pecking order and it's nocoincidence that life succeeds if thestrongestright the thing that is most capable ofreversing entropy the inevitabledirection of entropyif the strongest wolf gets to eat thesteak the strongest wolf will survivelife has the best shotat survivingif right like that's just how it worksit's notit's not anything like against eventhey have thisproto-morality or proto-useful fictionwhere instead of fighting over everystakethey already know the hierarchicalstructure yeahfascinating so what's interesting isthey're actuallyputting collaboration at the apex oftheir value hierarchy right it's like nowe're not going to kill each other overthis stake because we might need all ofus tomorrow to bring down a buffaloyeah so they will fight each other tothe point where one wolf is pinned onits back and the alpha has itsmouth around the jugularand the alpha will not bite and theystop it it knows instinctivelyi need this wolfin my pack to project more power tosurvive right if you read there's anentire book on this about humans sapienshave the same instinct it's called onkilling it's written by an armylieutenant colonelsapiens have the same instinct it youhave to actually overcome your instinctto kill another homo sapiena lot of times if you've ever been injust like a natural fist fighti haveyou actually pull your punchesinstinctively like especially if you'rewinning and you know that you're aboutto break this dude's noselike you will instinctively pull yourpunch because there's something in yourbiology that saysi need this human aliveif we're going to like survive longeryeah you know humans have figured out away to train themselves out of thatinstinct better than the other animal[Music]",
