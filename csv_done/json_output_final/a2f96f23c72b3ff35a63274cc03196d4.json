welcome to another episodeof the Bitcoin standard podcast OurGuest for today's seminar is thearchitect Michael diamont Michael is thefounder of the social media Network newtraditional architecture that has helpedto popularize the classical architecturetraditionMichael studied Society planning atStockholm University majoring in urbansociology he felt a need for a channelto spread awareness that there is anoption to the dominantmodernist thinking in architecture andCity Planningnew traditional architecture was foundedin 2013 and has since its Inceptionspawned local groups that havesuccessfully changed the publicdiscussion about architecture inScandinavia and Beyond a lot ofattention is also given to networkingand helping people discover like-mindedpeople both locally and internationallytoday content from Michael's socialmedia Pages can be found all over theInternet increasing interest for newtraditional architecture and inspiringmore to Aspire to become classicalArchitects while much of his Focus hasbeen on content creation Michael hasincreasingly been interviewed in mediapodcasts and filmed interviews about hisviews and architecture and urbanplanning I found Michael's views onarchitecture very interesting and veryrelevant to the audience of this podcastif you've read my book the Bitcoinstandard or the my or the Fiat standarduh you see the discussion of timepreference and I make the argument thatthings changed when it comes to timepreference after the move from gold asmoney to Fiat as money and I argue thatthat has been reflected in architectureI'm not an architect however it's notsomething that I've studied very closelyit's not something that I can speakabout with a lot of authority but todaywe have somebody who can so I'm veryhappy to be welcoming Michael here andto get his opinion on architecture whyit has changed and how it can be fixedMichael thank you so much for joining usthank you very much for having me I Ican frustrate that I'm not neither am Ian architect and it doesn't matter weboth have the right to have an opinionabout our built environment it's themodernists that have succeeded intelling everyone that if you're not anarchitect you have no right to commentyour own built environment where youlive every day but both you and I areexperts because we use the builtenvironment every day so of course wehave the right you know and preferencethis and you know opinions what to thinkabout you know what we see yeah withthat said you know it's a very widetopic but it's not that complicated thatmodernists want to make it your argumentis very valid uh it's part you know it'sone part of the broader culture changeof society you know moving away fromfrom generational building moving awayfrom you know trusting the futureEverything feels faster and faster thisprocess of course began you know alreadyin the 19th century we had you know thefirst globalization okay the firstglobalization I would say was it was inthe 60th Century but then gradually youknow it evolved more and more and moreand yeah everything's a quick Buck nowand what differs this time from previoustime is that many people both Architectsand developers and Builders they don'tlive in the place where they you knowcreate their buildings or or where theybuild so they have no skin in the game Ithink that's the the term that they'reusing in American English soif you build an ugly building you don'tcare you don't live thereif you lived in a placeand you know you're going to meet localsevery day you you're a bit little bitmore sensitive you know what you aredoing it doesn't matter it's not onlyarchitecture it is like every field ifyou will uh close a manufacturing plantand it will affect your neighbors ifyou're an owner of a big manufacturingplot and you live in the place so sothis you know this this connectionfrom the low gallon and everything isjust you know figures on a computerscreen yeah that's an alienated it'svery much you know from our buildingsenvironment but but all this is a porchof the broader culture change and withinthe architecture field I would say thatit's mainly the ideology of modernismthat's you know made the wholeenvironment change okay so I'm curioushere about what is your definition ofclassical architecture and how is itdifferent from modernist architectureI'm familiar with the terms but I'd likeyou to expound on more on what makesclassical architecture classical andwhat makes a modern architecture uhmodern a great question and this is veryvery important to Define because I neveruse there's often a confusion you callclassical style you use the styleargument all the time that this is somekind of style was but it is not I usethe term classical tradition and when Imean that I don't I don't you know singlike it's not that individual thing astyle it's a framework and anarchitecture philosophy how you createdesign a building so within thisframework there's a limited amount ofclassical Styles you know if you go backyou know before 1945there were endless amounts of differentclassical Styles so there is not oneclassical size and the majority of allclassical Styles have not been inventedyetso it's a framework and a tradition andthis tradition it's important to stressthat this is not only Greek Romatradition you know when we're discussingyou know in in use and and Europe ofcourse it will be the Greek Aromatradition that is the foundation of ourclassical tradition but there is youknowIslamic classical architecture you haveyou know cine station classicalarchitecture you have South Asianbroadly you can call it Hinduarchitecture so it's many many differenttraditions and these traditionsare not Styles they're a way of thinkingwhen you design a building and they'realso the philosophy what is importantwhen you design a building you knowwhat's wrote yours what should we thinkabout what proportions are importantwhat is important in our quality of thestress when we build a building okay sothat that's the definition of of theclass classical architecture and theclassical tradition not the style notolder Styles it's the framework and wecan create new Styles like they didbefore you know before before World WarIIyou had Art Deco was very popularized inthe U.S and you could actually yes youcould say that there is a classicalstyle because it has more in common withit used new technology but at the sametime it has more in common with theclassical tradition than it has withpost-war modelists you know how youframe the facade how you divide thefacade pot symmetriesjust the will to create somethingbeautifuland this the view that beauty issomething objective and measurablemodernism you know the opposition has arelativized new concept of beauty it'sjust a matter of taste it's just the eyeof the behold you need to hear all thiscrapand that's not truebefore 1945 you know we lived in muchmore religious societies so the absolutetruth came from God so you didn't needto argue about you know Beauty andugliness because there was you know anabsolute truth but now you know withincreased secularization post-war thenwe're relatives everything is just amatter of perception and viewand this fits if you're a developeryou're very happy with these view youcan build any crap and just say Beautiesand life of the boulderand that's what's happened yesabsolutely I think this is very astute Ithink the focus on beauty is somethingthat you see in many fields is not justin architecture but I think even inpeople's personal appearances you knowwe live in a world that's that's tryingto jam down our throats the idea thatbasically having any kind of discernmentabout the way that you look or the waythat others look is somehow evil thatyou know everybody should yeah yeah youhave the fat acceptance movement youknow every weakness of you my characterinstead of saying you know we we don'thate you but you should work you shouldstrive and work to improve yourself it'sacceptance so we should accept every youknow weakness and not only accept it weshould like almost aspire to it and ifwe don't aspire to be fat and ugly orsleazy that then we are supremacist ofsome kind you know it's it's really abusiness I'm sure that it's absolutelydestructive for the people who engage inthis because you know it portrays to bepeople the idea that you were born inthis way and this is just how you'regoing to be and there's nothing you cando about it and the only thing that youshould do about it is just indulgeyourself and embrace your uglinessembrace the fact that you don't takecare of the way you look embrace thefact that you don't take care of yourhealth and instead of trying to changeyourself which you know let's forgetabout that because that's hard then wedon't like to do hard things go do theactually relatively easier thing whichis just go around the demand that otherpeople change which I think is is a verycommon thing you see amongauthoritarians in that I've never seenan authoritarian who you could look atand say this person has real controlover themselves like it's it'simpossible like to be able to controlyourself is so difficultto be able to live your life accordingto what you want no matter what you dowith your life you know simply beingable to control yourself controllingyour food controlling your habitscontrolling yourself in your relationswith others is extremely difficult andany person who's actually trying itrealizes trying to control other peopleis much much much difficult and you knowthe the most that you want to get awaywith is maybe controlling your ownchildren which is Hell difficultyeah it's increasingly hard I know Ihave a I have a 15 year old daughter youknow and it's it's like uh I understandwhy people move to the countries yeahreally you know living in the city yeahbut like but what you say is true andit's not new because you know if youread you know old Greek text you know ofstory system you know fighting one'sdesires it's also a very central part ofboth Christianity and Buddhism you knowwhat and Greek philosophy you know toAspire for something higher not justbeing an animal you know fighting toself-controlself-awareness of course you shouldenjoy life but you should not throwyourself head on to all the to decadencemore or less you know to eating too muchuh chasing sex or women or all thesekind of things that you know bringself-destruction yeah absolutely and Ithink you know the only way that we canhavehuman civilization in the most looselydefined way you know the the only reasonwe can get out of being monkeys slingingour feces at each other under the treesin the forest and move away from thatinto building societies buildingpermanent structures that we can live inhaving social relations with one anotherhaving peaceful relations with oneanother collaborating with each other torepel outside threats like you know theenvironment and the rain and the onlyway that we can do all of that comesfrom essentially curbing our inneranimalistic desires everybody has thoseeverybody would like to eat everythingthat comes across them everybody wouldlike to you know attack anybody thatupsets them in in even the slicest wayeverybody would like to indulge theirsexual desires in the most direct wayand yet the only reason we have a womanyou see yeah but you know the onlyreason we have a society is because welearn to control that and I think uh youknow this idea that you should justindulge yourself you should justeverything is valid everything is fineit's uh it it's ridiculous because theyou you extend this and the result is weend up being monkeys thinking our fecesat each other all day in the forest inthe jungle really because that that'swhat it is to not have self-control it'sit's what differentiates us from animalsthey just act based on their Instinctwhereas we have a brain and reason iswhat differentiates it and this issomething that my favorite Economistmises stresses a lot and discusses indepth which is reason is whatdifferentiates us and it allows us toact as human beings rather and an actionas a form of rational thought applied tothe world we look at the world we thinkwe decide you know this would be bettermaybe we should stop singing feces ateach other how about we take a breakfrom that and see if we can build ahouse for each other together that willhelp us both benefit that's reason andit's it only comes along from thecurbing of our instincts it only comesalong because we sacrifice the presentyou know the desire of the present meneeding to throw something at you tohurt you because you made me feel badfor whatever reason I put that aside Isacrifice it and I realized no you knowwhat let him get away with it this timebecause I can benefit a lot more if Icollaborate with him than if I justcontinue to fight with him or that wesettle our difference to a third partyou know uh like the government has youknow Monopoly on violence so so it's ithas affected you know modernism is notonly in architecture it's in art it's inevery aspect of our of you know theculture today you know the relativismthat there are no values nothing is truedo what you want do what you please andthis is also equally important this isvery much in architecture not so maybein the other field partly in the otherfields is that so that people shouldn'tknow that there is an option they try asmuch as possible to destroy what wasthere before themso you had you know especially in the60s and the 70s less so today but stillcontinuing you had you know may yourdestructionof classical cityscapes and towns maledestructionso now we can look at photos and justyou know wow was it this beautiful andyou see today but but you know it's muchmore real if you see you know a buildingin front of you and you see its neighboris an ugly modest building and then youknow your mind start to think you knowwhat the hell happened why why whathappened to architecture we are ahundred times richer today than we were100 years ago but if you look atarchitecture it looks like we are athousand times poorer so so it it's like1984 you know rewrite the past destroythe past it has never happened this isthe only one I I my favorite example ofthis is I use that in the Fiat standardis the public library of Boston it wasbuilt in 1895 and it cost I have thenumbers in the Fiat stand so I may beoff here but it cost at that time Ithink a million or two million dollarsuh today in today's money it's aroundum I think 70 or 90. I forget the exactnumber but that was the building thatwas built in 1895 and then in 1971 theybuilt the New Boston Public Libraryright next to it essentially the twobuildings are right next to each otherand the new one is uh nicknamed themausoleum it looks like a grave it'sit's such a big giant box with littlewindows and the the astounding thingabout it and this is this is really whyI focus on time preference as being theexplanation for this is that it's notcheaper it's not just that it's uh it'snot just uglier because you know wecan't afford it anymore or we're tryingto build more libraries so rather youknow back then the library supposedlywas for rich people because it lookednice and now we're building librariesfor poor people and we get to build morelibraries from that no it's not cheaperit's actually more expensive in fact thebuilding in the was built in 1971required renovation in 2000 2010 orsomething like that and required severalyears of renovation that cost more indollar terms and it cost to build theBoston Public Library in 1895. so it'snot cheaper to build those things it'sjust very high time preference it'sexpensive in the long run it's cheaptoday you know you you put together abunch of quick designs and you tellpeople this is beautiful and if youdisagree then you just don't understandit and it's yeah it's cheap oh you'renot safe you're a Nazi that's also anargument they use if you discussion ifyou discuss such a texture for more than15 minutes to say that you preferclassic you will be called a whitesupremacist yeahyeah it's ridiculous but like if if theissue is cost then it's definitely notthe case that a modern is cheaperbecause modern requires a lot morerenovation and a lot more maintenancewhich ends up costing money so this thisis why in my opinion I think it is thetime preface and I think yeah you'reright it's it's related to all of thosethings but what do you think about theidea that it is the money that is um thedriver of those things so the way that Isee it uh when money was gold it waspossible to maintain the value of yourmoney money appreciated every year inreal terms in terms of real goods andservices by about one or two percent soevery year you could buy one percentmore apples one percent more houses twopercent more houses because every yearwe're making more apples more housesMore Everything whereas gold is thehardest thing to make so the scarcity ofgold over time means that it's valuegrows so I think in a world like thatyour alternative to building a house ismaintaining the money in your pocket andso in order and the money maintainingits value so in order for you to takethat money out of your pocket and giveit to an architect who's going to buildyou a housethat house better hold value as wellbecause otherwise why would you give upwith that money because the money thatyou have will hold on to its value Ithink that's one way of looking at itand then the other way is the money thethe fact that now we move to a um uh oror the from the flip side of this is youknow when you move to the Fiat world nowthe money doesn't hold on to its valuevery well and so therefore your optionof keeping the money in your pocketmeans that if you hold on to it foranother 10 years or in the bank you'regoing to lose you know depends on whenand where you live uh maybe 10 50 maybe99.99 like the case in Lebanon so in inum in those places the money is burninga hole in your pocket so you're going tobe a lot less Discerning about whereyou've invested your money isn'texpected to last 100 years and sothereforethe house that you're going to spend iton doesn't have to also last 100 yearsso it leads to this idea that back inthe 19th century people were buildingbecause they thought you know when youbuilt a house for your family youexpected your grandkids and theirgrandkids maybe to live in today peoplebuild houses and you look at modernarchitecture you see that basically ithas a shelf life of maybe 20 30 40 yearsthen and then it's going to get takendownand get renovated yeah it's absolutelyreasonable it's absolutely reasonableand by the way you're comfortable MiddleEast they are crazy about gold in theMiddle East and that may have hadsomething to do with you know the lackof lack of trust in you know in moneyand also you know real estate becomesreal estate and not you know homes yeahso everything is very very you knowtechnical everything is very technicaleverything is is you know we lostconnection to it and yes gold issomething that can figure it's somethingyou can hold it's something real so yesin that way you have a better trust foryou know the currency now we're we'redisconnected from it you know when theyleft the gold style and I think it wasin their 40s or 50s they did it in thein the British Empire at least wellarguably I would say 1915 1916. so afterthat okay they were sort of saying thatwe're kind of on the gold standard anddifferent things but really 1915 is whenI think it went uh they went off thegoals now so that it's important ofapart you know there are there are manyreasons for things to happen but that'sdefinitely a feasible you know areasonable argument why all this changedyou know short-term development becauseI don't know if things will have valuetomorrow then I just want to make aquick Buck now and don't care about thefuture yes it definitely uh you know itholds water and it affects you knowpeople's minds how they think how theybuildmoney now because I don't know if I'llhave it tomorrow I don't know anythingabout the future and what future we aregoing to die anyway you know combinedwith secularization we have fewerchildren today so everything is moreimportant now now now than a future thatwe simply trust less and lessyeah and we also know because we don'tbelieve in an afterlife a majority ofpeople I would say in the Western Worlddon't believe in an afterlife anymore weare very much here and now it'severything is very much here and now sothere is you know lack of long-termthinking but we have new religions in away you know we have this climate changereligion I'm not arguing against climatechange no no please go ahead we argueagainst climate change here all the timeby the way yeah but the way how it hasbecome it's it's a religion it's it hasnothing to do with scienceso if we care about climate changeyou know when you build classicala building has longer lifespan and whydoes it have longer lifespan is itbecause of the materials no it's becausebuildings have value Beyond merefunctionso if you build this beautiful Bostonyou know they built a beautiful BostonLibrary the Central Libraryand let's say in 100 years time let'ssay tomorrow that they would think oh wewill move the entire library to anotherplacethen they will make an effortto repurpose this old beautiful buildingand use it in a different way while theconcrete one they will not make aneffort they will send it to a developerthat will clear it down tear it down andthey will build a new building so inthat way the you know the the classicalarchitecture until the classicaltradition You're Building Beauty andbuilding buildings that have a cultureexpiration cultural expressionsthere will be more eco-friendly theyhave less impact you know CO2 remissionsbecause they will stand longer becauseevery generation will find reason torepurpose these buildings if you look atit I I don't know the situation whereyou are situated but I can tell for mostof Europe and Stockholm where I live werepurpose old meals you know floor mealsand and warehouses and Industrybuildings because they are so beautifulso we make them to luxury apartmentstoday yeah would anyone consider youknow making a 1960s Factory to to luxuryapartments you know that's preposterousit's the same thing with this you knowmodernist Library the concrete box noone will protest if it's torn down sothat is what will happen but buildingsthat we are beautiful and rich incultural expression we will always trywe will not always succeed but we willalways try and make an effort topreserve them and find new function forthem I remember in London once I wasshown a very nice building and I wastold this actually used to be horsestables uh back in the day and now it'sa very nice building and it's it'spretty astounding to think that 18thcentury horses lived in places where21st century Rich London investmentbankers live today sorry forinterrupting but it's even worse youknowwe have jails now in Stockholm and inother places 19th century jails thatthey made to hotels soso it's it's crazy when you think of itit is but they are so ability thestructures are so beautiful you knowthey are not you know very they're uhhow's that they're richly decoratedthey're not you know often of Warmasterpieces but they're they're solidand beautiful brick buildings withTowers beautiful roads the proportionsare right the facade division so theylook marvelous in a simple way so wemake hotels of them andI I you know let's any post or prisonyou know would anyone even considermaking yeah repurpose it to anythingother it will be torn down and thenfor for the people in the climatereligionthat's a loss for the environmentbecause you know the biggest impact thatbuilding has on the environment is whenit's built them and later torn down yeahno absolutely I think it's I very muchagree with you the the climate religionis just a completely irrational it'sit's a set of beliefs whose absurdity isthe point you know it's like ahumiliation ritual where you need tostand up there and actually be a grownadult who says yes I am scared becausetiny imperceptible in infinitely tinylittle article particles of CO2 aregoing to destroy this entire planetbecause they're going to go from 320particles per million to 420 parts permillion over a couple of years I I wouldargue that that you know we're changingthe climate but I'm arguing I guess youknow that that doomsday is religion yeahand you know the The psychosis you knowthe mass psychosis you know all theseyoung teenage girls cry that get angstthat can't sleep at night because theclimate's gonna kill us all in fiveyears you know it's it's like a doomsdayculture it is it really is and and howyou know hownow I'm gonna sound really communist youknow how big corporations profit reallymuch of this absolutely they really doyou know because I can only speak youknow for the place where I live but wesell you know cow's milkforone I one US dollar I would say one USdollarper liter I don't know what that is ingallows but one US dollar per liter wesellum let's say hover this you know thisit's not wheat but there's somethingthat grows in colder region that'ssimilar to wheat uh I forgot his name inEnglish and we sell it you know milkmade of of this you know like you knowlike soy milk but this is from from thisgrain so we sell this grain milk fordouble the pricewhen it should be half the price becausethere's no you know middle there's nocow that needs to chew it and live andeverything you can process it directlysoit's so much this you know all thisplant-based meat all this plant-basedthings should be cheaper than you knowthe the real meat and the real milk butthey are not because they they you knowthey reap Havoc you know on this scaredcultist you know crying uh people thatreally trying to find you knowIndulgence yeah so that they you knowcan come to Heaven no and absolutely andthe way that it is terrified people isjust it it's a religious replacementit's it's exactly what Christianity usedto do people would be scared of the factthat there's a judgment day and thatthey'd live their life and fear of thatand I think the the other thing is thatreligion allowed us a social focal pointreally where we all agree and that youknow this is the our religion This IsOur God and therefore as a society wegather around the idea of being asreligious as possible being as good interms of the religion so you want togive more charity you want to go tochurch you want to do all those thingsthat are part of the religious ritualsexactly and now that's been replaced bybasically freaking out about the weatherand that's the new religion and so it'sthe same thing so you know your virtuesignaling is instead of helping withCharity now you donate to a bunch ofyeah Swedish teenagers like Greta whoare out there going to protest or doingwhatever you have a lot to answer for uhin Sweden with Greta but we let it passI'm so sorry you know I I'm sorry for mycountry I'm going to have Swedish onlyhalf of me it needs toeverybody's got a lot to answer for inthis uh in this world unfortunately butI I also remember another example I'veseen in Toronto I've seen pictures ofthe um actually not just picturesactually it's still there the new townhall and then there's the Old Town Hallnext to it and again it's another agreat example of the contrast betweenthe two the new town hall is justanother box and the old one is just abeautiful building and until todaytourists go visit the old one nobodygoes to the new one but in many placesthey tore down the old one when it wasfunctioning there was no engineering orstructural reason that required you totear this down but it got sold based onthe idea that look it's hey it's the1960s we have all these amazingtechnology things and that we need abuilding that is modern and so it gottorn down say in the 60s and 70s theytoured these um beautiful classicalbuildings down replacement withmodernist eyesores and today themodernist eyesores need to be torn downwhereas the classical buildings thatsurvived the 60s and 70s are stillfunctioning and still going strong Ithink my and a high value and they'rehigher value absolutely yeah that's thatshould also be stressed okay thesituation is different you know but inEurope I would say you know theclassical districts and the classicalbuildings they are much more highervalued you know if you take everythingequal location and such people will paymore for a classical living in aclassical apartment you know in aclassical building than in a modernistone very true so so it's yeah includingmodernist Architects this is a verycommon theme on the internet wherepeople will show you the architect thebuildings they built and the building inwhich they live and it's it's verycommon you know they build these glassand concrete boxes but they go and liveinum 19th century townhouses yeah it'shilarious it's really hilarious becausebecause I thought you know I first readabout this in of course in Sweden whereI live where our you know architecturemagazine make made a study you knowwhere where do Swedish Aztecs liveand they were overhead willingly theylived in classical buildings so it'slike what and then you check you knowthe offices of all the big Swedish alsotexture firms they are also All Inclassical buildings and if you checkthis internationally you know in the UKNorway it's the same it really is crazyyou know so there was a there's aScottish sculpture that said it verywell you know modernism is something youdo to others and it it really is yeahand the the scary part is that theydon't see this hypocrisythey really don't see it you know theyhad an interview with a German magazinecalled HP who had an interview with thisDutch star architect called Ram kolaswhere they ask him you know they ask himyou know before Architects would youknow lived in the buildings that theysigned wouldn't they be more beautifuland you know he said oh that's justshallow and stupid it's not about thatso they they actually did a goodinterview so they stressed now where doyou live and he lived you know in aVictorian apartment house in London yethe refuses to design anything like thatso the same people that overwhelminglylived in classical buildings theyrefused to design them it's just why whydoesn't that say something do you don'tyou think that other people Aspire wantthe same thing as what you inhabit andif it's so good that you refuse to liveand you know in modernist buildingsisn't there something wrong with yourideology it's yeahit's it's an open goal really the moreyou talk about it the more you showyou know there is this Fabio the emperoris nakedis really naked and all we have to donow thanks to the internet we can exposeit so easily yeah and I think thereality of it is that the vast majorityof people it's true I think witharchitecture and it's true with art theyknow this they feel it but they'reconstantly really being gaslighted thatterm gets used a lot but I think in thecase of architecture and art it's it's aperfect application of it we just haveum people who appoint themselves asexperts and Authorities on art andarchitecture and they're constantlytalking down to us about the fact thatno you just don't understand you knowDamien Hurst or whatever his name isputs a statue of the Virgin Mary in aJar full of piss and you're supposed toapplaud because that's art you know butif you make fun of Damien Hurst or oneof those artists then you're you knowthat's sacrilegious so you know beingsacrilegious towards Jesus or the VirginMary isCutting Edge revolutionary amazing artbut being sacrilegious toward DamianHurst or any of these modernist artistsor Architects is basically you areignorant that you don't understand but Ithink I think the internet has hasreally helped us like I think my book uhthe Bitcoin standard was a book onbitcoin and there were a couple of pageswhere I was discussing time preface andhow it changed and I went on a bit of adiet tribe on uh Modern Art uh for a fewpages which I thought you know couldserve as a good illustration because ofsomething very Vivid everybody knowsthat the what the Sistine Chapel lookslike and everybody has seen Davidrothko's idiotic mattresses withbasically seven-year-old scribbles onthem and like there's a difference youcan't if you get rothkopf and you tellthem to go and make the Sistine Chapelhe won't be able to do it if you gotMichelangelo and you told them hey canyou just go and uh do the stupid that rothko did he's gonna spitin your face for degrading him enough toask him to do something so much heyhis little boy could do it yeahyou needed real talent before and todayyou need no Talent you need connectionsand this is also you know you could saythat modernist ideologies I wouldn't sayit's a it's a religion but more of anideology that people have invested a lotin so what you need is basically like anexit strategy you can compare it youknow to 1991 in Soviet Unionpeople wake up that have lived all theirlives you know they've been partymembers and they've really believed incommunism and then they wake up and theyare told that everything they believetheir entire lives was a liewhat do you do either either you getdepressed or you double down so what oursticks do is they or when artists andall these crazy people is that theydouble down on the madness because thetruth will be so hurtful to everythingthat they have believed in you know thattheir entire lives yeah I did get a lotof that reaction of a lot of people justyou know getting so offended andoutraged like how could you say thisabout rothko no you just don'tunderstand but I will say I did get alot of people who said particularlyartists who said this actually made methink and really changed the way that Iapproached art in particular a guycalled fractal encrypt uh he goes bythat name he's in the Bitcoin space andhe says basically that part of thechapter changed his life because yeahthis was the issue I think a part of itis talent but I think a part of it isjust basically turning up and doing thework and and I quote a passage fromMichelangelo you know when he wrote apoem about making the Sistine Chapel andit was four years of hanging from theceiling and painting and he describesall of the ailments that fell on him hewas smelling the humid air and the uhpaint and his bones in his neck and allof those problems that he gets it's veryvisual the poem that he wrote that'sfour years of really really really hardworkI guarantee you David rothko did not gothrough that kind of hard work to makehis mattresses and uhthat's what it is like it's it'syou know with the same genetics thatwere there when Michelangelo were therestill around so we probably haveMichelangelo's amongst us it's just theyhave not spent their life working hardat perfecting the craft likeMichelangelo did you know when he was akid he was out there going out withpainters and Architects and uh figuringout what they're doing and trying tocopy them and learning and spending daysand nights and weeks and months andyears so struggling and working hard totry and develop this so that he couldmake something so beautiful that peoplecould look at and everybody would lookat points and say beautiful without himhaving to harangue them and tell them noyou're idiots you don't understand likeif you your work can speak for yourselfif you put it in the work yeah it's sotrue what you say because you know whenit comes to classical Beauty if youdon't know anything about you knowreferences cultural history you canstill appreciate it and if you know thethings you can appreciate it even morebut you point out to the tragedy ofmodern times you know never in thehistory of humankind has there been moreTalent wasted becausehow many human beings are over today wewere eight billion you know worldpopulation during the time of missileAngelo was what could have been onebillion more less than a billionprobably 800 million something and howmany people today have accessto higher education or education at allso what this what what we have in ourtime is that we have probably millionsof potential michelangelos you know inthe global population that are totallywasted because there is no one they knowcan that can hardness their talent orlead their talent to something usefulso I I know we we could really be be youknow entering a golden age ofarchitecture and art just because of thesheer amount of potential talent that wehave today but it's all wasted so so ifyou waste Talent there's no use for ituh so so yeah this is really a a tragedyof modern times and I know it for Truein architectural schools and what youget now is either to get aself-selection in architecture schoolsonly people that like boxes and crazyfigures will apply if you like if youhave talent in drawing if you havetalent of creating use more it's morelikely that you would go into computergaming and doing computer Graphics thanthat they really become an architectso the self-selection reinforces youknow the the downhill Trend inarchitecture because these new peoplethat aspire to become architect they arethe one that likes the boxes and thenthey are the future professors andarchitecture critics and the system itwill be you know self-reinforcing forfor every generation so I don't thinkyou can fix it in in architectureschools you need to create newcompletely new architecture schools Idon't want you know to to remove theprofession of architect or institutionallearning just you cannot solve it in theestablished institution that has beentotally hijacked you need to create newschools and there are new schools butthey are not mainstream in general youknow there are classical articles inboth U.S and in Europe uh there areseveral but you know in the in the wholein the big picture they're of coursejust a tiny percentage of all artstudents and then when it comes toclassical architecture there's only oneUniversity in the entire worldthat teachers you know have a classicalArchitects program which one uh NotreDame a Catholic University in Notre Damein the US in Ohio I think it's situatedthere are you know other places wherethey have individual courses there areplaces we have in Europe we have summerschools in classical architecture forFrench speakers and English speakers butwe don't have like a a full programwhere you study you know five years andthen you come a licensed professionalclassical architectsso yeah things are changing but butthey're changing a bit too slow you knowthe in the big picture but the flame iskept alive at least and that's importantbecause we also have now a program witha lot of loss of skills you know stonemasons you know all these traditionalskills that created all this beautythey are hard to find apprenticesit's it's strange you know it's really aa job for the future you know when we'reat Mass automatize everything people canstart working with their hands again youknow when doing these craft things ofcourse we can let a robot run oh I do itbut I think it's better you know if wework with our hands because then we getless alienated from what we are doingbut yeah they have hard time finding youknow new pupils that want to do this soit's important to get more classicalprojects built to increase demand andcreate like a search and an interestfor all these professions as they'reneeded also you know it's not only anarchitect that needs to bepeople we know different Craftsmen skilla ton of them a different course yeah Ithink uh you know this is where we seeanother parallel with economics I thinkthere's a very similar situation ineconomics there's this classicaleconomics which was dominant up untilthe early 20th century and then whenHumanity decided to basically do theequivalent of the sniffing glue which isgoing on Fiat money that economics wasreplaced by the insane nonsense that yousee today where you know the governmentsjust need to be printing money all thetime and everybody thinks that's a goodthing yeah they're they're saving thebanks thank God they're out there tosave us and nobody stops the questionwhy is it that we need to constantly beprinting money to save the banks whydoes the world need more money but wedon't need more money and it'simpossible to ask these questions inUniversity I was at the PHD program inColumbia University and when you askthis question of why should the moneysupply be increased in the first placewhy should there be a central bank outthere printing more money why can't wejust you know break the printer and havethe money that is existing there andthen we just use that and then its valuegoes up over time so people who save areable to buy more and more and that leadsto more capital accumulation leads tomore wealth leads to more economicgrowth leads to more investment leads tohigher productivity why would we notwant that that's the whole point ofEconomics that's just an impossiblequestion to answer people just look atyou like you're an alien they laugh theyrationalize it with stupid thoughtsubstitutes they learn at Universitywhere you know you just as you saidguilt by association also these areaustrians so they must be Nazis you knowforget the fact that mises was a Jew whofled Austria from the Nazis but he getscalled the Nazi anyway oh yes yes yeahbut so you know these kind of thoughtsubstitutes or it's just oh they'reextremists or it's it's it's old and itdoesn't work in the modern economy wehave a very fast economy that doesn'twork uh completely uh fallacious andeasy disprove arguments but they they'renot meant to be argued they're not meantto be thought about they're just meantto protect you from thinking about theimplications of what people arepresenting as different ideas but thealternative is thriving online just likeyou're saying with architectures as whatyou guys are doing it's just people arefinding you know what I do with mywebsite I left my university job I teacheconomics courses online and um you knowpeople from all over the world aretaking those courses because theyrealize there's something wrong with theeconomics that we took at University itdoesn't make a lot of sense what youtouch is something that's very you knowwhat's very acute in architecture andnow you you mentioned it that it's alsopart of Economics is that you knowthere's some kind ofidiotic thinking that you know thatequals man's technical progress withmass you know somehow spiritual progresswe are the same human beings as ahundred years ago we're exactly the samebut because you know all these peopleequal you know because we are moretechnical Advanced today we are somehowdifferent humans we are not we areexactly the same humans and with thisthinking you cannot learn from anythingthat was before you because how could welearn from these people that lived 100years ago they were more you knowprimitive than us they see you know theyequal technology with you know evenspiritual thinking or you know all kindsof thinking so yeah of course you cannotlearn from people that live before andlearn about you know basic inflationbecause now is new now is somehowdifferent we are somehow differentpeople than the ones that did before usnever mind that our behaviors areexactly the same never mind that you canmeasure our behaviors in the exact sameway you know with classic market economyand you know Supply and the mod and thenwhen it comes to money if you increaseSupply then it will not increase demandit will only lower the value of moneyso yeahI think it's I hate to go into so muchpolitics but I have to touch politics Ithink it's much of this is part of youknow the whole woke thinking that thepast is bad you cannot learn anythingfrom the past because in the pasteveryone was bigots and racists andsexist you what what you do is that youwe have an expression in Swedish youthrow out the baby with the bath waterso of course we should know we should weshould not wholeheartedly pickeverything from the past not everythingthe past was good but you keep the goodand the Eurovision that's how you knowyou must say oh that's how you learn butnow it's just a clear black witharchitecture a clear break with the pastbecause everything with the past was badand you're not allowed to read booksfrom the past it's dangerous because youthen you can get IDs that are dangerouseverything is dangerous it's really youknowyeah it's used too often but yeah 1984is really you know what I could think ofbecause the past is dangerous yeah andit's it's interesting how selectivelythis thing is applied so everything fromthe 19th century is bad except of courseyou know um semi-literate morons likeKarl Marx or uh that's uh that stuff isokay you know all of the all of thenasty things he said about black peopleand about Jewish people and about all ofthose racist things that he said justcompletely get washed away it's fine allof his sins are excused because yes it'sit's it's it's the high time preferenceideology of the present it's it's justthis idea that you don't need to doanything and Mark's basically neverworked never took care of himself neverwashed and uh so he's he let his winesupport him yeahand uh Engels was a rich man hesupported him as well and um he had aslave in his home who he didn't pay andhe got her pregnant and he covered upand he made angles pretend to be thefather of the child and two of hischildren died young from neglectbasically because he didn't care for hischildren uh this is uh that guy's okayto read that's one guy from the pastthat's okay to read today but you knowdon't go and read crazy stuff like howto make a building nice for peoplethat's too extremists or just readingabout you know classical economics andquestion why because it's also the samepeople as you know that forbid you fromlearning from the past they are veryauthoritarian in the way that they areyou knowexpert worship you know if someone is anexpert or label an expert we shouldslavely follow every instruction weshould obedient believe everything thatthat person say we should you know neverquestion we should remove our ownthinking our own judgment and we shouldblindly believe and what they miss isthat experts are humans and humans canerror and also that experts change theirminds and the third is that experts havelike all of humans have a politicalagenda so what experts believe alignvery much you know what their politicalbeliefs are so if you're uh right-wingcriminal Economist you will believe incertain things and if you are left witheconomists you'll believe in certainthings regardless of reality more orlessso one should never you know blindlyfollow X but today yeah the expert cultis stronger than ever I would say ohabsolutely and it's I think it's it'sit's a fundamental part of the FiatWorld in that uh everything in the Fiatworld and the way that I discuss it inthe Fiat standard is that essentiallyyou could think of Fiat as a softwareforum denying reality and trying to imposea reality by Fiat soum well the government has a moneyprinterso the government can't do anything andyou know that it's we're not too faraway from uh the point where somebody'sgonna say hey you know the governmentshould just make the day 12 hours everyday and just make Sunshine because wehave a money printer we can do it I meanthey're trying to fix the weather withprinting moneysurely they're gonna next you knowthey're going to want to fix the tilt ofthe earth next why not you know if wecan print money we can do whatever wewant there's an infinite amount ofresources that's that's the basic ideathat motivates everything and so becauseyou have this uh money printer that canprint everything on the one hand I thinkthese are the two dynamics of the FiatWorld on the one hand you can't save soyou are unable to provide for the futureso you start discounting the future soyou don't think of the future on theother hand the flip side of this coin isthat where are your savings going whycan't you save why does your money suckwhy does your money fall apart and loseits valuebecause all of that energy is beingharvested by the people who print themoney so those people have infinitepower people in government can't justdictate reality they can make realitywhat they want it to be and the way thatthey can do that is through moneyPrinting and so you have this you knowon the one hand We are Becoming HighTime preface we don't think about thefuture we don't prioritize for thefuture on the other handum we want to indulge ourselves becausewe have this uh completely Supernaturalpower you know Among Us which is themoney printer which can do whatever wewant and so we it's it's just a wishingwell you knowum hey we should not have six childrenso let's just print money and buildhospitals and then that should make sickchildren go away and then if uh sixchildren are still sick then clearly weneed to vote harder and build morehospital and you see it everywhere yousee it in terms of just the fact that wecan use this to Define reality so whatbecomes food is now defined bygovernment government issues yes uhdictate that tells people hey you shouldbe eating this and you should be eatingthat and you know as if humans had neverbeen able to eat before our governmentwas giving them out advice it's just acomplete infantilization of peoplebecause people lose the ability to thinklong term so they become like childrenand that you know it's just me me andthey become dependent exactlyyeah exactly so this this dependence isyou know the the Preposterous thing youknow you yeah I I know that you use theterm marry the state but it is really ismattering this stage you know in thehighest regard because people lose allthe initiativethey don't care about reality they onlycare what is perceived as elect told tothem what is reality because there issocial It's associated with high socialcosts it's a question you know realityand everything is grouped thinkingeverything is violent and everything'severything's hanging with a threat ofsocial exclusion if you question thingsit's a very scary society and and we aremoving there faster rather than onething you know and it's it's also sadyou know because what this tells youwhat is the future of democracy you knowcreated consent do we see it all thetime there is this meme on the internetyou know I support the current thingbut it really is you know you see peoplethey have uh how many how manycoronavirus uh shots they had they putit and now they put the crime flag ofcourse I support the crime and thedifference to 99 of people I've been toa crime also quite recently even but youknow they don't know anything it's justI support the current thing and thegovernment can lead them to look ateverything that they want and they willblindly follow they will neverquestioned and now it is Ukrainetomorrow before it was Corona now it isUkraine then tomorrow it would besomething else and no one ever questionsit just becomes one you know fanaticcult after another and if you questionyou are heretic and you should besocially ostracizedyes that's democracy is that the futureof democracyit's very scary when you think of it itis democracy I think people just havethis idea that democracy is justeverything nice is democracy and thenevery time they see something they don'tlike they think oh my God this can't bedemocracy but no that is democracydemocracy just means uh 50 plus one cando whatever they want so if 51 of acountry decide to murder 49 of thecountry that's democracy all all thegood things that people associate withdemocracy are essentially orthogonal todemocracy they're not related to whatthey are so they like liberal democracywhich means there's freedom of speechwhich means there's freedom of beliefall of these nice things rule of law allof those things none of that hasanything to do with democracy isspecifically which is 51 get their wayin fact I think if the 20th century hastaught us something I would arguedemocracy has been far less liberal thanmonarchies you look are all over theworld you see many examples of countriesthat are very similar culturallyreligiously ethnically and uh you knowone of them wasum kept their Monarch and then the otherone went down the path of democracy andRevolution and then of course it ends upwith despotism and authoritarianism andpeople just say oh well that's not realdemocracy and never mind the fact thatit always goes in that direction butthat's that's what it is and I think uhpeople mistake the advertising thatcomes with democracy which is all ofthese liberal ideals for democracy butreally if you are for Liberal ideas Idon't think The Ballot Box is the way toget them I think uh personally for methe most important technology fordemocracy for Libra for liberalism forfreedom for individual freedom andsovereignty and for living in acivilized society in which people get tobelieve what they want to think whatthey want is Bitcoin because it takesaway the money printer that's that'swhat it comes down to because if ifBitcoin becomes widely adopted as moneygovernments won't be able to print itthey won't be able to print their ownmoney and then we go back to the normalworld we go back to reality we have todeal with reality as it is and we can'tjust keep mandating Reality by Fiatbecause we have a money print yeah butare you connecting the Bitcoin to Gold'sDiner then yeah essentially uh the waythat I see it is basically Bitcoin isthe advanced form of gold in that theproblem with gold the reason the goldfailed effectively and the reason thatgovernments were able to replace it withtheir scam coins if you want these arethe Fiat money is because ultimatelygold needs to be moved aroundexpensively and therefore it's expensivebecause it's expensive to move it aroundit tends to centralize eventually youknow everywhere in the world gold flowedinto Banks and people started usingpieces of paper rather than the gold andthen they started using letters ofcredit and checks and all kinds ofdifferent instruments wherein you don'tactually physically move gold when youpay so uh you know in Sweden if you'retrying to buy something from England inthe late 19th centuryyou know you say you buy something forthree ounces of gold they're not goingto send three ounces of gold every timesomebody buys something from Sweden toEngland there's a bank in Sweden there'sa bank in England and at the end of theday or week or month or year they tallyup all the money that they were uhsending to one another and then theybalance the books they make one shipmentso at the end of the year you know wecross it all out and then there's oneshipment so effectively gold justbecomes centralized because of that andthen because it becomes centralizedif you manage to take over theinstitution where the gold iscentralized you take over all over theworld and that's effectively whathappened in the 20th century and Bitcoinbasically gets around that Bitcoin isdesigned specifically to get around thatbecause the whole point of bitcoin'sdesign you know a lot of people strugglewith understanding Bitcoin because theyget into the how without understandingthe why and if you look at the howwithout understanding why it's extremelyconfusing it's like walking into anextremely specific building if I were togive you an architecture metaphor andyou're trying to say why did they putall of these things here you know if youdon't know the purpose of the buildinglike this is supposed to be say astadium or uh so something very specificthen you won't none of it it would makesense like if you think of it as a housewhy would this house look like this andthen you understand oh this is servingthis specific function so in the case ofBitcoin in case of the architecture ofBitcoin the function that it serves isthe ability for you to hold your moneyand send it without anybody being ableto stop you from sending it withoutanybody being able to confiscate it andperhaps most importantly when withoutanybody being able to print more of itthat's the killer app of Bitcoin there'sonly ever going to be 21 million Bitcoinand sothat for me is bringing back theproperty of gold that made gold moneywhich is the fact that you can't makemore of it but improving on it becausewith gold every year you make one or twopercent Bitcoin you currently makearound one or two percent but it's goingto go down eventually and it's going todrop to about zero percent and the otheraspect which is even more importantfunctionally is that you can makemillions of transactions on bitcoindaily without having to go through acentral bank and that I think isenormously uh powerful I think it's it'swhy it's going to be much more difficultfor uh governments to capture Bitcoinlike gold and that's why I think it'sit's a truly truly world-changingtechnology it's it's uh it's up therewith the printing press and the internetand writing in that if it takes away thegovernment's money printers it's goingto make the world a very very differentstuff honestly I need to read of coursemore about this but it sounds beautifulbecause centralization of power is aproblem because power always want togrow of course I mentioned examples as Ican relate to because I live in Europewe have the problem with the EuropeanUnion that it always want to growbecause once they got power the powerwas to centralize more grow more becauseall they are bureaucrats of course wantmore power they want more staff theywant more things to say about so at thecentralization you knowis you know like a like a account removeso if this means the centralization thenyou know I'm all for it becauseconcentration of power is always bad andwe we see it in so many fields whenwe're talking about democracy andfreedom now we have you knowconcentration of search engine thereused to be many search engines now wedon't even say you search on theinternet we say Google so so Googlebasically has what is 90 except forChina I think you know Google is 90 ofthe market so Google doesn't need to lieGoogle just decide what we see when wesearch and you and me and 99 of otherpeople will click on the three mostimportant you know links uh the threefirst you know search results we willclick on so we have enormousconcentrations of power yes so if thismeans decentralization I'm all for itreally really all for it and that's away to save democracy as well well maybewe'll disagree on that one for me it'sthe way to free us from democracy infact one of my more controversial ideasand I have a lot of controversial ideasbut one of them is that Bitcoin is gonnabring back monarchies because I thinkmonarchies are the only governments thatare able to uh think of the long termthat are able to plan for the long termand think about the long term I think wecan get to a point where you know thegovernments that are run by democraciesare going to be in uh constantlyprioritizing the present so constantlygoing toward inflation and they're goingto not prioritize holding Bitcoin forthe long term and so if their financialsituation is going to disintegratewhereas I think monarchies which youknow have been in power for hundreds ofyears the only reason they managed tostay in power for hundreds of years isobviously they're doing something rightand that right thing that they're doingis you know thinking about the long termthinking about how to make Societybetter for the long term so I think itmight not be a solution for uh democracyor it is a solution one way or the otherone don't worry about provocationalideas I'm full of them and I I'm notbroke so I can listen to all kindsroyalties I have no problem with thatand also you live in a monarchy youbenefit from being in a monarchy Ibenefit from living in a monarchy I canagree that monarchy has its advantagesand I will tell you one because I youknow my main interest is socialanthropology and when it comes tocountries especially multi ethnic oneyou cannot have you know modern daynation states and nationalism you need aunifying figureso either it will be a very strongreligious Society where religion will bethe common determinator you know unitingdifferent peoples or there will be amonarch in the case of Europe you knowbefore World War one it was the Monarchthat unified you know Empires thatconsist of of many different peoples andyou have it even you know today and thenthe other parts of world we have youknow the case of Iran Iran is a verymulti-ethnic State the only thing thatcan keep it together is either mark theShah or as now you know an Ayatollahbecause you cannot appeal to you knowdemocracy or nationalism it won't workthere because then it will you know betorn down in you know ethnic ethnicconflict so you need like a unifyingfigure and a monarch as you know eitherMonaco or amullahabsolutely absolutely and I think uh youknow to look around the Middle East uhuh on another argument I make is uh youknow you look around today in fact veryfew people like to make this observationbut the starkness particularly in Arabcountries the Stark difference todaybetween the fate of countries thatstayed as monarchies versus countriesthat became Republic is absolutelyastonishing yeah just inflation on itsown I I did a comparison between the uhexchange rate of these of Arab countriesover the past 50 years compared to theUS dollars and it's amazing all of themonarchies had lower inflation than allof the republics it's just clear-cutlike you look at all of the devaluationall of them all of the monarchies I hadvery little devaluation compared to thedollar and all of the republicsdestroyed their currency and you'retalking about very similar countries youknow you're talking about Syria andJordan Morocco and Algeria these arevery similar countries in many many waysand yeah I think one was monarchy andwhat was Republic yes so it's uh yeah uhyeahyeah it was mentioned long-term thinkingbetween short-term you know popularitygains so yeah well we're drifting away alittle bit from architecture but I wantto get back to that because that's whywe've got you here and I want to getmore of your knowledge so you didmention that classical is beauty but Ithink there is a misconception here thatit is Beauty for the sake of beauty sakethat is almost like ornamentation andthis is kind of where some of thecriticism of classical architecture andsome of the defense of modernistarchitecture might seem to make a lot ofsense and I think this is kind of how Ithought of it up to a point which islook yeah it looks nice but you knowback in the back in the day they umwe're building for nice things now welive in a more rational world and sowe're building for function and so yeahit would be nice if say um old Torontoor old Stockholm if today's Stockholmwas all like the old Stockholm or uhToronto but it would mean a lot fewerpeople being in the same area whichmeans a smaller city which means smalleropportunity for economic development andeconomic growth and so these cans ofsardines of buildings that have peoplein tiny little apartments they may notbe very nice for the architectural snobslike you but you know they make a lot ofpeople able to live in that City andthey mean a lot more vigorous labormarket I guess and I like I'm trying toremember what this name was but therewas a French Economist and architect whospoke about cities essentially beinglabor markets and the reason that a cityis such a powerful place is that if youhave five million people in one placethen you've got enormous opportunitiesas a worker and you can specialize andthe bigger the population that can fitinto a small area the more the economiesof scale in the production of everythingand so that's why cities are thePioneers in Industry technology andculture and everything it's because wecan fit a lot of people together and sothe magic happens so what is yourresponse to that so you know okay maybeit'smany classical responses and it's a verygood question first of all it's veryreductive view of classical architecturethat you know everything is just youknow Beauty because it's nice it's youknow it's reducing it to just a matterof style not an architecture philosophyyou know all these stylistic elementsthey bear value to us they are part ofwho we are you know they are referencesto the Past you know yes to the GreekAroma past and also to mythologydifferent aspects of our culture andthey fuse the old with the new so youhave you know in a tech ornamentationyou have things that we know the highhopes of the 30s in the 30s there wasdepression so they had high hopes of thecombustion engine you know of airplanesand such would bring wealth for you andpeace to humanity okay it didn't endthat way but but at least that's howthey you know they decorated theirbuildings because you know they use bothclassical stylistic motifs and these newones you know the new holes for forsociety so it's it's basic culture thenwhen it comes to to to building high andand you know pack as many people aspossiblethat's also a very reductive view ofwhat it means to be human beingand it has been done with the disastrousresults you know there's a lot of newsnow you know China and South Koreahaving you know record low birth ratesand they are met and they're you knowthere's you know most developedcountries have you know belowreplacement fertility but there's youknow grades in hell and when it comes toChina and South Korea it really isabdominal and that's because you knowthey Jam pack all these people in 40story high-risesand they are not good ways for peopleyou know to learn to get to know theirneighbors they are not good you know toget connected to the street and they'rein in such case also they lead to moredepression and they depress fertilityratesso it's very short term you know it'slike like a combustion engine you knowyou throw in in in coal and you have nonew code left it always constantly neednew code but what happens when we runout of code then we have nothing youknow to fuel this economy with andthat's what's happened now in in Chinaand South Korea you build this highrises and you sterilize the whole ofsociety then also you don't need highrises to create density and density alsothere's no thing that you know the moredensity the better that's that's not thecase there is you know there can be toolow density but there can also be tohigh density Cairo is not you knowpreferable Human Habitatso what you want is is good densitylevel density and the better you makethe city the more beautiful they makethe city the more interesting to makethe city The Greener you make the citythe higher the density and of coursetraditional Virtues Of course you knowlike the rule of law production crimethe more density you can have in a cityand you can achieve this very excellentdensity with maximum six-story buildingsyou don't need tall Skype Shapers themost important thing to achieve gooddensity is a good grid so they often useParis as an example but you can useParis you can use Barcelona you can usedowntown stock or you can use Berlinthey have all very good densities verylivable densities and high densitieswithout having skyscrapers mostbuildings are six stores tall they areyou know concentrated around a chordchart and then this coach on everycitizen has you know every resident ofthis block has like a private callIsland you know in the bustling Cityit's a very very livable and very veryhuman form of urbanity and of densityand something that we should developwhen you create you know make evenbetterso you don't need high resin for densityof course it's easier for a developer tobuild a high rise than to build aquarter block you know it's it's onestructure and you make it high you knowit's easy but it's not good for societyand it's not good for economy becausethe economic aspect is also important toaddress when you build this high-riseplaces you get a concentration of theeconomy to malls to shopping malls thatmeans that small firms you know ifyou're outside the small you will get novisitors because people will you knowmaybe just walk the mall and everythingthey will need they will find therethey'll drive through and walk around inthemso only the big farms will have themoney you know because there are onlyone prime location on the big first theywill crowd out all the small farmsbecause they can be there and that's badfor economic activity and economicdevelopment because you know to create abig firm you begin as a small firm ifyou have the classical city with theclassical trade like Paris likestore.com you get a more even spreadin the you know in the city like itcompared to a high-rise City so you getmany many millionsof good addresses and good places andgood locations and you get veryinteresting mix of plots and some plotsare not interesting for a big firm likea small Corner plot but that's maybeexcellent for a small store like a whatyou call it in English you know Mom andPop stores and if this has somethinggood to offer you know people willnaturally pass it by by coincidencebecause there's not one Center there aremany centers the whole city center is acenter people will naturally pass it bysome will look at the store when theysay oh this is interesting you know mostconsumptionists we don't know everythingwe want but when we walk byand we see something we will know if wewant it or not so so it's very muchdependent on on chance and you know thatthe classical grid creates so many youknow opportunities and chances for usyou know to be exposed to new thingsso we're exposed to this and if thischange change if this store goes wellit can grow to a big business and thenit will become a new change so for youknow for the economic you know the theeconomic destruction and creation a goodgrid a good classical grid instead ofshopping mall culture is is excellentyou know it's an excellent ground fornew businesses to developand also just for small small businessesto thrive maybe not every you know smallbusiness store will have the have thegoal of becoming you know a big chainmaybe they just want to go around maybethey like you know their personal takewith their clients and the clients likethem as wellmaybe just a way of living and now theyhave the possibility because they willnaturally get customers you knowpasserbys so that's my yeah you know onboth density and you know the wholeUrban form you know not high rises highrises are bad for so many things youknow every social study points out thathire us so bad kids that live in highrises are outdoor much lessand especially now you know with thesmartphones and PlayStations it'sextremely important you know to to makeit be more outside also it alienatespeople there are no too many people in ahigh rise so people don't it gets youknow Anonymous people are alienated fromNeighbors you knew very very much fewerpeople in a high rise than you do in ouroutside low rise set so it's it's badfor our social sociality and it's badfor us as human and as in the case youknow they did studies I mentionedfertilities previously but they made astudy now in the U.S you know the numberof kids you have depending on thedwelling that you live in of course theyhaven't discussed you know thisdiscussion of this correlation but whatthey found out was that you know themore units per buildingthere is a correlation especially afterI think after four or five or six unitsper buildingthe lower the fertility rates getsand of course there's both causation andcorrelation and which one is thestrongest I don't knowbut it just feels initiatively it feelsvery true when you see you know thefertility rates of all these mega citiesthat is popping up in the worldespecially East Asian ones yeah no Ithink I mean I asked the question but Ithink I have also my my own you whichkind of agrees with you and I think umyou know one important Point here isum that people look at the big buildingand they think well look you know that's80 floors and that fits uh 500Apartments and that can fit a lot morethan what you would fit in this onebuilding like the the the footprint ofthat building would fit say 15 houses ifyou built up to two floors or six floorsor something like that but if you get to80 floors you can fit 10 times that butwhat they don't see is that those peoplearen't going to spend all their lifestuck in their little apartment althoughwho knows you know the way things aregoing with lockdowns and the great resetmaybe that's uh that is the future butuntil now you know we still have theability to leave our homes and we canstill afford cars and gasoline or atleast many people canand so the real these people need to goto work these people need to go out needto uh go to activities and so the resultis you know at the end you have a bigmovement every morning at 9am everybodyneeds to leave all these giant Towerswhere they live to go into the giantTowers where they work and that requiresan enormous amount of roads and that iswhat eats up the street density and soyou were mentioning the example ofStockholm in Barcelona their populationdensity is higher than the populationdensity of New York they don't have thesame skyscrapers that New York has butthey don't have as many roads as NewYork has and so you end up fitting morepeople into a smaller piece of land intothe same piece of land into the samesquare kilometer per se let's say andthese people aren't stuck in giantApartments where they just you know youyou don't get to see others yourapartments are locked off from oneanother you don't get to walk aroundthere are no streets I think this isreally the biggest problem in the US uhin in the cities of the US is there's nopenis Austrian culture in most citiesmost areas of both cities because it'sall buildings and then there's all theseroads that you need where to get aroundand so as a result of this people end upwith actually pretty low density andbecause of the traffic which isessentially a problem that people alwaysthink they can solve but it is anunsolvable problems you can't have theentire town decide to go somewhere at9am everybody needs to leave and be intheir office at 9am and you basicallyneed to tear down the half the town andturn it into roads at 9am so thateverybody can go in quickly and then getit back together and that's justobviously impossible but but the reasonisyou need roads for all of thesebuildings and that just ends up takingup more and more space and ends upturning the city into isolated Islandsevery little block is basically anisland surrounded by highways and verybig streets that have a lot of cars andtrucks and basically makes the distancemuch larger in fact defeating the entirepoint of the city making the commutetake longer and so therefore defeatingthe entire point to the city the wholepoint was that you wanted to be close topeople so I think yeah you can get moredensity in a place like Stockholm andBarcelona precisely because you don'thave these large structuresthat require these massive roads so alot of people walk to work a lot ofpeople uh as you said you know havethose little small mom and pop shopsinterestingly enough you know as withthe architecture also in terms of UrbanDesign This is where people like to gofor their vacations this is where peoplelike to travel you know people go toFlorence and see the beauty of Florenceand post pictures of Florence a lot morethan they go to your average modernskyscraper City I mean there's a noveltyaspect if you've been to if you've neverbeen to Dubai yeah it is actually sortof breathtaking when you see yeah yeahit's cool you know it's an adjectivethat you know the only adjective you canuse for modernism is that you know it'sit looks coolbut you know that this attribute agedvery badly you know both with clothesand with architecture the you know thatbut cool age badly so yeah I can agreeit looks cool and it looks cool from adistance when you sit in your car inDubai and you look at all theskyscrapers for distance it looks coolbut on a ground level is it that cool isit that nice is it nice you know to walkaround with it I haven't been to Dubaibut I I would you know doubt it myexperience with skyscraper is alwaysthat they look cool from a distance andthen you get close to it and then it'sjust a big sterile Plaza in front ofthem there's nothing interesting there'snothing you know there's nothinginteresting happening on ground left andyeah there is a there is a big problemwith with urbanism in the U.S there is abig problem with urbanized in Europe aswell our problem is that we don't buildnew classical neighborhoods so yeahwe're getting extreme High concentrationnow in our downtowns everything you knowthat they everything is hyper gentrifiedas well there is live in downtownStockholm there is no normal people nowin downtown Stockholm everyone is in ourupper middle income and it gets morecrazy crazy because you don't build newclassical labels what is you knowdefined as the city can of course expandyou just add new neighborhoods like youknow how the old neighbors came to be atonce but because we don't build newneighborhoods the classical ones thatexist get overpriced and then there'scomplaint about gentrification and youknow it also becomes a clarification ina way that as you mentionedpeople want to recreate in the beautifulplaces see people don't recreate in thesuburbs of Stockholm they go to downtownso we're like four times as many peopleas we were 100 years ago but downtownhasn't changed in size so so it's it'sgetting you know crazy and crazyespecially yes rush hour is also hellingin Stockholm because there are so manypeople you know crowding everywherebecause downtown we're not allowed togrowand you mentioned also this abouttourism which also makes everything soabsurd because every tour sport in everycity in the world seem to understandwhat people likeyou know I was in Ottawa I was in Ottawain January and lovely people but thecity is a catastrophe it's so ugly it'sso ugly and it's so alienating but whenyou look and Moses you know more theybuild a lot of strange ugly modernistTowers now in Central Ottawa they reallydestroyed the city but if you look atthe you know the the movie of the tourswould visit Ottawa you will hardly seeanimal in these buildings they will showthe Parliament and they will show youknow some remnants of like a classicalMarket they have in Ottawa and then theyshow inside of some museumsit's like okay if this is Ottawa and ifyou do look at visit stop call or visitOslo visit uh Berlin visit London itwill always be the same thing they sawthe classical buildings and almost neveror a minority of what they show will bemodernist buildings so then if theyyou know build it cannot be thatsubjective if everyone knows what isbeautiful and what is ugly absolutelythis is this is the remarkable thinglike you see this um tourists localsforeigners people from all over theworld when they go to these citiesthey know where to go and look for theplaces they want to take their photosyes they take their pictures in the nicethose nice places and it's uhum and it's cross-cultural it'scross-cultural you know when people fromall of from Asia go to Europe these arethe parts that they like but also whenpeople from Europe go to Asia these arealso the parties they likeand this is I've discussed you knowbecause we have of course idiots in inall places where videos in Stockholmthat oh we must build high rises and Iasked him you know thinking about youknow because well now we are so you knowpostmodern we should think about ourGlobal brand and never mind you know ifwe stock Commerce don't like you knowhiring so that's one thing but you canconvince people at least with you knowtalking about the global brand if youcome from the US or from Asiado you want to see a skyscraper city isthat what you came for when you came toEurope no you want to see you know thebeautiful tour of the Century Citythat's our brand not you know high risesthat they have more of where they camefrom that are also probably taller andmore impressing than the ones they cometo see here so if one should care aboutour once Global brand what makesbusiness attractive what makes peopleattracted to a certain place that iswhat makes this place special and justbuilding your new high rises inStockholm because we must have itbecause everyone else have it it justyou know bad bad in in economic senseyeah it's bad in economic sense and Ithink another major point which I wasgetting at earlier and then I gotdiverted talking about something else isremember when we were talking about theum destruction and demolition of old uhbuildings to replace them with new onesI think perhaps a driver of that is thefact that governments are the onesbuilding it and for you and me as peoplewho live in the city and you know let'ssay you live in Stockholm forgenerations and you're gonna you hope tothat your children and their childrenwill live there for Generations what youwant from a cityis different from the you know your Calyour cost benefit analysis of whether weshould tear this thing down is differentfrom the cost benefit analysis of agovernment official who has access to amoney printer because in his case if wekeep the old beautiful Town Hall whichyou know the tourist gloves and thelocals love and it doesn't cost a lot torenovate that means I don't get to printmoney but if I say hey you know the oldtown hall it's old and it's not cool andwe need to get our city into the 20th or21st century and we need to keep up withthe competitors look at the city downthe river they built a new uh fancyTower why don't we build a new moderncity hall that you know allows us tohave all the modern things that we needfor a modern city hall you know as ifyou can't put a computer into an oldbuilding but you know that becomes a lotmore uh appealing as a logic for you ifyou have access to a money printerbecause then you're just looking for anexcuse to use the money printer andtearing down the old town hall andreplacing it with the new one is a greatexcuse so you get to decide okay well weare going to tear down the old city halland we're going to build a new one nowyou get to decide who gets the contractyeah exactly take all of the money youget to become king maker basically allthe biggest construction companies intown want to be your friend and they'regoing to contribute to your campaign andI think a big part of the drivers ofthose things the reason that we investin those things is becausedestroying the money taking the moneyout of the hands of the free markettaking the money out of people's uhhands and taking the value of money outof people's savingsresults in transferring that money tobureaucrats and bureaucrats have a hightime preference and an incentive tosatisfy themselves now you know for I'monly going to be mayor of Stockholm forfive years and during those five years Iwant to make as many favors as I can toas many rich and powerful people in thecountry and I'm going to try and abusethe money printer and abuse Governmentfunding as much as I can by coming upwith all these reasons for why thegovernment needs to give us more andmore money and then I become aconsultant for all these companies thatI made famous for so exactly so whatworks for you because of Fiat money as abureaucrat does not necessarily work forthe citizens of the city this is anincentive problem there incentiveprobably is very good because that's youknow one strategy to get things right tocreate the right incentives so then youknow you should make it so theincentives work in the favor of thecitizens and if you know if Bitcoin doesthat then I'm all for it I I I haveheard you know to to comment it you knowbecause I know of Bitcoin of course andI read some about Bitcoin but I'm notinto it I'm what you would say AverageJoe you have a special knowledge aboutBitcoin as much as I have spelled as thespecial knowledge about you knowarchitecture that and you know modernistideology and such and it'sit what it does is highlights actuallyone of the problems with the modernworld is that everything is so complexso we rely on the experts all the timeoh they know better and I have I as longas it you know works I don't invest timein itbecause investing time yes takes awayyou know from from my daily lifeso so yeah you always sit inhighlighting another problem andwhatever you know time preferences youknow taking time because they what youare doing is a more or less a revolutionand making people like me taking thetime to learn more about it that's thehard part I would sayto make me move yeah from you know theestablished routine I put my money inyou know regular yeah yeah although I'llI'll tell you this I mean I wrote a bookabout Bitcoin and constantly talkingabout Bitcoin and have a podcast onbitcoin but I don't think of myself asan evangelist for Bitcoin I'm not outthere to try and convert people I dothis as a job I used to be a universityprofessor and I started uh you know Iwrite about economics and then I got Istudied Bitcoin I became good at writingabout it and now I do it as a job butI'm not the sort of person who's goingout there trying to convince people toget into Bitcoin because I think on theone hand you know if Bitcoin needed meto go around preaching then uh it'sprobably doomed and it's probably notworth my time and secondly the realmarketing the real heavy lifting forBitcoin marketing is not done by me it'sdone by bitcoin's price and it's done bythe value of Fiat money so it's as youmay notice your monetary system is notworking very well yesterday was uh aSunday in which all of the central banksgot together and decided to issue astatement saying everything is finewhich historically you knowthese Sunday night statements are a veryvery good red flag to suggest thatthings are not fine so you know more andmore people are witnessing their wealthevaporate in banks in bonds and inSaving accounts and all that stuff andthey're beginning to ask questions and Ithink that's what's going to do theheavy lifting for Bitcoin and I thinkyou know realistically though you yeahyou're not an expert in Bitcoin youhaven't studied how it works but you'realso not an expert of Fiat money andI've written a book on Fiat money andBitcoin and I will tell you Fiat moneyis a lot more complicated Bitcoin issoftware at the end of the day like youcan you can audit the thing all the waydown you can go over it you can seeeverything about how it workstry and do the same thing with theSwedish Central Banksee how they work you know just walkinto their building one day I'm gonnaguess they've moved to a modernisteyesore no are they still in there ohyeah they moved to a modernist I sawthey did yeah of course what theydeserve to yeah they deserve to yeahthey deserve to serve a nice buildingand the square where they are situatedit used to be such a beautiful Squareit's one of the most beautiful squaresin Stockholm and they tore everythingdown and they built this brutalisthorrible buildings and today of courseit's totally dead square and there usedto be of course prostitutes there nowthey cleared away the prostitutes butit's still not uh you know it's not alive Square because everything is sougly around it well the arguably notclear the way the prostitutes entirelythey just replaced them with differentkindsuh but yeah I mean I think it's a muchmore complicated and sophisticatedsystem there in that all these reallyweird ways of operating and that you'renot supposed to know about and theyopenly say that it is our job to manageexpectations and to tell people thingsso that we can raise their confidenceabout them it's it's ridiculous Voodooyou are not allowed to questionsyeah you're not allowed to question youknow you don't get to vote and it's notclear if it's a government agency or ifit's a private entity but you knowwhat's clear is that it's none of yourbusiness and you just take the money anduse it and do what they tell you andthank them uh but I think that's clearlynot working and Bitcoin is just analternative so Bitcoin uh you knowwithout getting too deep into how itworks under the hood ultimately it'sjust out there it's just like uh theEuro and the dollar and the the Kroner Ithink it's called in Sweden is that whatis your money yeah it's just another oneof these currencies it works differentlyunder the hood from all of them but overtime I think what's gonna win uh for thereason Bitcoin wins is not because ofpeople preaching it it's because it'sit's better technology you know the thethe the steam engine did not win becauseit had good marketing at one becauseit's a lot more productive than theAlternatives and that's how classicalwins as well especially now you knowbecause we have a more or less everyWestern Country relies on anyimmigration for population growth assoon as you have you know decliningpopulation uh like I had in Berlin andsome German cities then it's not fun fordevelopers to build modernism then theystart building classical because ifpeople should you know if there's anabundance of apartments that of courseyou know they will choose the morebeautiful ones we saw this in Sweden inthe 90s and we will see this much moreyou know in in the future when you knowclassical would be clearly The Profitmaximizing for the developers well itwill win yeah I think so too and I thinkmy optimism when it comes to bitcoin isthat it undermines the deeper incentiveseconomically that lead us toward thisplace and that take away the city mayorwith access to the government moneyprinter being able to decide let's teardown this beautiful Square to build anew modernist thing take away that guytake away his his money printer andsuddenly the people who become mayor aregoing to become a lot more reasonableabout what they have as ideas you knowand the new buildings that are going tobe built are not going to be built withthe perspective of hey let's getsomething flashy so that we get featuredin magazines and CNN does a featureabout how this building has a part of itthat goes around yeahthe novelty aspect of it you mentionedthis at the beginning and I I think it'sit's a very astute observation thatmodern Architects make buildings to winAwards they don't live in them this isthis novelty idea that you know we makethis building and then we win an awardnext year for the most creative buildingin our city or in our country orwhatever but then what about the suckersthat have to live in the place for 30years you know that that that award doesnot go to make you have a nice uh that'sthe crazy part you know the only thingthe only attribute that matters you knowfor for for modernists is when theybuild new today is that their buildingis described as new thinking you know itdoesn't matter no one will care if it'sgood or any other qualities it's justthat it's new it's described as new it'sgroundbreaking is this groundbreakinggood doesn't matter they Twisted thebuilding in a certain way with a CADprogram so now it's new no one has everdone it before but was it necessary wasit good doesn't matter you win prizes bycreating this crazy new because thatthen that's the highest you knowattribute that's the greatest thing youcan have with a building in their senseof you yeah and it's it's remarkable whythat would be something that you wouldwant in your house I mean I get you'dwant something fancy and new in a gadgetthat you get like in your smartphonemaybe even in your car yeah you I knowyou get a special car particularly for asecond car let's say you know you have afamily car but you also get like asports car and yeah it's Innovative it'sgroundbreaking it has an engine thatdoes things that are different it canaccelerate and yeah there's value Iguess in mechanical and inelectronic devices for novelty and forfashion items but a home is a lot morefunctional you want something that worksyou want something that allows you tohave a good life it's it's a and it's ait's athere are many aspects of this and Ithink one one great way for me tounderstand why the classical traditionis important is that it's like withconservatives ideas in general it's notthat they're good just because they'reold because everything old is betterthan everything that's new it's goodbecause it's old and it has survived thefact that it has survived for very longsuggests that there's something therethe fact that it survived centuries andMillennia in fact of people building youknow the the column style there's areason why that's so popular so manyplaces all over the world people buildwith it and it's because it's it it it'sfunctional it's not just beautiful it'sbeautiful to look at but it's beautifulbecause it is functional and I think thefunction aspect we haven't touched butit's a good attention because now webuild a lot of buildings in wet areaslike Sweden with flat roofswhy would you do that that's so stupidthat's inviting you know leakage so okayI shouldn't maybe I shouldn't say thisbut you know my the company I work forwe built a new storage facility and theymade a flat proof and what happened wehave lots of snow and rain so there'sleakage because you know usually intraditionally Sweden you build you knowslow proof so the water you know can rundown I was told you know because I sawan interview with that with a architectthat I know a classical architect hemade an interview about you knowNorwegian vernacular in Bergen in thecity it's a city in Norway where itrains a lot so on the traditional housesthey have they are a bit sloped theirfacades are a bit sloped inwards so thatyou know that when the water runs itwill only damage the lower part of thebuilding and of the upper part of thebuildings you only need to you know whenyou do Renovations it's motor focus onthe bottom floor now with you knowmodernist buildings they are there areno slopes the fossil is straight so youget damage on the entire facade sofunctionality wiseit's also you know all these Traditionsall these Hub buildings look of coursethere is a beauty aspect but there isalso a function time tested functionalaspect and if you throw that out you getproblems that shouldn't you know theyshouldn't exist another you know veryvery good example is when it comes tothe Middle East it's hot in the summerso what they did you know if you have acity like like Tel Aviv that's yeah apopular tourist destination now what theBritish did is that they made theboulevard end up in the sea and they hadclear way to the Sea so that the oceanbreezeshould you know flow through into theCity and cool it down that was you knownatural Cooling in a very very hot placewhat did the models do with the 60s theyblocked all these you know all theseboulevards with Hotel buildings so thecity got a lot lot hotter and you cansee this probably in in a million placesin the Middle East and everywhere yeahit's exactly the same in uh downtownBeirut if you walk in downtown Bay wasreally beautiful it got destroyed in thewar but it was rebuilt in uh it wasn'tso much rebuilt it was renovated thebuildings were still standing mostlythere was no I mean there was some butlike a lot of the buildings survivedthere was bullet holes rather than umyou know destructive air shelling thatdestroyed it and so you walk around indowntown Beirut and yeah you don't feelvery hot the buildings are two threestories high and the way that thestreets are shaped next to the Seabrings in the breeze so you don't feelvery hot you go to the parts of the townthat were built modern you know allthese uh fancy long big buildings andthen everything is a lot hotter thereyou don't get the breeze and it's withinthe buildings of course you need airconditioning and so that just becomesenormously more expensive because infact you could actually live uh for avery long time in Beirut and it wasmanageable during this somewhere eveninto during the heat becausethe architecture was made in such a waythat was uh very it used you know thenatural image you use the ocean breezefor Googling this is you know if we goback to what we spoke about you knowlike environment and ecology airconditioning is consuming a lot ofelectricity and contributing to climatechange so why not use these traditionaltechniques of you know city planning tolower the need you're not eliminate theneed for for air conditioning but youcan definitely lower it by using allthese traditional techniques in Iranthey have a very interesting techniquethey probably have it in the Gulf aswell with using with these wind towerswhere they don't have a Sea Breeze theybuild wind towers that you know collectyou know the the wind and flows it downnaturally in the in the building thuscooling it down so so there are so manyyou know old techniques that we can useto lower you know our energy consumptionand we should understand that we canlearn from people that lived in the pastthey have wisdom and knowledge and weshould even admire them because theybuilt all these magical places that westill can't you know replicate todaydespite being more technologicallyadvanced yeah I think a a great quotehere uh from a guy named from an authornamed Donald Kingsbury I'm not familiarwith the author but I've heard the quoteand it stuck with me it says traditionis a set of solutions for which we haveforgotten the problems throw away thesolution and you get the problem backyes sometimes the problem has mutated ordisappearedbut often it is still there as strong asit ever was I think that's a very verypowerful uh argument and I think it'sit's true in architecture it's true inall kinds of different things so youlook at an old classical building andyou think wow look at all that spacethat's wasted on those columns who needsthose columns you'd rather use that forbigger bedrooms you'd rather use thatfor more apartments and then you do thatand you realize I mean and you'rethinking here you know the the thinkingof the modernist is look we're coming upwith the more efficient way to do itlet's put more apartments in it'll makeeach apartment cheaper it'll make thehouse more affordable butum as we said you know the the problemsthat that tradition was there to solvearen't going to go away and I thinkthat's that's extremely extremely trueand it's sad how how much of thoseTraditions are being forgotten yeah soin in many of those places people arejust um yeah it's sad you like you lookat the cities of the world you look atthe Modern buildings you can't tellwhere a building is you look at abuilding it could be Dubai it could bein Stockholm it could be in uh Rio deJaneiro it could be yeahwithout the identity just reducing everyperson on the planet to a globalconsumer you know everything is what itmeans to be human is reduced to you knowexchangeable consumer yeah and and likeeven if you were for that kind of hyperconsumerism of on a purely economiclevel say you were happy to be eatingMcDonald's and everybody else in theworld eats McDonald's but everybody caneat McDonald's because we all have thesame biology but we we don't have thesame geography and so our buildingscan't all be McDonald's because it'sdifferent to the people in Stockholmneed a different building from thepeople in Dubai and you can make themsimilar if you put a lot of money onHeating and Cooling but you can alsodesign them in a traditional way thatwould probably suit the needs of thepeople in those places a lot more yeahyeah exactly I'm reminded of the work ofJane Jacobs are you familiar with herI'm sure you must be right yes yes she'svery much worth it in Europe but it'sthe circus I know so yeah she's she'sshe's done pretty uh work that wouldmany people would call a hayekian Idon't think she references Hayek andspeaks of Austrian economists but herwork is very much in that tradition andthat you know she looks in particularshe looks at New York City and RobertMoses I think whose name was thearchitect who was yeah he had theplanner of the 60s that just cut throughall the all the old Fabric and builtmotorways exactly and that was the ideayou know we're just gonna do this modmodern city and it ended up destroyingall these amazing neighborhoods wherepeople had lived for decades and I thinkyou know the the the fascinating thingto go to talk about the unintendedproblems that emerged from this is wellwhen you've you've done the moreefficient thing of let's take all these100 little houses and put them into onebig building and then we'll haveeverything more efficient well nowyou've got all these high rises and allthese affordable housing buildings andyou've lost the community you've lostwhat she calls the eyes on the streetthe fact that you had a community youhad all these people living togethereverybody knew everybodymulti-generational friendships andfamilies and relationships and peoplewere intermarried and so everybody hadan incentive to behave well because eyeswere around you all the time and peopledon't forget so you know you dosomething stupidyou're they're not going to let youmarry their daughter your the neighborsknow that you're the guy who does thestupid things we're not going to let youmarry our daughter and so people had anincentive to behave now you take all ofthat everybody's in their Matchboxapartmentthey're alienated from everyone else andAnonymous also yeah and then when youwhen you go when you go into the fieldin the area outside the park there'snobody because there's nothing to do sovery few people know who you are and youcan get away with a lot more and that'sa big factor in the crime increase thatyou see with modernization of cities andthat's what we see you know I mentionedChina earlier you know and theirprogress you know with the high risesbecause as you mentioned you know in thein the hotel environment in China in thetraditional Chinese cities people eventheir neighbors you know they were bothsocial control but they were also youknow if an old person was alone peoplehelped that person you know with food ifyou needed you know daycare for yourchildren you just ask the neighbor nowpeople are you know have been pushed in40 stories higher this is no one knowsanyone everything is alienated you haveno connections and people can die aloneso yeah what are you know is there whatprogress you know we were promisedprogress but instead we got problems wedidn't have before yeah absolutely and Ithink it's it it's very sad how uhpeople have internalized the idea thatthese problems are just the price thatwe have to pay for Progress that youknow it's a lot of people just thinkit's it's a normal part of living in acity that you know your car is going toget uh carjacked and you might getkilled and there's be violence you mightget mugged but hey you're living in acity that's the price you have to payfor having a variety of cuisines in yourcity and that's the price you have topay for being in a vibrant labor marketbut that's not the case in fact it's theexact opposite the whole point of citieswas that it allows us to be civilizedand we can live next to each other andthe more urbanized humans became theless crime and the less violence uhgenerally existed yes until recently itcan it can be you mentioned New York andit's easy to compare it you know therewas a major blackout in New York in theearly 60s and then there was a one inthe middle of the 70s these were justlike 15 years apart but what adifference you know the blackout in NewYork in the early 60s it was a calmAffair it was before you know thehighways and everything so there werecommunities there were no rioting therewere no looting people were calm andjust walked around and you know andalmost enjoyed themselves you know thespectacular view that all the city wasdark then 15 years later in the 70swhere everything had fallen apart therewere motorways there were no flight fromthe cities there was looting they wereburning buildings there were skyroadingcrimes there were Burgers there wererapes everything you know so so whatwhat a difference you knowthis can be you know when you have acommunity and when you have atomized thecity and it was such a short time Ithink this documentary now that wherethey compare the blackouts I think thisis on YouTube I think I saw it onYouTube but but I should find a link andreally send you a notice you can youknow because it's so strike you knowwhat difference a community makes andthey work on form absolutely all rightDimitri who's joining us today is anarchitect and I follow him on Twitterand he posts interesting things and I'vegot plenty of ideas from him he's also abitcoiner and he's got a question foryou how do we get uh Dimitri you want togo ahead and ask it hey there hey guystechnically helloa technically uh can't call myself anarchitect but I can call myself adesigner so uh okay just to get that outof the wayum yes uh so I've been you know I'vebeen following Bitcoin architecture fora while kind of trying to see how thosetwo are connected and there's many waysyou know to do that and and I've beenseeinguh bukeli president of El Salvador youknow get on the on the Bitcoin train andand my question is you know there's alot of relationship between Bitcoinarchitecture all these things that youguys are talking about you know I thinkthe the connection is thatum these things are based on truth andfacts rather rather than people'sopinions right Bitcoins based on on mathon on these basic truths that exist inthe world and so is architecturetraditional classical architecture andyou know as as you see a country jump onthe Bitcoin uh wagon um it would be itwould be such a great way for them to touse these truths in in other aspects oftheir you know of the country forexample they're they're planning tobuild a city I think I don't know Ithink it's mostly just I don't know howclose they are to actually uh you knowbreaking ground or starting constructionbutis there a way to help these um thesepeople these countries understand thatyou know if they're accepting the truthabout Bitcoin they should they shouldalso look into the truth aboutarchitecture and Urban Design how do weencourage people like that countrieslike that organizations like that to youknow to consider traditional classicalarchitecture so that that's kind of myquestion yeah first very nice to see youlive I follow you on Twitteryeah very nice to meet you it is uhactually quite easy in in thesecountries and and you have you haveprojects now you have classical logicnow in in Mexico in Guatemala you have awhole new neighborhood see that Keralathat they're building in centralGuatemala they are building this in ElSalvador I thinkthe thing is with the Spanish speakingword the Latin American Worldthey have not becomewoke yet so they have not learned thatif you like classical architectureyou're a Naziso there's no you know there's no how tosay social negativity to to to likeBeauty and classical architecture thismakes as much as their cell andso in that sense I don't think there isa problem the only problem is of coursethe supply of classical architects sowhat you do is that these Architects arealmost always trained in Notre DameUniversity in the US so you need toSimply invite more invite more studentsmake more commercial to these studentsthen they'll come back to their homecountries and then they will buildyou have classical architects now in Iknow in Ecuador Mexico Guatemala ElSalvador to mention a few and there arepro and there are some in Brazil inBrazil there are also it's a big countryand you have one at least one NorthAmerican firm classical foreignprojects now in Lima so it's graduallycoming to to Latin America andbecause they don't speakso good English yet they haven't learnedthat they should not like this that theyare not allowed to like because thatthey are white supremacists or somethingif they like classical architecture yeahyetservice yet but ityeah unfortunately you know the the USis in a way the new Soviet Union as anexporter of bad ideas sogood ideas also I would say you know II'm very poor American butthis ideology can of course spread toLatin America and then they will learnthat this is a white European blah blahblah and you shouldn't do this uh youshould build modernism because it's uhyeah not Nazi as the argumentation inthe US and then even still parts ofEuropeso it was a little bit wide answer butbut I hopeI'm concern that there is thingshappening on the ground in thesecountries and they are successful theybuild not only private winners but theybuild entire neighborhoods andespecially this project you know seethat Kaila in Guatemala City becauseit's a it's a country and a city that'svery played by violence here you havelike an Urban Oasiswhere regular Guatemalans not expensivebut it's not a gated community you canjust stroll around enjoy themselves in abeautiful setting and they love it andthey're expanding this communityfascinating stuff do you think we'reheaded toward a Revival of those thingslike I know you're part of this you canyou've named a lot of projects all overthe world that are very exciting but doyou think which way is the wind blowingare we going to get more goodarchitecture or is it going to be moremodernist architecture because yes thereis a growth in classical architecturebutprobably there's even more growth in themodernist architecture wouldn't you sayoh yes yes yeah classical architectureis still a niche it's like one percentof everything now probably less than onepercent of everything built but but thegood thing is that they at least youknow because of the scale of the worldand everything that is built it's enoughto support a growing number of classicalArchitects and as long as we keep theflame alive then you know the the secondthing important that's what I work withbecause I'm not an architect is you knowthe public debateand as I mentioned here in Scandinaviaespecially in Norway and Sweden it hasgone very far we are really changing ofthe public discourseyou know politicians listen to us nowpoliticians override their Municipalexperts want to build modernists andbuild classical but it's a super tankerbecause there are so many instances somany institutions and the people thatneed to be you know educated inclassical tradition and even you knowall the vehicles need to be changed butthings are happening and it can happenso you have a successful you know changeof the debate in Norway you have one inSweden you have similar organizationsnow in Finland in Estonia in Germanythey are working very hard to create oneyou have one in the UK you even have onein in Croatia you have one inNetherlands and a recently one wasstarted in Israel and I hope there willbe one in Lebanon and all of the MiddleEastern countries so there is a growingGlobal boom movement thanks to theinternet everyone is connecting to eachother and sharing you know experienceand always you can always use a tacticthat we use to you know to stress to tomake this discussion you know Advancefurther is you knowcompetition you know every country hasone country that they admire so if thiscountry does classical then we must doit as well this works very well you knowin the example of Sweden everything thathappens in Berlin and New York we mustdo the sameso when I published you know when Ibegan you know advocating in Sweden Ipublished almost exclusively projectfrom Berlin and New York to show thatthese you know very Advanced places doit then we must do it that you knowAdvanced a discussion with 10 yearsbecause you don't have to talk aboutthings being backward because no onewill claim that Berlin or New York arebackward placesso you share strategies and and you cando it in in many different countries sowhat countries does Belgium look up towhat countries does the UK look up towhat countries do Lebanon look up to andshow examples from these places we shareexperience how you do it and then youadvance public discussion and youradviceyou know public imagination that we canbuild this because it's very importantto not only show renders and say weshould to show actual build projectsbecause if you want to show somethingthat has been builtthen you cannot deny that it waspossible it was possible in a cost youknow cost all these factors was soldso things are changing things arechanging for the better it doesn't go asfast as we want them tobut there is an embryo especially when Icompare it to when I began all they snowin 2013 there has been a reallyexplosion both in terms of quality interms of quantity and them out of youngpeople that want that know now that youcan become a classical architect andwant to study to become a classicalarchitectso yeah it's an oil tanker butclassical architecture will not die itwill only grow strongly you know forevery year and then hopefully we canadvance even more the biggest problemnow is institutional learning I told youthere is only one University in Thaiworld of freedom in the U.S we havesummer courses in Europebut you need you know Universityprograms when we got that you knowproper faculties and everythingthen we are one because then you willget you know a steady flow of neweducatedclassical architects and if you educateclassical Logistics they will buildclassic architecture yeah and I thinkanother another positive Point here tokeep in mind is that well classicalarchitecture lasts whereas modernistarchitecture is faster decays veryquickly so basically you could say oneclassical building is like threemodernist buildings because uh you needto build three modernist buildings tosurvive as long as the classical one notmoreso you know at least the ones that youbuilt last longer So eventually you winin the long term you know modernist willjust be a blip you know in in humanarchitectural history unfortunately welive in that blip now but in the longrun you know in 100 years or 200 yearseverywhere we will return to classicaltraditional then it will not be that webuild you know the same Styles as beforebut we will return to the framework andthinking how to design a building and wewill create new beautiful styles andthere will be new beautiful art as wellthere will be no bananas you know withplaster on a wall there will be artiststhat make figurative beautifulfigurative paintings and motifsabsolutely I hope so on that positivenote I want to thank you so much Michaelfor your time for joining us for all ofyour expertise and for everything thatyou do it's an inspiration to seesomebodyum work so hard on something that isbeautiful and really good for people sobest of luck to you and next time wehave you over you better have gotteninto Bitcoinfor your viewI really appreciate it and thank youalso what
