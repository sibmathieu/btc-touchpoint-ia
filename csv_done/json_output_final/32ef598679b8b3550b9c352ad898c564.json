  "text": "taking a stroll through a beautiful parkagain here in Laguna guys in Thailandand this morning I was watching somevideos some Old Time Videos guys and oneof those videos was that we were ontelevision and at a program power it's alate night show and they were attackingus on The Late Night show about theeducation of the show because we weretelling them our story our adventurethat we are traveling the world andwe're fully in Bitcoin believing in thisnew future he decentralized whereeducation that's uh will got a new rolebut they were attacking us they werelike ah you are stupid why will you dothat why would you make your kids stupidwhy would you think that children wouldlearn anything from just jumping in thepool in Thailand and of course mydaughter and myself my wife we allstayed calm we were like okay that'syour opinion we have our own opinionhopefully you're able to respect ouropinion like we are respecting youropinion but they didn't really respectour opinion they thought we were likecrazy peopleand at that time on the table and Ialready was talking about this newdecentralized future where um childrendidn't need to memorize books anymorethey needed to be prepared for thefuture not for the past becausememorizing books is something from the50s man we are living in a complete newuh time that we don't need to memorizestuff anymore our telephone is smarterthan we are and this morning I waswatching this video and again I'm likewow I'm so happy I didn't force mychildren to go to schools but they justfocus on memorizing books and a littlebit of social skills because now thatthis new technology blockchain hasevolved and has been as being combinedwith um chat GPT the first AIsearch engine we can see what ishappening to the worldwe don't need to memorize nothinganymore jet GPT is like a Google onsteroids like Google if you searchsomething you need to scroll through 50000 pages to get the result and then youneed to filter the Real Results checkGPT now is making a summarize of those50 000 Pages if you want and will giveyou the true answer this of course willevolve to this AI algorithms beingcombined with the blockchain Technologybased cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin andthat will be this new future ofpossibilities that we can't think ofright nowand definitely the schools of today arenot thinking on right now so yes I'mteaching my children everything aboutGPT yes I'm thinking teaching themeverything about the blockchain aboutthe Bitcoin the combinations that couldhappen and follow out of that becausethat is the future guysthat is the futurejust go to the website and just ask himto write a beautiful summarize of thetechnology Bitcoin and what it can dofor you it will take you 10 seconds andBam you have to summarize you don't needto go to a library to books too youGoogle to anything anymore it willsummarize that for you and that's whythe memorizing skill is not thatimportant anymore it becomes way moreimportant that your kids are creativeopen-minded that they can think ofthings that they need to tell theseartificial intelligence algorithms to door to research while they focus on otherstuff in life so for us as a family thisis a huge confirmation of the thingsthat we did we're right yes we wereright by taking the kids out of regularschooland homeschooling then unschooling thempreparing them for the future because weknew that the knowledge that people havein their minds would be replaced by theknowledge of artificial intelligence andwe will not be able to compete when itcomes to memorizing with artificialintelligence because they will be betterfaster way more advanced in memorizingstuff than we will ever be as humanbeings so and that was about schoolingso for all the people that still doubton the steps that we took aboutschooling but I do need to admit thatthe social aspect of schooling is veryimportant so I think that schools shouldbe reformed to these social media placeswhere children can exchange theirknowledge that they gathered athomeschooling so when they homeschool orsell school go to these beautiful meatplaces that they call a school wherethey can socialize and you know exchangethe values and Norms or the knowledgethat they gathered by using all thesenew algorithms and Technologies likeblockchain Bitcoin or chat GPT guys sofor me yes education is still importantI think education is still one of themost powerful weapons in the worldwhether education should be done rightthe future of the gay edge of EducationI don't know where it will be going butguys I think the world is changing veryrapidly now in the world that we can'tum even foresee at the moment thecombination the powerful combination ofblockchain artificial intelligence andcryptocurrencies like Bitcoin mainly ofcourse they are changing the worldcompletely because we have never livedin a world where machines can becommunicated with each other paying eachother and all that kind of stuff we aremoving into that kind of world where myfridge can pay a grocery store and thegrocery store can deliver the goods andthe robot can put the goods in my fridgeagainst something like that that's thefar future but that is the future and weare seeing the start of this now we areseeing the star of this with analgorithm chat GPT it is taking over ashitload of jobs that other peopleshould have been doing that wereeducated and had a certificate to do thejobsif I need to write a block now I don'tneed a professional writer anymore I canjust let jet gbt write a blog onwhatever I want in like 10 seconds andthen I rephrase some stuff do agrammatic control because of AI as welland then bam you have a block and thenyou put a video below it and then youhave the YouTube video and then you putan avatar on it that with a voice thatwill read the text that you just copiedand pasted from jet tpd in the video andyou have the complete YouTube video witha person speaking that people believethat is really a person but still it'snot official intelligencesomething like that guys the future isgoing crazy but I love it and I love tosee this advancement and Technology butI do prepare my kids also to be outsideplaying walking and doing the stuff thatwe as human beings should be doingenjoying life to the fullest Bitcoin yes23k beautiful level hopefully we can goto uh 25k maybe 30k even in this bushyou know if it is the same push that wesaw in 2019 from 3K to 14K that's likealmost four times and then oh that wouldbe a beautiful push now from 15K to 60kguys I don't think that it's gonnahappen but like 30 to 40K could be inthe picture and then a drop back beforewe go fully in the new Bull Run guys I'mdoing my steps I need to do 10 000 stepsand my Apple watch is telling me 10 000steps because I need to get more healthydo some weight and that's what I'm doingevery day training walking and all thatstuff while I make these videos perfectcombination look beautifulthey have these beautiful things overherewalk on stand on or do your yoga orSports yeah it's a little bit moreWestern looking Thailand it's a littlebit more like sophisticated it's not theThailand from kopangan where you havethe real Island Vibe you still have anisland Vibe but you need to be on thebeaches and if you walk in these Parksyou're like okay this development hasgone very rapid as well and yes alsothere in the future the developments ofthese houses I think will become smarthouses that you can control and pay withyour Bitcoin wallet maybe these houseswill be be their own entities and noteven owned anymore by us how can thathappen let's say that those housesare paid by human beings at the momentthey are builtand now those houses will get their ownBitcoin wallet and they will claim to bea known entity because they areartificial intelligence and then thosehouses will ask alone from human beingsto become this own entity to the houseloans from me I become the lenderand that house will be renting itselfout through artificial intelligencewebsites like Airbnb letting the peoplein the people pay with debit cards orwith Bitcoin of course and then themoney that the house then is umconnecting in their own wallet from thatmoney it will be paying me my interestthat I ask for my lending to that houseand then the house when it's broken itwill give an assignment to an artificialintelligence website to be repaired andthen the repairman will come repair thehouse and will be paid by the houseitself maybe that is the next step ofthe evolution of all these Technologiescombined that every single entity in theworld human being or non-human being canbe a known entity owning an own walletand by that not only communicating witheach other but also translating valuewith each otherjust think about it it could happen I'mnot saying it's gonna happen but kind ofbelieve that yeah that is the futurethat we are going intostrange developments but they are goingvery rapidly and again I think that youjust need to embrace the evolution ofTechnology like we have always done wecan start to fight it and we can startto resist it but that doesn't work wetry to fight the internet at thebeginning an email in the beginning andthere was a huge resistance of thegovernment and everything else and atthe end we all embraced it and we areall using these Technologies now I'mworking with a small piece in my handand I will upload a video to YouTube sothat you all can see this that we areall embracing the technology and thatwill also happen of course in my opinionto blockchain bitcoin artificialintelligence all these evolutions ofthese technologies will be combined andwill be very powerfuland unpredictable in my hunter's opinionbut let's see let's always look on thebright side of life and look how thatcan change the world in a positive wayand free us some very centralizedentities like governments and centralbanks because it is still the revolutionwhy I'm in Bitcoin it is thedecentralization of the world taking thepower back to the people from thosecentralized entities governments centralbanks and that one percent that tries torule the world with vaccinations and allthat [ __ ] I'm so happy seeing the newscoming out now how many overts andeverything it is that my smart braintaught myself don't do vaccinations dogive your kids vaccinations stay healthystay normaland that is a thing we should all bedoing our own due diligence also onhealth issues also on cryptocurrenciesalso in the future of our children ourdue diligence and we need to be able todo that and that it's only possible whenthere is freedom of speech Freedom ofInformation freedom freedom oftransacting values and all of that isonly possible in a completelydecentralized world where no centralizedentities like governments or centralbanks will be able to influencedecisions that you make or force you tomake decisions because they have thepower and control on you because youneed their currency or their systemwe can build our own system we arestrong enough we are intelligent enoughand now with the help of theseintelligent tools we don't need thosepeople in suits anymore we canbeautifully create vows and wedecentralized in an anonymous way toproposals do voting and then decidewhere we take the world collectively ashuman beings and not because a fewpeople like Schwabs and all those guystell you that you will die of a flu thenshove you fool with vaccinations toprotect you from that flow while theydon't help you but they are alternatingyour DNA so this turned out a little bitdifferent than I intended thisdiscussion but I hope you have still abeautiful Sunday and when I'm walkinghere of course again this huge lizard iscrossing every time when I walksomewherethese lizards start Crossingit's a big onebeautiful oneby the way if you want to know moreabout chat GPT and all the stuff that weare doing as a Bitcoin family and thendo visit thebitcoinfamily.com we startedblogging again a little bit so alsoinformation about Bitcoin simpleinformation so what is bitcoin what isBitcoin mining but also what is Tech GPThow do I think the jet GPT is going toinfluence over the world so go to thebitcoinetown.com if you want to knowmore see you next time[Applause]thank youtaking a stroll through a beautiful parkagain here in Laguna guys in
