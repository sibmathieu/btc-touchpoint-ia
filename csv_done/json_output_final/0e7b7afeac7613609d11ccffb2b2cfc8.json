  "text": "Preston Pysh (00:03):Hey, everyone, welcome to this Wednesday’srelease of the show where we’re talkingabout Bitcoin, and back by popular demand,we have Harry Sudock who’s here to talkto us about the current events and thoughtssurrounding the Bitcoin mining industry.This was a fascinating conversation becauseHarry got into a lot of specifics about thehardware migration coming out of China, thepotential impacts moving forward, and thenwe had a general conversation about the businessof mining.As many already know, Harry’s a treasuretrove of information on this topic.So without further delay, here’s my conversationwith Mr. Harry Sudock.I love having these conversations with you,Harry.I’ve been a big fan for quite a few yearsnow.So welcome back to the show.Harry Sudock (01:07):I appreciate it, Preston.Thanks for having me.It’s been a bit of a roller coaster in miningland for the last 3, 6, 9 months.Preston Pysh (01:14):To say the least.To say the least.Hey, I want to start off because we’ve nevercovered this.The last time you were on with Marty, we didn’tcover your background or your story.So I’m just kind of curious, what’s yourbackground, how you found Bitcoin, and howyou got into it in the first place?Harry Sudock (01:32):I appreciate it.So I’m a FinTech native.Basically, I joined up with a FinTech halfwaythrough college, interned there end the summerbetween my sophomore junior year, internedthere again the following summer, and joinedfull time five days after graduation, andthat company really focused on the full bellyof the beast.We were a big data company that sat in betweenhedge funds and prime brokers.Harry Sudock (01:57):So we tried to leverage the back and middleoffice functions to generate operational alphafor clients.That was as simple as saying to some folks,“Put your short on at Citibank, not a JPMorgan.They’re going to charge you less,” orit was as nuanced as recreating their marginagreement, and validating that they had topost as much collateral as they thought theyhad to post.Harry Sudock (02:18):So we were able to just shave some pointshere and there, but for a $15 billion hedgefund, a few points mean 10, 15, $20 millionin costs saved per year.So it was a really interesting business andit put me really in the guts of how the otherbroader financial system worked, which wasa blessing and a curse, because it made merealize that this stuff is still running onmainframes.Harry Sudock (02:40):The idea that these large financial institutionsand massive sources of institutional gradecapital are somehow sophisticated, is likea wild misnomer.There are hedge funds that are still workingwith paper orders.So the insight into that side of the worldwas one part of it and like with many others,I had my three swings at the plate with Bitcoin.Harry Sudock (03:04):First, in high school, there was a kid whowas very involved in some of the early anonymousstuff when they got involved with fightingback against Scientology, and they were sendingBitcoin to each other.So, the kid who got investigated by the FBIin my high school was the first pass at Bitcoin.Harry Sudock (03:24):Then, the second pass was the kids who werebuying drugs in college and then the thirdpass was like, the most junior guy on ourdesk at the FinTech had just given his buddyfive grand to trade Bitcoin prop for him.So I got these three swings at it, that wasprobably sub $1 in high school.It was probably sub $20 in college, and itwas sub $1,000 at my first job.Missed all three swings, obviously, but hadfinally reached that critical informationexposure point where the proverbial viralload had reached the saturation I needed tosay this is worth time and effort.Harry Sudock (04:05):From that point forward said, this is interesting.Went from this is interesting, to I can’tthink about anything else and from that pointsaid, I need to find a way to make this mycareer.Anything other than full career exposure toBitcoin is underexposed.At that point, I said, I have a thesis aboutthe future that balance sheet is going toreplace valuation.Hard assets are going to trade at such a ridiculouspremium over the coming, I don’t know, callit 10-year time horizon, that the actual freecash flow that your business generates, andthe balance sheet that you build with it isgoing to be like a way more useful sourceof compounding than the next up round, whichis what it’s been previously where the ideais that you can … If you go back maybe sixor seven years, you’ve got to just infinitelymark up your next venture round until yousell it to SoftBank [inaudible 00:05:01].Harry Sudock (05:02):Now, it’s like you just sell your next upround until Tiger comes in and pays for it.I was of the opinion at that point that businessesneed to generate free cash flow, and the bestuse of that free cash flow over time becomesa balance sheet.So I tweeted it during some of Trump’s rise,but like make balance sheet great again, waskind of what we were going through.Harry Sudock (05:26):I continue to believe that and I think thatthe reason why that’s so exciting is that,and the original thought before I got to itwith Bitcoin was that if you’re someonewho’s 25 years old, what are the best assetsyou can put on your personal balance sheet.It’s like, I’m going to spend two yearsat Stripe, I’m going to spend two yearsat Airbnb, I’m going to spend two yearsat Uber and I just want to vest three of thebest 10 companies I can find.Harry Sudock (05:50):Then my personal balance sheet will actuallyexceed anything else I’m doing.Then Bitcoin came and said, the thesis isright, but the collateral is wrong.So now it’s just, how do you aggressivelyfree cash flow as quickly and best as youcan to be able to build your personal balancesheet in such an early and aggressive way,that it becomes the best performing assetof your lifetime.That’s the replacement for the pension mythor the Social Security myth.Harry Sudock (06:20):What those are, it’s a replacement for thebalance sheet.So developing personal balance sheet early,and front loading it.It’s like what all the fire people get wrong,or they get right, but maybe get wrong.They’re right that saving these hard assets,they do it in the form of equities.My perspective is that that needs to happenin the form of Bitcoin for lots of differentreasons, but then extend that thought processout to either starting or joining a very earlystage company.Harry Sudock (06:46):How do you not mine a coin then?So, took that idea and said, the two bestfree cash-flowing companies that you can buildin the Bitcoin space are an exchange, or aminer.Having just been through five plus years ofFinTech experience at the heart of prime brokersand hedge funds was not thrilled to jump ontoan exchange at that moment, and by the graceof serendipity, found my way into a cold DMwith Griid’s founder and CEO, Trey Kelly,and we met for coffee a few times.I was thinking about starting my own thingand he very wisely said, “Don’t do that.Come join me,” and it was at that pointthat I joined Griid as the first employee.Preston Pysh (07:28):Wow.Oh, that’s fascinating.I agree with your fundamental thesis aboutthe balance sheet.I think it’s so important and I think it’sreally difficult for people to wrap theirhead around, because they’ve been so groomedand conditioned, especially anyone comingout of business school, that the income statementis the place to really spend all of your timeand analysis and for good reason.Preston Pysh (07:52):You got to find a company that’s kickingoff free cash flows, but when you think abouthow everything’s just being capitalizedto the moon because interest rates keep goingdown, it forces you to really understand whatis on the balance sheet and how’s it beingcapitalized on the balance sheet.So when you’re seeing these numbers andthe equity growth of the business, is thatreally equity growth, or is that just thecapitalization of the assets that are sittingthere?I’m with you 100%.Harry Sudock (08:18):Exactly.So for me, there were two moments within traditional,high growth companies that I thought werenot fully emperor has no clothes, becauseI respect a lot about what some of these companiesdo, but they were like, these are companiesthat are maximally extracting from the existingstate of play.They’re not actually designed for the futurestate.I think like, Airbnb is like the perfect example.Harry Sudock (08:42):Airbnb is like the perfect company to haveas minimal balance sheet as humanly possible,or all that money into building two sidedmarketplace and let’s let the balance sheetheadaches live on the host’s desk.Because we all agree that dealing with thatpiece of it, owning that hard asset, doingthe thing, it’s a pain.What they’re really doing is like valuechain hacking.Harry Sudock (09:10):They’re saying like, “Here’s a valuechain that traditionally would accrue overhere to the real estate.We’re going to have that traditional approachand we’re going to try to pull all of thatvalue accrual into this matching engine.”They’re basically pulling it into this liquidplace within that traditional business model.Kudos to them.They build a generational business, it’sincredible, but it’s very much a creatureof 2013 to 2020, clearly early 2020.Harry Sudock (09:41):Then the other, which is an example that Imuch don’t respect is just like the WeWorkplaybook, where WeWork is like the screamingexample of money is hilariously tucci.If you’re allowed to do this, if your boardof directors lets you do this, then the interestrates aren’t accurate and the risk modelsare wrong.Good on you [inaudible 00:10:08] he did agreat Stanford Business School speech wherehe said, “The playbook,” I think he presentshis own problems and he’s a challengingperson to wrap your head around generally,but he’s exactly right in this speech, becauseof the moment that he gives the speech inwhich is, his point is getting money.Harry Sudock (10:23):Why?Because it’s free.So if you’re not just going out and raisingas much money as humanly possible at thatpoint in time, whether it’s debt or it’sequity, or it’s an ICO or whatever the casemay be, everyone’s giving it away for free.Go get yours, and make sure you sit down beforethe music stops.EOS and Block.one are a great example of this.They raised $4 billion and paid out 20, someodd million dollar SEC fine.You don’t think the money is too cheap?Preston Pysh (10:51):Let’s pull the thread on this.So when we think about this cost of capitalbeing nothing, effectively, and you thinkabout how everyone’s maneuvering, we’veseen the Michael Saylor playbook, but froma mining business standpoint, they’re crazynot to go out there and be borrowing as muchof this as possible in order to buy more hardwareand put it to work.So are you seeing more companies here in theStates, anywhere in the world, it doesn’treally matter, using that playbook of therates are manipulated.So let’s take advantage of it while we canand conduct this speculative attack on fiatcurrency?Harry Sudock (11:29):I don’t see it in practice yet.I see the edge of it.I think people are 5% of the way into thatstrategy you just described, and I think thatone of the reasons that I love mining so muchis that it is a really hardcore meritocracy.It’s a hardcore meritocracy from the standpointthat it’s actually challenging businessto build and operate.So you may be able to roll … The way thatMichael Saylor is rolling out this attackstrategy is much, much easier to execute,because all he has to do is go buy Bitcoin.That’s the playbook.Harry Sudock (12:01):Raise money, buy Bitcoin.He doesn’t care how the money is raised,whether it’s equity, debt, convert.Preston Pysh (12:06):They’re happy to give it to him.Harry Sudock (12:09):For sure.So I think like that version of the attackis a lot easier to bring to market maturity,where even if there was as much demand tobring a similar strategy to market and mining,I just think the execution is way harder.Preston Pysh (12:22):Yeah.Because you’re having to know where you’reat in the cycle and just there’s a lot moremoving parts to this.So tell us some of your thoughts on all thesemoving parts?Harry Sudock (12:33):I want to use the counter again, just fora moment and say the worst thing that canhappen to Mike Saylor is that Bitcoin goesdown and stays down.Way down, like 90 plus percent for a protractedperiod of time.Preston Pysh (12:45):He’s got five year notes.So he needs it to be down for a very longtime.Harry Sudock (12:51):He needs Bitcoin to do something it’s neverdone.In mining, there’s a lot of other placeswhere the business models break on an interimbasis.So you’re subject to, let’s just use abunch of examples.The machines you buy don’t work, you raise$100 million in some Michael Saylor stylefunding event and you go buy S7 teams, andlet’s just assume this is early ’19.The S7 teams had an incredibly high failurerate, and Bitmain did their best to basicallystring you along until warranty period rolledover, and you get what you get and you don’tget upset.So there was a blend between hardware qualityrisk, and counterparty good behavior riskthat has nothing to do with borrowing moneyand buying hardware.Preston Pysh (13:39):So my immediate thought when I’m hearingthis story is like so okay, for people thataren’t familiar, Bitmain is over in China.So you’re just looking at hardware manufacturing,in general.With the China ban and with examples likethe one you just provided, I would think there’smassive demand for hardware that’s not beingproduced inside of China.Is that the case?Are you seeing some hardware manufacturerstrying to migrate out of there?Talk to us about that industry.Harry Sudock (14:09):Well, I think it’s important to double clickon why you don’t want the machines to bemade in China.I break it down into three major categories.One of them is straight up tariff risk.Buying machine out of China is 25% more expensivethan a machine not made in China.Apples to apples.The second is jurisdiction, litigation stuff.So you send them money, they renege on a contract,where do you sue them?Preston Pysh (14:39):You don’t.Harry Sudock (14:40):You don’t.Or you’d go to China, you try to sue them,hundreds of thousands of dollars, millionsof dollars in legal bills later, you hopeyou win.Do they pay you for legal fees in Chinesecourts?I don’t know.I don’t care to know.So the second is really that you don’t havea lot of recourse.The third is some kind of intervention ofsome kind that blows up the deal.We’ve seen it from a governance perspectivewithin Bitmain.Harry Sudock (15:04):So those who aren’t familiar with theircorporate governance structure, there’sbeen a lot of upheaval that’s gone on withintheir corporate structure, they’ve forkedtheir company.I’d get into the Bitmain conversation, butthe truth of the matter is, they still makea really good machine.So, I’m of these two minds that like, you’reonboarding counterparty risk by dealing withthem, but you’re also dealing with the bestmanufacturer.Harry Sudock (15:27):It’s this duality where like, you got tobuy enough to satisfy your growth, but you’vegot to manage those procurement channels prettycarefully to protect yourself from the badscenarios.We run Bitmain machines.We continue to buy and run Bitmain machines.We think they make a good machine, but navigatinga business relationship with them take savvyand takes skill, and it’s part of why youcan’t just jump into this thing.Preston Pysh (15:51):Now, are you seeing any change or any guidancethat’s being put out in the future now thatChina has their ban in place, as far as forBitmain, specifically, or any other Chinesemanufacturer?Harry Sudock (16:03):I think that it’s too early to tell.We don’t have anything super definitivethat they’re going to cut their volumesby 50%.We don’t see anything like that.We see that they’re looking to sell moremachines, demand for hash continues to behigh but there’s complexity to all of that.We’ve heard some reports around droppingexisting production quantities so that someof the existing orders or pre orders can migrateelsewhere.Harry Sudock (16:29):This is also part of the challenge, wherethe way that the manufacture is they forwardsell so many of those machines.They’re selling a year ahead, even longerfrom time to time.That allows for a lot of different stuff tohappen, especially in a businesses as dynamicas mining and as an industry that 24/7 isBitcoin.A lot can happen in 12 months, as we’veseen time and time again.Preston Pysh (16:52):Let’s say the worst case scenario playsout and China just shuts Bitmain down.No more of this, you’re not making any moreof these things.The company is toast.What does that mean for the market?What does that mean for the hash rate?Just like, if that scenario were to play out,what would that mean for you guys?Harry Sudock (17:10):It would put a lot of pressure on the usedmarket.Preston Pysh (17:13):So you’d be paying prices way higher thanwhat they’re going for today?Harry Sudock (17:17):I think…Preston Pysh (17:20):How about the hash rate in general?Harry Sudock (17:22):The hash rate would still rise?There’s other manufacturers, and more thanlikely, I would expect … So TSMC and Samsung,which are the two chip foundries are bothnot on Mainland China.So the ability to produce chips would still… No impact there.It’s really about the [crosstalk 00:17:41]of the corporate structure, and there’soutside of mainland assembly as well.So there are paths that would be achievablefrom a supply chain standpoint.It would be disruptive, for sure.I think that we would … It’s a hard thingto speculate on.There’s a lot of moving pieces around whereit could go.Our assumption is that there’s a lot ofmarket demand for hash, enough demand wherealternative supply chains would be re-establishedover time.Preston Pysh (18:09):And they would strengthen over time.Harry Sudock (18:10):And they would strengthen over time.I think we’re already seeing that.We’re seeing, whatever, 40 some odd billiondollars invested in US foundries.The price of machines would go up, becausethe price of labor and component parts mightgo up, but there are pathways to continueto produce significant amounts of ASICS thatdon’t involve Mainland China’s involvement.Preston Pysh (18:30):So let’s go back, I don’t know, 60, 90days, and the China announcement comes out.I know my personal opinion when I saw theheadline, I just kind of rolled my eyes andwas like, “Yeah, sure.Yeah, right.”Like seen this story multiple times in thepast.There’s no way this is real.I guess my first question for you is like,what was your interpretation?I see you nodding your head, but then froma company standpoint, from a mining companystandpoint, how did you guys start to interpretit as it started to look like oh, no, holdon a second, this might be real.Harry Sudock (19:05):So, umber one is we’ve seen this story before.We’ve heard about China banning Bitcoin,banning Bitcoin mining every 30 days for thelast three years.So our first instinct was not to take it tooseriously.We’ve been taking China regulation a littlemore seriously, since we’ve seen … InnerMongolia really did go through significantreductions in hash rate prior to this.So there was some provincial pressure thatwe’d seen, that was real and significant.Harry Sudock (19:33):So our instinct, obviously was to say, “Let’ssee if it’s real.Not giving us any credence right away at all,”but we had seen at the province level effectiveregulation in some regions already and quitequickly, it became clear that this was happening.We were hearing and seeing real panic.The other thing that we don’t want to letget memory hold too quickly is that we’dseen the significant disruption to the coalsector, where there’d already been a 10plus percent reduction in hash rate … Forgetif it was weeks or months earlier, where therewas a coal plant that significantly malfunctioned.Harry Sudock (20:12):So they ran a series of tests across all ofthe plants in that region over the next, Ithink it was maybe 10 or 12 days, and we saw10 to 15% of hash reduce during that difficultyadjustment as well.It came back towards the end of the adjustment.Preston Pysh (20:29):Yes, yes.Harry Sudock (20:29):So there were signs prior to this, that weshould A, be sizing the reduction in hash,maybe more aggressively than we would havethought otherwise.So, that was the first piece and the secondwas that these markets were more vulnerableand susceptible to black swans, whether theybe in the energy generation piece, or fromthe regulation, we should be taking that moreseriously, than we have historically.Harry Sudock (20:54):So we quickly digested that this was real.Frankly, my first thought was, this is reallychallenging.No doubt every miner is competing with everyother miner, but having now gone through multiplecycles with Griid and having stood up significantoperations with Griid, we have compassionfor other operators.This is a really hard business.Harry Sudock (21:16):So to have built your business in a placewith regulatory vulnerability, and to seethat vulnerability get played out, throughno fault of the business that you run andbuilt, it sucks.We have friends with close ties to some Chineseminers and we feel there is capitalistic andaggressive and competitive business ownersand operators as you can ask for.So we recognize that they’re no differentthan us and we compete with them like anyother miner, not like a Chinese miner.Preston Pysh (21:46):So Harry, if you could put on your hat asif you are one of these participants overin China that are going through this regulatorysituation, how do you think they were thinkingthrough how they solved their situation, asfar as selling their rigs, as far as gettingthem out of the country.Walk us through that thought process and howthey were probably handling it in the highestprobability way that you would suspect whatthe typical miner in China was thinking.Harry Sudock (22:17):In my experience with how they think and operate,and they don’t think and operate one way.There are a huge segment of this market.They operate all over different provinceswith all different kinds of energy relationships.Their families own the coal plants that they’reoperating out of.Some of them are building out a bilateralagreement with a hydro dam.So there’s a really wide range of how theseminers are actually running their operations.I think the first is like, you should havebeen planning for this already.Preston Pysh (22:44):Do you think most were?Harry Sudock (22:46):The biggest were.I think that like with everything, there’sa barbell.The biggest were planning for this already,the smallest might go unnoticed, but it’sthat sort of middle 50 to 70%, that are inthe danger zone of not being big enough tofully invest in diversification, but alsobeing too big to escape the Eye of Sauron.I think for that cohort, it’s seeing wherecan I move these things outside the countryand how can I be first?Being first or last.Rushed for the door.So first order of business would be speed,how do I move the rigs?Second order of business is, what price canI get for the rigs and try to sell them?Somehow we be at the front of that order book.Preston Pysh (23:31):Do you think many were trying to move theircompany so they’re trying to retain therigs, or are they just trying to get themout the door?Then also, how are they managing their ownpersonal balance sheet, which I would imagineis heavily denominated in Bitcoin?Harry Sudock (23:44):I think that the most common behavior is thoserigs are in storage.There’s just dry powder, so to speak, thata lot of folks don’t like the pricing they’regetting to sell them.They don’t have a place to move them, because… We’ll get into a lot of this, but Ithink that the shift has moved dramaticallyfrom hardware premium to rack space premium.Preston Pysh (24:07):You’re saying for all the ones buying therig.So they didn’t have the infrastructure inplace outside of China in order to buy [crosstalk00:24:16].Wow, interesting.Harry Sudock (24:18):No, there’s no rack space to confuse machines.There’s a ripple effect.So then you say, “Why isn’t there enoughrack space?”Some mixture of the inability to execute onbuilding out the locations or the inabilityto design enough scaled power contracts.So now you run into all of the normal supplychain problems that we’re seeing acrossused cars and other industries.Preston Pysh (24:39):You’re not going to buy those rigs unlessyou know the electrical expense that you’resigning up for whatever that contract is goingto be before buying.I got you.I think the other thing that people that aren’tfamiliar with the mining space, the infrastructureitself, like pouring the concrete, havingthe heating cooling in place, having the buildingitself, all the capex that’s associatedwith the stuff that just goes beyond the rigitself is massive.Takes a significant long time to establish.We’re talking a year to get some of thatstuff stood up or six months?Harry Sudock (25:14):I think six months is aggressive and I think18 months is conservative, and it dependson what …. There’s almost reverse economiesof scale.So diseconomies of scale are totally presentthe bigger the mining operation you’re tryingto build.So the longer lead time items, that lead timeextends, the higher up the power stack youget.So low voltage transformer used to take like12 to 16 weeks, maybe now it’s closer to20 or 30 weeks.Harry Sudock (25:42):That doesn’t talk about sort of a substationtransformer.Those are 18 months in the making, and thosearen’t getting any quicker.They’re not getting shipped any quicker.Boats aren’t moving, ports aren’t seeingthe type of throughput that they need to beseeing to achieve this kind of stuff.So the bottlenecks and the supply chain, otherthan the minor are significant and growing.So trying to get another 100 megawatts stoodup, there’s 1,000 megawatts trying to getout of China.So the ability to build the rack space forall of this new supply is not easy.Preston Pysh (26:18):Man, that’s not something that I consideredwas just how much time is associated withdoing that.Now what I want to get back to is in China,so if you’re one of these companies thathad just tons of rigs, correct me if I’mwrong, but this is like half of the entirehardware infrastructure for the Bitcoin networkthat’s been turned off.Harry Sudock (26:36):Yes.Preston Pysh (26:37):So half the rigs are in storage is what you’resaying.You think a majority of them went to, mostlybecause they didn’t have a buyer at theprice that the person would be willing tosell it for, they would just rather get sometype of storage and put them in the storageuntil they can find the right buyer and theright price to offload it.Some of them have left.Where are some of the locations that thosehave gone to?Harry Sudock (27:02):I’m seeing a lot of noise around Kazakhstan.Even though they’ve introduced a new sortof Bitcoin minor power contract tariff ofa quarter cent per kilowatt hour, we’restill seeing a lot of volumes migrate there,but those supply chain problems, those arecountry agnostic.They’re a little easier to overcome in somecountries, because they have different electricalstandards, but I think that by and large,it’s hard to build rig-ready rack space,for miners.So we’re seeing Kazakhstan, we’re seeinga ton to US.Harry Sudock (27:32):Even though we don’t have the ability toplug it all in right away, what is availableis coming here.So really, what’s interesting is we’reseeing updates to deal structures.So the folks who were able to get their machinesout of China, and they want to retain interestin them, they’re striking much more creative,much more hosting friendly deals in the US,or partnership friendly.Harry Sudock (27:55):I don’t know that I would call all of ithosting, but for the folks that are hosting,it’s an opportunity to sign way above marketpower prices.So what used to be a four or five or six centrate, all of a sudden is a 9, 10, 11 centrate, which is crazy, and introduces a bunchof interesting price vulnerability to someof these mining operations.If hash rises and price falls, or if hashrises and price rises slower, or hash staysthe same and price falls, all of a suddenthe machines that are at a higher marginalprofit than they would have been otherwise.Preston Pysh (28:33):It’s a short term game at that point.Harry Sudock (28:35):Exactly.So for us at Griid, we’ve always had thesame pieces, which is we’re vertically integrated,and we self mine, full stop.That’s what we do.We build rack space for ourselves, we plugin our own machines, like we talked aboutearlier.It’s a balance sheet game and one of thebeautiful things about being a Bitcoin mineris that the ASICs you purchase are just likelittle baby Bitcoin bonds.Harry Sudock (28:58):So their value is largely associated withthe price of Bitcoin, because their futurecash flow streams are Bitcoin.So we love being an asset-heavy business ina market that you still love asset-light,because it gives us this opportunity to buildthese multiple compounding layers that arehighly correlated to Bitcoin price.Harry Sudock (29:18):So we saw all this migration happening andwe said, “Well, we liked being a self minerwho’s vertically integrated before doubledown.Let’s do more.We want to do more of this.We think that more value is going to accrueto our business model.”What we’ve seen is other folks have wokenup to this strategy, but that’s why we’vebeen building the whole business this waywith this in our DNA for two years.Preston Pysh (29:45):Any other comments about the lens from theChinese miners?From a business standpoint?Harry Sudock (29:51):I think really, it’s this introduction offragility into the unit economics that they’renow going to see which is, they used to buythree cent power in China, a US hosting usedto be five or six cents.They come to the US, and now they’ve gotnine cent power, and they’re giving up whatever,a 10% or 20%-Preston Pysh (30:10):Oh, yeah.That’s brutal-Harry Sudock (30:11):Profit share.So you’re getting crushed on both ends andwhat used to be totally immovable hash isnow pretty fragile hash relative to the uniteconomics of the network.So something I’m watching closely is, whatdo we start to see around those rigs if thefavorability of Bitcoin economics and miningchange, and how do we win those deals?Preston Pysh (30:36):So Harry, I’ve always had the thesis thatthe hash rate is really setting the flooron the price action.Just if we were thinking about gold, and gold’sreaching a steady stock, the flow issuanceand demand and all that kind of stuff, you’regoing to get to really what’s the productioncost to pull this out of the ground that wouldreally set your floor price.So when we’re thinking about Bitcoin, andwe’re thinking about half of that network,half of that hardware that’s conductingthis mining has now moved to a location wherethe price to the electrical expense to putthis into the market is significantly higherthan where it came from.Are you of the opinion that this might favorablyimpact the underlying price or that floorprice that Bitcoin might achieve on the cyclethat we’re currently in?Harry Sudock (31:27):It’s a good question.It’s hard to speculate on what price willdo over time.I think that it’s not an unreasonable thesis.I think that there are folks who might takeprofits at levels in other environments thatno longer can, because there is no profitto take, but I think it cuts both ways.So if you have a higher cost structure onyour mining, you’re selling more coin tofund operations.Harry Sudock (31:50):On the other hand, you’re selling less coinsto take profits into, potentially, or maybeyou always kept all your profit in Bitcoinbut I think there’s evidence both ways onthat.So I think that a higher cost of production… Net net.A higher cost of production means sellingmore Bitcoin.Preston Pysh (32:06):It’s kind of interesting, and you hear alot of arguments and I think we’re hittingat this a little bit is does price followhash or does hash follow price.When I’m thinking about which one of thosetwo are leading the other, I see it more asthis homeostasis between the two, like theyhave this tethered relationship with eachother, where sometimes the ones driving theother and sometimes it’s the other way around.I’m curious to hear some of your thoughtson that idea as well.It’s just like, which one of those two isdriving the other?Harry Sudock (32:37):So I think that price drives hash at the tails,basically.Preston Pysh (32:43):When you say at the tails, what do you meanby that?Harry Sudock (32:46):So I mean that when bitcoin price precipitouslyfalls during COVID Black Thursday, that driveshash.That says to people, I need to turn my machinesoff, I’m worried about paying for power.Similarly, when bitcoin price goes from 10,000to 60,000, people say, “If I don’t pluga machine into my garage, that’s the cheapestway for me to mine a Bitcoin, not to buy it.”Harry Sudock (33:11):So I think when we see the most extreme priceaction, it drives, maybe not irrational, butit drives extreme behavior with regard tomining.I think the chart is most clear, when youlook at Black Thursday.You saw a price come down, borderline 50%and you saw hash drop double digit into the20s. 20 to 20, some 30% on a very short termbasis, and people panicked.Harry Sudock (33:36):I think you saw the same … The problem is,is that hash coming online lags, hash comingoffline is real time.So the way to try to correlate price and hashon the upside is with bitcoin price and machineprice, rather than bitcoin price and hashrate.Because with hash rate, we just talked aboutit, there’s significant lead times of plugginganything new in at scale.Harry Sudock (34:00):So I can’t say, “Oh, Bitcoin went from30 to 60.Time to plug in all those machines I’vejust been sitting on.Oh, maybe now it’s time to kick off purchaseorders for transformers.Now it’s time to engage with my generalcontractor.Now it’s time to work with my electricalengineering team to start plotting out expansionwithin existing operations.I got to go back to negotiate with power producers.”Harry Sudock (34:20):So there’s a lot of levers that have toget pulled to bring net new hash online.I’ll pull all those levers, [inaudible 00:34:27]but that doesn’t mean that the hash is goingto come online any shorter than 90 days, buton the way down, shut the machines out.Preston Pysh (34:36):I just want to go back to the China pieceone more time.So this was a common question that we sawfrom people online is how confident are wethat we’re actually seeing rigs leave Chinaor it’s like a theory that people have thatChina might have just made it appear likethey’re turning off the rig, but they’rereally going to be there for some type ofattack into the future.So I’m kind of curious … Yeah, I’m withyou.I’m kind of curious what percent of thathardware do you think is actually leavingthe country right now?So we both talked earlier that 50% of thehardware was in China.How much of that 50% is staying versus leaving?Harry Sudock (35:13):I’ll caveat and say leaving thus far.So I bet you we’ve seen one in five of thosemachines leave.Preston Pysh (35:21):20% of what was there.Harry Sudock (35:23):Yeah, 10% total network, 20% of what shutoff and that’s because we’re having conversationswith folks that are trying to move machines.This is still a pretty small club of folkswho mined Bitcoin at scale.A, we’re seeing it in pricing.So if those machines weren’t really leaving,we wouldn’t have seen prices in machinescome down so far.B, we’re seeing the network recover.Those machines are going somewhere.Our feeling is they’re coming to the USand they’re going to Eastern Europe.Preston Pysh (35:50):So this one was pretty politically chargedand got a lot of people in the community,pretty emotional and that’s the Mining Council.I’m curious to hear what your thoughts areon the Mining Council, and then I’m alsocurious to hear your thoughts on Elon Musk’spiece about Tesla no longer accepting Bitcoin,because of the high energy costs.How are you seeing that as somebody in themining industry?Harry Sudock (36:18):It’s a tough topic.The Bitcoin Mining Council, so long as theobjective is opt-in data disclosures, is agood thing.Preston Pysh (36:28):It’s no harm no foul.If people want to provide their data, theycan.If they don’t want to, then they don’thave to and there’s no anybody holding agun to anybody’s head saying they have todo it.Harry Sudock (36:38):Exactly, and these were two questions thatgot asked at their first.It was like first, either monthly or quarterly… They did a Twitter Spaces.The two questions that Pete McCormack askedthat I was really grateful for were, numberone is, can anyone join the Bitcoin MiningCouncil no matter the energy mix that theyuse?And the answer is yes.Number two is, does this group commit to neverlobbying for legislation around the energymix that Bitcoin miners should be using, orshould we regulate against?And the answer was similarly, we’re nothere to drive legislation on any of this.We’re here to provide opt-in voluntary datadisclosures and from that perspective, I thinkit’s awesome.Harry Sudock (37:23):I think providing tools to the community tomake fact-based arguments around how thisindustry works is a really positive thing.I think that the minute you try to get into,“Hey, I just heard about Bitcoin, and I’mhere to fix it,” or, “Hey, we want tocenter green blocks and clean blocks and aBitcoin is a Bitcoin except for that one,”that’s the type of stuff that doesn’twork in this network.Preston Pysh (37:47):I think the thing that got everyone so excitedabout it is just they were having flashbacksto the summer of 2017 with the Bitcoin Cash-Harry Sudock (37:56):New York Agreement-Preston Pysh (37:56):Oh, yeah, the big New York Agreement.So I think that’s where a lot of it wasstemming from and at the same time, you kindof breathe energy into this ESG FUD that’sout there by just talking about, well, where’dyou get your source from.So I can understand that side of it to wherepeople are upset that they’re even doingit because when you look at the trend, andwe’re both well aware of the trend, andthe direction that this is going to go, whichis the person who can get the energy the cheapestis going to be the ones that are really drivingthe train in the future.Preston Pysh (38:29):So with that, let’s talk a little bit aboutgeothermal.I know the El Salvador piece with the miningthe volcanoes was just a huge story.Everyone’s got volcanoes in their Twitterhandles and stuff.What are some of your thoughts on that?Where do you see that going?Is it really that cheap of electricity that’sbeing produced out of these volcanoes or anyother type of geothermal activity?I’m just curious to hear how you view it.Harry Sudock (38:55):I want to click out one level and just talkabout what goes into choosing a jurisdictionfor a miner, which I think is maybe not wellunderstood yet.This is … Forgive any talking to my ownbook, but we’re of the opinion that theUS is the best place in the world to mineBitcoin.Preston Pysh (39:11):Because of the lack of vulnerabilities-Harry Sudock (39:13):More than that.Preston Pysh (39:14):Oh, really?Harry Sudock (39:15):More than that.We think that if you are in the business ofconverting energy to money, the best placeto do it is here and that’s for a numberof different reasons.One of those reasons is that we’ve got anincredible electric grid that has its wattsor caught outage this year, and it has itspolitical warts, where state representativesfrom my beautiful state of New York are concerned.At the end of the day, our ability to deliverenergy across this country is a modern marvel.Harry Sudock (39:45):It has challenges but we deliver power withmore reliability to 340 or 50 million peopleevery day, which it’s an astounding featof engineering and we’ve designed that systemin such a way where there are huge pocketsof over engineering that are begging for revenueenhancement in the form of a Bitcoin miningpower relationship.Harry Sudock (40:08):You layer into that we are still the bestplace to form capital, we’re still the bestplace to protect property rights and takea bad actor to court.We’re the ideal business environment forBitcoin mining, as far as I’m concerned,and we’ve got a lot of runway before thatthesis is maximized.So we are heavily, heavily invested in thefuture growth of Bitcoin mining in the US.Harry Sudock (40:32):We think this is the place to do it.We’ve had conversations with half a dozenother countries that are really exciting placesto also mine Bitcoin, and we haven’t beenconvinced that that’s a better place todo it.That being said, El Salvador, other areasof South America that have truly abundantsources of energy, are really, really goodelectrical priced places.Preston Pysh (40:52):The geothermal, like the volcano.So how much are they able to get it for you?You were quoting 2 cents, 5 cents earlier.Where are we at with something like that?Harry Sudock (41:01):My guess is that they’re able to get itfor 2 cents or lower.Preston Pysh (41:04):Wow.Harry Sudock (41:05):I haven’t talked to anybody from El Salvadorand ask them for a power purchase agreements.This is pure speculation, but I think thatthere’s a number of different countriesin south America, geothermal, hydro as thetwo sources in particular, where I think thatsub 2 cent power is probably achievable.Preston Pysh (41:21):So when we fast forward 10 years into thefuture, 15 years into the future, these locationsthat have these naturally occurring, justabundant, ridiculously abundant energy, theseare going to be the hubs.These are going to be the financial hubs ofwhere Bitcoin is distributed at a geographiclocation of where those coins are going toinitially flow into.Now, whether the ownership is of the businessthat owns them, is there where the hardwareis located is maybe not necessarily goingto be the case, but as far as the locationwhere the hardware is at, that’s going tobe it, correct?Harry Sudock (41:57):It is correct.I think of Bitcoin mining, it’s basicallylike a giant egg crate and you basically throwa glass of water onto the egg crate and ifyou give it enough time, the water settlesat the lowest points in the egg crate.That’s where the miners will end up in thelong-term in the steady state.The scenario you introduce is actually, again,theoretically, very interesting.There’s a huge premium right now on miningthe soonest Bitcoin, not necessarily miningfor the longest, where in 10 years, there’smany fewer Bitcoins available to you per megawatthour of energy purchased or per terahash unitcontributed to the network.So in our opinion, time premium is actuallybigger than marginal energy cost premium atthe edges.That doesn’t mean go buy 7 cent power forus.Preston Pysh (42:53):It also speaks to the regulatory vulnerabilitybeing probably one of the biggest factorsright now in the near term.As you’re thinking about capturing as manycoins as possible in the near term versusin the future, it’s everybody’s goingto allow it because they’d be crazy notto, as they’re trying to compete with thisglobal money that’s made its way throughthe entire global economy.Harry Sudock (43:17):Exactly.Preston Pysh (43:17):Interesting.Harry Sudock (43:19):The thing with Bitcoin is that it’s prettyeasy, or not easy.It is reasonable to predict the 20 year future.It is utterly impossible to predict a twoyear future.Preston Pysh (43:29):Talk to us about, I don’t know how familiaror well versed you are on this, but Blockstreamjust came out with a note that’s associatedwith their mining and this was in order toraise capital so they could buy hardware,buy infrastructure.Then the amount of coins that are being minedwith that hardware, because it’s tied tothe hashing power, like whatever amount thatyou buy the note for has an associated hashingamount that comes with it.Then whatever Bitcoin, they were able to minewith that over a three-year period of time,you’re able to collect that in Bitcoin.Preston Pysh (44:02):You’re going to receive that back as yourcoupon.This seems like a really, really innovativeway to structure the cost of hardware andalso structure the operational risk.All of those things, all wrapped into thisreally unique financial instrument.I’m curious if you’re seeing other businessesthat are looking at doing something similarto this, or just your thoughts in general,on that type of vehicle.Harry Sudock (44:29):There’s two financial products wrapped upinto one in your question.One of them is how do miners reliably engagein capital formation to buy hardware.That’s really expensive.These are not a traditional VC backed business.We certainly aren’t.I think we’ll achieve sort of VC backablereturns, but because Bitcoin does half thework and we do have to work.So as long as that relationship exists, we’rea weird business.Harry Sudock (44:57):Really what we’re best fit for is like abunch of project finance, but that doesn’treally exist at maturity yet because the pricingof the future Bitcoin cash flows isn’t seenas safe enough, I think in a lot of capitalmarkets.So I think that what Blockstream is doingA, is really good for the investors.I think people taking on mining risk and receivingtheir coupon in Bitcoin is awesome.I think it’s really valuable.It’s an exciting financial product.Harry Sudock (45:22):So they’re solving capital formation inan interesting way.The other instrument that they’re in theprocess of solving for is how do I hedge difficultyand how do I hedge Bitcoin price, and there’vebeen a lot of swings at this that a bunchof different people have taken, but reallywhat people want to do is they want to be… And I’m speaking from the perspectiveof the miner, is they want to be long difficultyand they want to be short Bitcoin price.Preston Pysh (45:52):I need to wrap my head around that.They want to be long difficulty and shortBitcoin price?Harry Sudock (45:59):Yeah.A miner’s, natural position, I buy rig,I plug in rig, I mine Bitcoin.You’re short difficulty because your Bitcoinyield goes up when difficulty goes down.So you’re naturally shorter and your longBitcoin, because your ASIC is correlated toBitcoin and your revenues are obviously Bitcoindenominated.So the way you hedge that is with a productthat gets you long difficulty and short price.Preston Pysh (46:26):I got you.Your returns aren’t going to be nearly asgood as just buying the underlying, but ifyou’re looking for something that removesthe volatility out of Bitcoin, you’re goingto achieve it through owning something likethis, but it’s going to be at a lower return.Harry Sudock (46:41):Exactly.So ideally this would be a product that youwould be able to roll out for whatever percentageof your COGS … Your business needs to achievereliably.Then it’s about how much of a haircut areyou willing to take to achieve stability onyour COGS, cost of goods sold.Preston Pysh (47:00):Got it.Hey, so we had a question on Twitter.A person was asking, “What’s the hottesttopic right now in passive cooling and wherethe technology is heading to.”Harry Sudock (47:14):This is a very technical question.It’s a very interesting one, but the questionis really what is the best way to design aBitcoin mining facility.That’s really what’s being asked here.It’s being asked around, how do you cooland there’s sort of a two-prong school ofthought, which is air cool versus liquid cool.We think that air cooled can really work effectively,but not everywhere.So we’re seeing a ton of machines come onlinein Texas from a lot of different operators,and there’s certainly areas within the ERCOTgrid within west Texas that needs liquid cool,immersion cooling to function effectively.Harry Sudock (47:53):So our expectation is that that’s goingto be an area of growth.We’re excited about where it’s headed,but we want to make sure to be part of thegroup that gets it right, not that tries toget it early.Preston Pysh (48:04):It just shows, I think the question reallydemonstrates to people just how complex allof the considerations that you have to makeas you’re trying to allocate the free cashflows of your business, while constantly offsettingthem with just the price of Bitcoin and retainingyour earnings in Bitcoin.Right now is a perfect example where we justhad the price get down to like 30,000 now.Preston Pysh (48:30):I’m looking at the price right now.Evidently, it just went up to 40,000.I see your eyes just lit up.It’s back to 38.The thing’s all over the place.It’s so volatile and you’re trying toget that timing right of like this preciousthing that you’re mining and you’re tryingto retain at all costs, but you also wantto keep buying more rigs so that you can getmore of this stuff and that equation is anythingbut simple, especially when you’re talkingabout like, well, so what does the coolingget you as far as being able to run the machineharder?Oh my Lord, it’s just so complex.It’s amazing.Harry Sudock (49:08):The beauty of this business is, and what youjust described is why I have so much respectfor anybody operating mining at scale, isjust that there are no experts yet.The most expert people have been around forfour, five, six years.What other business has the most seasonedveterans with five years experience?Nobody.Preston Pysh (49:29):Nobody.Exactly.Harry Sudock (49:32):You know about the history of airplanes.What did the airplane industry look like fiveyears in, relative to today?Preston Pysh (49:38):Relative to today.It’s just laughable-Harry Sudock (49:40):[inaudible 00:49:40]and we’re there.So my perspective is that truly mature, industrialscale, future proof, Bitcoin miners are gettingforged today, but that operations don’tlook like that yet.There’s a tremendous amount of money tobe made.There’s a tremendous amount of capital formationrequired to do it, but the people operatingthese businesses successfully are really,really, really, really special and that’snot me.Harry Sudock (50:09):That credit on our team goes to the engineeringfolks, goes to the people writing all of thisproprietary software, running all of thisdetailed analysis around hardware and mechanicalengineering.This is a deeply technical business and we’relost without them on our team.Preston Pysh (50:26):I really like this question.A person asks the easiest method to shieldBTC to state grid operators.Harry Sudock (50:33):No megawatt goes unsold.Preston Pysh (50:35):So with that … I love that.How do you involve the bigger players in energyproduction like GE Mitsubishi, Siemens?How do you start to get them more involvedand more excited about this?Because that’s the sell, like you said.What was it?Three or four words.Harry Sudock (50:54):The sell is, show me a detailed breakdownof every hour in the last five years and theprice you sold it for and all the ones whereyou didn’t sell them, you got to be honestand cop to it.So look at those revenues and compare thatto a 1% energy mix allocation to Bitcoin mining,and what does that do for financial returns?It’s ridiculous.Preston Pysh (51:15):Yeah.Especially if you drop it on their balancesheet at the price that they mined it.Harry Sudock (51:20):Exactly.Exactly.That’s the thing.The detractors to Bitcoin and Bitcoin miningjust aren’t running the numbers.This is a ridiculously valuable business andthe reason that it’s so exciting is it’sso transferrable conceptually to massive infrastructureacross other areas of the grid, of energygeneration, of utilities, of all the ONG stuffthat’s going on.So the sell for Bitcoin to a hedge fund ispretty easy.The sell for Bitcoin mining to an energy operatorshould be easy.Preston Pysh (51:59):But you’re saying it’s not.Harry Sudock (52:04):To me, it’s like the same thing that wejust talked about with the way that Mike Sayloris able to enact his capital formation, Bitcoinallocation strategy, versus why a miner can’tdo it as easily.There’s operational risks, there’s businessrisks, there’s volatility risks.That’s harder to tolerate in our businessand that’s why we have levered upside tothe underwire.We get paid for it.Preston Pysh (52:25):Do you see them coming around?Has the conversation gotten easier in thepast year?Harry Sudock (52:29):Yes.Preston Pysh (52:30):It has.Harry Sudock (52:31):We get inbound at this point.Preston Pysh (52:33):Oh, that’s awesome.Harry Sudock (52:35):I think that there’s a gap in between peoplesaying, “We’re ready to mine Bitcoin directlyto our balance sheet,” versus, “Hey, canwe develop a relationship with you Griid,the Bitcoin miner to better optimize our energyrevenues.”So we’re still living in the, we generateand sell power and we’re living in the worldof we buy power.That’s still the nature of the relationshiprather than the energy producer saying, “Hey,how do we [inaudible 00:52:59] balance sheetand how do we use mining to do it?”Harry Sudock (53:01):So we’re not there yet, but I think thatthe conversation around what role does theBitcoin miner play within a stable, reliable,high uptime grid, that has changed dramaticallyand we’ve been at the forefront of that.So when we think about how to make Bitcoinmining work in the US, we spend a massiveamount of time investing in our energy relationships,and those investments have paid off massively.We love working deeply with energy partnersand we think that it’s at the core of everythingwe do.Preston Pysh (53:33):All right.Harry, it’s hard for me to believe thatwe’ve been talking for an hour already,because that went super fast.My last question is for you to pull out yourcrystal ball here, and everyone wants to knowwhen you think the hash rate is going to reacha new all-time high, and then I’ll tellyou what my guess is after this.Then when we’re both wrong, probably everyonecan tease us.Harry Sudock (53:56):Yeah, fair.Preston Pysh (53:57):let’s hear it.Harry Sudock (53:59):I think that we see new hash rate all timehigh … Let’s just be specific.Does that mean 180X a hash?Preston Pysh (54:06):Yeah, if that’s whatever the high was before,then yes.I don’t even know what it was and here Iam guessing.Harry Sudock (54:14):Let’s use the data.I’m looking at a seven day average overthe last year.The peak on the seven day average was 179.3.I think we returned to that in 10 months.Preston Pysh (54:30):All right.I was going to say Christmas day, but nowyou got me concerned because you’re a littlebit further out there than me.You’re biasing my original guests.I’ll say Valentine’s day 2022.We’ll see what happens.I’m with you.I think it’s going to take a lot of timefor this to come back online.Everything that was shut down in China.So it’s almost like you have to rebuildall that hashing that has occurred and whenyou look at how far it’s come down, thattook a year to build to where we got to.That was like a year of building hash rate.Preston Pysh (55:04):So it’s going to be interesting to see howlong this takes.I know there’s a lot of people that areinterested in knowing when the price is goingto recover back to the previous all time high,but I’m pretty sure we’re going to getthere faster than the hash rate recovery,but who knows.We’ll find out.Any highlights or anything … Any articlesthat you read that were really interestingor anything that you want to point peopletowards here at the end?Harry Sudock (55:29):I think that the industry really benefitsfrom more people who are fluent around energy.So there’s a great book that’s out thereright now, and I promise no affiliations calledThe Grid, one I.It’s by Gretchen Bakke.After the colon is, The Fraying Wires BetweenAmericans and Our Energy Future.I think that even if some of your listenersare not all the way bought into Bitcoin, whichI don’t know after listening to you howthey wouldn’t be, but we all have a hugevested interest in high reliability, highstability, energy being available to us.Harry Sudock (56:03):It’s integral to everything we do.It’s part of leading a modern high qualitylife.So getting more informed around how energyis created, how it’s transmitted and howit gets consumed is just a really … I thinkit’s a fundamental coherence building blockfor the modern conversation around energy,which is bigger than Bitcoin for now, butI think the queen plays a vital role in thatconversation going forward.Preston Pysh (56:28):Awesome.Awesome recommendation.I’m going to pick that up.People, if you want to find a Harry, I’mgoing to have a link in the show notes tohis Twitter.What is the handle on Twitter, Harry?Harry Sudock (56:39):It’s @harry_sudock.S-U-D-O-C-K.I welcome all resumes.Preston Pysh (56:46):Well, there you go, folks.If you’re interested in working with Harry,make sure you guys follow him on Twitter andwe’re also going to have a link to the bookrecommendation there as well.Harry, with that, thank you so much for
