  "text": "Hey, everyone.Welcome to the show.I’m here with Jason Lowery.Jason, this is long overdue.This discussion is long overdue.I’m really excited to have this with you,so welcome to the show.Jason Lowery (00:01:53):Thanks, Preston.I’ve been a low-key fan boy of yours fora while.So very excited to be here.Preston Pysh (00:01:58):I’m honored.I’m honored.Hey, so I want to start off this conversationwith this idea of property rights.So Jeff Booth is really big on first principles.Let’s start with the first principles thinkingon all of this, and you had made this recommendationto me when we were talking about how to goabout the show.I think it’s a great idea about propertyrights and how they first emerged, and thenI guess we’ll just take it from there afteryou take that away.Jason Lowery (00:02:26):Okay.Cool.Yeah.So property rights, how they first emerged,how sapiens first started managing their internalresources, determining who has control authorityover those resources, determining how to settledisputes related to property rights, and alsoachieving consensus on the legitimate stateof ownership and chain of custody of property.So at some point in the time scale of humanbeings, we started experimenting with differentprotocols for doing that, but where we camefrom was effectively a proof of power protocol.Jason Lowery (00:03:05):So before sapiens and even before primates,most animals, especially pack animals, whenthey just took down a kill and they have excessmeat, it is an existential imperative forthose pack animals to manage those resources,to determine who has the pecking order, essentiallylike, “How do you divvy those up?Whose property does this belong to?”So it’s important to realize that this isan existentially important question.Jason Lowery (00:03:33):The way natural selection has optimized itselfis what you see in surviving animals today,which is for the overwhelming majority ofcases, when pack animals have property todistribute amongst the pack, they feed andthey breed the most powerful members of thepack.So the powerful, the power projectors, poweras in watts, as in joules per second, literallythe strongest members of the pack get firstdips, and then if they have property disputeslike a group of wolves, like a pack of wolves,they settle those disputes through physicalpower competition.So they snarl and bite at each other, andthey’re constantly doing this.So they’re constantly snarling and bitingat each other and establishing the state ofownership and chain of custody of their propertyusing this proof of power protocol, you couldcall it.Jason Lowery (00:04:26):The reason why they appear to have done thatis because of, like I said before, naturalselection.So something that a lot of people forget whenthey’re evaluating or studying nature issomething called survivorship bias, wherethey forget that what you observe in natureis what has survived a very rigorous selectionprocess.So the reason why you see so many pack animalsuse this proof of power protocol for establishingconsensus on the legitimate state of ownershipand chain of custody property within theirpacks is because all the other animal packsthat used other techniques didn’t survive.Jason Lowery (00:05:06):So right away, you already see that this proofof power protocol where people settle disputeswith power competitions and achieve consensuson the legitimate state of ownership and chainof custody of property, and determine resourcecontrol over it using physical power, thatis the protocol that has survived naturalselection.That’s why you see it in nature.So that’s just something too that’s worthnoting because humans, sapiens, for whateverreason after we transitioned from the upperPaleolithic era into the Neolithic era, inthe beginning, there wasn’t really muchof a sign.There isn’t really much of a sign in thehuman fossil record throughout the Paleolithicage of any meaningful scale like killing ofhumans, human on human killing.There’s not really much on in the fossilrecord.Jason Lowery (00:05:54):In the Neolithic age, we adopted new typesof protocols for establishing consensus onthe legitimate state of ownership and chainof custody of our internal resources, andthen after we established these new protocols,you start to see signs of massive scale warfare.So this is really important to pull the threadon from both an anthropology perspective,but also the core.Really, what it comes down to when we talkabout Bitcoin is really just a philosophyabout how do you determine the basis for whichyou establish resource control authority anddeter, have consensus on those legitimatestate of ownership and chain of custody ofan underlying piece of property.Jason Lowery (00:06:33):So what sapiens started doing is they startedabstracting.Sapiens have really big neocortexes.They started coming up with imaginary alternativesto the proof of power protocol.So what they effectively started doing wasappointing people with imaginary power.We could call it rank, for example.So in the neolithic age, you started to seesigns of rank, and it was really obvious inthe fossil record because of how they burypeople of high rank.They bury people of high rank with much moreliterally gold-plated graves and the greatpyramids and stuff.These are people with such imaginary powerthat they are … People legitimately believethey’re gods.Jason Lowery (00:07:14):So early in this age, we had god kings.So the god kings got the resource controlauthority.So they were the ones that determined whatthe legitimate state of ownership and chainof custody and property was, and if peoplehad disputes on their property rights, thatgod kings would adjudicate those disputes,but at the end of the day, it is all justan abstraction, right?Let’s be real.They probably weren’t actually gods andthen there’s no indication that they were.Preston Pysh (00:07:41):I think you see some of this abstraction injust … You ever see these videos of maybea smaller dog being the alpha dog and there’sother larger dogs there, but the little oneis dry, it’s calling the shots in the house.Is that abstract power?Would you consider that being just becausethat little guy has convinced the others thatit’s more powerful, even though it’s physicallynot, it’s very clear that it’s physicallynot, in their mind, the larger dogs are lookingat and saying, “Yeah, I guess I need tolisten to this little thing that’s yappingat me,” or whatever.Jason Lowery (00:08:18):So that is actually a great example for tworeasons.So the first one is the little yapping dogis, in my opinion, doing the physical powerprojection technique.So what a yapping dog is doing is saying,“I will impose a physically prohibitivecost on you.I am defending my territory by signaling toyou my capacity to impose a severe physicalprohibitive cost.”So it’s a form of deterrence.This is the same thing that we do when weblow up, rattling.They’ll get a B-2 bomber fly low pass rightacross their coast just to remind them orwhen you’re down range, all the shows offorce.Preston Pysh (00:08:57):Peacocking.Jason Lowery (00:08:58):Yeah.You’re just letting people know, it’slike, “I have the capacity to impose severephysical prohibitive cost.”Now, the reason why it’s hilarious withwhen the little dog does it is because whenthe little dog is yapping at the bigger dog,the bigger dog has been domesticated.They’re both domesticated.So those dogs have been their wolves, extremelyaggressive wolves that over 40,000 years havehad their physical aggression and their inclinationto be physically aggressive, essentially bredout of them.So domestication is the process of humansdeliberately removing a animal pack’s inclinationto impose physically prohibitive costs, makingthem docile.Jason Lowery (00:09:41):The reason why that’s a such great exampleis because that gives us what is essentiallywhat we need to causally infer that the relationshipbetween when you stop projecting power, whenyou forfeit your power and you stop tryingto secure yourself by imposing physicallyprohibitive costs on your attackers, there’sthis direct causal effect of you become lesssecure.Jason Lowery (00:10:04):So for example, a lot of people will say,“Well, correlation doesn’t necessarilyimply causation,” but if you have randomizedAB testing across 40 different domesticatedanimals and in every case when you removetheir physical aggression, when you removetheir capacity and inclination to impose severephysical prohibitive costs on their attackers,they do become demonstrably insecure.We have the data to do the causal inferenceoff that because we eat it for breakfast andfor lunch and for dinner or we cuddle withit like we do with our dogs.Jason Lowery (00:10:37):So domestication is proof that if you do adifferent protocol than the proof of powerprotocol, then you risk systemic exploitationbecause that is what domestication represents,fundamentally, is the systemic exploitation,and it’s randomized.It’s like a natural experiment because wenever actually-Preston Pysh (00:10:55):Because nothing … You’d never see thatin nature.Jason Lowery (00:10:56):Right.Yeah.So I always joke because I love wiener dogsand I love Italian greyhounds and whippets,but I always joke, “Those are abominationsof nature.We literally bred these creatures to worshipof us.They would never survive in the Siberian wilderness,”and if that yappy little dog ever acted thatway to Siberian wolves, it wouldn’t turnout the way.So they only get away with that because they’reall domesticated animals.It’s the same reason why.That is essentially the foundation of modernagrarian society is our ability to make animalsless physically aggressive, less inclinedto impose physical power, to impose costson us, and then as a result of that, we cantake advantage of them.Preston Pysh (00:11:43):I’m not trying to jump ahead, but I guesswe got our example of proof of stake rightthere.Jason Lowery (00:11:48):Well, so what we have shown using a causallyinferable randomized dataset is that thereare dramatic strategic security implicationsfor choosing not to project power becausewhen we do it to animals, look what happens.We turn orcs into ox and then they becomepack animals and they become slaves and theygrow our grain to feed the other slaves thatwe’ve domesticated, slave being the domesticatedcandid animals.Jason Lowery (00:12:18):You turn boars into pigs, you turn junglefowl into chicken.So the difference between a boar and a pigis the pig doesn’t put up a fight.So that gets to be a major issue when we getto agrarian society because of abstract thinking.Abstract thinking enables theology, philosophy,enables ideologies, and it became consideredmorally reprehensible to use physical poweras the basis for which you settle propertydisputes or determine resource control authorityor chief consensus on the legitimate stateof ownership and chain of custody of property,and it was essentially morally condemned fortwo reasons.Jason Lowery (00:13:02):The first one being because of the energythat it uses.It’s very energy-intensive to establisha pecking order using physical power.Just watch a pack of wolves.It looks exhausting.They’re constantly fighting against eachother.Then of course, obviously, if you use physicalpower as the basis to do this, then you riskphysical injury if you’re doing it kinetically.So if you’re imposing physically prohibitivecosts kinetically using force to displacemass, then obviously, you’re going to haveaccidents.I say accidents because a lot of pack animalshave natural instincts to basically pull theirpunches to effectively not injure each other.Jason Lowery (00:13:43):So they have to figure out a way to use poweras the basis to achieve consensus on the legitimatestate of ownership of property, but they havenatural instincts which prevent them fromobviously killing each other because that’san obvious existential threat.If wolves fought each other to the death overevery stake, there would be no pack anymorebecause all the wolves would die, and humanshave the same, and most, a lot of primateshave the same natural instinct.Jason Lowery (00:14:06):So lieutenant colonel, I think his name’sGrossman, Army psychologist and a bunch ofother psychologists, they’ve led multiplestudies to show and basically quantify theaversion that humans have to injuring otherhumans.The famous example that I always use thatI got from Lieutenant Colonel Grossman wasthe example of Gettysburg, where when theytook the rifles off the soldiers that werekilled in Gettysburg, and 80% of those rifleshad never been fired, and several of thoserifles had been double and triple stuffedwith ball and powder.So it was implying that these soldiers thathad died were not firing their shots and werein fact faking full fire and reload sequencesduring the battle.Jason Lowery (00:14:55):That’s how powerful the natural instinctis to not impose lethal costs on or not physicallyor lethally injure fellow humans.Then he makes the argument that when you startedhaving long range weapons and then, of course,airplanes and bombs and stuff like that, youbasically stop seeing the person you’rekilling, and that was part of the reason whywar fighting became so lethal during the 1900sis because you don’t have that natural instinctprohibiting you anymore.Jason Lowery (00:15:20):So anyways, that is all to say that humanshave a very strong inclination to not usephysical power as the basis for which theysettle disputes, determine who gets to controlthe resources and achieve consensus on thelegitimate state of ownership and chain ofcustody of property.So they use an abstract form of power, andthis abstract form of power is consideredbetter because it does not use energy.Jason Lowery (00:15:47):It reminds you of proof of stake, right?Also, obviously, it doesn’t cause injurybecause it’s abstract, right?You can’t cause injury because it’s noteven physical.So that was the basis of abstract power hierarchies.The reason why agrarian society adopted theseabstract power hierarchies where they hadthese people of different ranks, they hadthe judges, they had the kings, and they hadthe resource control authority, and basedoff of what they say, you get to do all thethings that you need to do to manage resources,but there are, of course, major systemic differenceswhen you do that.Jason Lowery (00:16:22):So we’ve already established that when youtake the will to fight out of domesticatedanimals, they become systemically exploitable.That same thing repeated itself when agrariansociety first adopted these abstract powerhierarchies because these god kings essentiallyexploited their populations at egregious scales.Preston Pysh (00:16:41):You still see this today.I mean, look at North Korea.They think Kim Jong-un a god.It’s crazy.Jason Lowery (00:16:48):Yeah, yeah.It’s a trust based system.You have to trust in your god king and thebenevolence of your god king effectively becausewhen you create an abstract form of power,they are essentially, in many cases, unimpeachable.They have unimpeachable power now, and youhave also technically removed the constraintsof their control authority.So whereas the alpha wolf can only controlwhat he has the physical power to control,if you change it to abstract power, thereis technically no limit to what that god kingcan claim power over.So you can expand their abstract power andabstract resource control authority at zeromarginal cost.He can just say, “I’m the god, so everything’sfine,” and it’s like, “Okay.Well, I guess you’re right.”So if you look at how-Preston Pysh (00:17:41):Jason, real fast.It seems like the physical power would’vebeen bound by geographic region.You can only expand it so far, at least throughouthistory, and we can get into the argumentsof where we’re at now with Bitcoin, specifically,but in the past, it seems like you were boundby a range or it was very difficult to extendout.Jason Lowery (00:18:04):Yeah.So that’s actually a huge point becauseI’ve made this point before too.Let’s fast forward to today, okay?There’s a bunch of physical resources.The main one that people seem to enjoy isthe surface area of the earth, that is a resourcethat sapiens seem to value.So the question is, how should sapiens manageresource control authority over the surfacearea of the earth and determine what the “legitimatestate of ownership and chain of custody”of the surface area of the earth is?Jason Lowery (00:18:38):So if you take an extraterrestrial point ofview and you’re an alien and you’re visitingearth and you’re looking at the sapiensfrom your extraterrestrial point of view,sapiens are just one single species.So you look at them and then you would noteto yourself, you would say, “That’s interesting.They don’t have centralized control overthe surface area of the earth.For some reason, they decentralize their controlauthority over the surface area of the earth,and they do it using a massive scale, global,physical power projection.”Jason Lowery (00:19:14):So there’s no one government that has abstractcontrol authority over all the resources ofthe earth.In fact, sapiens deliberately prohibit that.How?By imposing a physically prohibitive costson gaining single and centralized controlauthority over all of the surface area ofthe earth.So effectively, that is the proof of workprotocol where we are using power, physicalpower, and we have a bunch of different largescale physical power competition, and thebenefit of that large scale power competitionon a global scale is decentralization of controlauthority over earth’s natural resources.Preston Pysh (00:19:58):Wow.Jason Lowery (00:19:59):So basically, yes, you’re exactly right.In fact, at scale, because a lot of peoplewill say, “Well, military centralized power,”it’s like, “No.Take a global picture of it.It is precisely the case that no country cangain 51% control over all the natural resourcesbecause we’re constantly engaging in thisphysical power competition,” and anytimeMr. Genghis Khan or Mr. Adolf Hitler or whoevertries to achieve centralized control authorityover physical resources, the reason why thissystem is secure is because there’s no limitto how much power honest people can sum togetherto make it too physically cost prohibitedto achieve centralized control authority overresources.Preston Pysh (00:20:45):The idea just struck a chord on a book thatI read that I’ve never even talked aboutbefore, but this was a book that in the summaryat the back of this, it gets into that exactpoint that you just made is the physical cost,that great, and here’s the title of thebook, The Rise and Fall of Great Powers.This is by Paul Kennedy, and that’s oneof the main things at the end.The summary is that the thing that you seethrough each one of these great powers throughouttime is they overextend themselves militarily.It almost always also corresponds with themdebasing currency and trying to, a lot ofthe stuff you’re seeing right now playingout in the world as far as offsetting someof that and expending and having all thisgross fiscal spending and the power projectionas they push out to a company that large fiscalspending to try to offset the issues thatthey’re having with their currencies.That being the crux of how all these greatsuperpowers have failed over time.It’s a fascinating read if people want todig into it.What was the one that you just held up, Jason?Jason Lowery (00:21:57):This one’s called The Collapse of ComplexSocieties.This was recommended to me by Natalie Smolenskifrom the Texas Blockchain Council, but it’snot just that.It has multiple different explanations forhow complex societies break down, but yeah,that’s a clear trend in history.The opposite is also true.Another clear trend is when people stop keepinga military or they deliberately impede theirown capacity to project physical power, theytend to have Hannibal at their gates reallyquickly.So there’s a balance there, but yeah, it’sreally interesting.Preston Pysh (00:22:42):Another point that’s very pertinent to theworld today, but anyway-Jason Lowery (00:22:50):Yeah, there’s so many good examples now.I often joke.It’s just like, “I don’t even need towrite this thesis anymore because it’s justplaying out in realtime.”Preston Pysh (00:23:00):It’s crazy.Jason Lowery (00:23:01):By the time it publishes, it’ll just beprobably obvious, but I guess what we’restarting to speak about now is the systemicbenefits, the systemic trade offs of abstractpower hierarchies as a basis for controllingresources and physical power hierarchies.So the big ones that we’ve highlighted iswhen you use physical power as the basis forwhich you manage your resources, physicalpower is inclusive.Meaning, every single person can have accessto physical power.Jason Lowery (00:23:37):You all are always able to swing a fist orswing a sword if you ever achieve a statewhere you’re being invaded or you’re beingexploited by your god king.So it’s a highly inclusive protocol everyonecan fight.Physical power is also unbounded.So there is no limit to the amount of … There’stheoretically no limit to the amount of physicalcosts you can impose in watts, especiallyafter humans discovered fire because it usedto be like animals can only project as muchpower as they can summon endogenously offof their own calories that they ingest andcan swing through their muscles, but especiallyonce humans found gun powder and these otherpower projection technologies, what that representsis you’re tapping into an exogenous supplyof power and then using that to impose physicallyprohibitive costs on your attackers or yourexploiters.Again, power meaning physical watts.Jason Lowery (00:24:31):So that game, this power projection game,has scaled to the point of nuclear weapons.That’s how when we say there’s theoreticallyno limit to the amount of power that honestpeople can summon to defend themselves, thathas scaled to the point of we could actuallydestroy the planet at this point.We have that means now.That’s how high this honest people can scalethat.Jason Lowery (00:24:55):Another big one, and this is a huge one, whenwe get into a future conversation about proofof work versus proof of stake is that physicalpower is systemically exogenous.Meaning, it cannot be systemically exploited.Whereas rank people can change their rankor people can change the rules so that rankhas more abstract power than not, right?Rank is instantiated by the system itselfand, therefore, is systemically exploitable,but physical walks is an ontologically differentphenomenon that exists completely outsideof these abstract power hierarchies that weuse to manage resources.So it doesn’t matter.Jason Lowery (00:25:35):This is why all those movie examples wherethe … It’s like those David-Goliath stories,where it’s like there’s someone of highrank, there’s some king, and they’ve gottheir abstract power hierarchy, and they’vegot themselves systemically secured, and it’sjust like you’re just going to get steamrolledby these peasants with their sorts becauseyou can’t exploit their power.It’s exogenous to the system that you’rethe king of.Then another big one, and you mentioned thistoo, but it’s a huge one, is that, obviously,physical power is physically decentralized.So you can actually validate, you actuallysee physical power, and you can actually validateit.Okay.Compare that to stake.Well, actually, let’s say the bad sidesagain, though, physical power is energy intensiveand physical power is prone to causing injury.So those are the downsides, but everythingelse, if physical power was not energy intensiveor if it was highly energy efficient, andif physical power had no capacity to causeinjury, say, if it was in an electric form,then it would be a fantastic, it would bea highly systemically secure protocol, andit would probably not be condemned as ideologicallybad on any philosophical or theological reasonsbecause it is so good at preventing systemicexploitation or invasion.Jason Lowery (00:27:02):When you use abstract power, abstract poweris non-inclusive.So not everyone gets to have a high rank.In fact, usually, there’s one person atthe top and they’ve got most of the power,but the point is not everyone can have accessto it.So it’s non-inclusive and, therefore, notfully representative.Jason Lowery (00:27:21):Another problem with abstract power is it’sbounded in zero sum.So there is a hard limit.There’s a mathematical limit to how muchabstract power that honest people can useto represent their interests or do some otherthings, and that becomes a very big systemicdifference that is important to call out withproof of stake, but we’ll wait until weget there.Then another problem with abstract power is,obviously, it’s physically impossible tosee it.It’s impossible to validate if it’s decentralized.Like we said before, there’s essentiallyno limit to how far you can scale your abstractpower.Preston Pysh (00:28:02):It only exists in the imagination of the oneto number of people that are part of saidsystem, correct?Jason Lowery (00:28:11):Yeah.So if they’re unsympathetic to your abstractpower, then it’s completely useless or ifthey don’t understand your laws becausethey speak completely different language orif you’ve been geographically separated.Preston Pysh (00:28:23):So for abstract power to work in the interimbecause it seems like it’ll always be aninterim way to project power, the trend ofparticipants always has to be going up insteadof collapsing down.Is that fair?Jason Lowery (00:28:38):Yeah.You expand the scale of your abstract powerhierarchies by adding more participants.There are some benefits that are worth callingout.The benefits of abstract power is it is notenergy intensive, so it’s highly efficient.It’s like if you live in a well-functioning,trustworthy society, then it is just fantastic.You can get enormous resource abundance fromit because people are trustworthy and they’refollowing the rules and they’re sympatheticto the rules and the people that you trustas intermediaries and the judges are fair.It works out really well, and it has directlyled to the enormous amounts of resource abundanceand prosperity that sapiens, agrarian societyhas experienced.Obviously, it is not capable of causing injury.Jason Lowery (00:29:26):The problem that you just highlighted is ittends to break down over time.The root problem, as someone said, with allthese abstract power hierarchies is that peoplemust be trusted not to exploit them, not tobe unsympathetic to them, not to invade them,and history is filled with examples of breachesof that trust.Preston Pysh (00:29:46):So it requires trust.Jason Lowery (00:29:48):So it is a trust-based system, yes.You must trust the people of high rank thatare appointed over you to not abuse theirrank or you must trust the neighbors thatare unsympathetic to your laws, the Hannibal’sout there, the Genghis Khans out there tojust-Jason Lowery (00:30:00):The Hannibals out there, the Genghis Khansout there, to just not roll in and take yourstuff.And so, for these reasons, it’s systemicallyinsecure because so long as you have and relyon abstract power, you are technically powerlessfrom a physical standpoint.You have no capacity to impose severe physicallyprohibitive costs on people who either tryto invade you or try to exploit you.Preston Pysh (00:30:27):Parasites are not allowed into an abstractpower situation, or it will eventually collapseupon itself.Jason Lowery (00:30:37):But the problem is, if you are a parasiteor a sociopath or you’re just a guy thatwants a lot of control authority over resources,abstract power hierarchies create a nice,beautiful honey pot for you.All you have to do is become a high rankingperson.Preston Pysh (00:30:55):They’re incentivized to find it.Jason Lowery (00:30:59):Yeah.It’s like moths to a flame.Preston Pysh (00:31:01):Wow.I’m sorry, but to me that’s a super powerfulstatement that I have never thought about.Jason Lowery (00:31:09):And also, that’s why you see nepotism inabstract power hierarchy over the course ofa growing society.So they will come up with abstract reasonsto say why these high ranked positions shouldstay in the bloodline.And so I’m the king.I was appointed by [inaudible 00:31:26], there’ssome God that says I have a divine right tobe this powerful, abstract powerful.And my son carries my blood and thereforecarries my abstract power.They come up with reasons.And over time that becomes very bad becausethe people at the high positions of abstractpower are literally deformed.They’re inbred freaks.The King Tut Exhibit is here in Boston.King Tut was not a healthy person.These God kings and the kings, there’s somany examples.It’s not meritocratic at all because there’sliterally inbreeding just to keep their abstractpower.Jason Lowery (00:32:05):Anyways, yeah.And so it’s like moths to a flame.It is actually way easier to exploit peoplethrough positions of higher rank than it wouldbe if they used physical power as the methodto do it.And so, this gets back into the case withthe wolves or with any form of abstract power,or sorry, physical power projectors in nature.It’s like, yeah, these wolves constantlyfight over each other, but that alpha is notexploiting their pack like humans can throughtheir abstract power hierarchies.It is much more of a meritocracy than whatsapien structures look like, what their abstractpower structures look like for that reason.Jason Lowery (00:32:48):And so this is why I often bring up the exampleof stags or a lot of different herbivoresbecause what’s cool about what they’vedone is they actually evolved a way to continuethe power projection game where they use physicalpower as the basis through which they achieveresource control, authority and determinelegitimacy of ownership or chain of custodyof property.But they have designed these weird thingsthat come out of their heads and they’renot horns.So they’re not pointy.They’re all tangled at the end.And so when they butt heads and they fighteach other, they actually get entangled bydesign to prevent themselves from injuringeach other.But those same antlers can be used to stabenemy predators that are attacking them.Jason Lowery (00:33:36):So they’ve created a way where they canuse physical power and they can still havelethal things on their heads to help imposephysical costs if they need to defend themselves.But when they use those same devices to achievepecking order internally, it minimizes thecapacity for injury.It doesn’t completely eliminate it.Accidents happen, and sometimes their antlersinterlock a little bit too much and they die.Preston Pysh (00:33:59):Another one that I find fascinating on theproof of work is bees.I find how the queen bee, I guess, goes outand then the fastest one is the one that geneticline is passed on.You might know more about it than I do, butthat is just fascinating to me.And it’s exactly what you’re getting atas far as projecting watts or power in thisphysical power display.Jason Lowery (00:34:28):Honey bees are a fantastic example of strategicsecurity because they literally create a honeypot.Security problem, right?It’s honey, everyone wants their honey.Yeah.It’s literally a honey pot security problem.Honey bees have stingers, but those stingersdon’t protect the individual honeybee.When a honey bee stings something, they willsink that thing so deep in their skin that,because of how it’s designed, the only wayto get that thing to detach from the personthey sting is to disembowel themselves andthen they die.So a stinger on a honeybee is not designedto protect the honeybee, it’s not designedfor self-defense.The stinger of a honeybee is designed to inflictas much pain as possible on an attacker, toimpose as much physically prohibitive costson an attacker for the systemic defense ofthe hive.And they will die in the process of doingit.Not to protect themselves, but to protectthe hive.And it’s just a great illustration of thatpoint.Jason Lowery (00:35:32):The really easy and simple way to think aboutit is, everything has a benefit to cost ratioof attacking or being attacked.There’s some benefit of attacking someoneand there’s some cost of attacking someone.And so if you want to be systemically secure,you need the cost of attacking you to be ashigh as possible, and you need to strive tokeep it high in order to keep your benefitto cost ratio as low as possible.And you can never know how much is enoughcost.You don’t know how much ability to imposephysically, severe physically prohibitivecosts you need to ensure that you’re ‘secure’.So you just have to be able to ensure thatyou have that ability and strive to do itas much as possible and kind of manage it.Jason Lowery (00:36:12):When you use abstract power hierarchies andyou get enormous amounts of resource abundance,but you don’t have a military to protectit.So you have all this freshly irrigated farmland,but you have no soldiers to protect it, yourbenefit to cost ratio is extremely high.The benefit of attacking you is high.The cost of attacking you is low.You’re going to get Sargon the Conqueroror Charlemagne or Napoleon or all these othereconomists that have ever lived.They’re going to take advantage of yourhigh benefit to cost ratio.And this is how it works in nature too.So it’s not like it’s a sapien thing.Preston Pysh (00:36:45):So let’s pause there.So people are hearing about power projection,they’re hearing about physical power projectionversus abstract.I would just generically say the one is proofof work, the other one is a proof of stakeidea.And we’re going to cover those in much moredetail here.But before we do that, I want to ask you aboutthe basics of computer science and how computerprogramming emerged before we then transitionthose ideas that we just talked about to proofof stake and proof of work found on protocols.Jason Lowery (00:37:17):Yeah, this is really helpful if you just havekind of a quick crash course on computer sciencebecause it’ll make arguments about the differencebetween proof of work and proof of stake alot simpler to understand.So at the end of the day, a computer is simplya general purpose state machine.So it’s a machine where you can change itsstate.And so back in the day, 2,000 years ago, theGreeks had astrolabes, and you could calculatewhere the stars are going to be in the future,where the heavenly bodies are going to bein the future.And the state machine programmer would changeits state by pulling a lever or pushing abutton or turning a dial in some cases.So you’re changing the state of this machine.Jason Lowery (00:38:01):And these state machines are named after theirfunction, not their form.So the main function of a state machine isto compute something, to compute the positionof the heavenly bodies in the future or tocompute whatever.And so these computers, these state machines,have existed for 2,000 years.But only a little over 150 years ago, I guessmaybe a hundred years ago now, 200 years ago,yeah, 200 years, they have been general purpose.So for 2,000 years, state machines were specialpurpose state machines.So if you wanted to compute something, youhad to build a dedicated machine to computethat.Jason Lowery (00:38:36):Babbage and his friends, in the 1830s, startconceiving of this idea called a general purposestate machine.And the reason why that was such a big dealis because you no longer had to build a specialpurpose machine to do a compute that you needed.You could just program this general purposemachine to do it.But the act of programming was the act ofgiving this thing instructions manually bypressing buttons or turning a dial or pullinga lever.And also, the big leap there is that now theact of programming or the act of buildingand designing a special purpose state machineto do your computation became an abstractidea.So you actually didn’t need to build anything.You just needed to think of a good design,and then figure out how to translate whatwas in your brain into instructions for amachine.For example, the first computer programmer,Ada Lovelace, her program was for a machinethat didn’t even exist.Babbage’s analytical engine in the 1830swas never built because it was too expensiveto use, but she could still program it.She could still conceive of the sequence ofoperations that general purpose state machinewould need in order to act like a specialpurpose state machine.Jason Lowery (00:39:53):So an easy way to think about what programmingrepresents is kind of to think about Shakespeare.Shakespeare comes up with a story, an abstract,fictional story called, what’s the famousone?Romeo and Juliet.So Romeo and Juliet is just a fictional story,does not physically exist.It’s a figment of his imagination.And then Shakespeare converts that from animaginary story that’s only in his brain,and he writes it down.So he uses a symbolic language, a syntacticallyand semantically complex language to translatethe fictional story in his head onto a script.And then he hands that script to an actor,and then the actors give a performance.So in that sequence of events, Romeo and Julietis still just an abstract story.It still only exists in abstract reality.It doesn’t physically exist.Just because the medium through which it’scommunicated, the script, physically existsdoesn’t mean Romeo and Juliet exists.And just because actors can act it out andhave an emotionally moving performance thatpeople think is real doesn’t mean Romeoand Juliet is anything but a fictional story.It’s still just a figment in this guy’simagination that he’s communicated througha physical medium.Jason Lowery (00:41:02):Computer programming is effectively the sameway.Computer programmers think of fictional designsin their brain, fictional stories.They write those down on scripts using a newlyinvented symbolic language called machinecode.And then they hand those scripts to machines,and then machines can actually read those.And then the machines act like.They basically role play.These general purpose state machines roleplay according to the instructions that they’vereceived.So at no point did the program actually physicallyexist, just the medium through which it wastransferred to the machine.So if you took my computer right here, thisgeneral purpose state machine, it is a bunchof circuitry.It’s a bunch of floating gate transistorswith electrons on them.So that exists right now.As soon as I ‘load a program on it’, nothing’schanged.It’s still the exact same circuitry.It’s still the exact same electrons storedin floating gate transistors.And if I ‘remove or delete’ that program,the circuits and the floating gate transistorswith the electrons in them are still there.The only thing that has physically changedis the state of the machine, not the stateitself.Jason Lowery (00:42:16):So this usually trips people out when youexplain it, but programming or a program thatyou have loaded or the piece of software thatyou have loaded is just the symbolic meaningthat you apply to the state change of thestate machine.And that’s because a human’s effectivelyfigured out a way to apply symbolic meaningsto circuits, and then they get those circuitsto repeat that symbolic meaning back to them.So a painter thinks of a scene, and he usesphysical paint and canvas to depict that scene.Of course, the scene isn’t real, just thepaint and the canvas is real.And so that’s what we would do with computers.So technically, Preston, you have no experientialknowledge of me whatsoever.Everything that you are seeing is an abstractionright now.You are not looking at me.You are looking at light emitting diodes inan array on a plane controlled by a generalpurpose state machine.You just know based off of where we are withtechnology that I’m probably real, I’mprobably not an AI talking to you.Preston Pysh (00:43:18):I don’t know.I’m not convinced.Jason Lowery (00:43:21):But 20 years in the future, it might not beso easy.And so everything that you see on a computerscreen is a symbolic representation of what’sin someone’s brain that a state machineis acting out for you and making a very convincingthing.And then you false equivalate or you thinkthat it’s real because the physical mediumthrough which it’s communicated to you isreal.So you’re making a false correlation betweenyour abstract ideas and this symbolic meaningand the thing that you see in front of you.But they’re actually two completely separatethings.A program is just an idea floating in abstractreality, virtual reality.That’s why it’s called virtual reality.And a machine, a general purpose state machine,is what physically exists in shared objectivereality.Jason Lowery (00:44:11):So why do we say that?Because that is an extremely trippy way.That’s an extremely hard thing to wrap yourhead around, that we have invented essentiallya symbolic language to speak to machines whothen speak back to us.And that what we’re effectively doing isshowing each other what’s only in our imaginationsthrough the machines that we program, throughthis virtual reality.That’s really hard to understand.So what people do to make it simpler to understandis they do something called hypostatizationwhere they treat these abstract things asif they were concretely real just for simplicity.So we just talk like a program is a physicallyreal thing that is ‘loaded’ onto a machine,just like people talk about the fictionalstory of Romeo and Juliet is loaded into thepages of the script.We just say that it’s-Preston Pysh (00:44:58):It’s a file, it’s a folder, it’s a trashcan here on my desktop.But it’s none of those things.Jason Lowery (00:45:05):Those are abstractions.They don’t physically exist.They’re just figs of our imagination.And it makes it way easier to handle whatis an extreme leap in abstract thinking thathumans only recently discovered 80 years agothrough stored programs, general purpose computerswith von Neumann and his studies.That is so complex.Machine code is so complex-Preston Pysh (00:45:26):It is binary.I mean, mind blowing.Jason Lowery (00:45:31):Yeah, they invented a new logic through BooleanLogic.So they’re implying symbolic meaning tobinary states that are then physically inputinto a computer.And it’s mind blowing.It’s way more complex than any human couldreally understand like maybe von Neumann could.Preston Pysh (00:45:50):I want to pause here because where we’regoing with this, and I think this is importantfor people just to kind of, like why are theytalking about this stuff?We’re talking about this because we’reabout to talk about how Bitcoin, and I’mnot trying to steal the punchline here, butI think it’s important for people to correlatewhy what you just explain is so important.We’re going to talk about the physical realityof energy expenditure, which is real in tangibleform, versus virtual reality, ones and zerosand how one can be exploited and the otherone can’t, and how there’s a tie to physicalreality in one and there’s no tie to physicalreality in the other.And that’s a foot stomp moment.And I’m sorry if I stole.Jason Lowery (00:46:37):No, not yet.No, I still got the punchline.Preston Pysh (00:46:41):So that’s important.That is something to kind of pause, thinkabout, don’t forget it because where we’regoing next ties a lot of what he was justtalking about to this much more deep divein proof of work for Bitcoin, proof of stakefor, call it Ethereum or any other proof ofstake token that’s out there, which is prettymuch everything other than Bitcoin.So are you ready to go there or did you haveother things that you wanted to talk aboutwith respect to the computer science stuff?Jason Lowery (00:47:15):With computer science, the last thing I’llleave is, it’s so complex that we just pileon different abstract ideas to make it simplerfor us to comprehend what is way more complexthan we comprehend.So over the four decades following the developmentof stored program computers where you canapply symbolic meanings to the states of statemachines and all this trippy stuff, that’swhen we get assembly language and then eventuallyhigher order languages like we use today likeC or, in Bitcoin’s case, C++ or Python andall these other things.These are just languages that make it easierto communicate to these machines and, specifically,to communicate our abstract ideas that wedesign in our brains and then we get our computersto role play back to us.Jason Lowery (00:48:05):Cyberspace, this idea of cyberspace, is virtual.Obviously it’s a virtual reality.And so everything in cyberspace does not physicallyexist.The only thing that really physically existsis all the machines and all the computer screensthat we use to basically role play.And it’s like the famous line from the Matrix,when Neo’s visiting the oracle and he seesthat little boy monk and he is like, “Insteadof trying to bend the spoon, only try to realizethe truth.There is no spoon.”That’s actually a legitimate computer scienceprinciple.There is no spoon.We use things like object oriented designas a technique to manage the complexity ofprogramming.And so we arbitrarily choose to describe thecomplex emergent behavior of the machinesthat we program as if it were an object oran orientation of objects simply to make iteasier-Preston Pysh (00:49:06):Because it’s too hard to wrap your headaround it otherwise, right?Jason Lowery (00:49:08):Yeah.It’s too hard to program computers.But more importantly, it’s too hard to explainyour design to other people unless you explainit in terms that they understand.And since all humans live in a three dimensionalreality where objects are oriented aroundthemselves, we arbitrarily choose to describethe complex emergent behavior of these machinesas objects.But the objects are not real.The spoon is not there.There is no spoon.Preston Pysh (00:49:35):It’s just a charge or no charge.Jason Lowery (00:49:39):And the story of Neo is, once you realizethat software is just an abstraction, thenyou can figure out how to exploit it.And then that’s how Neo gets his powersjust because by just simply realizing thatnothing in the matrix is real, therefore there’stechnically no restrictions, no physical restrictions,limits to his power.And so software-Preston Pysh (00:50:00):Reminds you of a clip I might play here atthe end of the show.Jason Lowery (00:50:04):Yeah, I know.And so that’s really important when it comesto the field of software system security becauseit’s important to recognize that softwaredoesn’t break, it can’t break.Software just does exactly as it’s told.So it does exactly as it’s designed.So if there’s ever a hack or if there’sever something bad that happens, nothing wasbroken, people are just taking advantage ofthe rules of the system.Jason Lowery (00:50:35):And so how do people make software more secure,especially if it’s in charge of sensitiveinformation or it has sensitive commands?Sometimes software runs major weapons systems.The way that most software security is doneis by creating an abstract power hierarchywhere you assign rank to certain positions.So like admin privileges or admin rights,these people higher up in the ranks have morecontrol authority, they can access more informationor they can do more dangerous commands.And the way you keep your software secure,at least in the old way, is by these abstractpower hierarchies.Of course, since everything in software isabstract, then the basis through which youchoose to determine resource control authoritywithin your software instantiated system orthe basis through which you choose to achieveconsensus on whatever the legitimate stateof ownership and chain of custody of whetherthe abstraction you’ve created in software,you have to use an abstract power hierarchyto do it because there is no alternative,not until we get to hashing.Jason Lowery (00:51:40):But that’s why it’s just important.There is no spoon.We arbitrarily choose to describe softwareas objects to make it easier to understandtheir complex emergent behavior.And for the purposes of system security, technicallyall software is an abstract power hierarchywhere usually the developer is the one whoeffectively functions as the God king whogives themselves the most abstract power,therefore the most control authority overwhatever resources that software manages.So like Mark Zuckerberg and all these bigtime, they’re God kings.They wield these enormous amount of abstractpower.They have control over billions of people’scomputers and the information on those computers.And they have control authority over resourcesfor no other reason than they’re the highestranking person on Facebook.Preston Pysh (00:52:29):Wow.That is so profound.Jason Lowery (00:52:33):Yeah.And in cyberspace you’ve got all these Godkings emerging.And so you kind of see them doofing it out.And so it’s in this migration of human society.Now we’re, once again, using abstract powerhierarchies to manage our resources, but nowwe’re doing it in cyberspace, managing thingslike information.But if you have abstract power over machines,and people become increasingly more dependenton those machines, then that translates topower over the people too.So for example, weaponized misinformation.If people get all their information from socialmedia and then you’re in charge of socialmedia, if you’re the head honcho at Facebookor whatever, you get to control the informationthat people see that affects their behavior.So it is enormous.People today in cyberspace have levels ofabstract power that would make the pharaohsblush.Preston Pysh (00:53:25):Don’t you think that they also have a bitof physical power too?Because when you describe physical power aswatts, just look at these server farms.Take Zuckerberg for example, all of this dataand all this information that he is storingon behalf of these billions of people requirewatts in order to run these on the hardware.So would you argue that there’s a mix betweenphysical power and abstract power that a guylike that wields?Jason Lowery (00:53:54):Yeah, I guess you could say it’s a mix.There’s two different realities to keeptrack.And this will be helpful when we talk aboutproof of work.There’s abstract reality.All that data on a server, again, it is symbolicmeaning that we assign to electrons in a floatinggate transistor.It’s not actual data, there’s not actualones and zeros.We choose to say this switch and this positionis a one and this one is a zero.And through extraordinarily complex semanticand syntactic language which we get Romeoand Juliet or information out of it.So there’s shared abstract reality.And then in shared objective reality, there’sthe actual physical hardware of the systems.Jason Lowery (00:54:34):And yeah, I guess you could say they havephysical control over that physical hardware,but that is defended the good old fashionedway.That’s on a plot of land, and it’s probablygot a big old fence with a bunch of barbedwire around it.It’s being physically defended.So they have control authority over that.And I guess the physical power of their fence.And they probably have armed guards.So in fact, I know they do have armed guards.That is a form of physical power.But that pales in comparison to the amountof abstract power and resource control authoritythey have from and through cyberspace.Jason Lowery (00:55:12):Now let’s fast forward.So for 60 years, we once again have anotherhoney pot problem where you have these massivedata repositories.You have this capacity to control a bunchof people’s computers all across the world,but you have no capacity to impose physicallyprohibitive costs on the abuse of that information,that data or the abuse of that abstract power.And you have all these people that are designingsystemically exploitative abstract power hierarchiesthrough their software.It’s very obvious.And then you also have all the just massivelevels of hacks and everything.A hack is just people taking advantage ofthe rules of the system.Nothing breaks in a hack, it’s just systemicexploitation.So this big problem with hacking is just essentiallya big problem of people systemically exploitingabstract power hierarchies.And a main challenge of all this is just thefact that you cannot impose physically prohibitivecosts on people in, and from, and throughcyberspace, at least not until Adam Back.Jason Lowery (00:56:11):So that’s why when you think of the hashcost function, that’s why it’s such abig deal is because what he did was he createda program whose sole purpose is to imposea real world physically prohibitive cost onpeople and programs on other computers.So to solve a hash function, you have to usebrute force, physical power.You have to use just electricity and justguess a bunch.So the only point of solving a hash functionis to impose an electricity casa, physicalcosts and watts and non-kinetic, so a nonlethal physical cost, but still a severe physicallyprohibitive cost on solving the hash function.Jason Lowery (00:56:51):And then in return for solving the hash function,in case of Adam Back’s invention with Hashcash,you get a receipt.You say, “Okay, I have proven that I havedone this work.”Or in other words, I have proven real worldpower, I have proven that I have been imposedby real world physical costs.And so there’s a very subtle but importantimplication of that from the perspective ofcyber security.Because in the case of Adam Back, the reasonwhy he created this was to defend againstsystemic abuse.It’s literally called a denial surface countermeasure.So what an easy way to systemically abusepeople is to spam them through email, right?Because there’s no marginal cost.Preston Pysh (00:57:30):I think that’s when Adam came up with this.Jason Lowery (00:57:33):And so Adam, the point of hashing is to imposea real world, physically prohibitive coston people who are spamming or otherwise systemicallyexploiting the abstract power hierarchiesinstantiated by your software.And that’s a big deal.That’s a big piece because, once again,7,000 years ago, you’ve got God kings exploitingpeople through their abstract power.Eventually the slaves figure out, we can imposea physically prohibitive cost on our God kingsand they’ll stop exploiting us.Fast forward to 1997, you’ve got peopleabusing their abstract power hierarchies andAdam Back comes up with a mechanism throughwhich you can impose physically prohibit ofcosts on people exploiting you, and it issuesa receipt and it’s a proof of work receipt.But it doesn’t really matter what it’scalled because it’s all abstract anyways.The point is, you’re imposing physicallyprohibitive costs on people, not in abstractreality, but through shared objective reality.That’s a big deal.Jason Lowery (00:58:26):And from a computer science perspective, it’salso a big deal because it’s kind of creatingthis gateway between worlds where you havereal world electricity passing into the hashfunction.And then coming out of the hash function isa receipt that you can then abstract as anobject and then pass around or, in his case,it wasn’t transferable.But the point is, instead of most things incomputer science where you hypostatize anabstract thing as a concretely real thing.Proof of work does the exact opposite.It’s reverse hypostatization, where youtake a real world thing, electricity, watts,and then you treat it as an abstract receipt.And so that’s huge because now, in cyberspaceor on your computer, if you see that proofof work receipt, you see proof of real, yousee proof of something that physically exists.That’s not true for anything else that yousee on a computer screen.Preston Pysh (00:59:17):For people that are hearing all this terminologyand they’re saying, I hear what you’resaying, but I just can’t really understand,what’s happening in the math?How is the code actually able to imply orapply that physical work in physical realityto the person who’s the attacker?And so if I was going to just very simplytry to demonstrate to people in real timewhat’s happening there, this is a way thatI’m going to put some proof of work on Jasonright now.Jason, I’m thinking of a number between1 and 10.And go, I want you to start guessing whatit is.Jason Lowery (00:59:59):Three.Preston Pysh (00:59:59):No.Jason Lowery (01:00:00):Five.Preston Pysh (01:00:01):No.Jason Lowery (01:00:01):Eight.Preston Pysh (01:00:02):No.Jason Lowery (01:00:03):Nine.Preston Pysh (01:00:00):No.Jason Lowery (01:00:00):Five.Preston Pysh (01:00:01):No.Jason Lowery (01:00:01):Eight.Preston Pysh (01:00:02):No.Jason Lowery (01:00:03):Nine.Preston Pysh (01:00:04):No.The number was seven.So he would keep going through this, right?Until he gets it right.But he’s expending watts, he’s expendingenergy trying to figure out what the numberis, and so through the mathematics, he wouldthen be able to…When he does find the answer and he does seethat it’s seven, he can mathematically,through encryption, prove that that was theonly answer to the question that I asked,which would’ve had…The way I asked it was it’s between 1 and10 and to go, right?There’s a way to verifiably prove that thatwas the only right answer to the questionthat I asked through mathematics.And this is what’s happening, where…And we’re doing this digitally over theinternet, right?This is what’s happening in a proof of worksystem that these miners are solving for,and it’s verifiable through mathematics.Jason Lowery (01:00:57):And there’s a lot of different ways thatyou could design a physical cost function.Adam Back just seems to just nailed it.There are several other people trying to solvethis problem, but the beauty of Adam Backis that it appears to be perfectly fair, likethere’s no advantage gained by anyone.You just have to brute force it, you justhave to randomly guess, and then you’rejust randomly lucky.Preston Pysh (01:01:22):Yeah.Jason Lowery (01:01:22):And so it imposes physically-prohibitive costsevenly to anyone who tries to solve it there.It has no favorites, essentially.But it’s important to emphasize that a proofof work cash cost function is a physical costfunction.Its sole purpose is to impose a real-worldphysically-prohibitive cost on the peoplewho try to solve it, and that’s huge becauseif you demand that someone essentially collateralizeor present proof of work in order to sendyou an email, in the case of that, and that’sHashcash, or to do anything to execute anyaction or to send any bit of information,then what you have technically done in thenon-abstract reality of shared objective realityis impose a physically-prohibitive cost onthem.Preston Pysh (01:02:09):Yeah.Jason Lowery (01:02:10):So we’re talking, this is like the realworld, like now you figured out a way to essentiallycountervail the abstract power of software,of the people who code software, because it’slike your software is not allowed to executea control action or send any information unlessyou present proof of real to me, and by demandingthat receipt, you’ve technically imposeda real-world physically-prohibitive cost onthem.And so Finney took that and he was like, “Okay,that’s pretty sweet.Let’s make that a transferable or a reusableproof of work.”So Adam Back is kind of a stamp, like youjust stamp an email, “Okay, this has imposedphysically-prohibitive costs on someone.”But with reusable proofs of work, then nowyou have enabled this system where you canimpose physically-prohibitive costs on peoplefor anything that you want because these proofsof work can be applied to emails, they couldbe applied to like anything.Jason Lowery (01:03:02):And so that was the original important thingabout hash cost function and proof of work.Now, it had nothing to do…I mean, you could choose to call it a wayto systemically secure money, but it’s that’snot really what it is.It’s a whole new transformational way ofcybersecurity and people are just happen tobe using it for a piece of software that wouldinstantiate something that we could call moneyand monetize.But on its own, by itself, proof of work isa major leap in cybersecurity and computerscience, even if it has nothing to do withmoney whatsoever.Jason Lowery (01:03:37):But the big question hanging over that was,“Okay.Wow, this is pretty insane.We’ve created a way to impose physically-prohibitivecosts on people using this tokenized formof cyber power, this reverse hypothesizedthing where we’ve taken a physically realthing but then transferred it into cyberspaceas an abstract thing but it can still imposereal-world physical costs.”The million dollar question was, who getsto control that?Because whoever can control that is now, onceagain, another god king, right?And so that’s where Satoshi comes in becausehe figured out a way to make it so that theprotocol which controls this reusable proofof work token itself is secured by its ownhash cost function.So it’s like a self-enforcing, self-securing,reusable proof of work token protocol.Jason Lowery (01:04:27):So the easy way to think of it is, really,what you want to do is, if you’re goingto demand this cyber power token as collateralto execute a sensitive command action or sendinformation, then you have to have some wayto track its position in cyberspace, essentially,and so you need a ledger of some kind, youneed someone to record where it is and haveverifiable ownership of it at all times, whichmeans you have to have someone to write thatledger, okay?But if you have someone that has the authority,the abstract control authority to write theledger, they have enormous abstract powerbecause they can control which transactionsget added and they can also withhold transactions.So whoever’s in charge, whatever entityis allowed to add or withhold transactionsof the cyber power token has enormous abstractpower.Jason Lowery (01:05:16):And so Satoshi, the beauty of Bitcoin is like,“Okay, well how do you decentralize thatcontrol authority over that ledger?”Well, how do you do it?You make the people who solve the hash costfunction the people who get to write the ledger.So by doing that, you impose a real-worldphysically-prohibitive cost on people whoattempt to control the ledger, and then boom,right there, now you have a proof of powersystem, just like natural selection is vetted,right?You have people who have the means, who havephysical powers, fully inclusive, everyonehas access to watts.Physical power is physically decentralized.There’s watts all over the world.You can pull watts out of the air, the wind,out of the water, out of natural gas, outof solar.So this power’s available everywhere exogenously,systemically exogenously, so there’s noway that you can code a systemically exploitablepiece of software that prevents people fromusing their real-world watts.It’s fully inclusive, so everyone can haveaccess to these watts.Jason Lowery (01:06:16):But the big one is it’s unbounded.So let’s say if someone starts gaining alot of control authority over this ledger,well, because you’re using watts power asthe basis through which you achieve controlauthority over the ledger, that means thereis no, theoretically, just like there wasno theoretical limit to the amount of kineticpower that people can use to defend theiraccess to their property in the real world,there is no physical limit, there is no theoreticallimit to how many watts honest people cansummon to impose severe physically-prohibitivecosts on anyone who tries to gain and exploitcentralized control authority over the ledger.Jason Lowery (01:07:01):And so that’s the primary basis throughwhich this system is secured, is there’sno limit to how many watts that people cansummon to defend it.And it’s clear that Satoshi was concernedabout this, because in eight pages, he mentionsthe word attack 25 times.He talks about people attacking with the sameprotocol more than any other word.And this whole thing is like, “Okay, listen,if you use physical power, if you make itso that you can achieve control of authorityover the ledger, unless you solve the hashfunction, that gives honest people the ability,the unbounded ability to impose physically-prohibitivecosts.So their benefit-to-cost ratio now can plummetbecause there’s no limit to how much theycan cost, they can impose on anyone tryingto gain 51% of the control.And that’s where decentralization reallycomes from.There’s obviously decentralization and thenodes and everything, but really, it’s thedecentralization of the control authorityover the ledger achieved through using thephysical power as the basis through whichyou can have control authority over the ledger,and there’s no substitute for physical powerfor doing that.Preston Pysh (01:08:04):Let’s go to proof of stake.Jason Lowery (01:08:06):Okay.So just like in the birth of agrarian society,where people start condemning the use of physicalpower as the basis through which they settledisputes over property, determine controlauthority over property, or achieve consensuson the legitimate state of ownership and chainof custody of property, people started tocondemn the use of physical power for theologicalreasons, because it’s energy-intensive orprone to cause injury.In the case of proof of work, obviously, doesn’tcause injury because it’s electric, it’snon-kinetic.But it is energy intensive, okay?So once again, you have these abstract powerhierarchies emerging, where people are makingthe claim that it is, on some ideologicalbasis, not on any meaningful systemic basis,especially meaningful from the point of viewof systemic security, they’re claiming thatit is “ideologically bad” to use proofof work because of the energy that it expends.Jason Lowery (01:09:06):This happened with agrarian society, and thisis how most kings rise to power, right?They say, “Okay, the use of physical powerto establish control authority over resourcesis morally bad.We should use rank to do it.”Proof of stake is effectively proof of rank.It’s people saying, “Okay, we should forfeitour capacity to project physical power todefend ourselves and go back to, go rewindourselves 25 years back in the history andprogression of computer science and go backto abstract power hierarchies.”It’s important to note the primary designconcept of proof of stake existed before proofof work came out.People were already using and designing abstractpower hierarchies to manage control over arandomly thing, like coins that they extracted.That was already being done.Proof of stake goes back to that.Jason Lowery (01:09:54):And so the easy way to simply compare, likewhen you start to look at the difference betweenproof of work and proof of stake, and if you’renew to this and you’re trying to reallygenuinely understand the main systemic differences,it really just comes down to two differenttheories on how to secure your access to yourproperty.The proof of work theory is, you secure youraccess to your property by preserving yourability to impose severe physically-prohibitivecosts on anyone that would try to take itfrom you, deny your access to it, or exploityour rules.Proof of stake says we can create some abstractform of power and then use that as the basisthrough which we defend ourselves.Jason Lowery (01:10:33):And so those are the two fundamentally different,like that’s the main difference, is canI design, can I use a general purpose statemachine to design a program to create abstractpower that does the same job as physical power?That’s what stake ostensibly does.And if I do that, can a thing which does notphysically exist…Remember, there is no spoon, so state is notreal, state does not physically exist.Can a thing that does not physically existachieve the same complex emergent behavioras a thing that does physically exist?So can a system that is defended through physicalpower have the same complex emergent propertiesas something that is defended through abstractpower?And I don’t, well…Preston Pysh (01:11:15):Talk to us about validators, specificallyon Ethereum, how they work, and then talkto us about slashing, because in their abstractpower, as you would describe it, this is howthey claim that they will defend the integrityof the ledger.Jason Lowery (01:11:33):Yeah, so the idea behind slashing is we canimpose cost by allowing honest people to “slash”the stake of validators that might be abusingtheir control authority over the ledger.Preston Pysh (01:11:47):So if I’m a validator, I have whatever amountof ETH to set up my validation node, and I’mlooking at transactions and I’m saying,“Yep, these ones are good.Include these ones in the next block.These ones are good,” and you think thatI’m a dishonest broker and enough peoplelike you agree with you that I’m a dishonestbroker, you can slash me out of the validationmechanism.Is that correct?Jason Lowery (01:12:12):Yeah.What we’re going after here, the main thingthat’s making this secure and insecure iscontrol authority over the ledger.So validators have control authority overthe ledger.They’re essentially the gatekeepers.They get to choose which transactions getadded to the ledger or which ones don’t,but that is a double-edged sword because thatalso means they get to withhold transactionsfrom the ledger, which technically means they’reperforming a denial-of-service attack.So you have to protect yourself against that.Now, the way Bitcoin does that is, the peoplewho are validating or the people who are addingtransactions to the ledger, if they startto be abusive, you can basically just hashthem out of the hash amount of their controlauthority.But with validators, you can’t because stakeitself is zero-sum, okay?For example, let’s just say there’s asituation where some single entity controls60% of all stake.If some single person controls 60% of allstake, they can split that stake across millionsof validators and it would still be the samesingle entity and then they could use thosevalidators to start tactfully withholdingspecific transactions from the blockchain.Preston Pysh (01:13:26):And so when you say they have 60% of the stake,you’re saying they have 60% of the validators,because if they had 60% of the coins thatare outstanding on that protocol, they couldhave way more than 60% of the validators,correct?Jason Lowery (01:13:39):Yeah.So there is a difference between the numberof coins on the protocol and the number ofcoins that are parked in validators, but theworst case scenario is, 60% of the stake iscontrolled by a single entity and they putall of that in validators.That would be the worst case scenario.Or actually, that could be the best case scenariobecause you have to look specifically at thestake, and if someone controls 60% of allcoins, they can have far more than 60% ofthe stake that’s being used in validators.Preston Pysh (01:14:15):Yes.Jason Lowery (01:14:15):So just to give them the benefit of the doubt,let’s just assume that everyone who ownscoins is using it in a validator, like allthe honest people are putting up their biggestfight possible to try to resist, so you’vegot like 40% of all the coins being stakedby honest people and then 60% of the coinsbeing staked by dishonest people.The whole point of bringing this up is, inthat situation, because stake is bounded andzero-sum, the honest people can’t get morestake.They can’t simply regain control authorityover the ledger by adding more stake becauseit’s a zero-sum and out.This isn’t a problem in proof of work.If you only have 40% of the hash, if honestpeople only have 40% of the hash, there’sno limit to how much hash they can add backinto the system, there’s no limit to howmuch computing resources they can get andelectricity they can get.But in stake, you’re stuck.Preston Pysh (01:15:08):And let’s frame this real fast.In a world where you have runaway fiat printingthat has no production cost whatsoever andnation states that could print by coins offthe protocol and then start staking them,there’s arguably an incentive to act thisway, to control which transactions are beingincluded, not included, stuck in the mempool.I mean, at that point, you can do whateveryou want.Jason Lowery (01:15:40):Yeah, there’s nothing physically preventingyou from just printing all the money to buyall the stake to gain the control authorityover the ledger.That’s one of the dangers of coupling controlauthority over the ledger to something thatdoesn’t physically exist.Preston Pysh (01:15:54):That has no tie to physical reality.Jason Lowery (01:15:57):That has no tie to physical reality that youcan’t see.So the easy way to think of it is, remember,all objects in software, there is no spoon.So stake does not physically exist.That means it’s not verifiably physicallydecentralized.It’s like physically impossible for it tobe verifiably decentralized because it’snot a real thing.So no one can prove that stake isn’t alreadycentralized.Preston Pysh (01:16:18):Right now.Jason Lowery (01:16:19):You just have to trust that it isn’t.And then if it is and then people start toabuse the control authority that they haveby virtue of having majority stake, then that’swhere slashing will supposedly help the honestpeople because, okay, the honest people canslash the stake of the people that are usingit to attack the network, censor transactions,or do whatever bad things they can do withthe control authority that they have.Preston Pysh (01:16:42):And then you get into the whole argument discussionof what’s considered honest and who arewe talking about, how they view what is honest,right?Jason Lowery (01:16:51):Exactly.Preston Pysh (01:16:52):Look at the world today, it’s a perfectexample of that exact point, is, are you inthis camp or that camp, or who’s right andwho’s wrong, while the people in your family,you could probably split them right down themiddle of what they believe in and both ofthem think that they’re right.Jason Lowery (01:17:10):Yeah.There’s three main critical problems withthe idea of slashing that I see just as amilitary adversarial thinker.The first one is, first of all, how wouldyou even attribute an attack?So if someone has 51% control of 50% of allEthereum and they’re staking all of it,right?And so the majority of staked Ethereum iscontrolled by one person.Because it’s not a physically real thing,they can trivially divide that stake acrossmillions of validators and then they couldpick which validators they want to use tostart tactfully withholding transactions fromspecific targets.So they call this censoring, but it’s justwithholding valid transaction requests fromthe blockchain, and you could do that andyou could do that across validators, okay?So how do honest people identify that theattack is even occurring if it’s happeningacross millions of different validators controlledby a single entity?That’s really difficult to do.Preston Pysh (01:18:09):Impossible to do?Jason Lowery (01:18:11):Yeah, I don’t know, but-Preston Pysh (01:18:15):But maybe.Jason Lowery (01:18:17):What I do know is that it is physically impossibleto verify that stake isn’t centralized.Preston Pysh (01:18:22):Yes.Jason Lowery (01:18:23):So it’s going to be really hard to makethe claim that there is a 51% attack occurringif it’s already physically impossible toverify that it’s not or is centralized inthe first place.Okay, so that’s assumption number one, thatyou can even have attributability, and I don’tknow how that could happen, like I can’treasonably figure out how people are goingto come to consensus about that.Because if you look at how Vitalik describesit is, if beyond a reasonable doubt that wehave identified that an attack is occurring,then we could slash.It’s like, “Okay, well, how are you goingto achieve beyond a reasonable doubt?”Because I don’t know how you would do that.Any self-respecting attacker isn’t goingto put all their sake in one validator.I don’t even think they can because I thinkit’s limited.Jason Lowery (01:19:04):Okay, so that’s problem number one.Problem number two, this gets to your point,which is, you’re assuming that people willthink that the synth strain is bad.That almost never happens in actual sanctionson financial systems, Canada being a greatexample.When they started sanctioning or denial-of-serviceattacking Canadian truckers, a lot of peopledidn’t think that was a bad thing, okay?So how are you going to achieve consensusfrom the majority of the people that theyshould even slash someone if there is sometheological, philosophical, or ideologicalreason why they are abusing their validators.Preston Pysh (01:19:42):Because at the end of the day, everybody onthe planet has to agree with the idea thatif you and I want to transact, if I want totransmit some type of value to you, I shouldhave the right to be able to do that.Jason Lowery (01:19:55):Right.Preston Pysh (01:19:56):Regardless of what anybody else in the worldthinks, right?Jason Lowery (01:20:00):Yeah.And what are the chances that everyone’sgoing to believe that, especially when onlyselect few people who might be easy to perceiveas bad are the ones being denial-of-serviceattacked?Preston Pysh (01:20:10):Yeah.Jason Lowery (01:20:10):You see all of it with Canada and then, obviously,you see it with the sanctions against Russia.Most people, like a lot of people think thatit’s good that we are denial-of-serviceattacking or 51% attacking Russia and censoringtheir transactions off Swift for ideologicalreasons, okay?Preston Pysh (01:20:28):And people will always think that until ithappens to them and they’re on the wrongside of the equation.Jason Lowery (01:20:33):Right.Yeah.But in reality, what you would expect is ifsomeone has that much control authority ofthe ledger, they would only be using it todenial-of-service attack certain people, noteveryone.Preston Pysh (01:20:43):Yeah.Jason Lowery (01:20:44):And so what are the chances you’re goingto get everyone else who isn’t being attackedto come to unanimous conclusion or how evermuch conclusion you need to prove withouta reasonable doubt that the censoring is occurringand that it’s a bad thing when in most casesof sanctions, people think it’s justifiedand they aren’t mad about it?Jason Lowery (01:21:02):So that’s problem number two.And then the third and glaring one is slashingworks both ways.Preston Pysh (01:21:09):Yeah.Jason Lowery (01:21:09):Okay?So the honest members can always slash themajority stakers that are abusing their controlauthority over the ledger, but the peoplewith the majority control authority over theledger because of their majority stake canslash the honest people back to maintain theirmajority stake, and so you get basically intoslash wars instead of hash wars.Preston Pysh (01:21:28):It goes back to what we were talking aboutearly on where the apex predator of an abstractpower hierarchy, they would do anything andeverything to ensure that they can continueto control this system, this protocol.But for the people that are at the bottomof this protocol or this social order, ifyou will, they don’t have the incentivefor it to be kept in place because they’rethe victim of this environment that they haveto operate within.Jason Lowery (01:21:59):And it’s worth just repeating like we’vecreated over the last 5,000 years, we haveused symbolic language to formally codifyabstract power hierarchies where rank is ostensiblydecentralized across senates or voting systems,where we hire something like 500 representativesof rank, we use voting systems, and we trustin them to represent us.But over the course of those 5,000 years,time and time and time again, they get exploited.People find a way to systemically exploitthe rule set to take advantage of the abstractpower.There is an enormous incentive to do thatbecause it’s a giant honey problem.And so when you go to a proof of stake system,what you have, once again, done is createdan abstract power hierarchy and a voting systemand you’re just making this claim that thislike thing won’t be systemically exploited,that people aren’t going to figure out howto abuse the rules.Jason Lowery (01:23:03):And it’s silly to me because people can’teven verify that it’s not already centralized.People don’t know.You have no idea who is behind the stake.So at least in governments, oppressive governmentsor regulatory captured governments, you atleast can see your oppressors.In stake, they’re anonymous and you haveno idea what’s behind these people.So it seems to be extremely systemically insecure,but even if you don’t believe that, it is100% irrational to make the argument thata system based on something abstract whichdoesn’t physically exist can have the samecomplex emergent behavior of system securityas a system that uses something that is physicallyreal, like power.Like you can’t reasonably make the argumentthat they will have the same emergent propertiesbecause they are very physically and systemicallycompletely different systems.Preston Pysh (01:23:59):I want to play a clip as we’re talking abouthow the apex predators have an incentive tokeep these systems in place.This is a clip.I’m going to play it, I’m not going totell you what it is, and then I want to captureyour thoughts after we’re done playing it.And this is an apex predator of the existingproof of stake system.Here it comes.Speaker 1 (01:24:23):Mr. Dimon, if I can ask you one other question,I’d like to ask of another topic that I’vebeen very focused on, which is the rapid developmentof digital assets and related financial technology.I believe the United States should lead thedevelopment of emerging technologies likedistributed ledgers and blockchain, and thefederal government should provide the certaintyneeded for the country to serve as a hub forfinancial innovation.And I’ve developed legislation to help definequalified stablecoins, which I know the chairwomanand the ranking member are also working on,and to select the appropriate regulator.I’ve read that you’re a little skepticalof some of these new technologies, but whatare the biggest things keeping you from beingmore active in the space?And do you worry that we would miss the voteand give other nations like China an opportunityto advance their digital currency and otherpayment systems that could undermine the USdollar?And I’d love to get some of your thoughtson that.Jamie Dimon (01:25:05):So you have to separate blockchain, whichis real, DeFi, which is real, ledgers, tokensthat do something and deliver information,money, ideas, simplify smart contracts.That’s one thing.I’m not a skeptic.Okay, I’m a major skeptic on crypto tokens,which you call currency like Bitcoin.They are decentralized Ponzi schemes, andthe notion that’s good for anybody is unbelievable.So we sit here in this room and talk abouta lot of things, but $2 billion has been lostevery year, $30 billion of ransomware, AML,sex trafficking, stealing.It’s dangerous.There’d be nothing wrong with the stablecoin,just like a money market fund, properly regulated.Preston Pysh (01:25:51):All right, Jason, your thoughts?Jason Lowery (01:25:55):Again, all software is abstract, and becausesoftware is abstract, there’s a lot of semanticambiguity about what kind of matters and whatdoesn’t.And so…Preston Pysh (01:26:08):And real fast, that was Jamie Dimon from JPMorganChase, if people didn’t hear the names oraren’t familiar with the clip.I’m sorry.Keep going.Jason Lowery (01:26:17):Yeah.No, this is great because let’s use adversarialthinking here.From Jamie Dimon’s point of view, to yourpoint, he’s the top dog, he’s the apexpredator in his abstract power hierarchy,right?He’s the god king.He needs to do whatever he can to maintainhis abstract power.He’s talking about because software is sosemantically ambiguous and because it’sall abstract, a common tactic, and you seethis with like the crypto world, is you picksomething random and you say that’s theinnovation.Preston Pysh (01:26:48):Yeah.Jason Lowery (01:26:48):So you say, “Oh, it’s blockchain.That’s the innovation,” “Oh, it’ssmart contracts that are the innovation,”or, “Oh, it’s this,” or it’s, “Oh,it’s that,” and it’s like-Preston Pysh (01:26:56):Everything but Bitcoin.Jason Lowery (01:26:57):Yeah, it’s like wave here and then don’tpay attention to the thing that actually matters,which is Bitcoin, which is-Preston Pysh (01:27:07):Work.Jason Lowery (01:27:07):… physical cost functions and physical decentralizationof control authority over resources.And so that’s exactly what Jamie Dimon isdoing, and you’ll see this with everyone.You’ll see this with the CBDCs, you’llsee this with like Ethereum, for example,is they say that something else is the innovationto try to get you into their abstract-Preston Pysh (01:27:28):They won’t even talk about it.Like Andreessen Horowitz, right?They had some big giant recap, crypto recappaper, I think it was Pierre Rochard thatwas talking about.Bitcoin wasn’t even mentioned-Jason Lowery (01:27:43):Wow.Yeah.Preston Pysh (01:27:43):… in the entire report, but yet it has thelargest market cap of any type of “cryptoasset,” using air quotes there for people.Jason Lowery (01:27:54):And if you study computer science, if youstudy software reuse, the most common formof software reuse is design reuse, so peopletake a design of an existing piece of softwareand then tweak it a little bit.Preston Pysh (01:28:07):Yeah.Jason Lowery (01:28:08):Majority of cryptocurrencies out there isreused Bitcoin, right?But they tweak it-Preston Pysh (01:28:13):Minus the proof of work.Jason Lowery (01:28:14):Minus the proof of work.So they copy the design of Bitcoin, then theyremove the proof of work, and they createan abstract power hierarchy where they havethe control authority over the ledger in somebackdoor way or some trap door way throughthe systemic exploitation of the rules.Preston Pysh (01:28:30):They get VC money, they then pump the marketingto get a bunch of people to buy it, then theyget their bags pumped, then they offload it,and then they probably go and buy Bitcoinwith the proceeds.Jason Lowery (01:28:41):Yeah, I mean, if they were smart.I would do that if I were kind of evil thatway.Preston Pysh (01:28:46):No, you wouldn’t.You’re not evil like that.Jason Lowery (01:28:49):But the point is, whatever you do, don’tlet people realize the value of physicallydefending their access to their property orphysically defending their policy againstsystemic exploitation using real-world physicalpower.Condemn it as much as possible.Get people to forfeit their physical aggression,domesticate them, and then once they stopusing physical power, they adopt abstractpower hierarchies and then they become thedomesticated animal that you can exploit.And so you’ll see this with everything now,is they’re going to come up with every possibledifferent way to get you to not appreciateproof of work or the use of real power tosecure your access to the things that youfreely choose to value, and you should justbe very, very-Preston Pysh (01:29:33):Skeptical?Jason Lowery (01:29:34):Yeah, that should raise red flags.Anyone tries to raise the argument that theuse of physical power to physically defendyourself by imposing severe physical costson attackers is somehow bad because of the-Preston Pysh (01:29:45):Red flag.Jason Lowery (01:29:45):… energy it uses, that’s a red flag.That’s a god king trying to build an abstractpower hierarchy, trying to trap you, and that’sexactly what Jamie Dimon here is doing.He’s saying, “Okay, well, this blockchainisn’t bad and smart contracts aren’t bad,but that thing called Bitcoin, that’s bad,and look at all these bad people.”So he’s the…Jason Lowery (01:30:00):Called Bitcoin that’s bad.And look at all these bad people.So he’s the shark trying to get you to thinkthat your swimming pool isn’t safe.And he is trying to say what is safe is thisopen water where I swim, you just have tobe careful.Preston Pysh (01:30:15):All right, here’s the next clip I’m goingto play for you.You ready?Jason Lowery (01:30:18):Yeah.Preston Pysh (01:30:18):Here it comes.Vitalik (01:30:20):So I did look to summarize that one of theways that I think about this in a more philosophicalway is, Proof of Work is based on the lawsof physics and so you have to work with theworld as it is.You have to work with electricity as it is,hardware as it is, what computers are as itis.Whereas because Proof of Stake is virtualizedin this way, it’s basically letting us createa simulated universe that has its own lawsof physics.And that just gives us as protocol developersa lot more freedom to optimize the systemaround actually having all of the differentsecurity properties that we want and-Jason Lowery (01:30:58):That we want.Vitalik (01:30:59):… if we want the system to have a particularsecurity guarantee.And then often there is a way to modify theupper stake mechanism to also achieve it.So it’s just much more flexible and it showsthrough in the efficiency and the securityof the network.Preston Pysh (01:31:16):Way more flexible, Jason, to give us the securitythat we desire.Jason Lowery (01:31:23):Yeah.I study system security of software intensivesystems at MIT, for whatever reason I findthat interesting.And so I took as many graduate classes asI can on that.And it’s actually extremely common.So what’s happening here is Vitalik is makingthe claim that if you remove the physicalconstraints, it will somehow make it saferor make it more secure.But he doesn’t realize is the thing that’sachieving the security is the physical constraints.Preston Pysh (01:31:50):Yeah.I mean you’re not going to…Fort Knox, right?It’d be like saying, “Oh yeah, we’regoing to take the walls down, we’re goingto remove the fence, we’re going to removethe security guards, we’re going to movethe brick walls, we’re going to remove themetal casing around the vault, to make itmore secure Jason.”Jason Lowery (01:32:10):Yeah.But this isn’t just true for this scenario.We’ve studied, at least in my graduate classes,so many different fields make the same mistake.Aviation has made this mistake multiple times.Preston Pysh (01:32:20):In what way?What do you mean?Jason Lowery (01:32:21):Well, you replace a physical interlock ora physical impediment with something digitalor with a piece of software.And then you end up inadvertently removingthe physical constraint that was actuallykeeping that thing safe.And then the rocket blows up or the airplaneblows up, or the Boeing 737 dive bombs.Jason Lowery (01:32:46):And so this is a common problem.It is just something that software developersdo for some reason, is they think that, forwhatever…they don’t realize that system securityis a complex emergent behavior, and oftenthe result of physical constraints that cannotbe replicated in a virtual environment wherenothing physically exists.And it was so refreshing to hear him makethis assertion because I had already starteddown this path of making the distinction betweenProof of Work and Proof of Stake, and sayingthe reason why Proof of Stake isn’t goingto work is because stake doesn’t physicallyexist.And what they’re essentially doing is tryingto make the claim that they can virtualizePhysical Power and still achieve the samelevels of systemic security.I had already made that argument.I had already written 50 pages on that formy thesis that I’m having to write.Preston Pysh (01:33:35):I’m sure you did.I’m sure you did.Jason Lowery (01:33:37):And then he said it, he said it on the nightof Proof of Stake.And I saw it in the morning and I was like,“Oh my God, this is it.”Preston Pysh (01:33:44):Oh, the Holy Grail.Jason Lowery (01:33:45):Yeah.Preston Pysh (01:33:46):The Holy Grail.Jason Lowery (01:33:47):I had already been arguing with people onTwitter about it and they weren’t buyingit.And so I was starting to feel insecure.I was like, “I don’t know if this is theright angle to take.”And then Vitalik just flat out says it.Preston Pysh (01:33:55):He knew.Jason Lowery (01:33:55):He flat out makes the assertion that you canremove the physical constraints, replace itin a virtualized environment, and he’s claimingthat it will be more secure.Preston Pysh (01:34:04):Yeah.Classic.Jason Lowery (01:34:04):And that is just god king, Abstract Powerbuilding 101 right there, is convinced peoplethat to forfeit their Physical Power and thephysical constraints protecting them.Preston Pysh (01:34:17):So I’ve often wondered, as you’ve beenvery public in your research, your just interactionson Twitter.And for people who are not familiar with you,let me just describe my point of view of howJason Lowrey came on the scene.Jason Lowery (01:34:36):Oh boy.Preston Pysh (01:34:36):So here we are on Twitter and we’re justintellectually battling with each other, jokingaround, whatever, on a constant daily basis,just having fun really.And somebody posted this screenshot of thisguy on LinkedIn going to battle; basicallydoing what we do on Twitter every day, butdoing it on LinkedIn, which was just hilarious.You have no idea how hard I laughed the firsttime I saw one of these JPEGs of you justbeating up some total suit on LinkedIn.And so evidently somebody reached out to youand said, “Hey, the real conversation’shappening here on Twitter.”And-Jason Lowery (01:35:16):It was Greg Foss.Preston Pysh (01:35:17):Was it Greg Foss?Jason Lowery (01:35:18):Yes.Preston Pysh (01:35:18):Okay, I didn’t know that.Yes.So Greg Foss reaches out to you, you thengo on Twitter and you immediately captureda really large following.A lot of people, myself included, battlingwith you over some of the choice of wordsthat you used.But you know what, when I look at how muchyour thesis has evolved through the time thatyou’ve been at MIT writing this, I can see,Jason, that you took a lot of the things thatpeople were saying to heart and really wantedto understand other people’s vantage point.You weren’t battling with them via ego,you were battling with them intellectuallyto try to understand their point of view.And all of that has come out.And I think people that are listening to thisconversation can see that evolution in yourwriting and your thesis that you’ve developed.Preston Pysh (01:36:04):But here’s my question.Sorry to keep going on.My question is this.How has MIT and the professors there receivedthis?Because I would think that it hasn’t beenreceived well, because it seems like so muchof the Proof of Stake, saves the energy usagestuff, is so indoctrinated at the academiclevel that I would think that you’re literallybanging your head against the wall.Jason Lowery (01:36:32):Yeah.So I got invited here…I forgot that’s how I got famous is throughthe bashing of suits on LinkedIn.I forgot about that.Greg Foss, yeah he was like, “Dude, yougot to come to Twitter.Your people are here.You don’t really get it.”Preston Pysh (01:36:47):We were watching…People were posting these things on Twitter,these screen grabs, and I’m telling youwe were laughing so hard.Jason Lowery (01:36:56):I was so afraid to come to Twitter.And I was like, “I’m going to say somethingthat gets me in trouble.”And sure enough, day one I say something aboutthe grounded theory methodology…So I’m using a grounded theory methodology,which is essentially you try to just talkto people as much as you can.Preston Pysh (01:37:15):Interviews.Yeah.Jason Lowery (01:37:16):Preferably talking to people who are knowledgeablein your subject matter area.Well, there ain’t no such thing as an expertin cryptocurrency, as much as people on LinkedInlikes to put it on their profiles.No one actually-Preston Pysh (01:37:27):Web3, they’re putting Web3 Jason.Jason Lowery (01:37:29):Yeah.There’s no such thing as an expert in thisfield yet.It’s too new.And so if you want to find the most knowledgeablepeople, they’re going to be on LinkedIn.Or they’re…No sorry, not LinkedIn.God no, not on LinkedIn.On Twitter.Preston Pysh (01:37:40):Twitter.Jason Lowery (01:37:41):They’re going to be on Twitter.Preston Pysh (01:37:42):And their name’s probably going to be douchebag5or something like that.Jason Lowery (01:37:45):Yeah, right.No, and it’s true.And then they’re going to have a cartoonas their profile picture with laser eyes,but those people have enormous technical knowledge.Way more so than you could get from any professorshere.Not all of them, but most people in any institutionjust because this field is so new.And so my approach to this thesis was a groundedtheory methodology where I engage in unstructuredinterviews with the public, or with anyoneI could find, and then just have intellectualdebates on them.And then I use their feedback to… and that’sjust the grounded theory methodology is youjust use their core concepts and you improve,improve, improve, improve, and try to getto what’s called saturation.And so yeah, no, I owe all my ideas to thesomething like 70,000 comments that I’vereplied to in the last year.Jason Lowery (01:38:31):Okay, sorry.I just wanted to address that because I doreally appreciate all the help and all thepeople like you that I get to meet, that canhelp shape this.It’s really important to me to do this publiclybecause of my job and the reason why I’mat MIT.I am a US National Defense fellow.I am an active duty officer.I am researching the national strategic implicationsof Bitcoin and I am going to send this straightto the Joint Chiefs once we finish it.And I am going to be advising senior policymakers and I already do.And so I don’t want that to be secret.I want that to be an open conversation andI want to be as fully transparent as possible.Jason Lowery (01:39:05):Now in terms of how people at MIT react toit, I have seen the same thing you’ve seen,which is this obsession with Proof of Stake.There’s that MIT article that talked about,it’s such a big deal and I get in lots offights with those people.But luckily the way MIT’s structured isthere’s different schools and no one reallyhas any claim over any particular subject.So there’s not one department that getsto claim all Bitcoin research or all cryptocurrencyresearch.There’s people in the business school, there’speople in engineering school, there’s peoplein the computer science school and you prettymuch have freedom of action.Jason Lowery (01:39:44):And so what I did was I deliberately steeredaway from the professors.I do clash with most of the line of thinkingwith the business school people here, they’rejust so into Web3 and crypto right now.It’s just kind of hopeless, I don’t eventry to talk to them now.I found the expert in software security andsoftware system security.I found the expert with 40 years of knowledgeand literally wrote the book on system securitythat the whole world uses.And I found her and she was also skeptical.She’s like, “I think it’s all scam.”But I was like, “Okay, then you should bemy advisor and let me prove to you using yourown area of expertise why Bitcoin is the exception.If I can convince you using your own areaexpertise of why Bitcoin actually is a majornew change in cybersecurity, then wouldn’tthat be a good thesis?”And she was like, “Okay, cool.”So I found her as my advisor.Preston Pysh (01:40:42):And?Jason Lowery (01:40:42):So far it’s going well.I won’t know if it’s successful untilI publish next year, but man, she’s justawesome.She’s actually…like I said, she’s one of the world leadingexperts in system security.And Ethereum developers have been startingto go to her conferences and I’m just [inaudible01:41:03].Yeah, so it’s just kind of funny.It’s like anytime an Ethereum developersigns up or whatever, she’s like, “Hey,check this out.”Preston Pysh (01:41:08):So this is something I want to just say.So if somebody from your school, or one ofyour advisors, are listening to this, thething that you get in this space, and I wastalking to you a little bit about this beforewe started recording, is you get people thatcome to Bitcoin from so many different expertise.Some people come from the software side, somepeople come from the game theory side, somepeople come from the finance side.I’m coming from the financial lens and that’show I found Bitcoin in 2015.How I found it is I had the opinion that thecredit markets were going to implode and thatthere was no way out for central banks tocontain how broke credit markets had become,because I was looking at this long term creditcycle that was made famous by Ray Dalio.And I was just looking at it as just like,what can possibly catch all of this buyingpower when this neutron star of credit explodes?That’s how I personally found Bitcoin.So I came with that bias.I came with that lens.Preston Pysh (01:42:09):And so, one of the things that sold me onBitcoin versus everything else that was happening,was if you’re going to catch something withcall it 300 trillion dollars worth of buyingpower and it’s going to implode like a neutronstar, security is the primary thing that peopleare going to want to nest that buying powerinto, to ensure that it can’t be taken.There has to be some type of enormous amountof security and Physical Power behind thesecurity of that in order for it to ultimatelywin.Because when you look at how bond investorslook at their invest…they’re obviously not concerned about theyield because you just started getting…And I wouldn’t even call these good yields,especially when inflation’s at 8% and they’reoffering 4% on the 10 Year Treasury, you’reguaranteed to lose 4%.They’re not there for the yield, they’rethere for the preservation of buying power,and it’s to the tune of hundreds of trillionsof dollars that they just want to preservethe buying power.So if this thesis of the credit markets explodingis valid and true, which I’m saying as anif, because I’m trying to look at it asobjectively as possible, how can anybody thinkthat that’s going to manifest itself anywhereother than the most secure protocol or moneyon the other side of such an event?Preston Pysh (01:43:32):And so I guess that’s me venting a littlebit.And I’m sorry to go off on a tangent becausethis show’s not about me, it’s about youand your thesis here.But I find it frustrating that people arenot seeing that.Instead they’re caught up in these tokensor these get rich quick ideas that, “Oh,it’s an innovative blockchain, smart contract,Jamie Dimon BS.”And they’re missing the elephant that isso big in the room that it’s suffocatingthe person.They can’t see it, it’s literally suffocatingthem because it’s so big.Jason Lowery (01:44:15):Can I vent on this real fast.Preston Pysh (01:44:16):Yes, please.Jason Lowery (01:44:16):So you came in from the financial perspective.My first job in the military was as a blastand ballistics research engineer where I literallymeasured the watts of bombs that go off andbullets that go off.So I’m literally measuring our ability toimpose physically prohibitive costs on peoplein watts.Jason Lowery (01:44:37):My second job in the military was as a subjectmatter expert in electronic warfare, specificallydirected energy weapons.So once again, using watts as a measure toimpose severe physical prohibitive costs forthe sake of securing something.Okay?Jason Lowery (01:44:51):Then I transitioned into the world of space,I became an astronomical engineer, learnedhow to use and design spacecraft.And then I was part of the founding team ofofficers that stood-up US Space Command andalso US Space Force, which was essentiallya question of, well how do we impose physicallyprohibitive costs in a completely new domain.Jason Lowery (01:45:14):So what I’m saying is I know a lot aboutthe use of watts, the importance of wattsfor achieving security, and the question ofhow do you start using watts in a new domainto secure the stuff that you care about.So what attracted me to Bitcoin was just thisidea that of course, it’s going to be thecase that we are going to figure out a wayto use watts to impose physically prohibitivecosts on people in and from through cyberspaceto defend ourselves in and from through cyberspace,especially our cyber-property, and especiallyour policies are our rule sets and the softwarethat we use.So the missing ingredient of cyberspace isthe ability to impose physically prohibitivecosts in and from through cyberspace usingwatts, obviously we’re going to that future.It doesn’t make any sense, I don’t understandhow anyone can think that we wouldn’t goto that future if we’ve already done itin land.We’ve already done it in sea, we’ve alreadydone it in space, of course we’re goingto do it in and air.Of course we’re going to do it in cyberspace.Jason Lowery (01:46:18):And so you have to just be looking out what’sit going to be a protocol that people useto impose physically prohibited costs on peoplein and from through cyberspace.And that’s clearly Bitcoin.And that was clearly the original intent ofBitcoin.And it’s supposed to be a denial serviceor denial of service counter measure or acounter measure against systemic exploitationof software.That’s how it started.That’s how they talked about it.Yes, Satoshi took it and framed it as a cash,but like we said before, that just happensto be a great use case.One of many use cases that this type of technologycould be used to secure, but it isn’t limitedto just cash.And so I’m in the same boat.It’s so frustrating for people to just…Especially at big institutions like at MITfor people just to ignore the major-Preston Pysh (01:47:05):Yes.But think about it makes sense, Jason.It goes back to what you’re talking about,Abstract Power, right?There’s no more Abstract Power going onthan in an academic institution of who’swho and who’s tenured and whose class ismost noteworthy.Jason Lowery (01:47:28):I guess my point is you could have calledBitcoin anything, it could have been calledBitunicorn or just anything.It doesn’t matter what it’s called, whateverit was called.It would’ve still been a major leap in thefield of computer science and cyber security.It’s just such a dramatically differentway of doing things that is so completelyunique and different, that no matter whatyou call it.And it’s just that we happen to call itmoney and we happen to use the first use casefor which we started to secure this was asa peer-to-peer cash system.People just get obsessed with this idea asBitcoin only being a monetary system.But it’s like no, what we have done is we’vecreated a giant global scale physical defenseinfrastructure that people are using to physicallydefend what they value, not just the moneybut [inaudible 01:48:20]Preston Pysh (01:48:19):There’s the time and energy.Jason Lowery (01:48:22):You could use it to defend you against emails.And it’s only a matter of time, so peopleare going to start using the lightning protocoland they’re going to start using Bitcoinas basically a cyber dome to protect peopleusing this Physical Power infrastructure.They’re going to figure it out.And it’s only a matter of time and I wouldn’tbe surprised that it emerges in the next coupleyears.And it’s like that is such, in my opinion,a bigger deal and more importantly, a moreinevitable deal.Of course that’s going to be something thathappens.Of course, we’re going to start figuringout how to use protocols to physically defendourselves through cyberspace.And for whatever reason, that’s just missing.People just aren’t thinking about that.Maybe that’s because people don’t thinkabout it often.And maybe because I’m the guy that measureswatts because I’m the military guy, I’mjust more inclined to see that sooner, thanthe-Preston Pysh (01:49:11):Yeah.I think that’s what it is.I think that when you pull back the threadon how many complex academic and real worldthings are colliding here to understand themagnitude of all of it coming together, youjust have to have some expertise in a wholelot of different domains to get it.Jason Lowery (01:49:36):Yeah.It’s a very tough systemic problem thatis multidisciplinary.It combines computer science, it combinesanthropology, it combines political history,it combines military strategy and it combinesmoney.And then you have to be able to just zoomout and see what the big picture is, likewhat is the ‘so what’.And I think what the ‘so what’ is, forthe first time occurring society, we figuredout how to use a power based control structureto manage resources and to achieve consensuson the legitimate state of chain custody ofproperty and to physically defend ourselvesin and from through cyberspace, and we’vedone all these things at the same time andwe’ve done it non lethally.And that’s huge.Preston Pysh (01:50:18):It’s unreal.Jason Lowery (01:50:18):This is going to be so much bigger than moneyif people start using this thing beyond justmoney.And I think it’s going to start happening.And so that’s the message I’m trying toget out.Preston Pysh (01:50:30):So Jason, let’s say that you had policy,anybody in government or policy listeningto the discussion, which I’m sure we mighthave.What would be, if you had to frame up guidanceto them, what would be the one thing or twothings that you would say to a person who’slooking to implement policy on some of thisstuff?Jason Lowery (01:50:52):Couple of things.So this is an example I like to use; whengun powder was first invented, when blackpowder was first invented for more than 200years, it was considered to be medicine andit was monetized and traded as medicine.So they invented this new power projectiontechnology and they called it medicine foressentially no other reason than the factthat the doctor who invented it was intendedto build medicine and named it medicine.And so for that reason they just called itmedicine and traded it as medicine.Called it fire medicine.And then they noticed that it was quick tohold a flame.They weren’t quite sure what medicinal purposesthat could be used for, but whatever.The point is, it was a power projection technology.And you could have gone to doctors and youcould have asked doctors for their professionalopinion on how good this black powder stuffis as medicine.Jason Lowery (01:51:46):But whatever they would have to recommendwouldn’t have been useful for the real purposeof this black powder stuff.And I say that because we keep on saying softwareis an abstraction.What Proof of Work really represents is acybersecurity system as specifically a systemwhere people are learning how to defend themselves,learning how to defend the access that totheir property that they freely value or todefend their policy against systemic exploitationand abuse or just to figure out how to usethis thing for all sorts of new cybersecurityreasons.And it was called a coin and people act likeit’s a coin, but that’s just one of manyuse cases of this thing.Jason Lowery (01:52:26):And so Adam Back, I talked to him about whenhe first invented the hash function.And he first called the receipt for solvingthe hash function a stamp.And so imagine how ridiculous it would beto go to the United States Postal Office andask for their technical inputs about the technicalmerits of Bitstamp, just because it was arbitrarilycalled stamp.Or imagine how ridiculous it would be to aska meteorologist about the technical meritof that stuff that stores your emails justbecause it’s called a cloud.So just because we happen to call this powerprojection system, this massive scale physicaldefense system that people are using to securetheir property, a coin, doesn’t automaticallymake it the case that the United States TreasuryDepartment or the United States Federal Reserveis qualified to be talking about the technicalmerits of this technology.Preston Pysh (01:53:23):Wow.Jason Lowery (01:53:23):Least of all is the freaking bankers becauseof the- [inaudible 01:53:27]Preston Pysh (01:53:26):Perverse incentives.Jason Lowery (01:53:28):Yes.Because of the very obvious incentives weheard Dimon talk about.So the last people qualified to be talkingabout the national strategic security implicationsof this power projection technology is theUnited States Treasury Department, is anybank.And so who’s running the conversation aboutthe national strategic security impacts ofBitcoin right now and why?And what qualifications do they have?Because from my perspective, from a guy whoactually spends all his time studying powerprojection technology, I do not think they’requalified to be talking about the technicalmerits with this technology.At least not about Bitcoin specifically oranything that uses the Proof of Work protocol.And so my recommendation to any policy makerthat might be listening to this is, the lastpeople you should be listening to are bankersand financiers about power projection technology.That’s silly.It’s like listening to doctors about thetechnical merits of-Preston Pysh (01:54:26):Gun powder.Jason Lowery (01:54:26):Black powder, just because they called itmedicine.[inaudible 01:54:31]Preston Pysh (01:54:30):That is not the response I was ever expectingto hear from you.That’s fascinating that you frame it thatway because as a person that comes with afinancial lens, a very financial lens to this,I just would not have ever viewed it fromthat optic.I view it as very financial.Jason Lowery (01:54:49):And it definitely is because to your pointearlier, if you’ve created the most securesystem ever, it’s going to double as a greatthing to monetize, to secure your money.Preston Pysh (01:55:01):Yeah.Jason Lowery (01:55:03):But people also monetize black powder.That doesn’t mean that…So you just have to be careful here becauseof the second point, which is anytime anynew power projection technology has emergedthroughout history to include black powder,to include torpedoes, to include aircraft,to include nuclear weapons or whatever, anytimea new power projection technology emerges,it becomes a strategic selling point.And there’s many examples in history wherebad things happen because countries don’tappreciate its strategic importance soon enough.Preston Pysh (01:55:41):Wow.Jason Lowery (01:55:42):China just made this mistake, in my opinion,at an epic scale by seeking-Preston Pysh (01:55:46):Epic scale.Totally agree with you.Jason Lowery (01:55:48):But the problem is China’s very authoritarian.And so once they figured out that they messedup, they can pivot quickly too.They can pivot quickly back into Bitcoin.And so I guess my advice to people is, ifthis is a power projection technology, ifthis is a wholly new way for people to defendthemselves or particularly their property,then-Preston Pysh (01:56:11):Better take it serious.Jason Lowery (01:56:12):You should take it extremely seriously froma national strategic standpoint.And the last thing you should do is be tooquick to kick it out of your country or disenfranchiseit or condemn it because you could be handingthe keys to the kingdom over the next 500years to someone you don’t want to handit to.And so this is a very serious matter if youconsider it from the perspective of nationalstrategic defense, not as a monetary system,but of a global physical defense system.Preston Pysh (01:56:42):That’s pretty profound.Jason, give people a handoff if they wantto follow you where they can do that.Also, can we have links in our show notesto your drafts and the papers and everythingthat you have academically written to date?Can we do that?Jason Lowery (01:57:01):Yeah.I don’t know how much I’ve published.I started a website, so I’ll send that link.Preston Pysh (01:57:05):Perfect.That’s perfect.Jason Lowery (01:57:07):Yeah, so the first question is where can youfind me?Is that it?Preston Pysh (01:57:10):Yeah.Jason Lowery (01:57:10):Yeah.Just on Twitter.I mean I just use Twitter to…Jasonplowery, L-O-W-E-R-Y.I just use that as my interface to engagewith what I believe are the subject matterexperts in here, which is just Bitcoin Twitter.It’s such a bowl of knowledge that you candrink up everyday.Preston Pysh (01:57:26):And if you’re feeling like you want to usesome Physical Power, he’s on LinkedIn.Jason Lowery (01:57:31):I’m on LinkedIn too, but I have to be.I’ve got to be more professional on LinkedIn.Preston Pysh (01:57:39):I think you’re plenty professional, sir.I think you [inaudible 01:57:42]Jason Lowery (01:57:42):I get a lot more freedom on Twitter.Preston Pysh (01:57:45):Oh lordy.We’ll have links to LinkedIn, to Twitterand your website there where you’re postinginterviews, you’re posting some of the thingsthat you’re writing.What a pleasure.Thank you so much for making time to havethis conversation.I thoroughly enjoyed this.I learned a ton and wow, what exciting workthat you’re doing there at MIT and it’sbeen fun for me to see the progression.It really has.And I’m sure there’s a lot of other peoplethat share that sentiment that have engagedwith you on Twitter.Because I know you’re very active with alot of the people that are providing counterresponses and different opinions.Jason Lowery (01:58:27):And I appreciate all of the honest feedback.It’s extremely helpful and I hope you cansee that I have been incorporating that.Preston Pysh (01:58:34):Bravo.Jason Lowery (01:58:34):Thank you.Thanks for talking to me so long.And sorry I took so long but this has justbeen great.Preston Pysh (01:58:38):No.No.God.This was a blast.So thanks Jason.Really enjoyed it.",
