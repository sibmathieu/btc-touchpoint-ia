She was too young to realize it, but thanks to her industrious, frugal parents,  she would have the means to pursue a meaningful education and career.But when Farida's family woke up on the morning of January 12, 1994,  everything had changed. Overnight her parents lost half of their savings, not due to theft,  bank robbery, or company bankruptcy but a currency devaluation imposed by a foreign power more than  4,500 kilometers away. The previous evening french officials and IMF bureaucrats met in  Dakar to discuss the fate of the CFA franc. For years the currency used by citizens of Togo and  other West and Central African nations had been pegged to the French franc at a rate of 1 to 50.  But when the late night meeting concluded, it was 1 to 100.The economic fates of tens of millions of people had been decided by French leaders  with the complicity of pro-french rulers of countries such as Togo and Ivory Coast.This is French monetary colonialism, an exploitative system of monetary control which has  outlasted political colonialism and allowed France to retain control over the economies of 15 African  countries and subsidize the French way of life. Despite decades of uprisings, the system stands to  this day but is now being challenged by a new form of resistance: open-source code. At the height  of its imperialism, the French Colonial Empire stretched over 11.5 million square kilometers.  After World War II, the French had fought tooth  and nail to keep their colonial possessions but eventually were forced to give them up.  However, the benefits of the resources and labor of French colonies in West and  Central Africa were too rich; Paris devised a scheme to have its cake and eat it too, ending  political colonialism while orchestrating monetary colonialism. This was the birth of the CFA Franc.The French understand that by controlling the colonial Franc currency, also known as  the CFA Franc, it increases its power against its former colonies and allows it to siphon  the wealth back to Paris in numerous ways. The CFA Franc was originally introduced in 1945.  By the 1990s it had been devalued by 99.5 %.  The CFA farmers and producers have no recourse. France still manufactures all of the notes and  coins used in the CFA regions, charging 45 million euros per year for the service.  And if CFA residents want to travel abroad. they are forced to convert their colonial Francs to  Euros as the CFA currency is worthless outside their countries. France again takes its cut.  With the guise of generosity, France grants loans to its CFA Nations for infrastructure  developments, but the work is contracted to French companies. This is the infamous double loan  the taxpayers of countries like Ivory Coast are on the hook for the entire loan plus interest  while the French get paid back twice, first in an immediate sense when the loan is used to  pay a French company to complete a project and then later when the principal plus interest is  paid back on the loan. By denying CFA Nations the ability to produce their own manufacturing-based  economies and by steering CFA Nations away from consumption agriculture and towards producing  inedible exports designed for World Markets, they eliminate sovereignty and engineer dependence.  Today, the CFA system has been Africanized. Togo's currency now shows local culture and flora and  fauna, but these are only superficial changes the banknotes are still made in Paris. French  officials still sit on the boards of two of the three regional CFA Banks, and the wealth generated  by the French authorities in the first seven decades of the CFA system, when Paris got to keep  National reserves and dictate monetary policy, has not been returned. The World Bank and IMF work in  concert with France to enforce the CFA system and rarely if ever, criticize its exploitative nature.  The IMF managing director position has often been held by a French official recently  Christine Lagarde. Contradicting the values of liberté, egalité, fraternité, French officials  have propped up tyrants to enforce the CFA zone for the past six decades. Omar Bongo in Gabon,  Paul Biya in Cameroon, and Gnassingbé Eyadéma in Togo have amassed 120 years in power between them.  Those who resisted French rule have paid a heavy price, Togo's first post-colonial leader Sylvanus  Olympio, formerly moved to create a Central Bank of Togo and a Togolese Franc. January 13, 1963,  days before he was about to cement this transition, he was shot dead by former Togolese  soldiers enrolled in the French colonial army. A few days later, Farida Nabourema's grandfather  and his comrades were arrested and tortured by the military for organizing against the puppet  government the French had installed. Gnassingbé Eyadéma was one of the soldiers who committed the  crime. He later seized power and became Togo's dictator with full French support, ruling for  more than five decades and promoting the CFA Frank until his death from 1967 to 2005. His  son rules to this day. Olympio's murder was just one of the many ways in which France has punished  those who would overthrow its rule. Whether it was France collapsing the Malian economy  by rendering the Malian Franc in convertible or by pouring huge quantities of counterfeited banknotes  into the Guinean economy their retribution is brutal. Learning about the 1994 devaluation of  the CFA Franc opened Farida's eyes to the ways in which currency is used as a mechanism of control.  Farida's father had his bank account restricted because of his pro-democracy activism. Farida,  fearing the same retribution, has turned to Bitcoin, which has been a financial lifeline  to keep the democracy movement going inside Togo's dictatorship. \"When I discovered Bitcoin,  I realized it was a cultural scientific and most importantly, economic revolution all bundled into  one.\" People in the West might be skeptical about Bitcoin. If you have Venmo and Cash App, you might  not see why it is important, but when you go to Togo, more than 75% of the people have never set  foot in a bank. \"Today, Africa is made up of 54 countries and an incredible 46 currencies.\"  Bitcoin gives Africans the ability to unite on one monetary standard, controlled neither by dictators  nor by colonial powers. Money and currency are buried beneath the surface, and the global human  rights movement, they hardly ever come up at human rights conferences and are rarely discussed among  activists. Monetary repression continues to be hidden and not spoken of in polite circles.  The reality today for the 182 million people living in CFA Nations, is that while they may be  politically independent in name, the economies and money are still under colonial rule.  But even monetary independence from France would not guarantee that they will perform well  or that the country's leaders will not abuse the currency.  Today, Farida and like-minded activists are spreading the word of Bitcoin.  \"It is clear that people are in need of a currency that actually breaks the will,  one that cannot be manipulated by government of any kind.\" Cameroonian Economist Joseph Tchundjang  Pouemi wrote: Monnaie, servitude, et liberté, the thesis monetary dependence is the foundation  of all other forms of dependence, the final words of the book ring especially strong today.  Africa's fate will be forged through money, or it won't be forged at all.",
