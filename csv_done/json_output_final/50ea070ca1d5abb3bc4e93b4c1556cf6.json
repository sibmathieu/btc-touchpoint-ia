useso check them out i also have a fulltutorial on them as well and thenfinally if you're backing up anyimportant bitcoin wallet get it in solidsteel you don't want just pieces ofpaper you know fire damage water damageruns the gamut can be scary i've heardsome horror stories so this is how i'mbacking up my stuff with the bill foddleover at privacy pros dot io just givesme that peace of mind and uh nice andsimple to use and get your seed phrasein something a little more substantialthan a slip of paperwith that let's dive into the showso let's chat prerequisites what are yougoing to need to know in order to diveinto this tutorial because if you've notexperimented with nodes and lightningand all that kind of stuff thenthis app isn't going to work out thegate for you becauseyou need some of your own infrastructureit's designed specifically so that youare trustlessly using your ownbitcoin lightninglines of liquidity your own lightningchannels and all of that through yourown node soi do have previous videos that will helpyou along with thisnumber one would be how to set up yourown bitcoin node now there's a ton ofdifferent options for this but onesimple one for those that areshy when it comes to new technologywould be to run an umbral node so i havea full tutorial on that that is linkeddown below in the show notes also thenyou're going to want to dive into how toactually set up your own lightningchannels now this isobviously a little bit of a learningcurve so this video in particular asyou're setting up your own lightningchannels and learning about howliquidity works and and how lightningworks and how you can route paymentsyou knowtake your time it may take a couplewatches it may take rewinding andlistening to different parts again butif you want to get your hands dirty andactually really really learn this is agreat way to do it so be sure to checkout that video once you have a node setup and then finally the only other thingthat i'd recommend isi'm going to be using moon wallet in acouple instances just sending paymentsback and forth for proof of concept herethis is a non-custodial lightning walletthat also does on-chain and i did a fulltutorial on it as well so you can checkthat out those three videosall the prerequisite that you reallyneed and then we can actually dive intozeus itself and how to use it so againwhat exactly is this well it allows youto connect directly to a bitcoinlightning node that you yourself haveset up so you've created channels withother individuals and you're kind ofmaintaining that you're running your ownbitcoin node so you're not trustingsomeone else to do it you're verifyingthe code everything yourself all yourtransactionsand so this allows you to link into thatliquidity pooland actually send and receivepaymentsto and fromyour node and other peersfrom anywhere in the globe okay so youcan connect to your node and then thisgives you full access to that so when idid a video on zeusabout a year and a half ago somethinglike that maybe a year ago i was able toeffectively connect this app to my nodeat home in canada while i was in greeceand then i was able tosend and receive payments i was able topeople were streaming mymypodcast and they were able to basicallybe sending minute by minute paymentsjust to listen to the podcast i was ableto see those payments coming into mynote and have access to spend themwherever i saw fiton the fly on the other side of theglobecommunicating with a node in canadawhich was really cool and it was allstuff that i had set up myself so thisis what we're in for today let's take alook at the app and how to get it set upassuming that you already have a noderunning yourselfso here i am logged in to my umbral nodeon my desktop computer now this is goingto be an example of how you mightconnect to your node with zeus and i'mjust going to show you where you gowithin your umbral node but it maydiffer from node implementation to nodeimplementation whatever you're usingon umbral they have an option for aconnect wallet over on the left handside so i'm going to click on that andthen you get a drop down menu and you'rejust going to look for zeus and when weclick on that we're going to get theinformation we need to connectall right so on this screen we have aseries of steps basically we need toopen the app scan the qr code that'shidden under the sticky note herethen you're going to make sure you checkoff a few options save everything andthen we should have access to this nodewithinwithin zeus on our phone so let's goahead and go through those stepsso here's what we're going to see whenwe first open up the zeus app and simplywe're going to go down to the bottom andhit get startednow the first thing we want to do ofcourse is connect a node so we're goingto click on that option and we seethere's no nodes available there sowe're going to hit the plus button inthe top right anddown at the bottom there's an optionthat says scan lnd connect configalternatively we couldput in all of this information righthere uh if you're dealing with somethingthat isn't umbral if you can find thisinformation through your note thenthat's where you're going to beutilizing itbut for us all we need to do right nowis uh as per the second option and orthe second instruction in umbral rightnow we need to tap scan lnd config andthat's going to open up our camera toscan the qr code on the screen so we'lldo that momentarily herea few moments later now this is going toautofill a lot of information into ourscreen hereeverythingautofills including the uh the nextoption of making sure that we've checkeduse tor that is already on and so we'regoing to go ahead and we're going to hitsave node config the white button downbelowalright and so we can already see thatwe have a reflected balance which issplit between lightning and on chain andthat total is up here we can see theindividual values down below andwe'll just get out of our umbral screenbecause we actually don't need itanymore and we can now start utilizingthe app so it's really as simple asscanning a qr codesaving that configuration and you're offto the races so let's dive in now towhat zeus can doso let's get an overview of what we havein front of us uh we have our totalbalance up top we have our lightningbalance split below and our on chainbalance as well in the top right thereis a scan button the little square thatwill open up your camera to scan aninvoice and if we tap on where it sayslightning you have the option to receivesend orfigure out your routingand for on chain same thing receive sendand in the middle you have the optionsto actually see your individual utxosdown below there's a little arrow if youtap up you can see any transactions thathave been going through your nodesending receiving so and so forth soright here you can actually seeall the times that i've received setsfor people listening to the showvia podcasting 2.0 so there's a bunch oftransactions there really cool to seethat kind of stuff i really enjoy it andthen if you tap in the top right you canactuallybreak down exactly what you want to seeif you want to change how thatinformation is represented so and soforth okaywe'll go back out here so down at thebottom this is kind of our home screenand then if you tap on thenext tab here this is a breakdown ofyour channels so we have a totaloutbound of 21 million sats we have atotal inbound of 20 million sats and youcan see kind of each individual channelhow it isdistributed how much is on your sideversus their side of the channel so andso forth andthis allows us to even tap into theindividual channelsseebasically everything about it how muchhas been received and sent through thechannels the capacitythe commit fee all of the stuff that'sinvolved in this what the the fees areset ateverything is here and we can even go sofar as to set all of those settings forindividual channels as well all rightyou can also this is the screen fromwhich you would set up new channels withnew individuals that you'd like to openchannels withand back on the home screen here in thetop left this is where you're going toget more of your kind of fine tuning andsettings and more information your nodeinfo anything about privacy you canchange your security like password andpin uhsign or verify messages your currencyyou can set uh if you choose to set alocal currency for this app you can dothatyou can also change the languageandthere are different themes so there'sdark lightall kinds of different themes that ifyou see fit you can go ahead and changethem i like the dark theme myself so i'mgoing to stick with that and then just ageneral about screenand right back let's dive into actuallydoing some transactions hereso first up let's deal with lightningitself the the top option here what canwe do with it so if we tap on it againwe have receive routing and sending okayso let's receive a payment to our nodeso we're going to go ahead uhwe're going to and again this does applyto on chain as well if you want toreceive an on-chain transaction there'sa tab here and you can hit get newaddress and it will just generate a newbitcoin address for you to send towhich you can show a qr code or copy theaddress so and so forthbut we're going to be utilizinglightning right now and solet's just do a simple payment ofi don't know we'll say 500 sats perfectand you can set an expiration time youcan set a memo maybe we'll just say umwe'll say zeus testandyeah our our time it'll expire in 3 600seconds umdo we want to include include route hitsum hints rather do we want an ampinvoice which means it splits thepayment into multiple pieces to getthere it's a pretty small payment idon't think we need to worry about thatso we're just going to go ahead andwe're going to hit create invoiceall right so this will create an invoicewhich we can copy or show a qr code thatcould be scanned if you're receiving apayment from somebody right in front ofyou you can simply hit show qr codehowever if you're utilizing this to sendfrom another app you've got on yourphone you're probably going to want tocopy that invoice we're going to hitcopyand we're going to jump out we're goingto open up our moon wallet i'll just putin the pin off screen hereand we're going to go ahead and we'regoing to hit sendwe're going to paste in that invoice wejustcreated so we can see here this is goingto be 500 sats going to that particularinvoice with a one sat network fee for atotal of 501 sats and we can see thenote that we created in the invoice sayszeus testthat looks all good to me so i'm goingto go ahead and hit sendso back in zeus here after exiting thatinvoice that we created we can actuallygo and tap the up arrow to see thelatest transactionsso we've actually there's somebodycurrently apparently listening to thepodcast right now because we see acouple transactions of 99 sats but herewe gohere's our 500 satinvoice that was paid and is nowresiding on our nodes lightning walletor our lightning note itself but can beaccessed immediately from zeusso let's now test sending out of zeussending a transaction soi've got again my moon wallet here andwe'll just try sending back to it sowe're going to hit receive and moonlet's create an invoice fora thousand sats instead so we're goingto make sure that this is in sets we'regoing to say we'd like a thousandwe'll confirm the amountand we'll copy that so that we can goback over to zeus herewithin zeus to send a lightning paymentreally simple you're going to tab onlightning you're going to hit sendand then it auto detects that you havean invoice in your clipboard so you cantake a look you can review everythingand if all looks good andagain if we we saw something for atomicmultipath payments before uh it says ifthere if this is an amp payment wouldyou like to accept that and you can setin a maximum number of paths we'regetting into a bit of the nitty-grittyhere but just know that those optionsare here but nonetheless i see athousand sats going to this destinationi'm gonna pay this invoiceperfect transaction successfully sent wecan now go back to the walletand let's check in moon here to makesure it has indeed come throughyou were paid a thousand sets from thelightning networkeverything looks good to gonow while we are on the lightningportion of this i just wanted to showthe last option here when you tap onlightning is routing and what routingwillshowis any fees that you've collectedthrough your node for routingpayments now my node currently is notreally set up to be a routing nodeearning a lot of fees but nonetheless ican see that you know i've got a couplesats coming in here and there from todayand if i zoom out a week then it's alittle bit more if i zoom out a monththen it's a little bit more so you knowi am earning some fees through my node icouldspend a bit more time on that andprobably earn a little bit morebut this will break it all down for youbased on the timeline you are curiousaboutand you can also see your general nodefees so mine are set pretty low rightnowbasically to the lowest and you canchange your fee rate or your base feefor whatever you choose it to be okayso i'm going to leave thisit's just set right there but just knowthat you can change your fees throughthat routing page if you see fitnow if you're out watching this videoand you're diving into lightning and uhyou've already done the steps of settingthem up node and running your ownchannels you're probably pretty familiarwith how to execute an on-chaintransaction so i'm not going to gothrough the exact details here but justkind of show you the receive and thesend screen so you're familiar but ifyou tap on chain and you hit receiveagain you will be able to hit get newaddress it will generate a new bitcoinaddress for youand once this new address is generatedyou have the option of showing a qr codethat can be scanned you can copy theaddress or you can utilize nfc which ihaven't done myself because i don'treally have anything nfc that i dobitcoin with but that is an option aswell and if you're done with thisaddress you can generate a new onewhen it comes to sending again hit theon chain and hit the send buttonnow if you do have an invoice still inyourclipboard it will show this but if youjust simply go back it will take you tothe regular send screen now this is justa unified send screen for reallyanything it can either be a lightningpayment request a key sendaddress if that's enabled or a regularbitcoin address or you can just scanwhatever you're looking to send to andit will figure it out for you but youcan just paste in a regular bitcoinaddress hereand sent to it as you see fit as long asyou have the funds available on chainand not tied up in lightning channelsalso if you hit on chain and you go tocoins it will actually show you yourindividual utxos so i can see here ihave four utxos of varying amounts so ican actuallytap on those see those details and i canyou know utilize them as i see fitand see thosedetails which address it's allocated tohow long it's been confirmed for so onand so forth so all of that is availableto me as well through that on chain menuso let's talk about opening up channelson the fly and we're gonna do that rightnow so we're gonna jump down to thebottom tab here for our channels and inorder to open up a new channel you'regoing to hit the plus button up topand you can paste in the appropriateinformation here or you can scan usingthe scansquare up in the top right souhthis is one ml it's a website where youcan look up different lightning notesand right now i pulled up theasync lightning node and so what i'dlike to do is maybe i can get someadditional fees by opening up a channelto this particular node and then bumpingup my fees a little bit for this wellconnected node so that if anybody usesthat route then perhaps i'll get a fewextra fees there so i'm going to goahead and do that now i could go aheadand paste in the public keyand the portand all of that information intomy zeusmy zeus wallet here or i could just goaheadand i canjust hit the scan button so i'm going togo ahead and do that i'm going to openup my cameraand when i scan that it fills ini'll just open it up here it fills inall that information for me okay sothat's pretty much all i need i canalways double check the mempool to seewhat kind of fee i'm gonna need to openup that channeli'm looking at it right now the fees arenotsuper crazy but i wouldn't mind it beinga little bit higher umso i'll i'll go ahead and actually thenthat's really really nice what they'veadded here if you go and you tap on feesit gives you from mempool kind of therecommended fees so right nowi'm not in a huge rush for this channelto actually open but i don't want it totake forever so i'm just gonna kind ofset a middle of the road fee of aroundfive sats per byte okay maybe that'llhave me waiting for a while but that isokay by me so i'm going to confirm thefee thereand then it saysthe local amount how muchhow many sats would you like sittingin this channel so i'm going to open adecent sized channel here i'm going toopen a 5million sat channel with async so youhave the option to make it privatei don't need to do that for this one soi'm going to go ahead i'm going to openchannelall right successfully connected to piersuccessfully open channelperfect so that is now in the process ofopening so keep in mind it's not openright away we've got to wait for anon-chain transaction and i set aslightly lower fee than uh next block somight be waiting a little bit but that'sthat's okay we're all set here uh itlooks like we're good to go we can goback and once that channel has or oronce ratherthattransaction has gone through on chainthen that new channel will be reflectedhere in my in my total uh lightningoutbound and inbound or i guess it wouldbe in my outboundpotentialchannels that i have liquidity for okaynow if i go back here i can see on mymain screen here that i've gotfunds that were on chain that are nowkind ofin limbo or at least waiting forconfirmations because i use multipleutxos in order to execute thistransaction so as soon as that settles iwill have access to all of that and theni can see that my lightning balance isnow about 5 million sats higher okay sothis kind of just breaks it down butwe'll have to wait for that settlementto see that reflected and one other noteif you go into your activity and you seein your transactions you will see uh anyopens channels they will be shown as anon-chain unconfirmed transaction ofcourse until it confirms but you canthen tap on that transaction and followit so that you know when that channel isup and readyso now that there's been a confirmationor multiple confirmations onthatlightning channel opening we can seethat we now have again a single unifiedbalance and then it's split betweenlightning and on chain my on chain hasbeen reduced and my lightning has goneup if igo into my actual channelsi can now look for that particular nodeconnection that i made to async righthereand i can go ahead and i canupdate that so i can already see thatthere's been some transactions that havegone through right there's 98 000 satson the opposite side of the channel andi opened it for 5 million sats soi might want to go and set new feesright here from within the app and i cando that so i just hit thatso i can have a base fee of whatever ilike but the percentage is kind of morewhat i'm after soi think i'm going to set this tomaybe 0.2 percentand we'll just kind of see how that goesif there's not a lot oftraffic going through that after a whilethen i can i can change it again anddrop it and that's pretty much all ineed to do so again this is a percentagehere unlike how you manage it in uhthunderhub there's a different way ofdoing it there but just so you know thisis a percentage so this is less than apercent it is two tenths of one percentto route a transaction of whatever isbeing routed all rightoutside of that everything looks good tome i'm not going to change my base feeof just one set and so i can go aheadand i can hit submit new feesandthat will now beall set for me andthat's pretty much it if i wanted touh close the channel i could do thatdown below obviously i just opened it soi'm not going to be doing thatand i can just back out of this and i'mnow updated i can see 13 channels now soi've added one and i go back to my homescreen everything is all good to goonce again zeus is a fantastic optionwhen it comes to using and managing yourown lightning node on the go the toolsthat are afforded to you just in asimple mobile app are prettyflooring honestly once you get into ityou realize what you're really doing soi can't recommend zeus enoughand i look forward to seeing what theyhave on the roadmap moving forward buteven just the difference between thelast time i covered it and this time theuser interface has improved so much andi thoroughly enjoy the new look ofeverything so uh kudos toevan and everybody over at zeus withwhat they're
