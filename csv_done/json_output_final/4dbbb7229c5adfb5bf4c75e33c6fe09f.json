  "text": "Corey welcome back to the showgood to be here Stefanso uh lots happening in the space andyou know it's one of those things whereit's just there's always so much goingon in Bitcoin and I think maybe in a waythat's what uh it's so intriguingbecause there's so many things changingabout it even in a supposed bear marketand uh at a time when of course we'reout here trying to teach the DCA or AutoDCA messageum but you know there are I guessthere's different aspects to considerwith this and I know um this issomething uh you're writing a pieceabout this as wellum so yeah why don't you tell us alittle bit about uh what you're writingand what you're working onyeah sure so it's something I've beentweeting about in different formsreally since publishing the missionstatement of swan 10 million bitcoinersback in the beginning of 2020 so thishas been kind of out there I'm justfinally putting pen to paper and got afirst draft and I should get it outaround the time of the Pacific Bitcoinconference in a couple of weeksum Loosely it's it's the race versus theWar uh might end up being titled uh therace the race that avoids the war orsomething like that we'll see what Tomermakes me do he's our editor-in-chief atSwan but uh anyway it's this conceptthat if you win the adoption race andyou can Define that a few different waysand we'll obviously get into how IDefine it and what I think actuallymatters for for this concept you canavoid fighting a war over Bitcoin andit was really nice to see uh MichaelSaylor crystallize this concept as wellin his recent keynote speech at theatlas Society Gala uh he basicallytermed it uh you don't want to be amartyr you want to be a winneryou know and it's kind of like so it'sall sort ofand there's a lot of people that arereaching kind of the same conclusionthat we have this opportunity whereevery bit of effort that we do to sortof stealBitcoin s-t-e-e-l to prepare it for apotential war is a defensive maneuverthat makes it less attractive to attackand then from the other side you haveall of the adoption going on with thepeople the 10 million bitcoiners that weneed for an intransigent minority in theUnited States and at the company levelwith the banks and the corporations andyou think of like what nydig does orwhat you know Swan business or SwanPrivate Client Services does and thenthink of all of the efforts of satcenter and open SATs and BPI and all thepeople sort of you know picking up fromfrom where we got dropped by theblockchain Association and coin Centerwhich obviously don't really care aboutbitcoinersum and we created our own our own groupsto go and and sort of sway the minds oflegislators and lawmakers and soattacking on all these fronts while alsobuilding up the the Privacy Tech and thecustody Tech and everything that youneed on the tech side for Bitcoin andadvancing therethese things are kind of working in thein uh they're pinching out anyopportunity that the only entity thatcould ever really make life difficultfor bitcoinersuh the US governmentpinching out the opportunity that thatthe government in the United Statesmight have to coordinate some kind ofmassive globalheadache for Bitcoin and bitcoinersgloballyand while we're there I'm curious yourview why specifically the US governmentis do you believe we are at the pointthat let's say the Russian government orthe Chinese government or some othergovernment they just they're still notpowerful enough to have that same kindof impactwell they never have been and the USgovernment is kind of like a umit's a figurehead for the system itselfright the system potentially defendingitself uh this is a the base currency ofthe globe today and the global system isU.S treasuries and represented by the USdollar and so that's what you're lookingtofor some number of years or decadescoexist with as an asset or anotherasset a global asset one that has usesand then I think eventually uh unseatand become the global standard uh whichI think we all believe is you know wellif you're listening to Stefan's show andhave been for quite some time you'llprobably understand that folks like usbelieve this to be inevitableum so when I talk about this war a warversus Bitcoin can't be one it'sactually inevitable that you'll losebut you could delaythe opportunity for this generation orour children or our children's childrento live in this you know this brightorange future that we always talk aboutor you know sort of post bitcoinizationwhere Bitcoin is kind of used broadlyand is ushering in an era of Greaterproductivity and and prosperity for forhumans around the world and and that'swhat we want to see you knowthere was this I'm pretty sure it was anAndreas video from 2015 or 16 orsomething and and essentially it boileddown toif bitcoinization can Stave off oneincident of hyperinflation Fiathyperinflation in any country around theworld then we all essentially have amoral imperative to try to make Bitcoinbitcoinization happen as fast aspossiblethis is why I've never been in the campof like oh you know cheap sets for me ohthey're stamping out Bitcoin in somecountry well cheap sets for me like I'mnot down with that I think that's youknow that's fine if that's that's howyou roll but like I really am in this totry to make it happen faster than itotherwise wouldand I think this is uh which we couldarguably say is a bit of thethe Romanticism uh of uh people who areinto Bitcoin right that it's not justthis purely neutral and dispassionatething although certainly you could lookat it that way tooum but as you sayreally really bad things can happen whenthere is high inflation or hyperinflation in the fiat currencyum so maybe you want to elaborate alittle bit on that like what does afailure mode look like what are some ofthe bad examples or maybe any historicalexamples that you think are relevant forusyeah sure I mean I I think it'll be moreinteresting for me to get into some ofmy own personal experience over the lastdecade uh because I go to Turkey everyyear so I think that'll be kind ofinteresting and I'll share some of thatbut uh you know probably the one that'scatching my eye right now is peopleposting pictures of paying for things uhwith cash in Argentinaum because they still have you know fivehundreds and thousands in circulationbut a lunch costs you know hundreds ofthousandsof of of pesos so these these giant cashstacks that you're having to pay forthings with are getting pretty hilariousand out of handumin Turkeyit's really started to kick in in a bigway in the last two or three years andbecoming noticeable but when I firstwent there in 2010 it was 1.8 Lira perdollar and now it's 18.5 Lira per dollarandwhen you don't have a stable currencyand it's just kind of running away fromyou and I think the official statisticsare 82 percent I know Steve hanke hasyou know his method of of measuring itand thinks it's more like 140 orsomething like that even a lot of Turksuh that are running their own numbers inin country with various offices arethinking it's about 99 or 100 annualinflation right now so you know notcrazy waymar hyperinflation yet but waymore than enough com to completelydisrupt how things workand so maybe it would be helpful to justgive a few anecdotes just to kind offill it let you understand so uh realestate in Istanbul has more than doubledin price uh and this is adjusted forinflation in the past three years soit's just pricing tons and tons ofpeople out of their homes like imagineif an inflation-adjusted terms theaverage high house price in the U.S wentup from like you know 250 to 500 inthree years or something like that it'sjust it's really fast to make that kindof adjustment and this is just peoplefleeing the currency and putting it intowhatever they possibly can that's notLira so they're stacking Flats becausethey don't know how to stack SATs yetthey're just buying apartments rightum not unlike what you see the Chinesepopulation doing which is probably thebiggest bubble on the planet today is isobviously Chineseuh apartment buying essentiallyumso so that's one major Distortion and sowhat else you've got a lot of efforts bythe government to try to offset theeffects of inflation so you have youknow this this desire to keep rents lowwe can stay in real estate for a littlebit and so they have crazy rent controlsthat basically make it really cheap tostay in your house and so owning owninga leaselike a long-term lease on an apartmentis a more it's better than owning ahouse in many ways if you have it for anumber of years uh not on like a rentcontrolled apartment in in New York Cityif you're ever a Seinfeld fan you knowthat they're like sitting around at awake or something and they find itsomebody else is dying and four peoplesay what's the rent because you're justso excited to take over a dead person'srent controlled apartment in New Yorkcity so it's like that throughout all ofturkey nowandwhat that means is you can no longerleave your house to take a job somewhereelsebecause you can't afford a new placebecause if you move into a new place youhave to pay the market rentand so imagine that like you really haveto stay within commuting distance ofyour home or if you take a new job youhave to accept maybe a disastrouscommute that's just terrible and you'regoing from like the European side to theAsian side fighting that bridge trafficwhatever it is uh okay and nowon the employment sidethey're suffering obviously they'regetting squeezed everything's costingmore so the companies are not raisingwages willinglyand so the only way to get arrays is toleave your job and join another companyand so people in their 30s and 40s likemid-career are jumping jobs every sixmonths every 12 months just so that theycan go and be able to afford their livesand feed their families not because theywant to leave not because they want towalk out the door with the mostimportant source of capital a companyhas which is the knowledge inrelationships and know-how that you'veaccumulated while you were there or inyour career prior and that just walksout the door like a revolving doorconstantly so that people can keep upwith inflationand they have to balance that with youknow you can only do that or for a jobthat's close to your house because youcan't leave your house so look at allthis friction that's being introduced inthe real estate market in the labormarket because of inflation and thinkabout how that affects the productivityand the profitability of Turkishindustryanyway I'll pause for a minute yeah andI I imagine as we get to more advancedphases of this inflation you start tosee breakdowns in terms of what productsare available on the shelves and fromwhat I've heard and what I've read aswell there are examples wheregovernments try to do price controls andof course anybody who studied Austrianeconomics and generally free marketeconomics in general teaches us whythat's a bad idea but unfortunatelygovernments still try it andunfortunately people still suffer don'ttheythey do yeah and we'll see how this oneplays out it's usually been bred likeliterally your daily bread bread andcircuses like it's always bread becausethat's the cheapest thing that you canpossibly produce that sustains humanlife essentially in in mass populationcenters and so that's been the one thingthat they've kept the price low ontraditionally so they basicallysubsidize the means of production ofbread and essentially sell it at Cost orslightly below costuh you know and they looks like theykind of got saved this year uh becausethe expectation was that there was goingto be kind of a crappy wheat Harvest andmaybe not a second harvest because ofthe Ukraine and Russia but essentiallyeverywhere other than Russia and Ukrainehad I think a massive bumper crop and soa lot of these forecasts for what mighthappen you know bringing about like ArabSpring on a grand scale and turkey wouldhave had its you know its own pressureswith with increased cost of inputs uhwas put off by it looks like a year orsix months or something like that butit's this risk that's just kind ofhanging out there when you have uhyou're essentially subsidizinghalf the population or two-thirds of thepopulation just to feed themuh and you can we know where that goeseventuallyyeah it's horrific yeah gone I was justgonna say you know all these years of uherdogan the head of uh akepe the theruling party you know seems like he'sbeen there forever well guess what he'sbeen there forever it's 20 years nextyear and there are elections in June of2023 and he's not been able to puttogether any sort of Coalition thatmakes it look like he will be in poweranymore so now you've got inflation andall this disruption and all thisfriction in the economyand all of the geopolitical stuffhappening on their doorstep and you haveyou know probably a transition of powerand less scarily enough he figures outsome way to stay in power in the nexteight months and you see a lot of saberrattling going on with with Greece andother neighbors and and you know tryingto figure out some reason to maybe ginup some reason to have emergency powersor something like thatbut uh yeah it's all basically inflationis such a key part of this story andwhat's happened and it's it's just beenfascinating to watch over the last 10yearsyeah and I and I I'm reminded here ofhow I think there's a higher quote aboutit about how he's saying it's not anexaggeration to save a lot of history isactually about inflationary stories andof course it may well be that highinflation drovepoliticians or other conditions to occurthat then maybe the story was aboutsomething else or maybe in the same waythat a magician tries to distract youthat they sort of try to cause someother issue somewhere else to say ohthat's a distraction from what you knowthe domestic problems happening backlocally which you know we You couldargue that's happening in many placesaround the worldum and yeah and I know in some Asiancountries so for example in Sri Lankathey will sometimes set they will setthe price of rice right so that's likeanother that's like another way thatthey do this kind of thingum and the broader problem is that we'reseeing this breakdown in society as youmentioned right like jobs people areturning over Jobs super quickly makingit difficult for businesses to operatewhere we see some really bad things andso for listeners who haven't already Irecommend checking out these books uhit's when money dies and I'm sure you'veread that Coreyum and another good one is when moneydestroys Nations which is on theZimbabwe hyperinflationum so those are a few examples and we westart to see some really bad thingshappen so I guess that's probably theyou know the path we're trying to Staveoff or at least trying to avoid thatwhat does thebrighter pathway look like so from hereto there before we get to the hyperbitcoinization what kinds of thingswould that pathway look likeI mean I think we kind ofthere are there are certainly dreams andwritings from you know Nick bartier andsafe and some others talking about thepotential for kind of a soft Landing forthe dollar system that we kind ofcoexist is sort of more slowly uh seeBitcoin rise in market cap and valuepurchasing power versus the dollarumprobably hard to do much about thepurchasing power thing that's going toprobably continue to explodeum but you know I think uh I think it'strue that as demand for Bitcoinincreases you would see both demand andSupply Fall for the dollar and kind ofthe dollar system broadly and so youmaybe wouldn't seeyou know massive hyperinflation possiblyif they are smart about it but beingsmart about it means them not beingscared of what's replacing it and that'swhere all the education and all the uhyou know evangelism and sort of teachingabout about Bitcoin comes in that's whywe're doing this rightabsolutely and I think the argument goesessentially that because we're living ina Fiat fractional Reserve System part ofhow money is created is when loans aretaken out and I guess the argument thatI've seen people like safety and make isthat under a Bitcoin parallel systemthere might actually be less demand forcredit and so therefore as you saidthere's going to be less US Dollarseffectively created through the themagic of fractional Reserve bankingum and so yeah maybe ifbitcoiners do the job right we build thecommunity we try to we build good toolsyou know there's code there's codereview there's all these things thenmaybe there's somewhat of a softeninghere of bad things that are about tohappen and it feels in a waymaybe a bit morbid or a little bit uhyou know unpleasant but I think this isthe this is the way to Stave off theworst of it in a wayum soin that sense what are some of the let'ssay obstacles or hurdles that we mightbe facing on the way as Bitcoin is whatyou know I know um you know we've you'vecommented a lot about uhfor example [ __ ] coin noise or cryptoquote-unquote cryptoum or the orange washers what are someof the obstacles and the hurdles that wemight face along the wayyeah I mean I I so this is kind ofif the framework is anything that youcan be doing to shore up bitcoin'sdefenses or sort of put it on offenseand increase its its speed essentiallyis helping win the race then anythingthat is working to slow Bitcoin down toslow down Bitcoin adoption is giving theContra Bitcoin forces more time to sortof catch up and get their [ __ ] togetherand if there are forces that want towork to defend the existingshitty system and and try to thwart theadvance of Bitcoin than anything thatslows down Bitcoin adoption isessentially helping the other sideand so that's what I think is going onlike I'm not gonna you know take somedude out of a four on four basketballgame who I know works for an altcoinfund and be like dude you're an enemy ofhumanitylike they don't understand it and theydon't expect them to see it through thatframeworkbut you know probably the the worstsingleentity acting against the interests ofBitcoin today is probably in JasonHorowitz The Venture Capital firm likethat's probably the number one enemy ofBitcoinand whether they see it or not is kindof beside the pointit happens to be true because they'rethe ones that are sucking the liquidityaway from Bitcoin using the words thatoriginated in Bitcoin to Market theirpump and dump scams like axi infinityand helium and all these [ __ ]projects World coin eyeball coinwhatever they were doing with theretinas like over and over again likethese things just come out of this [ __ ]coin Factory up on Sand Hill Road atAndresen Horowitz an otherwise venerablepretty solid Venture firm uh that'sreally good at marketing and they grabthe web 3 term and they pumped nfts andthen all this defy crap and they werethe big the big driving force behindSolana sort of sucking a lot of thejuice out of the bull market last yearthat should have been going towardBitcoin and all the noise was Solanathis that the other like Salon is[ __ ] they dumped they dumped almosta year ago they dumped 11 months ago andit's like nobody cares about Solanatoday a so all you were doing with allthat noise about all these futureproblems being solved by cryptoblockchain magic was just [ __ ] toline your pockets and like do you everstep back and look at the opportunitycost of the capital the 40 billiondollars that's gone into [ __ ] coin VC inthe last two and a half years versus youknow a few hundred million toward theBitcoin ecosystem and look at thedramatic under allocation towardbuilding on bitcoin that existsand just in the sucking in of all thiscapital and all this resource and allthis talk time just trying to get peopleto trade crypto you know like we gottalike look at Matt Damon and Tom Bradyand [ __ ] on on the Super Bowl talkingabout you get into the crypto Casinowhereas with their line right I meanit's it's not it's so much worse than azero-sum game because way over half theeconomic value is already taken by theInsiders and then the sophisticatedparticipants in the market the FTI I'msorry the the alamitas and the jumps andthe you know the sacs and all these guysthat are participating that are laughingat click Traders click Traders someonewho enters a trade with a mouse or akeyboard they laugh at them right it's aderogatory termandso you're already starting with like 50out of 100 and then those guys are notregulated and can do whatever they wantthey can paint the chart trick you allthe stuff that's actually regulated inin stock markets they can get away withwilly-nelly with no repercussions and sothe returns are more like power lawdistribution you know one percent takingall the money from 99 versus maybe like20 or 25 percent taking from the rest instock day trading plus that that pie isactually expanding because stocks growin value because they have Revenuebecause they're productive these cryptosare already again huge haircut off thetopit's a race to raised to the bottombecause as we know from the researchthat Sam Callahan had a research at Swanprivate and I did over the summer youknow only three out of 22 000 altcoinshave ever had a new all-time high inBitcoin terms three or more years aftertheir first all-time high and thosethree it's just Doge Ripple and um andBNB have bled out significantly sinceand will never ever hit that all-timehigh again so it's just a race to zeroin Bitcoin terms no matter what for allthese all coinsum so it's just it's just fake it'spretend SBF is a villain Brian Armstrongis a villain and Jason Horowitz is avillain Paradigm is a villain all theseguys are just you knowwasting our time with this chatter andthis noise and keeping people away fromthe signal that is Bitcoinand I think you're right I think there'sbeen so much fakeness fakedecentralizationover marketing over hyping justdishonest deceptive practicesall around the crypto quote-unquotecrypto Worldum and so look I I think I you know Ibasically agree with you but I think oneother question I would pose I wonder isthere also just a broader problem oflet's say apathy is it just that theaverage person like as an example rightso the quote unquote crypto Market uh inthe recent let's say 2021 you know uhearly 2022 bull cycle had a peak oflet's call it three trillion or so whichis still tiny compared to the globalmarket for bonds or the global marketfor property or stocks is it also justaround apathy and lack of knowledge inthe broader market like even excludingthe quote-unquote cryptoyeah I mean it is still kind of a dropin the bucket and this will be a muchmore interesting conversation withBitcoin at 10 trillion obviously so youknow they're 20x up from here orsomething four or 500k Bitcoin will bein every conversation all the time atthat point and I don't think we're thatfar away from that that's that's thisdecade in my viewum soyeah I mean some of it is some of it ispatience to some degreeas far as like wishing that that werehere immediately but it's not going tohappen without people working on itwithout people talking about it withoutpeople telling their friends withouteducating without understanding betterfor yourself so that you can go you knowdeeper into your own portfolio you knowresponsiblyumyeah I just I just think that a lot ofpeople have kind of given these thesecounteractors a pass and they shouldn'tthey should understand exactly what'sgoing on here that we do have anopportunity to bring Bitcoinall the way through totrusted store of value widely usedmedium exchange and at least dual unitof accountby 2035 like we race hard we can getthis [ __ ] done in 13 yearsumif we fail and we don't win the adoptionrace and the existing system you knowled by actors in the US government andprobably frankly with with a lot ofco-option by consensus and FTX and allthe crypto folks and then Jason Horowitzlike they may not realize it but theywill to survive end up working ContraBitcoin because they will be they are byNature political because they arecentralized and centralizing over timeso it introduces politics into it nomatter what well the end game ofpolitics is getting involved in politicsat the US government level to surviveand just like a dictator who may havecome into some country you know wishingthe best for the people once you cut afew deals with a few Shady people a fewfor shady characters for the good of thepeople now there's dirt on you nowyou've got to start paying people offnow you've got a patronage Network nowit's like the health and safety of yourchildren depend on staying in power andyou follow the path of every dictatorwell that's exactly the path that thesecrypto casinos follow they start off youknownot making a judgment just saying heylet's not be tribal let's let a millionflowers bloom and not ex not actuallyexercising sound judgment and making adetermination that Bitcoin is differentfrom these [ __ ] coins and these scamsand the end game of that is Desiring tobe co-opted by government and thebanking system and becoming part of itand working Contra BitcoinI think you you I couldn't have said itbetter I think that was an excellentexplanation of the dynamic that islikely to play out with some [ __ ] coinsthat the likely outcome for them is notnecessarily that they just all go tozero in this big uh Blaze is that someof them end up getting captured by thegovernment and that is a problemum I yeah and again it's it's the it'sthe players in the ecosystem it's thebig trading firms it's the alamitas thejumps it's it's the the exchanges likecoinbase and FTX like in binance likethose are the entities that actuallyaccrueall the lasting value or all the all thelonger term value in the crypto spaceit's it's the picks and shovels it's thecasinos themselvesum that control the market and theydon't actually care as you know from Sambakeman freed himself like they don'tactually care what's in the black box orwhat's in the magic box at allit's just something that can be tradedand thus will be traded as long as it'sallowed to be tradedthey don't actually care what it does oreven know what it does like that guydoesn't understand Bitcoin he openlytalks about not understanding Bitcoinyeah Iand one other question I'm curious toget your thoughts on givenwe've been through various Cycles inBitcoin now it doesn't necessarily haveto be four-year Cycles or whatever but Ithink most people agree with you knowwe've seen these sort of Bull and BearCycles I'm curious in your view if itwasn't for so much of this you knowquote-unquote crypto nonsense like if wecould just wave that magic wand and sayokay no you know crypto nonsense do youthink we still would have had Cyclesforeignbe able to see until we're like way pastit you know and and what defines the endof these you know so we had like atwo-year cycle from 11 to 13 and then afour-year cycle from 13 to 17 and thisfour-year cycle from 17 to 21.sure is how it looks like we peaked andyou know fall of 21 and you know would Itake another four-year cycle that endsin a rip roaring bull market in 2025sure I'll take that guarantee but I'dalso love to see this thing shoot pastyou know way past all-time highyou know next yearand then you know settle back a littlebit and shoot up more and just kind oflike get out of those cycles and andjust kind of have more of a random Ithink it's better for Bitcoin in thelong run to have kind of a random walkupwarduh that isn't so tied to that becauseyou know I just I just you know the memeis probably not it doesn't really havemuch of a rational basis and so seeingit die I think would probably be goodum but we'll see it may have legs yetyeah yeah and I mean I'm not saying it'slike oh it's it's pretty ordained to besome for you halving cycle I just meanmore in the sense that uh Eve let's saywe could wave our magic wand and therewas no quote-unquote crypto would therestill have been uh you know a herdmomentum rush and a herd momentum youknow crash and you know I'm not sayingevery four years but maybe that wouldhave been the case anyway yeah I thinkit's I think it's orthogonal I don'tthink it's necessarilytied to each otheryou know if anything there's a hugeincentive for the altcoin promoters topromote pump Cycles so that they can geta bunch of dog crap off the ground youknow according to the latest memes youknow saying hey the having is comingcoming and alts always perform betterthan Bitcoin in in Bull markets and thebull Market's definitely coming so buymy [ __ ] coinso I think I think that type of thattype of uh numerology or astrology orwhatever is uh is much more useful topump and dump promoters than it is topromoters of sound money of course yeahI mean at the end of the day we uh Ithink many of us are clear-eyed aboutwhat our end goal is it's you know toprice things inside we want to repressthe world into sets uh and I think toyour some of your some of the earlierpoints as well about avoiding capture ofthe system I think that's probably oneother question that's still in people'sminds around things like kyc right now Ihave my own thoughts on this as wellum but I'm curious how you're seeingthat do you see kyc as being like thisbig existential risk to bitcoin actuallybeing the freedom tool that we wouldlike it to be or how are you seeing thatI think this kind of fits into the raceversus the war to me I think that uhpeople who are staunchlyin favor of of no kyc coins or just youknow peacefully building their their ownlargenot kyc'd stack or you know miningwithout having their name on theInternet or whatever it is you know Ithink that's the type of thing thatmakes Bitcoin look really reallydifficult to attackwhich is amazing butit's also wildly positive for Bitcoinschances in this raceto avoid the warto have the price of Bitcoin go way wayway up this is a monetary protocolthis is about sucking assets intoBitcoin that you know that value is isbetter stored in Bitcoin than it is inthese inferior asset classes and youknow that's got to be meeting peoplewhere they are that's that's you knowobviously at Swan we do everything wepossibly can to encourage self-custodyand we write all kinds of you knowarticles and do podcasts about coinjoins and mixing and you know like wepromote all kinds of services you know Iprobably search my handle and the numberof times I've sent people to bisque overthe years when they're asking about nokyc coins like check it out if thatworks for you then you should absolutelydo that and if that's how you want toroll I think the Azteca guys are doingcool stuff with vouchers where if youyou know if you have the time and like abig stack to you is like a few thousandor something like and you're gonna goand go visit a bunch of stores and usevouchers to build your stack like by allmeans do it but you know when you'retalking about people buying you knowtens of millions of dollars like youjust can't do thatwithout it and frankly we want thosepeople on our side as staunch BitcoinAdvocates and we want them not toabdicate their role in the system wewant them to flip the system from theinsideright so I think they're bothadvancing the cause of Bitcoin andadvancing the speed that we're runningthe race so that we don't have to fightthis warright and I think that's a fair way toput it I understand and I you know Iface criticism on this point also peoplesay oh look see you're supporting a kycexchange or you work it with a kyccompany but here's how I'm seeing it aswell I thinkwould I rather somebodyhold some kyc coin that theyself-custody or hold zero I would ratherhold some coin than zero so and thatpersonis still helping they are still helpingthe overall cause as you're sayingthey're helping the race in this sensenow I understand you know people like usyou and I Corey we might face criticismuh for you know working with the kycenvironment but I still believe on netit's we are in a world of overallsurveillance and our best chance atimproving this overall thingis tobring about a Bitcoin standard or somekind of world where people can justtransact natively in Bitcoin and Ibelieve that we can if we bring morepeople into our system into our worldinto our parallel Financial system ofBitcoinwe're helping speed that processum but you know it's one of those thingswhere there is a bit of a heated debateum and we see this back and forth uh butI I still believe getting more peopleinto the system is helpful and I thinkperhaps that's maybe that's where thethat kind of disagreement lies becausesometimes people would say well we'llsee that you know that kyc'd hodler isnot helping the censorship resistancebut I actually do believe in some smallway they are but you know let's seeyeah I mean listen shout out to theanons that do DM memany of whom are very very staunch nokyc people and they at least admit thatyou know I and Swan are good for Bitcoineven if we disagree on a few points soyou know you there may be just a few ofyou that have written but it reallymeans a lot because you know I know howpassionate uh some of these folks thatare that are you know coding amazing[ __ ]around privacy tech and and the factthat they can actually reach out and anddrop a note you know you know who youare there's only three of you so but Iappreciate it yeah uh it's been it'sbeen a rough year I've been in a lot offights this yearyeah I mean look there's a lot of fightsall the time in in uh Bitcoin land butat the same time let's um also rememberto zoom out right because if we look atyou know I can imagine what someone likeJeff Booth might say now Jeff Booth isgoing to be a Pacific Bitcoin also so wecan hear directly from him there alsobut um you know I can imagine the way hemight explain this as well is to sort ofreally zoom out and remember the biggerpicture there are a lot of people whojust literally haveyou know all of their money in let's saystocks and bonds and they have zeroBitcoinand right now Bitcoin is this tiny tinything if we're able to grow it we areable to effectively grow the size of ourquasi Army right we're not like actuallygoing to fight but in a sense we'regoing to push an idea an idea whose timehas come this idea of sound money thisidea of a money that's outside thecontrol of any Central Bank anygovernment any Corporation and so youknow I think that's that's really howI'mseeing it but I can understand rightthere our privacy and security concernsum you know actually here's anotherinteresting one how public should we beabout our Bitcoin use like should wewalk down the street with a Bitcoint-shirt uh how do we balance that sortof privacy security concern but also wewant to Advocate we want to helpnormalize Bitcoin don't we yeah yeahit's an interesting one obviously it'sit's a decision that each person has tomake for themselvesum you know cats out of the bag for meuh so I have more incentive you knowthan most to make it completely safe andnormal to be a bitcoinerand I think that'sthat's a decision that I made prettyearly on obviously deciding to be theface of the company and and and getgoing and umyou know it there are trade-offs you gotto think about it a little bit you knowyou got to think about security you gotto think about you know where you arelike getting recognized in public is aweird thingand it's happening like increasinglywhich is disconcertinglike yeah I don't know that I'll everget used to it and I feel for thesefreaking La celebrities more than I everhave and I don't think I'll ever say hito one again because it's such a weird[ __ ] thingum you know it's like I don't know someguy came up super nice guy and you knowwanted to take a picture of me with hisyou know five-year-old daughter at apark like sat his daughter down next tome to take a picturehe was like freaking out that I was likethat Bitcoin Corey guy and I was like ahmanthis is super weird I'm never ever everdoing anything like this to any otherhumanso yeahum you know but uh I think but I thinkit's important you know I look at youknow uhyou know Matt Odell putting his face outthere and making that decision to to bepublic and just like my God howimportant that has been to so many tensof thousands maybe hundreds of thousandsof of new bitcoiners uh having his voiceand having him stand behind his wordsand kind of just be out there with hisname and his face and and just the thelittle bit of extra credibility thatcomes with thatum you know or just just the differentchannels you can talk through onceyou're willing to be on camera andthings like that so you know again it'sa decision that everybody has to makefor themselves but some people are kindof called to do it and they they feel upto it and they make that decision I hopewe don't get burned you know and I'mtrying to make sure we win this damnrace so there's no war on bitcoinersso that that we don't have to pay forthese decisions for some dumb reasonbecause of some horrible gestapo-likegovernment actions in the futureright and it's also probably fair to saythat maybeif Bitcoin is so normalized it'lleventually just be like oh their walksCorey or they walk Stefan they areinternet users well okay yeah it's youknow it's 2022. wake up everyone's gotan email everyone's got internet like Imean I think if if Bitcoin getsnormalized to that degree then it's notsuch a big deal to be known publicly asa bitcoiner because eventually everyonewill be a bitcoiner I mean I guess andthat's what I want yeah just just it'sjust money that's what we want to get toand I think we have I think we actuallyhave this time frame of you know thenext decade and a half to two decadeswhere we can win this raceand again never have to fight the warum I yeah so you asked about the articleit's almost done Tomer gave me somenotes unlike the one the missionstatement the 10 million bitcoinersarticle which like I would just Ichanneled that one I literally wrote itdown straight whatever 600 words didn'tedit a single character and published ituh this one I don't know it's taken alittle while because I've been thinkingabout it for so long there's so manythings I want to fit in but I want it tobe short uh anyway I'm going to give aspeech version of it uh at PacificBitcoin so I think I'll do it onThursday November 10th but uh I'll kindof talk about this concept at PBfantastic and so this is another commonquestion and I received this questionalso people ask me what are the ways tohelp out I'm not a developer so what aresome of the ways that you would suggestif somebody's listening now they want toget involved and they are not adeveloper what are some of the ways forthem to get involvedum wellthere are so many different ways I meanyou can you can write you can join acustomer service team part-time remotelyfor many of these Bitcoin companies youknow we've had people just you know comeon part-time for 10 hours a week and endup on the team you know a year laterfull-time things like that uh Bitcoincompanies are really used to workingremotely very few of them have like acentral location with all theiremployees in one place so you can kindof be anywhere which is nice especiallyfor people that live out of expensivepopulation centers because Bitcoincompanies again because all of thisVenture Capital gets sucked up by the uhthe crypto scams most of the Bitcoincompanies are fairly lean and aren'tpaying uh ridiculous salaries and so weactually lean towarduh hiring remote in many cases becausethe cost of living is so much lowerthere it makes running as a Bitcoincompany uh a better value prop becausewe use remote workers so that'ssomething to keep in mindum I think all of the Bitcoin companiesand projects are looking for some proofof work that can be an active Twitterhandle that can be a newsletter that youwrite for your friends and family thatcan be just a Blog that you start thequality is really easy to seeum getting involved in a Meetuporganizing meetups joining I mean Idon't think there's a Bitcoin Meetupthat couldn't use another organizeryou know or another person that'sactually going to do some work to helpwith the Meetup and a lot of theseconnections get formed you know you hangout in Minneapolis and get to knowBrandon quittum and there's somethingthat you do in Bitcoin like he'll hookyou up with the people you need to knowto toapply your skills and desires to theBitcoin ecosystem you're in the KansasCity area you go to some meetups andmeet Brady and you meet Don Stewart likethey will hook you up with something todo in Bitcoin and it's like that in sortof every city soum I think it's just a decision to to doit and then I'd say the the other thingisyou know pronounce the podcaster namescorrectly like that's that proof of workright the proof of proof of listen isactually knowing you know who thesepeople are and having some favoriteepisodes and being able to recommendsome articles like when when people makeit through three or four interviews andget to you know get toyou know an interview with me where I'mscreening them I'm usually just askingthem about like Bitcoin media andcontent and asking for their favoritesand asking them to describe why becausethat's how I can tell if they'reactually on the mission or not and youknow I find those people that have likedeleted blockchain from their resume aweek before very very quicklybecause they don't know [ __ ]you know and you won't last like youjust won't last at these Bitcoin onlycompanies like Unchained and Swan likeyou just it's not gonna make it unlessyou actually give a [ __ ]yeah that's a very marked difference intheculture the way of thinking it's it'sdifficult to exactly put your finger onit but when you're talking to somebodyyou can sort of you can pretty quicklyfigure it for that outum so let's chat up a little bit aboutPacific Bitcoin it's coming up do youwant to tell us a little bit about whatyou're looking forward tohell yeah manuh as as quite a few people know at thispoint I had some family health issuesthe last couple of years that reallymade it very difficult for me to travelum so I still haven't been to a Bitcoinbig Bitcoin conference since uh 2019 inSan Francisco where I met you yeah ifyou remember that June 26th and 27th Ithinkum so yeah so I'm really excited aboutthis I'm psyched to be going to Miamifor the Bitcoin magazine conference inMay it's May right yeah thank Mayum in Miami so that's gonna be awesomeand then we're doing our annualconference now in Los Angeles uh PacificBitcoin which Swan is organizing andobviously a bunch of other companies arechipping in and sponsoring and doingtheir own parties and things but itreally is going to be pretty amazingit's um you know it's the biggestBitcoin conference on the west coast uhwe take a lot of pride in making it funand cool and having a lot of goodentertain payment there's three stagesfor seven hours a day uh both days sothat's uh that's 21 hours a day ofcourse of Bitcoin Education and Funacross the three stagesum the swan Dome is back so if youremember the swan Dome from Bitcoin 2021uh we had that out in the uh in theoutside of the Bitcoin conference sowe've reconstructed a bigger Swan domefor this one the conference itself is inthe uh the Barker hangar at Santa MonicaAirport which is an awesome venue youcan really dress it up and make itamazing they've done you know MTV MovieAwards and all kinds of film premieresand things like that in this space sothe production company is fantastic andand I just think it's going to be anawesome time and then there's obviouslygreat parties and events the VIPexperience at this conference is goingto be one of the best things that that Ican imagine participating in aroundBitcoinum we have obviously like a greatexperience for the VIPs there at theconference but then also via VIP partyon Thursday night like six to midnightfull buyout of one of the best bars andrestaurants in LA right on the right onOcean Aveum and then a wrap party at a at a beachhouse mansion with panoramic uhunblocked ocean views on Saturday afterthe conference so kind of like a dayparty Bitcoin brunchafter just for the for the VIPs so allof it's going to be amazing we've got uhLynn Alden Michael Saylor Jeff BoothFosse Elise Colleen Stefan Natalie Peterand Brady are the MCS each of you guysdoing half a day it's gonna beabsolutely awesome come meet all theswans

after uh after wemerged and joined uh joined forces abouta month and a half ago so that'll bereally coolum yeah just in general like SoCaldidn't go anywhere it's still the onlywarm dry Coastline in in the mostpowerful wealthiest Nation on Earth andit's a pretty fun place to hang out soyeah hit us up uh you can use what doyou have a do you have a code Stefanonline so pacificbitcoin.comeverything is coded there you goyeah use Lavera always use Lavera I justput I just punched in Lavera now whenI'm on like you know Groupon or you knowAmazon I'm like maybe there's just incase you knowno I mean I'm really looking forward toit I think it's going to be excellentand the thing is if you like honestlylisteners check out the lineup thelineup is incredible like you just it'sit's incredibly difficult to beat thislevel of lineup especially at this sizeof conference also so there's a goodchance and it's all signal man like nocrypto speakers no crypto sponsors it'sonly Bitcoinyeah I think some I think there's goingto be some magic that happens having aconference this size that's only aBitcoin yeah now one other point I oftenget I'm sure you've probably heard thisalso some people say uh conferences area rip-off or they're a waste of time oryou knowum you know now one way I I think aboutthat is sometimes it would be likesaying you knowI I can listen to that artist on Spotifywhy would I want to go see that concertright it's sort of like well you're kindof missing the point like you mightactually really enjoy meeting otherpeople who are into the same thingyou're into in this case Bitcoin and Ithink there's a real sense of communitythat you can start creating and when youmeet the right people you can just makethe right connections and the value ofthat is just so so much more than theticket price it's worth itum if especially if it's if it's aquality eventyep oh I also I would be remiss not togive a shout out to uh stack chain whichI think is one of the most funlittle communities it may be the firsttruly like decentralized Communitymovement within Bitcoin that's like asubset of bitcoiners that has like apositive vibe I think that's what's kindof so magical and fun about it anyway uhyeah check out stack chain just look forhashtag stack chain one word it is notan altcoin thanks for your questionsum but check it out on Twitter and learnabout stack chainum but yeah we're doing we're doing alightning hackathon with voltage and uhand TVPum Chris calicot and Dustin trammell'sfund uh on Wednesday the day before theconference but also at the same time inthe same space is a stack chainhackathonum so that should be really fun uh butyeah check that out and DM me if youdon't know what stack chain is it'sawesomeright that's the other one I see a lotof people saying oh that's an old coinwhat is this stack chain thingum so that's the best question that'sthe best question yeah I've had a couplepeople come at me and saying oh my Godyou too Corey not you what is the stackchain crap especially after you spentbasically the last yeargoing after the old coin is yourselfright uh you went after all these youknow we want to get into all that nowback chain stack chain in case you don'tget a chance to look it up it's justgamified stacking somebody stacked fivedollars worth of bitcoin and thensomebody else replied with a tweetproving that they'd stacked six bucksnow we're on like you know twenty twohundred dollars the the stack chainCommunity is bought almost two milliondollars worth of bitcoin uh I personallysat down next to Michael Saylor lastmonth when he was here in La actuallyjust about two and a half weeks ago anduh and basically forced him to stack Ithink it was block 2080 so Sailors onthe Chain booths on the Chain Foss is onthe Chain uh anyway it's it's it's quitefun and it's very it's very meme heavyand it's very social but yeah it's uhit's a fun thing to get involved inyes it feels very much like a successorto the lightning Torch from 2019 rightso that
