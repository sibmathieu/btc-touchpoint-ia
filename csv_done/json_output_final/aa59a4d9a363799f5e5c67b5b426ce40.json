rightsfoundationwe talk about his new book check yourfinancial privilegeand show how people in many developingcountries are in their form of monetaryimperialism learn how monetaryoppression keeps people in thosecountries downalex gladstein it's the third time we'rerecording you're my first guest wherewe've done three how is everything goingman honor and a pleasure sir things aregoing wellriding high off theinspiring times in miami amazing to seebitcoin going mainstreamobviously pros and cons to that but it'sto be expectedas weenter into an era where politicians andathletes and you know everybody startsusing bitcoin it just the scene is goingto change but i'm very grateful to seeyou know the focus on the open sourcestage andgenerally speaking you know continue tofocus onbitcoin as ayou know a tool that can help us througha lot of the problems that we're gonnaencounter over the coming couple ofyears and decadesyeah and certainly there were goodaspects of the conference but you know igotta say i was a little bitdisappointed just you know a lot of theall coins that were there i mean celsiushad a whole booth and stuff like thatand there werepeople talking about bitcoin in a way ohwe need to comply with the state and doeverything they say that was a littlebit frustrating for me i don't knowabout like how you saw it as like ahuman rights advocate but that that'swhat it felt like to me well again ithink that you're going to have bleedingon the edges as we get biggeryou knowit did feel more kind of conferency youknow kind of like a consensus-y thinglike in the media lounge especially andyou know butagain i think this is inevitable ifbitcoin's gonna groweverybody's gonna use it andyou know i think that's a healthy thingi think the organizers do an extremelygood job trying to stay as focused aspossible which is which is really hardto do given that they have 25 000 peoplethere andsome and then some some massive numberof people who don't have a ticket whocome just to miami right soand you know what there's going to benft events and different kinds ofaltcoin events that pop up on the sidejust because it's a natural you knowit's it's a natural thing rightand i think again i think they did apretty good job of just kind of stayingstraight obviously i'm hugely gratefultheyallowed me to go up on stage with yummypark and friends and talk aboutbitcoin's freedom and we got a lot ofamazing feedback on that andi mean man you know what an opportunityto go up right after peter thiel whostill doesn't understand lightning butbut at least he understands that bitcoinwill become really valuable in the nextdecadeso yeah i meanagain things change but look we got todo book signings the community wasstrongthere were you know for everycorporate bureaucrat there was a ronindojo you know what i mean like that youknow for everytalk onregulation there was a talk onprotecting the rights of americans usingbitcoin for every talk on you knowsome sort of like you know wider cryptotopic there was a talk about how to makebitcoin more private so so again i thinkthey didan admirable job and that that sense ofgetting bigger and more cloudy is ithink aan outcome of just um themainstreamization of bitcoin in in manyways but yeah i think that last year'sevent was much was much more kind ofideological orfelt more like a woodstock you know whati mean it felt like there was a missionthere and you know it i just think we'regonna get too big for that kind offeeling you know so but we can we canrecreate that feeling in a lot of otherplaces and i think that the open sourcestage is still like very heavy signalbasically it was it was greatshout out shout out to matt odell whodid a great job with thatindeed but there is that tension isn'tthere between like sort of theyou know investment fiat bro or i meanlike crypto bro kind of uh mentality onone side and then what you're trying todo with the human rights and likefocusing it onthe billions of people that are unbankedand stuff like that that to me isis sort of at the heart of thisseparation and why you know it felt alittle bit disappointing to me because iwanted to hear more about like the stuffthat you were talking about and indeedlikewhat we're gonna talk about your bookcheck your financial privilege likeit's at the heart of that because for alot of people they they only perceive itas this investment you know crypto brokind of thing whereas you're making avery different argument yeah well inchapter three of the book i talk aboutbitcoin's adoption mechanism andyou know this is this is part of thatit's like corporations and governmentswilljoin the bitcoin standard because theyout of self-interestall these corporations that you saw thatyou're kind of referencingfive years ago most of them were hatingon bitcoin or ignoring it so now theywant to get a pieceum they want their customers to be ableto interact with it you see this both atthe kind of uh let's sayyou know liketraditional financial services platformsand other i mean and othercryptocurrencies like i thought it wasinteresting thatfor exampleyou know we've had all this debate aboutthe terrastable coin thing which i think isinteresting and then you knowthe apparently the biggest announcementat this huge kind of like alternativecryptocurrency event in spain last monthwas was that this chain was gonna likeyou know add bitcoin or whatever assomething that its users could interactwith soi think you're just gonna see aninevitability ofall kinds of people wanting to likeattach to bitcoin use it in some waywhether it be mainstream wall streetpeople or other you know cryptocurrencycommunities i i think that's probably agood thing but you know it comes withall of its you know all the hazards andyou know you got to be careful as wenavigate this i mean look i think allgovernments are eventually goingadopt bitcoin in some way shape or formdoes that mean i support what they'regonna do noi just think i just think they're gonnahave to likethis macro climate we're in ofyou know governments realizing thatfinancial instruments that they weresaving in are freezableis is a big one and will have massiveramifications and as they seek todiversify and i think eventually they'llland on bitcoin as like a thing thatthey want right and and that'll go forall kinds of unsavory governments dittoall corporate treasuries i think so ijust think we need to steal ourselvesfor that and then we need to buildcommunities and movements that are morehuman focused right and i think that'sthat's something i'm really excited todowith the full knowledge that things aregoing to getincreasingly messy and blurry rightumindeed well so let's go back to yourbook because i love the title check yourfinancial privilege i think this is somesomething that you've more or less memedinto existence i think you're the guythat made it happen so can you like talkabout what financial privilege means anddefine it for our audiencesure andyou know the back story of thebook was that in2020 ii just started interviewing people thati thought were interesting in thebitcoin spacemany many more people than actually wentinto the book butisat down for a couple hours with eachperson and just try to get their storystart it was is really educationalfor me i'm really grateful to everybodywho gave me their time it taught me alot about all different kinds of bitcoinangles both both like the hit when i wasinterviewing people who contributed tobitcoin's history bitcoin history theblock size wars all that uh but also theusers of bitcoin people inside countrieslike iranchina venezuela etc just learning aboutwhy did they turn to it and kind of thepolitical backdrop sogrowing up i always read the new yorkeri really liked long-form journalism ithought it was fun i liked journalistsbeing able toyou know tell a story and get intopersonal details as opposed to justdoing like a 1200 word op-ed orsomethingi really like long reporting so that'swhat i tried to set out to do is thatthese chapters would beyou know longereight five six seven eight or even tenor twelve thousand word pieces whichwould reallygive a lot of detail to a particulartopic and kind of focus on monetaryhistory and then bitcoin adoption thoseare the two themes that go through thebook and you know as i explore those wewe kind of focus in on this idea offinancial privilege sowhat's clear is thatonly a small percentage of humans in theworld have like aa really well functioning financialsystemand it really could have been check yourmonetary privilege but i wanted to makeit a little broaderbut the point is only a fraction of theworldyou know somewhere around a billion alittle more than a billion people likelow teen percentage percentage of theworld 10 11 12you know it kind of changes buthas access to what's called a reservecurrency so like a fiat currency that'sthat's trustable enough let's say thatother central banks want to allocatesome of their savings into it right soyou would have the dollar the euro thepound the yen maybe maybe the canadianand australian dollars and increasinglythe yuan i think but thenthen you have to think about so sothere's only some small percentage ofpeople that are born into those strongercurrencies that are that don't face likean immediate realistic chance at like20 30 inflation right or at least wethought that way right recently untilrecentlyand then you have to look at the peoplewho live under property rights and underkind of like let's sayyou know reasonably secure propertyrights and that's again a minority ofthe population so 53 54 of the world'spopulation lives under kind of a kind ofa straight-up authoritarian regimewhere where the government doesn't needto like justify anything it can justtake stuffnow they can certainly do the same indemocracies but there's just more checksand balances like there's of courseeminent domain and operation choke pointwe've heard here in the u.s butgenerally speakingyou've got a lot more property rights intexas than you have in tibet there'slike a huge gap right sothe point is that that the overwhelmingmajority of people on this earth live insocieties wherethe currency itself is like super weakcan't be trustedfinancial systems broken they can'teasily connect with family abroad andthey don't really have any kind of legalrecourse to protect themselves againstyou know confiscatory policy by state orby other actorssoyou know people in london and new yorkand san franciscohave financial privilege that they theyhave just a much more robust system thatthey use and that blinds them to thereality of everybody else so this leadsto the sort of conclusion and thesis ofthe book which is thatlike the critics of bitcoin you knowoften you know almost exclusively reallyin the end come from from financialprivilege and and again this kind ofblinds them from from like why wouldsomebody want to use bitcoin or howcould it be helpful so we need to checkour financial privilege and then we canstart to understand like why this issuch an important tool so that's kind ofthe tl drwell you're certainlybringing thatperspective in this book but i want totouch a little bit on sort of thecritics of bitcoin sort of having thatfirst world financial privilege and themnot being aware of pretty much how itworks everywhere else in the world andyou know using like the esg narrative orsomething like that as a way tocriticize bitcoin withoutrealizing okay you're taking away thistool of freedom from all of these otherplaceswhy are they so ignorant of what's goingon everywhere else they seem almostentirely focused on what's going on inthe western world and notanything that's going on in the rest ofthe world where the vast majority ofpeople arei don't know man it's difficult i meantodayit was revealed thatwikipedia essentially is going to stopaccepting bitcoin and cryptocurrencydonationsbecause of the esg stuff and it's likehow insane is that like like a projectbuilt foropen knowledge rightit's going to stop its supporters fromdonating to it with open money becauseof disinformation and scare tactics fromcorporations and governments like that'skind of where we are todayandthe people pushing for theyou know frothing at the mouth to banbitcoini mean they'veyou know not only do they havealmost certain immense financialprivilege that's almost a givenbut that they've also allowed themselvesto be swayed by this kind of disinfo andlikethat bitcoin's bad right and that isgoing to be a very popularthing that we encounterover the comingfew years is this likereactionary force to bitcoinkind of a an establishmentmob mentalitythat says we must burn this thing downbecause we don't see any value in it andthat's dangerous soyou know it's dangerous because it hurtspeople it danger it's dangerous becauseobviously be better if wikipedia couldtake bitcoin donations and develop abitcoin strategy it'd be a much betterresource for the worldsoit's actually important to address thisissue of financial privilege and thenfight backbecausethe next few years are going to bepivotal in terms of bitcoin adoption itsincrease in valueand you know we don't want people to beyou know unnecessarily left out of thisthing right soi think we got to take the fight to themyou knowwell we'll certainly talk more aboutthat as we go along but i love thelayout of this book you're talking aboutfinancial privilege and then you knowhowbitcoin came into existence then sort ofthe hidden cost of the current you knowdollar hegemony basically but chapterfour is very interesting to me a bitcoinis a trojan horse for freedom andthis is theyou know why don't you just explain whatit is and you know how this idea cameaboutyeah well look it's obviouslyan idea that's beenuh you know i'd say it's a wrap it'sbeen around bitcoin since since near thebeginning there's some good kind ofbitcoin talk poststhat people kind of thought that this ishow it would play out and you knowessentially thatpeople would adopt bitcoin not knowingwhat it was right so in this chapteri've tried to flesh out the detail thereof likeusing the parable right from the aeneidof of this like trojan horse where likebasically brute force couldn't work totake the city right sogreeks were trying to take troy for 10years they couldn't do itjust you know odysseus had this uh sortof eureka moment which was implanted inhis brain by a god minerva of coursebut the point is he was like oh my godwe should just like trick them we shoulduse subterfuge so they like trick thetrojans into likethinking that this big horse they builtwas this beautiful you know basicallylike uh giftand the trojans even though what wasinteresting is there were trojans who umin the story there were trojans who saidno no this is obviously fake right solikethis is gonna take our power away fromus like don't do this but like the mobwas like nah nah this is great let'sbring it in so they bring the horse inof course there's greeks and the horsethey come out at night and sack the citysothe point is that you know over thedecades people use this terminology todescribe like you know computer virusesthat look fine but they end up beingmalicious so my point was that like inif you're gonna try to change the dollarsystem fiat currency central bankingsystemi don't think it can be taken by forceor like i don't think it could be takenor changed in a straightforward wayi believe it was there's that clip of isit friedman or hayek i can't rememberwhere he saysis a clip of him from the early 80ssaying something like you know we'd haveto invent a roundabout way right a slyroundabout way to replace a governmentmoney rightand i think that's the point is thatyou develop this asset you bootstrap ityou make it decentralized and you youbuild a value mechanism into it thatbasically out competes fiat money thatbecomes more valuable over timeand in that sense like people out oftheir own self-interest will startgetting some again whether it becorporations governments whomeverwithout reallyyou knowwithout caring about what other thingsit does to humanity they're going to beforced to participate as my thesis soyou go and you buy a bunch of bitcoinfor your corporate balance sheet becauseyou don't want the melting ice cube offiatwell guess what you're supportingcypherpunk freedom technology but that'snot what you're going to tell your boardrightyou're not going to sit there and talkto your board about coinjoins andlightning networkyou know a nation state is going toadopt bitcoin you see this in elsalvador well guess what you know you'reprobably not focusing on the fact thatthat allows citizens tohave parallel banking and financialservices that you can't control if therussians indeed accept if they decide toaccept bitcoin for oil for examplesomething like thatyou know again that they might find ashort-term value in that but like to themedium to long-term what they may not bethinking about is that that's going tocause like an explosion of bitcoinadoption in their country and thenyou know essentiallyputin will have less control over thepeople i mean dictators needmonetary and financial control to stayin power in a way that the you knowpopulation you know if the populationdoesn't agree right if there's noconsensus they have to use force sowhat's interesting is like i think thatin the end bitcoin is this trojan horseit kind of buries itself into the heartof these systems that are oppressiveand then it helps liberate thembecause at the end of the dayyou know you think about the chinesecommunist party for example likewhat do they need they need censorshipthey need confiscationand they need closed capital markets tomake their system work well bitcoinsfree speech private propertyandopen capital markets so it's not goingto be very good for dictators butthey're going to bring it into the citygates was my thesis again corporationsand governments are going to like wantthis thing for its digital goldattributes it's very shiny and beautifulthey're going to want it but they won'tbe able to separateits value proposition from its likeradical freedom upside this is what ibelieve i think satoshisaw how gold was killed by governmentswhich of course i detail in myin my bookand then from thereyou know they figured out a way toavoid the fate of goldandbasically make it so that the peopleheld the keys to power as opposed togovernments so that's the thesis in anutshellumyeah and and it's an interesting ideathat we can actually subvert and takeover the global reserve currency throughthis sort of trojan horse way it's gonnahappen it's like really crazy it'sprobably gonna happen and it's like it'sso insane that something went from amessage board uh topicand something that really was like inthe mind of like science fiction writerstooprobably the reality i mean it's reallyit's just a deep a very profound thingand you know you point out like whathappened on bitcoin beach but that to meis like absolutely stunning that it wentfrom a tinyplace within el salvador to the wholecountry within like a year and a halfthat's so crazyyeah i think okay so you had a guy imean he had there was a couple thingsthat had to happen there but you knowobviously first and foremost you had tohave the pilot rightyou had to havethis amazing community that you visitedthat obviously jorge and jimbera andmike had builtyou had to have a community thatbelieved in each other that had acertain amount of social capitalthat trusted people when they said let'sgo and use this let's try this thing outyou had to have the open mind you had tohave the donor you know to sort ofmake it a option you had to have theopen-mindedness of the three of thoseguys plus the other community leaders totry it a lot a lot of things had to goright but ultimatelyyou knowas it started to just become a thingi think it became like harder and harderfor the government to ignore and i knowthat bouquet had been likeprobably open-minded to bitcoiner orcryptocurrencyhe tweeted about it i think five yearsago something like that but like itwasn't like that's it it was like onetweet and you know we know that he wasthinking about a umlike a cbdc type thing as well that waslike heavily reported last year so whoknows what route he could have taken buthe saw this like chance right he sawthis thing and he was like wow this ishow i mean he started sending hisministers down to el zante you can kindof it's just all the history of thisit's all well documented andagain you talk to someone like mikepeterson and they they say that at firstthe government was like and then likeall of a sudden they got a lot moreinterested right so there was some sortof like change they saw and theyobviously believed in this and that itcould do something good for them or forthe country depending on how charitableyou want to be to them but the point isthat yeah it was this sort of likereally unique combination of ingredientsthat that went into this magical soupthat were like it was able toto happen in this way but the point oflike my chapter i think el salvador isthatit was really a grassroots thing in thebeginningand that's that resonates so cleanlywith what bitcoin's gonna dolike ultimately it was bouquet whoforced it through given his supermajority in parliamentbut he wouldn't i don't think he wouldhave done it without this sort ofgrassroots movement and pilot to beginwith or it wouldn't have been bitcoin itwould have been crypto legal somethinglike that you know and obviously he wascourted by all the crypto people anddeserves credit for choosing bitcoin 100all the way it's a very smart decisionbut i i try to strike this balance ofliketrying to show the reader that there wasthis community behind this thing thatwas grassroots and needs to beunderstood to get the full picture ofwhat happened down thereand it kind of shows like that trojanhorse effect at least as far as i cantell like it gets into this communityand next thing you know it's within thewhole country and little things likethat have a way of sort of blowing upand makingeverything bitcoiny wherever you seebitcoin is you knowit goes into a tiny community somehowgoes to the entire country and that thatwas the trojan horse like you said it'spossible that kelly would have chosensomething else he was looking foralternatives exactlybut because this trojan horse wasalready there it was oh okay we're gonnago with this and that that to me wasvery interesting about the case yeah imean look he reached out to jackmahler's not brock pierce do you knowwhat i mean like like it was veryintentional and that came from bitcoinbeach not not crypto beach right like itkind of mattered soyeah i think look i view bitcoin as thisbenevolent virus basicallyit kind of you know how viruses willleap from one species to another or likewe'll get a virus that goes from a batto a human or whatever and then it likechanges in intensity etc differentspecies have different like resistancesto different virusesyou know i think you're gonna seesomething like that here where yeah likebitcoin made its leap like it leapt fromindividuals to nation states like thatin 2021 like that's a pretty massivething nowit doesn't mean that there's going to beimmediately this domino effect i thinkthat people got a little excited theresimilarly it made the it made the leapfromindividuals to corporate treasuries in2020 with michael saylor andagain i think people i think a lot ofpeople expected thatthere'd be a lot more corporate treasuryadoption today now there is a fairamount of course but like i think peoplethought there'd be a lot more by now butit's slow but steady the processand i think you're going to see the samefor nation states like you have theukraine thing which is insane they'reraising all this money with bitcoinyou have sovereign wealth funds start tobe exposed to it in different waysit's we're clearly going in a certaindirection even governments that areagainst it are either getting defeatedby itorthey're being forced to change theirtune based on bitcoin's persistentperformance like i'll give you twoexamples thechinese government tried to like youknow i don't know i don't know what ittried to do but it definitely like tookout 60plus percent maybe 70 plus percent ofthe bitcoin hash rateand guess what we now are like at anall-time high hash rate right so itdidn't succeed in getting rid of bitcoinall it succeeded in was shooting itselfin the foot and giving up its hash ratedominance which iskind of an amazing blunder and then theother one was uhi mean just just a couple days ago janetyellen the u.s treasury secretary youknow the highest ranking official in theunited states for economic and financialpolicyshe now gives this speech about howbroken the financial system is andkind of amazingly you know goes intodetail about bitcoin and the white paperand likeyou knowit's i thought it was interestingbecauseit's different from like what christinelagarde is saying likei'm not sitting here saying that they'regonna like in any way be favorable tobitcoin but i thought it wasa nod to maybe it's people likewhether it be ted cruz or otherpoliticians who are really prominent whoare like talking about bitcoin a lotor maybe it's a nod tocorporations and bitcoin lobbyists whoknows but the point is that like or it'snot just the general inevitability of itbut likei thought it was really interesting tosee the discrepancy between yellenand and legard like lagarde is still onthe like this is for criminals we mustdestroy it that that's her kind of vibeand while yellen might have been likethat a couple years ago i mean she'slike yeah she's basically like it's notthe new fed line the new government lineand the fed line is is like is that it'sit's not going to be a currency that'sthat's their new line but they're notseeking to discredit it as an asset ifyou listen to what powell says or yelland says etc they're basically seedingground and saying that it's gonna beit's gonna be here it's a novelinventionand americans want it like and i thinkthat's kind of an amazing that's amazingprogress now again i think they're wrongwanting to control it and that it's notgonna be a currency and all these thingsbut it's amazing to see what this opensource project has has done i mean fromsatoshi's brain tothe treasury secretary's mouth in 13years is insanewell and that's the really remarkablething it somehow trojan horsed itselfintothe treasury secretary's mouth how didthat happen likewhat's she looking at thatshe's speaking good things againwell and again she she you know shetalks about it and then she says wellit's not likely to become a currency butshe doesn't go you know again this isspeech she gave like six days ago it'sjust very fresh she doesn't attack proofof work she doesn't talk about theenvironment she doesn't talk aboutcriminals like it's as for for thetreasury sector united statesit's an extremely positive take onbitcoin and that's her most recent takesoi guess the ripple stuff's not workingthe ripple flood isnot working let's put it that way shedidn't talk about ripple let's put itthat waymm-hmm i bet chrisi bet chris larson was very upset bythat speech that's all i gotta say yeahwhat's up with ripple because that to meis uhit's a strange thing to come out as sortof like the villain in this whole esgnarrative scenario like chris larson waslike sort of like thisyou know villain in the back that no oneknew was there and he goes in the headand tells everyone hey i've donated fivemillion dollars to greenpeacei mean is this like a blunder what'sgoing on hereyeahi think that he's got a massivefinancial incentive toattack bitcoin to get the us governmentto ban proof of work and to try andunload his tokens on more banks i meanthis is really clearit's not going to work man sorry chris imeanhe's being investigated at the same timeby the us government for fraud etcsecurities fraud good luck i meanyou know it's not going to treat youwell in history to attack bitcoin likeit's not going to work very well for youor your reputation so it's kind of sadto seebut they're very effective you knowthey've gotten into the minds ofeverybodywhohasn't paid bitcoin very much attentionbecause of the media and thegovernment's line on it over the lastdecade plusthe initialsurface level take of the average personabout bitcoin is negative because themedia has been criticizing it for solong and so consistently and sohomogeneously like that just like theposition is this thing is bad for avariety of reasons so chris is able toand ripple people are able to like getinto that and then that's a seed andthen they can grow it it's like a treeso they're like getting in there andthey're feeding it water and they'regrowing it and then they can go intothese ngos that are again naturallyhesitant and they can like really stokethe fire soit's an amazingly effective thing likehe's been able to convince all kinds ofpeople who whoclearly have no knowledge about howbitcoin actually works that it's likereally bad for people over theenvironment or whatever soi don't know i'm looking forward tothat chapter being over but it's goingto be a struggle i meanjust you know and look bitcoin i thinkthe bitcoin network will be just finebutpeople aren't going to be fine andthey're going to let be led astray andespecially progressive people i thinkand i'm not sitting here saying that alllibertarians or conservatives understandbitcoin far from it but there obviouslyhas been likemore of an uptick on that side of thingsi think you're starting to see a lotmore democrats actuallyrokhana and a bunch of others in americaat least be open to this but generallyspeaking the left has sort of laggedhere and the book was really hopefully atool whereby we could showthatthis thing is a progressive revolutionas much as anything else i mean it's uhit's about neutrality andthe fact that bitcoin can't discriminateand it's abouthow bitcoin's anti-colonial i thoughtglenn greenwald you know he was in miamiand hevery kindly mentioned to me in his talkbuti think he's he's turning into anincredibly eloquent advocate for bitcoinand he's basically like listen man hesays it's it fights censorshipfights colonialism it fights imperialismit fights the surveillance state itfights all the things that he caresabout you know and i think to hear kindof uh you know i would say you know moreyou know obviously progressive left-wingkind of voice say that is very powerfulso i think you're going to see a lotmore of that and i hope the book canhelp in that regardyeah and that is really an interestingpoint that you're making that it's notbeing taken up on the left a little bitprobably due to some of this esg totally100well so what do you hope that you knowthe progressives that read your bookwhat perspective do you hope to changein them so that they're notsort of getting deceived by this footwell just to read the stories of thesepeople in these countries whether it'snigeria or afghanistan or palestine orcubai chose these countries in particularand i wanted to show that likecountries that have been hurt by theunited states or that are adversarialthe united states and its allies iwanted to show that the people livingunder those countriesareare benefiting from this thingand you know if you have thisworld view that maybe america hasn'tbeen the bestforce in the world then look i i think ihave a nuanced view on that i thinkamerican ideals are amazing but i thinkthat outcome and execution has beensloppy i have a whole kind of chapter onamerica and bitcoin where i interview aniraqi immigrant and an africa a sort ofafrican-american native american bitcoinusersand we kind of dig into this buti just think thatwe need to beempathetic towards people who who livein countries that have been screwed overby our government andand it's hard tohelp i mean what are you really gonna dolike do a twitter hashtag thing like ihave a piece on this in the palestinechapter like it's like virtue signalinglike what do you know free palestinewhat's that really going to do forsomebodyvery little if nothing at all but whatif you can teach somebody how to usebitcoin i mean that's a massiveindividual personal empowerment right soi just kind of think that and look i'msomeone who spent 15 years in humanrights activism i think there's there'sright ways to do it it can be veryeffective it's very inspiring it canchange the world but i mean bitcoin justin my view takes it almost to the nextlevel like in terms of your ability toactually meaningfully make a differencein someone's life around the world ifyou can teach them how to use this thingso that'syou know i think it's almost like thenew wave of activism is helping somebodyunderstand bitcoinumand that's something that you'redefinitely focused on with uh you knowthe human rightsforum uh foundation and uh the oslofreedom forumhow is the uptake among human rightsactivists because obviously you and ihave been working on this uh quite awhile are they embracing it and are theyusing it as a tool a tool of freedom arethey seeing it for what it is oryou know is it lagging what's the sortof current state of progress therei think it's it's improving i mean it'sit's starting from zero like everybodyelseit's slow i would say that likeyou know two years ago it was almost atzero stilli hope we can make a difference there atthe as the freedom forum next month andat other events we're going to be doingand i think we will and i think thati mean look i mean the people i was onstage with in oslorather in miamihave come to their own you knowunderstanding of the importance ofbitcoini helped them kind oflet's saysee the possibility and then you knowthey then manifesttheir own interpretation of why it'simportant which is amazing i mean that'sthat's what happened with me right likepeople showed me the way right soi think that if we can show the way tothe human rights defenders of the worldthey will jump on this thing and theywill push it in directions that we can'teven imaginebut once they grasp really what it isthis like neutral open money that's thatcan't be colonized that can't becancelled i mean it's just it's so coolso i think we want to share that andwe're going to do that through our workat href you know on an ongoing basiseven as other groups are going toget you know swayed by the virtuesignaling and and the mob and all thatstuff so it'll be interesting to see howit plays outum yeah and that's certainly happeningat sort of like a micro level almostwhere you know these individualhuman rights activists are using bitcoinfor you know the purposes ofyou know subverting the evil governmentsthat they're under and so on but let'stalk a little bit more about sort of thecontent of the book in chapter seven youtalk about palestinecan you talk a little bit more aboutwhat being a palestinian is like and youknowthe financial oppression that they'reunder as a result of being palestinianyeah well i meani'm not palestinian so all i can do isspeak to the uh stories i was told andthat i observed from palestinians butwhat was amazing to me is when you seesomething through the monetarylens you really start toappreciatethe full picture likei mean look i mean i've been looking atthe israeli-palestinian conflict for fora long time and i thought it wasi thought the situation of palestinianswas bad but i did not know how bad and idid not know how structural it was andthen i would never have known thatreally unless i looked at this situationfrom a monetary point of view and from afinancial and economic point of view andreally what i saw thereand this this sucks i mean i'm someonewho believesvery much in the state of israel and inthe the project of giving a home to thejewish people so it's a conflict but imeanit's been really you knowpoorly executed tothe point wherethe israeli military is just you knowinfectinginflicting tremendous suffering on allkinds of people and and the counterpartswho areyou know at least in charge of the westbank are almost like this proxy statewhere they work together to oppress thepeople it's extremely sad and my wholepoint of this chapter that ikind of try to take the takeaway is thati don't know for how are you going toget changed like we've had no change forso many years likemaybe we can at least help individualsinside palestine like build this likecircular economy this parallel economybut what i learned about wasbasically the way that from 67 to 87you had 20 years of israeli militaryoccupation in the territory in thepalestinian in palestine andit was premised on like a particularlike strategy that the israelis hadwhere they wanted essentially thepalestinians to become dependent onisrael so basically what they would dois try to shrink the agricultural andindustrial baseof palestinethrough a variety of tactics includingmaking like local produce likethey would like subsidize israeliproduce and bring it into the west banksso that the farmers like couldn't workin that fieldand they would use those kind of tacticsand what would end up happening is overthese 20 yearsbasically palestinians would work inisraeland build things for the israelis andthen they would come home and theywouldn't be building anything at home sokind of the palestinian economic statelike just shrunk it actually shrunk overmany decades states are supposed to growright states are supposed to grow overtime as we become more productive ashumans with new technology and newtactics andthings like that but palestine hasshrunk in terms of its economic engineso that was a really brutal realizationto understand that that was kind of thegoal of the occupation for those first20 years and then once you had theintifadain the late 80s you knowa lot of people are like oh it's a bunchof terrorists but you know in realitythe intifada was like a sovereigntymovement it was basically a movement ofpeople who said at first at leastlet's grow our own food and let'sactually cut the dependence on theisraeli economy that was like thepremise of the first intifada andunfortunately it had a bad outcomebecause what happened isit got big enough that israeli couldn'tisrael couldn't ignore it and you knowthey brought them to the table right soyou had these oslo accords but whatended up happening is thatthe the the palestinian authoritiesarafat in particulartraded off economic freedom forpolitical freedom or this politicalindependence right and everybody youknow they all got nobel peace prizes andall this stuff but in reality whathappened is that is israel ended upcontrolling imports exports the currencythe central bankeverything the everything so they useshekels um israelis get to decide whatgoes in and goes out so all these thingswere seeded away as part of thisnegotiation it was part of a documentcalled the paris protocol that even alot of palestinians don't know aboutit's kind of hidden and this thing wassupposed to expire in 99 it didn't it'sstill inactive it's still active todayand what it's essentially ensured wasthat like the palestinians could neverreally stand up on their ownand you know menuin gaza it's like an even more insaneversion of that like it'snot only do you have like thisdependency on israel for jobs butthen then because of likedifferent policies like they basicallygot cut off entirely from from israel sonow they can't even work there anymorethere's like two entry points likebasically the capital stockthis idea that alan farrington writes alot about like of a society like thatyou kind of think of a society like afarm right where you need productivesoil right and you want kind of think ofcapital as productive soil that you cangrow things on for future abundancethis basically all got strip mined outof gaza so so the capital stock of thisplace has again has shrunk the real gdphas shrunk the real per capita incomehas shrunk even as the society grows interms of number of peoplethis has caused tremendous humansuffering so i mean the place is a totaldisaster like they don't have cleandrinking water they don't have any wayto like grow food and sell it like thatthey don't have any of the like servicesthat that we have sodoing this story made me understand allthese things from a monetary andfinancial point of view which made itmuch more devastating than my previousunderstanding of the plight of thesepeople andyou know it also made me understand theworld bitcoin could play like when iinterviewed this guy in gaza who's likei mean he's telling me people areselling their homes for bitcoin becausethey think the housing market's going togo to zero there becausewho wants to buy a piece of property ifit could be blown up by a missile likeyou know at any pointbut he says listeni'm saving up in bitcoin and i'm gettingout of here you know it's like this ishe told me this was like his ticket tofreedom and that was like a reallypowerful thing so hey man it just itshows you that likeeven in the most difficult scenariosbitcoin can thrive and can help peoplewell it's interesting to me how you sortof characterize that wholeisrael-palestine relationship because atleast for mewhen thinking about the us'srelationship with a lot of centralamerican countries you're talking aboutlikepeople coming to build stuff in israeland not in their homethat's basically what's happened allover central america right like thereare mexican laborers that come into theu.s to build you know homes and maintaingardens totallyand like not building in their own homesit's kind of crazy the parallels thereare yeah and i think the whole chapter idid on the french monetary colonialismin africa has a huge number of dovetailswith the israeli-palestinian issue andchapter andyeah it's similar like the frenchbasically used these countries as like aplantation where they would harvestgoods for lower than market priceand then use them to create finishedgoods which they would then sell back tothese countries at a higher than marketprice and they would basically do thisfor decades and it shrunk again itshrinks theproductive capacity of these states it'sit's extremely cruel i meanyou know i think that in a lot of wayslike colonial theory ordependency theory i mean these theoriesand ideas have been kind of sidelinedto the fringe of history books orwhatever and ironically it's usuallymarxists who are usuallypar you know parroting these talkingpoints but the reality is there'sthey're they're real like these arethings that happened i know they'redifficult for us to swallow becauseit it makes us have to question our ownyou know where we come from and how wegot here etc especially as some asamericans or as french or as israelisbut like we need to acknowledge theserealities i mean our success is verymuchbuilt by the exploitation of otherpeople and i think that that ispart of the fiat system in many ways andi think that bitcoin can can helpaddress some of that like on a macrostructural way over the next manydecades likei think it just gives people more powerand you know certainly isn't going tofix all of the problems in the world oranything close to it but it's kind of isgoing to kind of change certain likesocial dynamics and economic dynamicsthat i think will bemuch more favorable for for thevulnerable around the worldwell what do you think of uh china'sbelt and road initiative is is thatreally a form of monetary imperialism aswell or is that something completelywell i iup until todayas far as i understand it ironicallymost of the contracts in that are donein dollars soyou still have this issue of the yuannot being trustedbut as pointed out by likethis credit suisse guy zoltan posar whoi think is like a brilliant macroeconomic thinker he's talking about hownow we're in bretton woods three sohe's saying bretton woods one was 44 to71 dollar backed by gold bretton woods 271 to 2022basically people saving in u.streasuries as the like most importantmoney in the worldand then 2022 onwards we're in brettonwoods three where like countries aregoing to diversify away from thatthey're going to save in gold they'regoing to save in commodities they'regoing to save in yuan and you know maybebitcoin right soi would urge people to read his stuffthe latest one he came out with two daysago was incredible banger like i meanthis guy's just on fire right now soread everything he writes and it'samazing because he's like trusted onwall street everybody on wall streetreads them so they're all reading aboutlike the end of the dollar hegemony atthe beginning of like the you knowbasically he says you can't print oil toheat or wheat to eat that's like histhing and i think he's basically justaffirming a lot of these things thatbitcoiners have been saying for a longtimeso he's not a full-throated bitcoiner hedoes mention that bitcoin he thinksbitcoin specifically will do very wellif it survives he says but but like imeangenerally speaking incredible that hewould say that at all for someone who'skind of so like traditional but thepoint of all this is thati think that in this sort of era we areyou know you know times are sort ofchangingand it ismuch more likely thatwe're going to enter into anera where some of these exploitativestructures start to start to fray andcollapseand i i don't think bitcoin was thetriggerright it wasn't the iceberg but it wasit's but it's the lifeboat right soit's a way that this this whole beast ofa system is just lumbering to a collapsebasicallythis post-71 political economy system isyou know this frankenstein thing is likeit was juiced up for as long as theycould juice it up and it's just runningout of steam you know it's justobviously running out of steam it'sgoing to fall it's going to collapsebut at least we have a lifeboat you knowand i think that that's ultimately oneof the greatest legacies of satoshi willbe providing people a way out of thiscollapsing systemwell so just to go back to the questionis chinatrying to become a monetary imperialistor what are they doing what's their sortof endgame in this all yeah i don't knowif they get that far but they definitelywant more people to use the yuan they'redefinitely setting up an infrastructureunfortunately unfortunately for themand fortunately for for maybe a lot ofothers including you know i'm certainlynot rooting for the ccp they'rea horrible wicked government but likebasically the point is that a lot of itwas like flimsy and fraudulent a lot oftheir infrastructure stuff they have amassive housing bubble i mean insanehousing bubble right now a lot of it'sjust sort of built on sand soso we'll see i do agree with zoltan andhis theory i mean he basically saysregard you know we may not trust theyuan but like the r b will becomeit'll become more serious and moresignificant in the futureand yeah of course china will try to dothe monetary imperialism thing as muchas it canbut i i don't know if ityou know thankfully we have bitcoinbasically to push back andi just think that once people start tounderstand what bitcoin ispractically not from a money point ofview necessarily but practically what isit and it's like digital outside moneythere's no other digital outside moneyin the world everything i meanoutside money would be gold and insidemoney is is like let's say u.s treasurythere's every other digital asset orcurrency is inside money either it canbe frozen or it's or it can be the rulescan be changed so even ethereum which islike you know arguably the second mostdecentralized crypto asset or whatever imean we have no idea how much is goingto be printed in two years and theconsensus mechanism is changing and it'sall dynamic and we don't you know theanswer is we don't know so andeverything else is downstream from therewith bitcoin we have predictablepredetermined outside money that peoplecan rely on and once people understandthat i mean man it's just like it's likethe perfect central bank reserve assetsoi just think that likein this environment where the us'ssystem is fraying the dollar system ismaybe the chinese are rising a littlebit like you know people will be able tohave a way out like we're not inevitablygonna have to live in the chinese worldis what i'm saying like there's gonna beoptionsumall right so i do wanna cover this onemore thing before i let you go superimperialism can you explain the conceptyeah well kind of on the themes we'vebeen touching on in our chat likethe world used to run on asset moneythat is kind of the idea behind superiorimperialism it used to basically run ongold as a kind ofinternationally at least in theinternational balance of payment systemcentral banks used to communicate withone another using gold using positionsof gold and this had a natural kind ofbalancing effect whereif you know if someone's currency issomeone's fiat currency again these fiatcurrencies were pegged to a certainamount of gold rightsome sort of redeemability right and ifyour fiat currency got too strongwell your exports would becomeuncompetitive and therefore yourcurrency would start to weaken and itwas this natural balancing effect underthe goldlet's say the gold standard or the goldexchange standard right and if yourcurrency got too weak you'd startselling a ton of stuff and and thenyou're and then your economy would growstronger and there was this beautifulkind of balancing effect that you getwhen you have a neutral reserve assetright what this guy michael hudson doesin his book from 1973 is describe rather71 is describe how the americangovernment ended up like breaking thesystem and basically imposingthe u.s treasury as the reserve asset ofthe world so we went from gold to theu.s treasury to american debtand the book is a history of how thathappened and you know it goes throughlike the situational circumstances ofworld war one and how we were just muchstronger afterwards and how we had themost gold andproductivity and best position when itcame to the bretton woods agreement andwe got to have our way instead of thebancor which is what keynes wanted hewanted like a internationally managedcurrency american said screw you we'regonna have the dollar backed by gold soeverybody started using dollars allaround the world50s 60s the dollar had become hugelydominant and then nixon you know wantedto fight this war in asiacold war was like at its peak he endedup spending more money than we had wehad basically a run-on goal a run on thedollar like basically our gold reserveswere drawn downand he had to stop the redemptions andin 68 congress cut the dollardomestically from gold and in 71 he cutus off from the international system interms of other nations being able toredeem their dollars for gold so we rugpulled the world and we we said wepromised them that all these dollarliabilities they had were redeemable andthen we said just kidding so you know weentered into the seven post 71 politicaleconomy andit's been a fiat standard right sincethen for about 50 yearsand super imperialism describes themechanisms of that and kind of the theupside of a superpower that's able toget its rivals to basically pay for itswars it's a crazy thing that had neverhappened beforeand then you knowhudson has updated the book a few timesincluding last year sohe kind of uh pressages kind of maybeits demise eventually butyou know it's interesting because hecomes at it from a very left-wing anglei mean this guy's likeno capitalist let's put it that way buti mean it's cool because he he sees theproblems in the system and he sees thevalue even in gold as something that wasa restraint against war right soi think it's really neat to to try topull on these like diverse historicaluh angles and and you know superimperialism as i like is my last chapterbecause or rather the end of superimperialism because it it's kind ofpulls everything together and shows themacro view ofhow we got here and then it talks aboutwhere we could go from here if thesystem does indeed frayand again i'll just end by saying i'm aproud american i think american valuesare amazing i just i'm just anti-dollarso i think this idea of beingpro-american anti-dollar is something weneed to continue to pushin the coming yearsand along with checking your financialprivilege maybe we can
