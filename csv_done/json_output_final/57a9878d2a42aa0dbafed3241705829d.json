Greatcholesterol con from 2007 doctoring datafrom 2015 and the more recent the clotthickens the enduring mystery of heartdisease published in 2021. his blog Drmalcolmkendrick.org explores the meaningbehind misleading Healthcare headlineshe joins us today for a discussion ofhis work on cholesterol and heartdisease this is of course a veryprominent Topic in scientific circles DrKendrick holds opinions that are notexactly congruent with the mainstreamviews that you might get on your TV andnewspaper and that is of course whywe're having him here because we'realways looking for these different waysof interpreting the world from what theFiat authorities have told us so DrKendrick thank you so much for joiningus today no problem nice to be herelet's just begin with the main thesis ofyour book The Great cholesterol con Imean cholesterol is something thateverybody in the world knows isdangerous it's for me it's as astoundinghow I travel all over the world andpretty much everywhere you go the onething that people are concerned aboutwhen it comes to their health ischolesterol you know people will beeating the most uh highly processedobesogenic food out there without anycare you know they'll be drinking litersof soda every day but when it comes tofatty Food they'll tell you oh no Igotta watch my cholesteroland you've written a book that saysthe cholesterol hypothesis is largely acon why is that the case well why we'rewritten the book or why is that I can'tI wrote the book because I suppose Ifelt I had to to do something one thingthat you become aware of quite quicklyis that if you start trying to writeclinical studies and papers that goagainst the mainstream it's incrediblydifficult to get them published I havebeen involved in a few but therejections are like an avalanche and thethe uh the approvals are the occasionaldrip because you send papers to peerreviewers and the peer reviewers allbelieve in the theory and they just saywell this must be nonsense so so it isvery hard to get scientific paperspublished although I have had one or twoum so I thought well I'll write a bookabout this and see if that has anyeffect on on the world because that'sone way of communicating nobody can edityou and and so long as you get itpublished it's at least it's out thereso so that was the the rationale forwho are writing the book anyway no Idefinitely can relate to that and Ithink I'm going to experience ineconomics part of the reason that I findmyself so uh perceptive to these hereticideas like yours is because of mybackground in economics it's practicallyimpossible to get published inhigh-ranking important journals andeconomics if you question theinflationist logic of central bankswhich Finance those journals and sothat's why I ended up just writing mybook independently and published it andfound it because it was just a book thatwas out there people could read it andthey could get access to their ideasmuch more than they could if we'd beenlooking at journals yeah well I thinkthat's true and in all Fields years agoI spoke to a scientist called Thomasgold who you've probably never heard ofhe's now died he must have died 20 yearsago but he was um he was one of thefirst geologists in the United States toto be a supporter of tectonic platemovement Theory at the time that wasconsidered heresy in the world ofgeology apparently he used to go to Eastgood conferences and way banners aroundsaying we believe in tectonic movementat which point you got thrown out of allthe meetings and you couldn't getanything published it's the same in allFields I think it's probably more ifimportant ormore corrosive in in medical researchbecause the amounts of money that can bemade from promotingdrugs that do certain things likelowering your cholesterol make billionsand billions and billions and the foodmanufacturing companies that make foodsthat theoretically lower yourcholesterol make more billions andbillions and billions so if you stickyour poker stick into that particularHornet's Nest they come up and theysting you because there's an awful lotof money to be lost huge vast sums ofmoney so entire reputations are madeyou become an expert in cardiovasculardisease if you support these ideas youget funding for your researchyou get your papers published in the bigjournals because that's how it goes soit's there's a gigantic kind of industryout there who who are really trying tostop you it's probably not so much ofthe case in I mean in economics yes butbut people don't become hugely Rich bysaying I believe in Keynesian economicsrather than whatever oh yes they do whatdo they know why well I I I I defer toeat superior knowledge I'm in economicsI think we're like an order of scalelarger because you know in your casesyeah pharmaceutical companies make a fewbillion dollars in this case you knowyou're talking about governments andBanks making trillions of dollars uhfrom promoting these Keynesian ideas butyeahstrike my previous comment from therecordhahaha but it is apart from the monetarythings there's also reputations at stakethere's people who've built their entirecareers on supporting our point of viewit's extraordinarily difficult foranyone to say uh you know what I thoughtabout this andI think I've been wrong for the last 40years and I think you're right so so I'mgoing to change my mind on this wordsthat one doesn't really tend to hear inin the world very muchum so as I think yes I mean you are upagainst uh a hugething whatever that thing is a huge blobof inertia as much as anything else soit's a yes it's not an easy place to beI think that Skeptics if that's thecorrect word from different areas dotend to find each other and seek eachother out of it because it's like wellI've had exactly the same problem in myfield this is what happens in my fieldyou you know I'm sure it's been the samethroughout historyalthough I fear that uh maybe a hundredyears ago or maybe even more recentlydifferent countries might have haddifferent ideas so the Germans mighthave had no different ideas and theRussians are different ideas and theUnited States and a different idea thanwhatever where the problem with the whatif you like the the the way things havegone there's a globalization of ideas isthat these ideas have sort of taken overeverywhere there isn't a country wherepeoplethere's not an Austrian economic groupanymore there's just a Big Blob ofpeople who all go around to the sameconferences and agree with each otherand Pat each other on the bat and backand fund each other and my my belief isit's far more difficult today than itever was to go against the the acceptedideas in any field I don't know howeveryone would ever prove that but Ibelieve it to be true yeahno I I agree with you entirely and mysecond book the Fiat standard I make thecase that Fiat money is at the root ofthis dysfunction I think throughouthistory you know we know all theseexamples of scientists who came up withideas and they were ridiculed and theywere fought and uh you know many timesit took many decades or centuries fortheir ideas to be Vindicated so thisisn't by any means a unique 20th centuryphenomenon but what I think is uniqueabout the 20th century and the inventionof Fiat money is that it makes itpossible for institutions to be long tobe wrong for a very long time and andthere's no corrective mechanism becausethere's no Market test so in a freemarket where you and everybody else isable to preach and practice whateverthey want you know you can come up witha theory that says cholesterol is badsomebody comes up with a theory sayscholesterol is good hospitals are freeto experiment with this people are freeto choose which hospital they want to goto which nutritionists they want to goto over time you're going to see thatthe people who choose the theories thatwork better with reality will do betterand they'll be better off and the peoplewho teach those ideas will benefit fromthat so more and more hospitals willadopt the theories that work if we had afree market in ideas and a free marketin those things but in the 20th centurybecause of Fiat money in my opinion thefunding mechanism is no longer basedupon the client it is top-down fundingfrom the money printerand the money printer as well alsodecides by regulation who gets to be ascientist as you said so it's it's amuch more elaborate straight jacket fora science and for group think in thatyou look at the example of in health yousee these and then you see it in allthese other fields you cannot become adoctor you know you lose your license ifyou tell people we saw for instance whathappened to doctors Professor Tim Knoxin South Africa we see so manyprofessors that and doctors who losetheir licenses for preaching somethingthat works very well for clients youknow the the reason I think this cansurvive is that the money printerprevents economic reality from imposingitself it continues to overrule economicreality and that's why I I love the termyou use in your book and endlesslyadaptable hypothesis which is anotherway of saying it's really not scientificit's just the makeup made up excuse sothey have the conclusion and theconclusion is you need to take thestatins and then they'll just adapt thehypothesiswith whatever is needed in order toarrive at that conclusionand they can do that because there's noMarket competition in a sense there'sthere's no alternative hospital systemthat's saying you know what we're notgoing to go ahead with this you can'tget licensed as a hospital you can't getlicenses and nutritionist or as adietitian or as a doctor unless you towthe party line effectively oh yeah Imean that's absolutely true you knowthere's others of course um what you'remaybe not aware of who've challenged andquestioned more the diet Heart part ofthe hypothesis Gary feckers anorthopedic surgeon in Australia who'staken to the Australian whatever it'scalled board and basically told neverever talk about this ever again or youwill no longer be able to practicemedicine in brackets at the end even ifit proves that you were right so I meanthe Ridiculousness of it I think is isit would be funny if it wasn't soserious and um I think it unfortunatelyyeah what's the quote you can ignorereality for as long as you want but youcan't ignore the consequences ofignoring the reality and I think that uhin you know I've recently been lookingat statistics of life expectancyparticularly in the United States butalso in the UK whereyou know we are seeing a reduction inlife expectancy it's not huge but it'sthere and it's relatively significantand people are rushing about trying tocome up with explanations as to why thismight beyou know of all these preventivemedicines like statins and bloodpressure lowering medications and allthese things that everyone is nowvirtually commanded to take worked wewould be expecting some increase in lifeexpectancy you would helpit may not be huge and in fact I waspart of the British Medical Associationcommittees when they introduced thesystem into the United Kingdom whichyou've never heard of and almost no andno one's aired up but still the qualityoutcome frameworkwhereby you use a certain number ofpoints to be gathered eleven hundred andfifty points or whatever for doingcertain things like taking people'sblood pressure lowering their bloodpressure measuring their weight makingsure their blood sugar levels are undercontrolincluding cholesterol and loweringcholesterolit was led to really an explosion inpolypharmacy probably Pharmacy beingobviously ticking more than one severalmedications at the same time now each ofthese medications had an Evidence baseof sorts to support it but of course noone's ever no one's ever done a study onis it better to take seven medicationsthan six is it better to take six andfive or eight then seven my predictionat the time was that we would see areduction in life expectancy because thecombination of all these medicinesbeing given to people simultaneouslywould cause greater problems than itcould ever ever sold now we're seeinglike expectancy going down but of courseno one no one is is looking at thepossibility that it might be because ofwhat we're doingthe medical interventions that we'redoing might have a role to play in thisI can't say it for certain however I didpredict it it has happenedand and studies on people takingmultiple medications where they've triedto reduce or take off as manymedications as they can I've shown quitedramatic improvements in life expectancybut again these are small scale studiesthey're never followed up it's becausewell we know why they are not fullenoughbecause then you'd have to turn aroundand say you know what all this stuffabout monitoring and measuring andtreating and treating treating and moreand more and more drugs being givenis having the exact opposite effect tothat which we we wished it to and againquote yourself in a way back at you thisis not an acceptablething to look at so no one looks at itand yet it's incredibly important I meanacross the world at the moment we'reseeing an increase in overall mortalityrates in many many countries which can'tbe explained and yet these things haveto be explained and the only way you canpossibly explain them is to look atthings you don't necessarily want tolook at but we are just people are justhiding from what could be causing thislet's look at everything now there arecertain things you can look atand there are an awful lot of things youare not allowed to look at you're noteven allowed to suggest that we shouldlook at them because to suggest that wecould look at them suggest these thingsmay be a problemyou know it is I don't want to get intoI don't want to get into that action butI'm extremely concerned that that we'renot looking at this at all at the momentand yet there is it should be looked atif only to dismiss it as a possibilityof causing harmand you know the explanations of whatcan't possibly be causing harmful we'renot looking at it it becomes very wellit's anti-science isn't it it's justit's not scientific at all exactly thereare certain issues we can't look at wewon't look at and you're not allowed tolook at them in fact you're not evenallowed to mention them as possibilitiesI mean that's the exact opposite of ofscience which is where I find myselfgetting ratherworked up with people yeah go back tocholesterol I mean what did I do I Ilived in Scotland I was brought up inScotland Scotland did the highest rateof heart disease in the world when I wasat Universityso obviously it was quite an interestingissue to look at and the idea was thatthe Scots at a terrible diet thisbecause their cholesterol to go up andthat was what was causing them to havethis Iraqwell I I happened to go to France quitea lot and one thing I noticed aboutFrance was they certainly don't hangback on eating saturated fatand in fact they have the highestconsumption of saturated fat in Europeat um 15.5 the last time I looked it'svery difficult to get these statisticsnow 15.5 of all the calories that theyconsumed in France were were from suchconsuming saturated fatand yet the rate of heart disease was afifth to a sixth of that in Scotlandso once you see a fact like that youthink well yeah hard to see that it'shaving an effect and once you startquestioningyou start looking into it more deeplyand then you have to ask the questionwell you know the last time that theyactually provided these figures wasabout year 2008 were there were the werethe top five countries in Europe withsaturated fat consumption where if I canget this right off the top of my headFrance SwitzerlandSpain the UK and somewhere else I can'tremember my name upuh with an average intake of about 13and if you looked at the five countriesat the lowest consumption of saturatedfat which was actually at the timeUkraine mulled over Russiaum somewhere else and somewhere else thethe difference in heart disease rateswas that the countries at the mostsaturated fathad five times less or five times fewerheart disease deaths than the ones thatat the lowest amount of saturated fat soif there was any correlation it was theexact opposite way around and in a verysignificant manner to what we were toldso once you start reading this and thenyou start looking into the mechanismsand the science you realizethis is just doesn't work it's not thehypothesis that worksand yet and yet people believe it morestrongly than they ever have done I meanfacts like you know we hear about eatingfive portions of fruit and vegetables ishealthy for you now if you spoke to mostpeople they would absolutely tell youthat this is an absolute fact I rememberonce a few of us went and tried to findout where where where is the evidencefor this come from and the the answer isthere was never a study never ever anystudy on this ever done anywhere everthere is no evidence to support it andyet it is almost the fact I don't knowwhat it's like in other countries but inthe UK this is a fact and and you can'targue against it they go well you can'tthat's just just everybody knows thisyou know I realize that everybody knowsI know everybody knows this fact butwhat I'll do is I'll challenge you I'llgive you a million pounds come up withthis thing find me the study from whichthis fact emerged and you will find youcan't find it because it doesn't existand believe me lots of us have lookedfor it and fail so I mean theastonishing thing is how how vehementlypeople supportthings that they know to be true thatjust aren't even remotely true and theproblem is of course I mean how do youargue against somebody's deeply heldbelief when their belief is based onnothing at all other than what somebodytold them once and and umI don't know why humans are so well theword is gullible once they've got itstuck in there wellI think you know the key is it's nottold once I I think I heard thissomewhere that you need to repeatsomething to somebody seven times andthen it just sticks and they take it asbeing true and so the way that uhpropaganda works is just continuousrepetition so people just believe youknow five rations of fruits andvegetables have to be true thatis bad for you saturated fat is bad foryou CO2 emissions are boiling the oceansyou you hear these seven times on theBBC and then everybody knows and for mewhenever I hear the term everybody knowsthat's a red flag you know if some ifsomebody has to you know if it was truethat they'll tell you you know youshould do this because of that because Iread it here and I read it there andthis is the evidence for it when whenyou know something that's true you canexplain why you know it but if youresort to the mental crutch of everybodyknows then it's just propaganda that youread on TV that you heard on TV ingeneral and I agree with you this is whyyou know in in the field in my chapteron science it's called Fiat science andI think the term science is veryappropriate because on the one hand it'snot just that it's financed by Fiatmoney in that it's you know all theseinstitutions that promote this scienceare heavily dependent on inflation andgovernment subsidies in order tocontinue to produce this stuff but alsobecause the money the fact that themoney comes from above means that thescience is not open for questioning it'snot open for the scientific measuremethod it's not open for experimentationit's just handed down to us by Fiat youknow government agencies anduniversities and the anointed expertshave decided that you should eat fivefruits and vegetables in a day and thenthat's it that's it by Fiat you knowit's by decree that's what the word Fiatmeansand that's it like you can't argue withthat whether it's you know uh climatechange where they tell you it'sconsensus that's it it's consensus youcan't argue what kind of science isconsensus and whether it's diet andwhether it's macroeconomics you knoweverybody knows everybody agrees all theexperts agree all your arguments aren'tvalid that's it that's all you need toknow yeah well you say DavidAttenborough said it then it'sabsolutely true you know in our countryif he says it you can't argue with itbecause David is like the the ultimate Inoticed you had trouble working out whatto say when you said five root andvegetables portions this is my firstcomment what is a portion of fruit andvegetables is it is it five watermelonsor five grapes you know and then no onecan tell you at the moment you can't getan answer to I think a very basicquestion like what's a portion you knowyou people are just talking nonsense youknow when someone say well it's it's 27grams of this and the other thing thatalways amuses me is when people come upwith their own figure because when itcomes to cholesterol it's like if yourcholesterol is greater than five it'sdangerous that used to be the case it'snow gone down butum but of course in America they usedifferent units milligrams per deciliterrather than millimoles per liter so inAmerica it's anything above 200milligrams per deciliter is dangerouswell there's a difference of 0.2 thereand within that point too so it's aboutfive percent of the population of thesecountries so it's sort of don't movecountries because your cholesterol isokay if you're in America but you cometo Britain you're going to have to betreated because we use a different youknow measurement than you doit's like with blood pressure you knowit was all zeros it's 120 over 70 it'slike if it was a true measurement if youreally knew where that level was itwould be126.75 over73.92 instead of oh that is 720 over 70.and it's like with bmis as well becauseI looked at body mass index stuff and umand where where is the idea that obesitybegins a bit body mass index of 30 beganwell no one knows the answer to thateither but I think I do in that I read aWorld Health Organization document fromabout the year 2000. which is about 600pages longand when they come to saying when do wedecide to set these limits it was umthe the argument for a BMI of 30 thecommon the only thing that was statedwas we looked at the inflection on theCurveand that was where it comes fromthere's no absolute fee there's noguaranteed for it you just never thinkof the ponderosity index which wasactually in a different way of measuringbody mass index and that was differentand the Americans us used to have adifferent BMI for obesity than they hadin Europe and then suddenly they decidedwe'd better all have the same the samedefinition and then they found thatthere are populations in what they callfrom India and Pakistan what we callSouth Asiansif their body mass is greater than about25 they're obese so actually being obeseis not a is a Movable Feast you can beobese for the body mass index of 25 anda half in in India but you've got tohave it over 30 in the United Kingdom oror or United States so when you startcoming across this did you say it's anendlessly flexible thing it's it'sendlessly flexed to meet some new pieceof data that comes in but they don'tquestion the hypothesis they just saythe hypothesis is correct it's just thatwe need to look at it in a different wayyeah and so when you look at you look atcholesterol itself of course there's nosuch thing as cholesterol in thebloodstreamthat it's carried around in littlespheres when you find that they used tohave a thing well they still do have athing called total cholesterol which ofcourse includesall sorts of different type of proteinsand and then they found that somepopulations with high cholesterols werenot having higher rates of heart diseaseso this now it's because they've got ahigh level of good cholesterol so westarted splitting it into badcholesterol and good cholesterolcholesterol is just a molecule it'sexactly the sameuser utilizing terms of good and bad wenow have light and fluffy badcholesterol we have good bad cholesterolnowand we have we have bad good cholesterolso we have cholesterol good cholesterolbad cholesterol good bad cholesterol andgood bad and bad good cholesterolso you have every possible version ofcholesterol and and the one that wascalled good high density like proteinthey've recently found in many peoplehaving very high levels is bad for youso instead of saying well thathypothesis is complete sentence okay soso I want to get into this in detail butfirst like yeah I I just want to say thething with hypothesis is what's amazingis as as it is endlessly adaptablethere's just nothing that can't falsifyit and one of my favorite tricks thatthey pull off in Fiat science is theidea of a paradox so whenever you get apiece of data that clearly contradictsyour theory a scientist says all rightyou know this thing falsifies that andyou only need one Sunrise from the Westto falsify all of our views of astronomyyou know if the sun rises from the Westone day then everything that we knowabout astronomy is wrong you can't justsay oh well that's a paradox why is itthat on this Monday it Rose from theWest no you have to investigate and youhave to come up with a theory that fitsall of these observations but as yousaid you know the French paradox is wellknown in in nutrition so this falsifieseverything we say but we're just goingto call it the Paradox and continue tobelieve what we want what we do rightif the scientific paper has anexplanation of or fourthen it's title you know it's a completeCrocit's just people saying well it'sbasically trying to explain a paradoxaway you know yeah why why why did theFrench have have you know eat so muchsaturated fat and and the lowest rate ofheart disease measurable in Europe forthe last 50 yearswell at one time they had a Time longlag hypothesis which was that it allactually takes 50 40 Years of eatingsaturated fat for it to cause a problemand the French haven't been eating asmuch saturated fat as say in Englandwhich is completely rubbish but anywaythat that paper was published in 2002 sonow 20 years laterit's those 60 years and how long haveyou got to eat saturated fat for beforeit's going to show some impact on heartdisease we've now had 60 years when it'sbeyond the average lifespan of the humanrace maybe you'll accept that it's gotnothing to do with it at all but butthey won't they just move on they justthey just say oh well it's it's otherthings you know it you can never everever get hold of them and get them toadmit any any you know any scientifichypothesis is about predictive abilityand if if you can't predict what's goingto happen even remotely with yourhypothesis it's wrong and so thecholesterol hypothesis fails here orthere and and in fact everywhereand some of the most ruthless promotersof the cholesterol hypothesis in the UKare the Oxford teams of researchers whoset up a thing called the UK biobankwhich you may or may not heard ofthe Gathering data from like noteverybody in Britain but it's hundredsof thousands and thousands of people andfrom time to time they look at thisdatabase it contains stuff from all overthe country and they looked at becauseof the cardiovascular disease what werethe most important triggers formortality and cardiovascular disease andthey came up with a smoking surprisesurprise a high sugar level diabetessurprise surprise some of the usualsuspects but when they looked atcholesterol and the the the impact of aone millimole per liter decrease orincrease on your risk of cardiovasculardisease what they found was in thisstudy that the risk of your cholesterolgoing up by one millimeter per onemillimole per liter of cholesterol wasonenot even 0.99 not 1.01 it was onein other wordsit made absolutely no difference to yourrisk of dying of heart disease having ahigher cholesterol leveland and the paper itself that waspublished in didn't even mention thisfact the only way you could findyourself is by looking into the tablesand data that partly and remember looksinto and yet despite that they stilltell you that it's the most importantsingle causal factor for heart diseasetheir own research has disproved theirown hypothesis and they don't they don'teven mention itso they they come up with other nonsensethings called um mendelian randomizationand if you come across this as absoluteit's just a way of we have an expressionwhich I like to use calledbaffles brains mendelian randomizationis the biggest load of everbecause they can't find a gene that isactually associated with heart diseaseand never found one they admit thatthere's no such thing and yet they theycontinue to say that mendelianrandomization proves X Y or Zand and the only reason they get awaywith it is no one understands whatthey're talking aboutand unless you read the paper as anincredible detail to find a fatal flawbecause the statistics is fine so youknow once you've made the assumptionsthat are incorrect that they can'tsustain the statistical analysis workspretty well but we now have a situationwhere you can be told that you havefamilial hypercholesterolemia which ishaving a raised LDL bad cholesterollevelbut you don't actually have to have araised LDL level to be diagnosed with itbecause they can prove genetically thatyou've got it even if you haven't got itI mean there is no end to theunbelievable Ridiculousness of of theRidiculousness but you can't debate thisstuff because if you try and sort ofwrite a paper about it it just getsrejected if you try and pin these peopledown you you won't you can't have anargument you knowif you simply try and ask the questionof how is the genetics how is it thatthe genetics are responsible when 100years ago all of our ancestors didn'thave those diseases and now everybodyhas those diseases so how did thosegenes skip all of our ancestors and comeand hit us now but these theseexplanations of genetics are just verypopular because you can argue with themyou don't understand genes nobody knowshow to get into the genes and playaround with them somebody tells you ohyeah you have a gene well how do I knowso just it it seems to work pretty wellall right so what what is cholesterollet's start from from Square One what ischolesterolcholesterol is a is a chemical c25 h46you know 23 I think it is yourcholesterol is the basis of of manysteroid hormones in your body it's it'sthe the basic structure of it is is forhydrocarbon rings with with them or thechain attached to the end of it which isit which is a very common that you'lluse by the body for all sorts of thingsum you'll find it you can find it inanimal Foods animal if you eatum uh animals or if you carnivore youwill eat a certain amount of cholesterolbecause it's part of all of our cellsevery cell contains quite a lot ofcholesterol and it's present in in ourbody if you like in in various differentfunctions our own liver manufacturesabout five grams of cholesterol each daybecause the body needs it for variousimportant functions it makes up thesynapses in our brain sothe highest concentration of cholesterolin the body is actually in the nervecells and the neurons and the synapsesin our brain that's that's one of itsfunctions it's a really important inmaintaining the the structure of allcell membranes and allows them tofunction properly that allows noimpulses to be transported along theSouth and essentially without it yourbrain doesn't work and they've proventhat with animal experiments it's alsomade into various hormones liketestosterone and estrogen andprogesterone and cortisol and whateverby the body and these these hormones alluse the basic structure of cholesterolto work so it's it's not found in inPlants because plants have a thingcalled a sterile or a style which isvery very similar to cholesterol it hasa different bending structure at the endof it which gives cells in Plantsthey're more rigid structure so a stanalor a sterileis creates what they call a cell walland that's why cells in trees orwhatever are quite hard or harderso so if you take a standalone or asterile in things like benico You'reabsorbing that rather than cholesterolwhich is why your cholesterol goes downbut what you're doing is you're puttinga plantsterileinto the place where cholesterol maybeshould be and there is some evidencethat that is not a very good thing to doin humans because we're we don't we'renot designed to be full of stalls andsterols we're designed to be full ofcholesterol cholesterol is actually a noit's just a sterile it's just adifferent version of it so thecholesterol molecule itself is thisthing that has no Myriad functions inthe human body and the the reason whywe're worried about it is not well whoknows for sure why we're worried aboutit is that the liver producescholesterol cholesterol like all fats isinsoluble in bloodso if it just was pushed out of theliver into the bloodstream it would justClump together and get jammed up and itwouldn't work at all couldn't betransported so you have to transport itaround the body in a little lipid whatwe call a protein lipid Sphere for thelife of protein which takes cholesteroland fats takes it out of the liver andtransports it around the body wherethese things are dumped into variouscells around the body that need them andthen it comes back to the liver it goesout as I think called vldl which is thetriglyceride a big life of protein itshrinks down in size to become an LDLand the LDL is then removed from thecirculation by the liver and the variousparts of the LDL are remanufactured tomake more what they call vldls sothere's a kind of circulation going onthe LDL made made in the livertransports fat and cholesterol aroundthe body comes back to the to the liverwhere it's reabsorbed a certain amountof cholesterol is also absorbed by cellsthat need itso it's a kind of transportation systemfor fats and cholesterol that we'retalking about and the one that we'reworried about or the mainstream isworried about is the LDL the loaddensity lipoprotein essentially they'recalled different densities becausethey're very low density like protein isless dense obviously it becomes anintermediate density line for protein itbecomes an LDL which ismore dense hdls are the one that sayshigh-density lipoproteins are the onesthat are theoretically take cholesterolback from various tissues where it'sneeded to take it back to the liverthat's a very simplistic way of lookingat it and try to keep it simple so soit's the one the one that we're worriedabout the one we call cholesterol orhalf cold cholesterol is LDL low densitylipoprotein and that's the one that allthe medications are designed to lower soyour statins lower than that and the newones called incretings and whatever theylower it and there's other things newmempanoic acid and there's everyone'sbeen trying to lower it for years andyears the first cholesterol lowererswere things called fibrates which werehorrible things that basically stoppedyou absorbing cholesterol and fat andthey're only straight through insteadand there have been a few other onesthat have sort of arrived and not donevery much at all as a demive is anotherone so there's all these drugs that keepgetting getting thrown into the marketto lower low density lipoproteinnot cholesterol that's what's beinglowered does that sort of make sense oryeah so that's that's the bad one thateverybody is worried about what's themechanism that the mainstream viewsuggests is implicated in the move fromcholesterol to destroying your healthhow does that work why is this thingthat your body makes somehow deadly foryou yeah well it's uh the theory is ifyou have a higher concentration more ofit is absorbed in to your arteries whogoes into your arteries where where itclumps together and gradually formsthickenings that narrow your arteriesdown and eventually the artery is verynarrow the blood supply can't getthrough might jam up completely with theblood clot and that's the that's thebasic mechanism for a heart attack or astroke so LDL is higher it gets absorbedinto the archery wall where it builds upinto these what they call plaquesthickenings in your arteries and that'sthe the the the underlying thing I meanI I agree with the existence ofatherosclerotic plaques and narrowing ofarteries that exists the hypothesisreally came about because when theyfirst looked at atherosclerotic plaquesmany many years ago they found they hada lot of cholesterol in themso they had a high concentration ofcholesterol so what people said is wellwhere is the cholesterol coming fromwell the answer is it must be comingfrom the bloodstreamand therefore a raised level ofcholesterol although it is notcholesterol and the bloodstream iscausing the thickenings and narrowingsbecause where else would the cholesterolhave come from how could it be there ifit wasn't coming out of the bloodstreamso that was the the reasoning thatstarted it all elf if you like fromthere the whole thing has has sort ofsustained itself for the last so manyyears you can sort of see why you wouldwhy people might arrive at this kind ofconclusion not necessarily nefariousit's not like people are there out theredeliberately lying it's just that theway that they look at the world is thatyou want to establish a mechanism whereyou find one culprit that you can fixwith a pill that's just how the medicalmind of the 20th century has functionand that's I mean that's been somethingthat's been institutionalized intomedicine throughout the 20th centuryprimarily I would say if we look at therole that the Rockefellers and themodern medical they played with modernMedical education at the beginning ofthe 20th century the Americanfoundations and the American medicationthey moved toward the idea that lookwe've discovered these amazing chemicalspetroleum essentially and all of itsderivative products and we can makeanything we want in whatever propertiesthat we want from it and so therefore wecan fix all of diseasesand indeed this has given us anastonishingly High number of medicalproducts and pills and so on that youcan see why you know that thatengineering mindset that built theworld's hydrocarbon infrastructurearound petroleum which truly transformedthe world and arguably incidentally youknow arguably I I believe it washydrocarbon infrastructure that gave usall of the improvements in global Healthprimarily not so much medicines you knowthe sanitation and the ability to heatour homes that have hot drying water andall of those things these were far moreinfluential in our health probably thanany one individual medicine but ifyou've had this massive success you cansee why you would project it onto thehuman body as well so in the same waythat we can design engineering systemsto solve problems with sewage we cansolve problems with the human body wefigure out this is the thing then wefigure out what chemical can take thatthing down and then we do it and it'sit's very easy to make that mistake whenyou come at the world from that kind ofperspective and the disaster is it'svery difficult to snap out of thatmistake because essentially the feedbackmechanism of the real world which ismarkets and prices and signalsyou know price signals that tell youwhether what you're doing is good or badthat's essentially undercut in this kindof Fiat top-down world of Medicineso why would you say then this is wrongwhat is your objection to this Theorywell uh first of allum you know I like to go down to basicsof things just like get down to thewhat's actually going to happen I meanthe first question you want to ask is iswhy would LDL an LDL molecule out of allthe things that are floating around inthe blood be the one that just happensto leak into the artery walls there'smillions of other molecules out theremany of which are much smaller what'swhat's unique about thisyou know there is no explanation for itthe other the other one of the keyproblems that I started with looking isis this happens in arteries which are ofcourse the Bloods of vessels want tocome out of your heart and you've gotthe big artery and then the arteriessplit down like like branches on a treethe height the pressure in thesearteries is much higher then then theblood turns itself around Hillary's andcomes back to the heart through veinsyou never getum atherosclerotic plaques in veins thatdoesn't existyet the level of LDL is precisely thesame the blood vessel wall is preciselythe same thingso what's your mechanism that says itgoes into arteries but it doesn't gointo thingsand you can say oh well whatevermechanism you wish to propose you couldsay well in your lungs have a differenta separate blood supply if you like themthe blood comes back through your veinsarrives in the right side of your heartgets pumped out of that side into yourlungs travels around your lungs goesinto the left side of your hardeninggets pushed out under much higherpressure into the rest of your body younever get other sclerotic plants in yourlungs either when I say never there areone or two conditions where where it canhappen but it's very very unusualso you have to explain why does LDL leakthrough blood vessels in arteries not inveins and not in the lungs what what isyour mechanism of action now that can'tbe due to blood pressureblood pressure is not going to beforcing anything through anywhereand then you start looking at it moredetail you say well you know your yourarteries are lined with if you likeendothelial cells a bit like wall tilesare obviously more complicated than awall tile well you have to get the LDLthrough the wall tile into the archerywall how does that happen well there'sno mechanism known by which this canhappenand if it could happen it would happenin veins as well and it would happen inthe arteries and and veins in your lungsso what you're saying is there's someunique mechanism of action that happensin your arteries that doesn't happenanywhere else that allows LDL to somehowor otherget past what is a barrier and into thearchery wall behind so then you have toask yourself the question of what'shappening in one artery how can it whyis it not happening everywhere in allarteries why is it not going through allarteries the same why is it just in oneor two points and as you startquestioning it you say well there is nomechanism of action by which this canoccurokayit doesn't make any sense from uh fromany any perspective but when you startlooking into it and start asking thesequestions people can't answer thisquestion they pretend to be able toanswer this question but they can'tanswer these questionsand then you look more clearly and saywell look at this cholesterol that's inthese these plaques where does it comefrom and in fact a number of researchershave said well it is one place itcertainly isn't coming from is LDLmolecules becausethe cholesterol you find in in plaquesis actually free cholesterol it can formcrystals that is not what you find inLDL molecules now okay I'm going to gointo every single one of these detailsbut every time you go down a route tosay what are we looking at you find thatit cannot be explained by thishypothesisequally you know we find that whenpeople have as people get older having alower cholesterol level means you'remore likely to die from cardiovasculardisease than having a higher LDLcholesterol levelwhich is a bit like saying well if yousmoke you can cause lung cancer up tothe age of 60 but after the age of 60 ifyou smoke you get less lung cancerthat would make sense not but they'resaying the same thing with cholesterolwhich is when up to the age of 60 havinga high cholesterol level is associatedwith an increased risk which is sort ofa bit in some populations after 60 or 55or whatever cut points exactly you lookat it doesn't exist as a correlationit's a paradox well it's a it's aparadox and every time you come up withthis Paradox well it's apparent this onehas an explanation which is that andwhat happens is that when people are illtheir cholesterol level drops so it'snot they it's not the uh the highcholesterol a little cholesterol that'sa problem it's the it's the underlyingdisease now no one's ever found thisotherwise diseases and anyone everlooked at it they have found thisexplanation doesn't work however you'llstill hear of this low cholesterolhypothesis which was just made up inabout the year 1998 by a guy calledstamler to explain so every every timeyou find a parrot someone will come upwith an explanationand and in fact it was Carl says copperwho who first recognized what they callthe ad hoc type officers here issomething that is not fitted by yourhypothesis oh well here's theexplanationsoand you can keep doing this but reallyyou can keep doing this forever theproblem is at a certain point yourparadoxes start tripping over otherparadoxes until they they meet in themiddle and you you don't have an answerbut no one no one wants to use thatlevel of logic so you know the theconcept is they thought they werelooking at cholesterol in plaques andthey were but actually within LDL justto get slightly more scientific LDLcarries cholesterol as what they call acholesterol Ester is attached to asaturated fat so cholesterol is not freechemically is bound to a saturated to afatty acid that makes the cholesterolEster that's what LDL has within it nowthat form of cholesterol attached to afatty acid cannot cannot be free whatthey call free cholesterol and cannotmake cholesterol crystals is what youquite often find in atheroscleroticplaques the only place that freecholesterol in sufficient quantities tomake cholesterol crystals exists iswithin the cell membranes of red bloodcellserythrocytes and red blood cells if youlike are also lipoproteins they justhave a really high concentration of freecholesterol in them because that allowsthem to shuttle oxygen and carbondioxide very complicated but that's theonly place you're going to find this sowhen you find cholesterol crystals whichyou find in almost all plaques to somedegreethe one place that cannot have come fromis an LDL molecule where it must havecome from is a red blood cell so wheredo red blood cells how do they get intothe artery wall no one says well if yourred blood cell count is high you getatherosclerosis this isn't even aremotely accepted hypothesis so you haveto ask the question how does a red bloodcell get into the artery walland if you can answer that then you'restarting to move towards the trueanswers of what causes heart disease andpeople just don't even look at thisit's like oh well we thank cholesterolcrystals but that's a later thing and weget it's it it is like listening yeahhowever you find these contradictionspeople just they either just dismiss itor say well that happens in this otherprocess that I can't explain to you butwe know it must happen because we knowcholesterol causes heart diseasetherefore whatever we find that doesn'tsupport this is just wrong or can beexplained in some other way or I'm notgoing to talk to you anyway becauseyou're wrong you know that's about thelevel of argument you get but like yourthing is you know as everybody knowswell I was saying the science is settledthat's my that's my version of anyonetells me the science is settled theysaid anyone who makes that statement bydefinition should remove themselves fromever calling themselves a scientistbecause if the science science is neversettledno one can ever settle itit's always up for grabs and some thingsmight be a bit more certain than otherthings but one thing I do know for sureis science ain't ever settledso your your comment if everybody knowsmine is always the science is settledand you get that one a lot about globalwarming for instance the science hassettled right you're not a scientist soI'm not listening to you about anythingscientific ever again go away until youaccept that that as as Feynman said weshould find me now science science is isthe is the knowledge that experts can bewrong if you don't accept that expertscan be wrong if you don't think therecan be any questioning then then we'redoomed no you were done for because thenyou're not allowed to question thingsbecause they just are accepted facts andthat's that and there is no there isnothing you can do so you know how doyou start questioning it I mean mylatest book is called thickens and itgoes through this in possibly too muchdetail for most people but it doesexplain why and how the hypothesis uh iswrong no that wouldn't I don't reallycare about whether I processors areright or wrong in a way in medicinebecause human biology is got so manyvariables kicking around it is quitedifficult to see that's an absolutecontradiction or that's an absoluteproof of anything it is it is complexeswhat happens is when you actually do theexperiments themselves and say well dothey fit the hypothesis and the answeris I mean the other thing that supportedthe cholesterol hypothesis or the LDLhypothesis is that statins reduce LDLthey actually reduce cholesterolsynthesis in the liverthe resist collateral synthesis anddelivers that reduce the amount ofcholesterol being shunted out by theliver because of that the liver then hasto draw more in and the LDL level Fallsbecause it needs more cholesterol to becoming back at itand they do reduce the risk ofcardiovascular disease by what I wouldconsider a small amount now this wasconsidered absolute proof of thehypothesis and in fact people who arequestioning the hypothesis in the early80sum gave in when the Statin trials appearto show benefit I'm part of a groupcalled The International network ofcholesterol Skeptics and we you know youlook at the data the data and you saywell there's no evidence no one'sactually shown that the degree of LDLlowering is associated with the decreasein risk of cardiovascular disease justtaking a Statin reduces the risk ofgetting cardiovascular diseasehowever just taking an aspirin reducesthe risk of cardiovascular disease thatdoes nothing to LDL and there are manyother drugs that reduce and can reduceyour risk of cardiovascular diseasewithout lowering your LDL what just sohappens is it's statins have quite asignificant effect on on bloodcoagulation it's a coincidental thingthat's what we call a pleiotropic effectit's not something that they designed itto do but it does itstatins also lower blood pressure inpart through the same mechanism so theyhave in fact the last time I came across43 what they call cleotropic mechanismsof statinsthat could and and I believe do explainhow they've shown some benefits becausethere's been plenty of other drugs thathave lowered LDL to the same degree itstarted and have had no impact oncardiovascular diseasethe reason you have never heard of themis because obviously they didn't launchthere were drugs which were designed toincrease HDL and lower LDL they werecalled trapez or very tourist attractiveand previous attractive and there's fourof them the latest one of them loweredLDL by about 40 which is more than moststatins it raised HDL by 150 which LDLbeing good cholesterol so you'reexpected to see some pretty majorbenefits from this nothing happened atall there was no impact oncardiovascular disease pharmaceuticalcompanies spent about 15 billionresearching these drugs they all failedto show any benefit whatsoever and thenthey are obviously at that point died atdeath now you don't hear of thesebecause they didn't watch and no onemade much noise about them surprisedsurprisedbut there are plenty of others that havelowered LDL and total cholesterol andhave had no impact these don't gettalked about so they contribute as yousay it only takes the sun to rise in thewrong way around don't forget which wayit arisesthere are sets in Western it only takesthe sun to rise in the west once andyour hypothesis is a crop and when youhave four sunrises in the Westthen you've definitely got a realproblem in your hands then you've justgot four paradoxes well well easilyexplained because they did well theexplanation is oh they did other thingsthat raised the level of heart diseaseby the same amount as they would havebeen lowering it so that's why theydidn't workone can you could just use the sameargument the other way around aboutstatins and they said yeah well it hadnothing to do with they're only loweringit was the other things they did thathad an impact on cardiovascular diseasebut a lot of explanation cat that wedon't like that inspiration but we likethe other explanation you can't convincesomebody who's unable to be convincedit's just impossible it doesn't have anincentive to be convinced becausefinancially there's a lot more money tobe made in the simplistic explanationsof disease that require a pill you knowif you can sell people if you canconvince people that the problem is thelack of a magic pill then you can make alot of money selling a magic Bill wellto quote I can't remember his name nowhe's a few quotes and one of his quoteswas um an American politician he saidthe uh did the electorate have spoken tothe bastards and his other quote was umit's very difficult to convince somebodyif their salary depend of something andsuch salary depends on them notbelieving it and we are in thatsituation uh what are your money MoneyTalks I don't I don't you know do Ihugely blame these researcherswell I sort of do but but you know weall have to make a living we have to gohome and look after our children andit's very difficult togo against the mainstream very difficultto go against the mainstream I mean I'mlucky enough in that you know as ageneral practitioner I'm not aresearcher I'm not going to loseresearch fundingbecause I don't have any I never will Ihave I have put research and forapplications have been miserablyrejected several times I can be criticalof the cholesterol hypothesis and notlose my jobI can't be political of the of anythingto do with vaccination or I will lose myjob so don't jinx it quite well yeahum well I'll reach an age where about itbut uh but equally if you go too far andyou upset people too much you're notgoing to get excited it's a hard oneisn't it if you really just say you'reall talking rubbish and and really go atthem maybe you have more chance ofwinning eventually if you're relativelycalm andquite oh quite as quiet it's not theright word about it then people mightlisten now that sounds like a reasonableguy he sounds quite reasonable alwayswhat he's saying sounds quite reasonableso you know I I don't know how stronglyyou attack things that are wrong andwhether a full frontal head-on attack isa better way or or trying to just getpeople to shift you know have youthought about this have you thoughtabout this the reason I wrote my mylatest book The Great thickensis it just attacking the clusterhypothesis because it seems to getnowherebut it seems to just reform itself andgrow strongerso I thought well part of the reason forthat so my my metaphor was like it waslike blowing up a planet and thenwondering why every time you blow it upit just cool messes again this becausethere's nowhere else for the matter togo if you knowwhereas at least if you can say wellhere's another way of looking at heartdisease this actually fits the factssomewhat better or hopefully it fits thefacts all of that then maybe people'sthinking can move across to this becauseit's something positive rather than anegative all the time which you're wrongyou're wrong you're wrong this isrubbish it's nonsense it doesn't makeany sense to say actually and here'sanother idea by the way here's adifferent way of looking at it and Ithink that makes more sense and I thinkif you look at it you may find it doesmake more sense and therefore it'ssomewhere else for you to go now I don'texpect any of the experts currently thethe higher level key opinion leaders topay any attention to it but I'm kind ofhopeful maybe that some younger doctorsor some younger researchers might sayyou know what I think that does makemore sense so I'm going to have a lookat it so that's sort of where I am atthe moment if you like so I agree withyou entirely and uh you know I I like tokeep drawing analogy to economic beforeBitcoin came along uh this was kind ofwhat proper economists or AustrianSchool economists would say that they'rejust constantly out there telling peopleno you're wrong you're wrong you'rewrong you shouldn't do this this way youshould do it that way and with Bitcoinit's it's entirely refreshing that youdon't have to convince them that they'rewrong you can just show them that thisdoes it better yes this is just bettermoney so what is your explanation forheart disease why does heart diseasecome along if it's not well uh I like tobe suitably modest and saying that myexplanation for heart disease was firstproposed in 1852 also in Austria it'salways in a place that all good ideascome from uh Carl Von Rocky tansky aresearcher looked at plaques in arteriesand said oh what I'm looking at here areblood clots or the remnants of bloodclots metaphomorphosing into you knowdifferent structure obviously if youdamage the body it starts off you knowyou get a cut in your arm it starts upas a cut well it will gradually healtogether but then you'll get a line ofclassification and all sorts of thingsit will look completely different thanit did the moment you cut it so so whathe said was I'm just looking at bloodclots here and so his hypothesis wasthat atherosclerotic facts are theremnants of blood clots in variousstages of repair and metamorphosisand in fact it was another it was aGerman obviously because we don't youknow we don't like the German scientiststhey're probably certain but it wasactually a workout who's a very famousGerman scientists had a very famous andbrilliant man but he saidwell then how does a blood clot getinside the archery wall now I did talkabout there's aligning to all arteriesand blood vessels it's called theendothelium which is a single cell of itlike a wall tileand what you find is obviously theplaque the thickening is underneath thewall tiles so you you obviously had toget it through the wall towels in someway or other rocketanski didn't reallyhave an explanation for this so howcould it be underneath it how can youhave a blood clot forming that's not inthe actual blood vesselso the idea kind of die to death otherresearchers looked at it and have lookedat it over the years after the secondworld war there was a researcher calledwho looked at it again and said I'mlooking I think I'm looking at bloodclotsor or the remnants of blood flots hereand Ross uh what I forgot his first namein the 70s was very much the response toinjury hypothesis which was that youfirst of all have to damage the archerywall in some way a blood clot then formsover that that damaged area and then thehealing process comes along but the theblood clot that that was on the insideof the arterial molecule like was wassort of sitting therehas been pulled back into and coveredoverall with a new layer of endotheliumand and it sits in there and and thatbecomes the focus for further bloodclots so you might get blood clot afterblood clot after blood clot at the samepointnow normally this is a process that'sactually probably happened in all of ourarteries to a degree all at the sametime but in most cases the repairsystems get to work and the whole thingis cleared up and there's nothing leftthere's not a problem so say if yousmoke a cigarette if you smoke they haddone a study on cigarette smoking we'vegot healthy volunteers to smoke onecigarette one cigaretteand they then measured what effect thathad on their blood vessels and theyfound that um you could see the remnantsof of destroyed and dead endothelialcells you could measure that so they'recalled micro particles it's thebreakdown products of endothelial cellsso smoking one cigarettestrips off a number quite a lot I don'tknow how many of endothelial cells inyour blood vesselsat the same time the repair systems kickin and the repair systems consist ofproducing more endothelial cells in thebone marrowpre-endothelial cells that float aroundfind the area of damage cover it overover each area of damage you must havedeveloped a blood clot because if you ifyou strip off the um one end of Theodoreprobably more than one endothelial cellif you strip off endothelial cells itexposes the artery wall to thebloodstream and sitting within theartery wall art is a stuff called tissuefactor and tissue factors like bloodclot you will blood clot now so themoment you expose the artery wall or anyblood vessel wall to the bloodstream ablood clot will form that's an absoluteand and Studies have Sean and Shonaso why doesn't cigarette smoking causeyou to instantly die of heart diseasewith blood clots forming everywhere theanswer is they're very small blood clotsthe repair systems kick in and mostlyeverything is cleared uphoweveras you get older and European systemsstart to fall to bits or you're smokingmore and more and you do other thingsthat damage your artery walls as wellthe the rate of damage is greater thanthe rate of repair and this is how Ikind of explain to people it's a bitlike having a road that you don't everrepair so you get pothole you getanother pothole and eventually you justhave a road of potholes so the repairsystems have to come along and get ridof these areas of damage which they do agood job of but it comes a point wherethey can't do enough repairand this is the reason why plaques onlyhappen in arteries because arteries havea blood pressure of say on average 100millimeters of mercury which is a veryArcane way of measuring blood pressurehow much mercury gets pushed up a tubeanother pressure on your arm your veinsit's about a 30th of that so the bloodpressure is very low so the amount ofbiomechanical stresses on an endothelialcellthen the arteries is very high and inthe in the veins it's very low and weknow that to an extent we already knowthis is the case because if you take avein from the leg and use it as a as abypass in the in in the heartso you do a coronary artery bypass thesebypasses block up very quickly withfaster sclerosis like within six toseven years or faster than thatsometimesso it's not that plaques can't form inveins because we know that they can formin base what you have to do though isturn the vein into an artery and themoment you turn a vein into an arteryyou start to getatherosclerotic plaques developing sothe cholesterol level is exactly thesame the LDL so everything is the sameit's at the blood pressureand you can get blood blood clots in theyou can get plaques in the lungs and thecommonest causes of that you've got ahole in your heart and the blood goesfrom the right side to the left side bymistake pressure in the right side ishigh and the pressure in your lungs isincreased usually and people with thiscondition provides in mind your syndromeare quite likely to developatherosclerotic plaques in their lungsso there's nothing structurally or orbiochemically different from the lungsand the veins and the arteries it'spurely the amount of biomechanicalstress that they are under so you can doanything you likeyou can smoke and have a blood sugarlevel through the roof and denied youain't gonna get plaques in your veins itdoesn't happenso what's the difference the differenceis the blood pressure why is the bloodpressure different because obviouslythere's an awful lot more stress Isometimes liking it to a vein is a bitlikewhen the Nile reaches the Nile Delta andit's moving the river is moving veryslowly and and sluggishly whereas if youif you go up well probably not the Nilebut if you go out streaming most of themyou reach a point where you've got whitewater tumbling through the rocks and thebiomechanical stresses much higher soyou need that biomechanical stress ornothing is going to happenwhat sort of things then add furtherdamage to your arteries well we knowthat smoking can do it we know thathaving a raised blood pressure canobviously do itwe know that having a raised blood sugarlevel in diabetes can do it and why doesthat happen becauseshortest explanation the high levels ofsugar damage there's another layer upabove the endothelial cells thatprotects the endothelial cells andthat's probably glycocalis 99 of doctorshave never heard of the glycake theydon't know that it exists but it's agigantically important part of yourcardiovascular system and if you havediabetes they glycogelics which is likea forest this thick becomes aforestistic and therefore theendothelial cells are much more prone todamagewhat other things can cause it wellinterestingly sovirus can damage the endothelial cellsso in fact I was writing a chapter inthe book on viral infections increasingthe risk of heart disease when SARS Cove2 came along and what they found ispeople with diabetes in fact what theyfound was that people were getting a lotof the blood clots and were dying ofblood clots and that was the thing thatwas killing most people rather than theinfection in their lungs and no oneseemed to be able to understandhow a viral infection could cause bloodclots and heart attacks and strokes EtcI said well this is very simple whathappens is the sun virusgets into cells using a receptor of theH2 receptor it doesn't really matter butit's to do with these two receptors havean influence on blood vessel tighteningcontrol etc etcif you don't have an aceto receptor thevirus can't get into the cell it cannotbe an entry and and the highestconcentration of H2 receptors are a inthe lungs and B in the in their bloodvesselsso the soloscope 2 is getting intoendothelial cells around the body it'sgrowing inside them it multiplies insidethem it bursts out and it kills theendothelial cells well once you startblowing up endothelial cells around yourbodyyou're going to get blood clots formingrapidly all around your body those bloodclots can become severe enough to causeheart attacks and strokes there'sanother condition I was actually writingabout what's called Kawasaki's diseasewhich you've never heard of or you mayhave heard of and Kawasaki's disease isa disease whereby you get a vasculitisin other words inflammation in yourblood vessels mainly in childrenprobably viral although no one's everidentified what the viral whereas mightbe now in Kawasaki's disease you get avasculitisand you get again you get blood clottingand in vasculitis you get severe damageto your arteries as well such that inthis six to ten years followingKawasaki's disease your risk of dying ofheart attack and that you have quite alow risk at this age is increased 54 50times times 50.so I was looking at this and thencyroscope too came along and I said wellwhat we're looking at here is is exactlythe same thing it says the vasculitisthe endothelial cells have been damagedyou're getting blood clots you'regetting heart attacks you're gettingStrokesbig surprise made worse if you've gotdiabetes because of diabetes the raisedblood sugar level damages your arteriesso so the hypothesis begins to makesense if you like from that point ofview and you can look at all sorts ofthings where you say well how does thiscause how does that cause Okay one ofthe one of the the commonest reasons foryoung men having premature heart diseaseplaques and heart attacks is usingcocaineand the reason why cocaine well is thisquestion is if you snort became the theseptum in your nose disintegrates andfalls out that's one of the things thatpeople know about it so you'll ask thequestions why does the septum of yournose disintegrate when you take cocaineit's because it causes an enormouslypotent damage to your blood vessels andvasculitis if you like in the bloodvessels in your nose so your nose septumdies and falls out so you say well it'sdoing that to your nose imagine whatit's doing to your arteries around yourheart well it does it causes this damageand inflammation to your blood vesselsin your heart and everywhere else aroundyour body and the risk if you the riskof dying of a heart attack within onehour of taking cocaine has increased 30fold versus versus other people andyoung male and female presumably aren'trelated so much cocaine users have gotsevere atherosclerosis all around thebody despite having no other riskfactors so you say to people well wellokay let's think about sarscope to youbut Kawasaki's disease you've gotcocaine use you've got diabetes you'vegot raised blood pressure you've got allthe things that we know re- increase therisk of heart disease and they all haveone thing in common one thing in commonwhich is that they damage theendothelial cells in especially in yourarteriesbecause they're under extreme stress andthen you have the you have the bloodvess the blood clot forms and then theblood clots absorbed into the arterywall and then because it's happeningrapidly there's no time for this torecover before the next blood clot comesalong then a plaque begins to form andgrow and thicken and that is what heartdisease is it's all the same processdoes that make sense to youvery much so yes absolutely I think itmakes a lot more sense good bad bad goodcholesterol having an insane dance withone another which you know can onlymagically be fixed by the world's mostprofitable drug coincidentally it usedto be when the new drugs coming alonginjectables pcsk9sthat stops the LDL receptors from beingrecycled and it just allows the receptorand cells to be sent back to the surfaceso they pull more LDL out of thebloodstream and the LDL level drops morethan with statins the only slight wellthere's two problems with them one isthey haven't been found to reduceoverall mortality or cardiovascularmetallics the other problem with them isthey cost about 100 times as much asStatin my calculation on pcsk 9Inhibitors which no one's ever heard ofbut don't worry they're being usedis that if everybody in the UK swap fromtaking a Statin to a pcsk 9 inhibitor itwould cost90 billion pounds a yearand that is the UK alone so that wouldbeum five six so the entire cost of theNHSspent on one medication that doesabsolutely no good to anybody but therewe are so uh yes the idea is that I'vesuggested here are not newthey've been around for 150 years thathave pushed quite hard by various peopleover the years just no one's ever heardof themand it sounds you know when I say topeople they say the sense ofpreposterous and I go well give me achance I'll explain it to you you willunderstand it I said give me a risk giveme something I happen to be looking atthat you may have heard of the SLE lupusuh you know if you've heard of itand so it's a condition that's quiterare but it affects them women more thanmen and women with lupus young womenwith lupus have an increased risk ofdying of cardiovascular disease which isthis is almost my favorite although it'sa bizarre thing to be your favoritestatistic have an increased risk ofcardiovascular disease of five thousandpercentfive thousand percent that figure isless scary than you might think becauseyoung women don't have a huge risk ofheart disease so five thousand percentincrease doesn't mean they're all goingto die within the next three weeksbut that that when you've got a riskthat is that high I mean if you look atthe I mean I've gone back in history andlooked at you know what what is theincreased risk of having a high LDLleveland and even even the most sort ofpositive papers are coming up with anincreased risk of 15 percentor 12 so this is just nothing you know Ican find your condition raises your riskof heart disease by five thousandpercent when you're looking at a risklike that you know you're looking atcauses I mean real proper causes notpretend courses so if you can't explainwhy this is SLE systemically personalitymitosis increases the risk of heartdisease by five thousand percent when ithas no effects on LDL or or any of yourother standard risk factors you don'thave an explanation do you you havesomething here this is a this is this isthe sun rotating five thousand times aday from the Westyou've got to explain stuff like this oryou don't have an explanation and theycan't and they don't and they just sortof ignore it this is you know where theParadox comes in or credentials you knowwell my potentials are bigger than yoursso what do you know oh yeah well they'rejust going to go well it's uh well it'sI've never heard an explanation no one'sever come up with one but theexplanation is if you say it's due toblood clots then the explanation is likebeep very easyis associated with a real high risk ofwhat we call vasculitis inflammation anddamage to your blood vesselsthat's what it is it's primarily it'snot very much primarily of vasculitisand yet no one looks at this and you gowell yes the explanation is steering youin the face you cannot surely and if youhave got a better explanation come upwith it tell me what it istell me what is it no in fact there'sone condition that has a higher risk ofcardiovascular diseasein percentage termsthan SLE and that is that is a sicklecell disease and sickle cell disease inyoung people all right has increasedrisk of 50000 percent50000 percentthat was one study but I'm I'm goingwith that because I like itand you say well now if you cannotexplain why a disease increases the riskof cardiovascular disease by 50000 if you have not even a hypothesisthat remotely you can even point to andgo I wish they don'tthen you you are just talking nonsenseyou know here's an absolute beat causeyou won't get a bigger risk than thisthere is no bigger risk than this I'vestudied heart disease for 40 yearsthis is it this is the number oneabsolutely the mostbeing hugely increased with you childrenused to Die four and five and six areheart attacks with sickle cell becausethey get transfusions now and andalterations and people are now gettingum genetic treatment to reduce the thedamage of a Sickle Cell by the way isyou know it looks like a sickle problemit's like a crescent moon so a red bloodcell supposed to be circular and squidgyand a sickled cell is is shaped like asickle and if you've got a lot of thesecells it's very bad news and you can saywell how does sickle cell disease causecardiovascular disease in fact I waslooking at Paper 20 years ago I just wasinterested in thisand I didn't dawn on me then I'm sayingwell if you've got a round squeegee rareblood cell going through your bloodvesselsis probably not going to do much damagebut if you have a very sharppointyrigid red blood cell battering throughyour arteries then it's going to becrushing up against the lining theArches and stripping It Off day afterdaysurprise surprise and it was it was acase history of a 12 year old boy whowas taken into hospital with gangrene ofhis foot so how's he got gangreneur'sfoot in fact they had to amputatebecause the blood supply in his lowerleg was so poorer like he couldn'tsustain the foot it just died basicallyand then they did some scans on him andfound that every single artery in hisbody was riddled it was what they calledcalcified atherosclerosis uh that's thesort of thing you might see in an 85 or90 year old that level of calcifiedcalcification happens after damageshappen to the body that's one of thethings the body does with damage itcalcifies itso this 12 year old boy now his brotherdied age five of a stroke because he hadsickle cell as well and every singleartery in his body was riddled with withplaques and atherosclerosis no otherrisk factors nothingand they say well well here's anexplanation yes and the people who didthis case study actually said the reasonwhy is because of the rigidSickle cells in his bloodstream damaginghis archery walls and causingatherosclerosis they wrote that 20 yearsagoandI didn't read the paper properly at thetime but I went back to ityou know you've seen it you know what'shappening here you know exactly what'shappening here why didn't you make anymore noise why didn't you jump up anddown and go hey guyswe have the answer because thecholesterol hypothesis he is so powerfulthat no one dares to saywe know something completely differentnow we've seen it we we've writtenpapers about this this is this is thething right SLE this is the thingcondition called Hughes diseaseantiphospholipid syndrome there's acondition called anti-phospholipidsyndrome your cell membranes areprimarily made of phospholipidswhich is basically two layers of lipidsthat join together and they're calledphospholipids because of phosphorphosphate and a lipid antiphospholipidsyndrome is where the body decides toattack phospholipids which is obviouslynot a good idea because every cell inyour body's made phospholipidsand so anti-phospholipid syndrome isactually closely associated withsystemic lymphocytosis as wellso what happens is the immune systemstarts attackingand cellular cells it starts damagingthem and and people with s this HuesyndromeEPS antivascular lipid syndromethey die young of heart attacks andstrokes the risk is gigantic althoughabout about one in 200 people haveantiphospholipid syndrome is is reckonedto account for 50 percentof all strokes and under 50 age group50 one and two and I was having a shortwhen you're 40 or 30 years I meancomplete disasterand so we were having another exampleand this is well known by mainstream butthey know ABS exists they know Houstonor exists they know that this happensand yet they will not make theconnection and say well what links thattogether with SLE ordisease ordiabetes or having gum infection youknow having having a gum infectionsprolonged gum infections increases yourrisk of heart disease usuallyeven the American Heart Associationwhich is the most cholesterol or Centricgroup in the world says it does itdoesn't give an explanation for itthey said well how can having disease inyour gumscause atherosclerosis again they don'task these questions they just they justsay it does you go well here's theexplanation and the explanation is thatif you have bacteria in your bloodstreamwhich you will have if you have gumdisease periodontitisbecause bacteria their their wasteproduct is called a toxins called anexotoxin right so EXO being out with andtoxinexotoxins float around in thebloodstream and the place that theyattack and damage is your endothelialcells that's what they do so clearly wehave yet another easily explained by ifyou damage the endothelium and you causeblood clots you get heart diseasethis is like well where's your otherexplanation we don't have oneit's just a fact so so they're saying isin the end about medicine is that it itdoesn't matter what your hypothesis isdo the facts fit does the evidence fitso this alternative explanation is itwell we're all in fact actually youcan't find a fact it doesn't fitand it explains it in this way but ifyou are stuck with the cholesterolhypothesis you just can't believe it youcan't believe it because that meanswe got one or the other could youexplain if you're if you accept thisthis is wrong rightthat's itso if if we accept your theory and Imust confess I mean I find it extremelycompelling I find it far more compellingthan diet heart hypothesis and thecholesterol LDL story so if we acceptthis what are the implications how doyou protect yourself from heart diseasethen you don't smoke obviouslyif what are the comedy you know on whatthey call a population level what arethe Communist causes of heart diseaseprobably having a raise blood sugarlevel or diabetes is possibly yournumber one so you should probably avoidat that point eating carbohydrates andstart eating a high fat diet becausethen your blood sugar level will dropand you may even reverse your type 2diabetes and again the problem with thecholesterol hypothesis is the diethypothesis is all linked together soit's like you eat saturated fat itraises your cholesterol you die privacyso if you then come along and say wellno part of that is correct but howeverwhat you should be doing is eatingexaggerated fat then you're attackingthe whole hypothesis right at its veryroot so you start that and everyone justgoes shut up so you eat a high fat dietand that will protect yourcardiovascular system if you havediabetes type 2 diabetesyou exercise because that actually hasvery beneficial effects on oncardiovascular health the health of yourendothelial cells Etcone of the ones another might great sortof contradiction ones as you go out andyou get sunlight becauseSunshine increases a substance callednitric oxide and nitric oxide is thesingle most potent endothelialstrengthening and health healthy if youlike substance in the body nitric oxideis is like the magic moleculeon sunlight increases nitric oxidesynthesis it does all sorts of otherthings as well Sunshine is incrediblybeneficial to peoplewe're advised to stay out of the Sun butthe study done in in Swedenlooked at women who sunbathed a lot withfive minute quintiles Are there womenare somebody a lot women in some waysquite a lot women in somebody made anaverage amount and towards women whoeffectively avoided the Sunand what they found was that um is thatwomen who avoided the sun had a risk ofpremature early mortality or increasedmortalitywhich was equivalent to if they hadsmoked 20 cigarettes a dayso avoiding the sun in this studywas just the most damaging thing thatyou could do to yourselfand yet we are told again and again tostay out of the sun it is another of thenonsense things but it's in my opiniongo out walk in the Sun get outside thesethings all are very beneficial to yourcardiovascular system unfortunately Ican't I have no patented wonderfulmagical device there of anything thatdoes this it's all like basic stuff berelaxed because obviously if you arestressedonce you trigger your stress system thisdoes all sorts of long-term damagingthings to your cardiovascular systempersonally I think negative chronicstress strain is is the single mostdamaging thing for your cardiovascularsystem the people in the world who arethe most stressed or under strained arepeople with schizophrenia they arehugely they are so stressed that you canactually measure changes in their brainin their in their stress system thereason why they died while they diedthey'd commit suicide obviously which isone one example of how stress they arebut they after that they basically justdie of cardiovascular diseaseand that's true of people who havebipolar disorder it's true of anyone whohas any serious medical mental healthissuesPTSD for instancea huge increase in the risk ofcardiovascular disease anxietydepression in fact is this is somethingI tell people they never believe thathappens to be true because if you becomeseverely depressed really very badlydepressed you can also you can becomediabeticcan actually cause type 2 diabetesand there was a condition in the firstworld war where they looked at men who'dgot what we would now probably call PTSDand they found that they actuallyin this condition these men wouldactually show sugar in their urine theywould become what are called glycosuriathey were developed like assuria due tomental stressso because the hormones underlyingnervous system changes are directlyantagonistic directly antagonistic to uhto insulinin many sites so if you raise the stresshormone levels and then trigger theneural hormonal system you will becomeyou can become diabeticsomeone had a question about stress Ithink we're asking that questionyes Peter wanted to ask you about stressyeah one of the things I found veryinteresting Malcolm in your book was inthe Final Chapter you talked about thisissue of stress but then you outlineddifferent categories of stress andexplained that there are certain kindsof activity like having a disagreeableboss that are bad for your health and astressful but other kinds of stress likepassing an exam and succeeding those aregood for your health so I just wonder ifyou could explain to us what thea physiological mechanism is throughwhich those kinds of stress havedifferent impacts on the body yesit's it I say it's quite it'scomplicated I think that that I wouldbrace it down as if you have a form ofstress that you can control to a degreethen it's not getting at you all thetime so if you have say a bullying boxit's something that's just thereconstantly chronically all the time younever can get rid of it if you'restudying for an exam for example andthen there's a sense of achievement atthe end of it so it has a death definedendpoint if you're constantly studyingfor an exam and you never passed it itwould be the same sort of stress as asif you like having the bullying bosssyndrome so it's The Chronic negativestress it's almost like an attitude ofMind as much as anything else they usedat some point Prime ministerial stressversus violence stress the PrimeMinister can be under a hugely stressfulsituation but they also feel at somepoint you can say I found enough of someI'm going to the pub or I'm going outfor what they they are in control itappears to be a loss of control soyou're in a situation where you cannotcontrol itand you can't get out of it is isterribly damaging you can be under whatthey call different stresses taking partin the exam or standing up giving a talkthese things are things you can say I'mnot going to do that I don't want to dothat so when you feel compelled andunable to stop it stressed which is toan extent when I say economic stressesstressors like being not having enoughmoney to pay for stuff there was a studyin South Africa which that men who areunder Financial stress were 13 timesmore likely to have a heart attack inthe next I think it was four yearsso Financial stress is chronic it nevergoes away stress so I think thedifference is not that there isnecessarily a difference I think it'sjust can you stop it can you switch itoff can you get away from which is why Ithink things like exercise are goodbecause it raises up yourstress system and then it then it dropsback down again so exercise can help tocontrolbut what's happening within your stresssystem you know the worst form ofchronic stress physiologically is isactually having a having a tumor in inyour adrenal bias where you get a thingcalled Cushing's disease so it overproduces cortisol continuouslyand this is absolutely disastrous forcardiovascular health it makes youbecome diabetic blah blah blah so it's Ithink it's a constant continuousness ofit the trappedness of it rather than theactual stress itself necessarily becausethat make sense yeah yeah that makessense I also heard that if you're in astressful situation then your amygdalais active all the time and that canchange your brain such that the amygdalakind of is permanently damaged it'spermanently turned onto this act ofstate is there any truth to that it'svery complex stuff and I know someonewho's done a lot of research in this butpeople with what they call PTSDwhat appears to happen is there isactually structural changes in yourbrain such that so so saymaybe simplify it you're in the Army andyou're in a in a in a truck and thenthere's a sound of someone shoutingsomething on a dog barks or whatever andthen the truck blows up your your leftis a survivor or your brain then becomesUltra sensitized to that danger so a dogbarks someone slams a door and you'relike that and that seems to be because alot of the brain has actually changedits structure you can see the strain thethe structural changes so you're lessable to cope with things that otherpeople would cope with so if you look atthat from children who are abusedphysically or sexually when they'reyounger have structural changes in theirbrain and they are unable to deal withstresses in the same way thatothers can if you like so the thing thatyou or I would so classically if you'resexually abused a lot of people can'tstand then to be touched in a certainwayand if they've touched it creates aterrifically powerful kind of negativereaction in them and that triggers thewhole system off so so such people areare super sensitized and there arestructural differences you can seestructural differences in the brains ofschizophrenia it's really quite majorand significant increases in the volumeof certain parts of the brain anddecreases in others so it's it's thereit's real it's but it can be seen realin physical changes which way round thathappens for sure is is not entirelycertain but those changes are there andonce they're thereyou kind of governmentthank you yes so I'm wondering when itcomes to this damage so you mentionedthis kind of things that create thisdamage is this reversible or do youthink it's just a one-way Street ifyou've been eating garbage for 30 yearsof your life you've obviouslyaccumulated a lot of damage will fixingyour ways mend things or does that workonly when you're young or what do youthink yeah well put it another wayaround is that um I think you can youcan stop the damage you can't you knowif you've got what you call a calcifiedatherosclerotic plaque in your car inyour arteries in your heart there's verylittle evidence that that will ever goaway once it's there it's there howeverthe important thing is to stop itprogressing there's a lot of work onwhat they call CAC coronary arterycalcification scans where you scan theart and look how much calcium there isin the arteries that's a sign of youlike past damage that past damageI have seen little evidence that you canever reduce it what you can do howeveris you can do things to stop it and ifyou're stopping it then the risk yourrisk can become equivalent to to anybodyelse of your age it's more that it'sprogressing or not progressing so canyou reverse plaque damagenot reallycan you stop like damage from increasingyes and if you do that it's just aboutit's just about as good I mean lookingat another way they looked at Maasaivillagers in Kenya going back to the1960s and 70s they hadnone or very low rate of death fromcardiovascular diseaseand then they looked at their arteriesand found it was actually quite a lot ofcalcium batteries they were not theywere not perfect arteries completelyclear they had this calcification butbut they didn't die of cardiovasculardisease so theyit depends there's some other factorsgoing on here if you you can get if youlikealterations and if you do very heavyexercise very heavy exercises ultramarathon runners Etc have got prettyknackered coronary arteries when youlook at them but then they are also thenthere are also not likely to die ofcardiovascular disease so they'regetting this damage but other things areprotected it does not reverse but aslong as you're doing all the otherthings right it's less of an issue it'sthe final thing that will kill you isthe final blood clot the one that blocksthe artery completely bang rightand you can get areas of damage buildingup and building up and building up butas long as you don't get that secondarysituation which is the bigger one comesalong it completely blocks the arteryyou're not going to have the majorproblems of other people so this is umit's a complicated area but it won't itwon't reverse classified blacks in yourarteries but you can stop them growingand you can stop them causing you healthproblems okay that's good well I meankind of good I guess but uhwe're all gonna die mateyeah that's not that one that's not thatone ever happening but what you want youcan reduce risk reduce risk reduce risksyes these are there are beneficialthings to doI mean looking at ways of measuringglycocalyx Health which is obviouslypotentially much more immediate way ofsaying because if you do a calcium Scarand to an extent you've got to wait on ayear before you do another one otherwiseyou're not going to see any meaningfuldifference in it you don't really knowif you're doing the right things or notright awaywhereas you can measure the glycolicsthis Forest of glycoproteins thatprotects the protects the endotheliumbeneath you can measure this it can bemeasured it can be measured in real timeand in fact it is still in a kind ofresearch phase for most peopleyou get a device you stick it under thetongue it looks at the very small bloodvessels the capillaries it looks at thespeed that red blood cells go through itlooks at the thickness of the glycocalyxand it's used in uh in sepsis monitoringnow sepsis as you may know as we getblood infection a bacteria gets intoyour bloodstream and when that happensthe bacteria release toxins exotoxinsinto your bloodstream they damage theblood vesselsit causes blood clotting all around yourbody it's called disseminatedintravascular coagulation that's thething that kills youyou can monitor the thickness of theglycocalyx and if you have a thickerlike you are more likely to survive thethinner your glycogelics is the lesslikely you are to survive and if it's ifit's thinning down on you it's a reallybad sign sothe research evidence is not hasn't beenlong enough and enough people to look atbut I do believe that if you measure theglycocalyx and you can see it thickeningand improving then then you're doinggood things I mean even in a very shortterm if you give someone a glucose drinkand the blood sugar level goes up youcan see in real time the glycopicsshrinkingand then afterwards it comes back upagain it repairs it's it can repairitselfquite quickly so I think that this ispotentially where the most interestingresearch is going to be is measuring inreal time the health of your glycolicsbecause if that is healthy yourendothelium is being protected andthings are going well if that's thinnedyou're in potential trouble so so Ithink that that will be a veryinteresting areaand what do you think about fasting doyou think fasting can protect or improveI do think fasting is a good idea if inthat we have togive our body a chance to reset and Ithink one of the big problems we have ispeople eating all the time what do youthink people were actually told to snackregularly wasn't at one time I don'tknow if this is stillwild advice but actually yes we are Ithink we're physiologically designedprobably because we couldn't find enoughfood in the past at times to stop and Ithink it does help to reset thingsobviously your blood sugar level will godown you'll not be in a constantly fedstroke over a Fed state so yourphysiology has a chance to get itselfinto a better shape so I think you knowthe idea of whether you have to havelike a five-day faster or 2D fast orwhatever or whether you just have youyou eat at eight o'clock at night thenyou don't eat anything untilsix o'clock the next evening or whateverI can't see the dataclearly enough to say that one isdefinitely superior to the other but Iwould definitely recommend havingperiods during the day where you don'teat yeah let's get back to statins thenwhat is this assessment of statins Iknow you're a big fanjoking no well no well I mean what I sayto people is they have shown somebenefits and what they call secondarypreventionsecondary prevention means you'vealready had a heart attack or a strokeor a diagnosed heart disease in otherwords basically you're high risk thebenefits in primary prevention andotherwise you don't havepre-existing heart disease arevanishingly small really such that Ipersonally don't think they're worth itI think that that you know a lot of theStudies have shown really no in primaryprevention there was a bunch of studiesthat came out that showed there was somereduction in cardiovascular diseasedeath sort of maybe but no one had evershown there was any benefit an overallmortality which is the main reason whyyou want to take a drug is it going toactually make you live any longerbecause otherwise what's the point sothe primary prevention studies that showno benefit until there was one that cameout in 2008 or the Jupiter studywhich was a really reallydodgy study in my opinion in that thereduction in overall mortality wasactually in cancer mortality in thestaticand that's what pushed the overallmortality benefits into statisticalsignificance there's no benefit oncardiovascular mortalityno other study has ever showncancer benefit from taking status sowhen you get one study showing this youshouldn't at that point say ah it worksyou go well actually you know this isnot somerising in the west this is this isactually a you know the problem withstatistical significance in clinicaltrials isyou can have five deaths in 20 000people and it will trigger it over thismagical statistically significant Targetas we all know you can throw you couldtoss a coin 20 times and it could comeup heads every time that can happenso when you get2012 showing nothing in one trialshowing something what you say is well Ithink I'll go with the 19 that showednothing and I'll ignore the 20th oneunless we get another 2012 showing somebenefit no other benefits shown so Iwould say in primary prevention thebenefit is slightto potentially non-existent andsecondary prevention there is somebenefit is it significant enoughI mean I've written a lot and I'vewritten papers and I've written peopleother people talking about thedifference between between relative andabsolute risk which no one can everunderstand but in clinical trials theylook at relative risks so the relativerisk can can say there's a 20 reductionin in the risk of heart disease if youtake a Statin for five years blah blahand that sounds quite impressive or itcould be 30 sometimes but actuallywhat's the difference in real terms inabsolute termswhat we're talking aboutin general is a maximum of a reductionof about one percent in absolutemortality over five years in in theclinical studieswe say well how can a one percentdifference be presented as a 30difference well what what's thedifference between 1 and 1.5 iswhatever it is off the top man 30approximatelyso if if 1.5 percent of people die inthe placebo worm at one percent ofpeople die in the Statin arm that's a 30difference in mortality relative 30chance the absolute difference is pointfive percentand yet the 30 difference is the onethat they trumpet the point five percentthey keep completely silent to that butthe point five percent is is all thatmatters someone said if you don't knowwhat the absolute difference is therelative difference in Risk ismeaninglessso if you have something that kills 50of people and you reduce the risk by 30that's pretty significant if you havesomebody that kills one in ten thousandpeopleand it reduces it by two you know a oneso it's reduced it from one in tenthousand to you knowto twenty thousand well that can bepresented as a fifty percent Improvementor a one in ten thousand percentImprovement so that's basically noisewell it is noise you know and that's thelevel that we're at with these trucksyou know I I sometimes see people say ohthis study was too small to proveanything my counter argument is alwaysif you need a study with 40 000 peoplein either arm the effect you're lookingfor is clearly still small butclinically it is utterly insignificantyeah and like with with large data setsI mean you you'll get noise either wayso you just need to run the data twiceand you'll get one that shows you apositive effect one that shows you anegative effect you know it's noise it'sgonna go either way and then you justreport the one that shows the effectthat you want well the other thing thathappened is that in Trials was that umup to the year 2000 and four or fivebasically if you're going to run a trialyou didn't need to you didn't need tosay how many people were on either sideof it what what were the outcomes youwere looking for or really anything youjust went yeah it's been successfulafter 2005 you had to say these are thestatistical things we're looking atthese are the outcomes we're looking atthis is what we're trying to do andhere's the trial protocol is set out andyou can see it on clinicaltrials.gov youstill don't show the raw data we justhave to take the pharmaceuticalcompany's own word for it wellabsolutely and yeah that opens itanother gigantic kind of worms I meanI'm gonna there is one organization inthe world called in Oxford that saysthey have all the raw data we have ityou can't see it no one else is allowedto look at it by the way we say thatstatins are wonderful so can I have alook at you later nope you can't see thetowers I mean that is the again theopposite of science isn't it I meanvalidation is absolutely key and thesepeople won't let anybody else see thedata on started it's just ridiculousit's completely inexcusable and thefacade they put around it that oh it hasto be viewed by the experts and it needsto be peer-reviewed and all that stuffit's all just so that they could youknow have the freedom to treat the dataas they like it's translated I mean youmay have heard of the Cochranecollaboration or you may not have thething yeah whilst they're not perfectthey are at least free from commercialEnterprises and the Cochranecollaboration under John Wright senttried to send a researcher to Oxford tolook at the data on adverse effects andbasically you know at all we're notgoing to show it to you get stuff offyou goI mean I mean if you go if you want toshow it to the corporate collaborationit's it's likeit yeah it it is it is again this is thedeal it's a different way it's theopposite sides we won't let anybody elsesee what we're doing but we're going totell you what we've found you know youcan't look at it yourselves because whatbecause what you know it's commerciallysensitive and we can't be commerciallysensitive because there's not a singlestatic that remains impatient thesedrugs are way off people now so so whyare you still keeping this data you knowfrom everybody well like the reason iseither there's only one group of peoplewho've got big enough brain tounderstand itor you're hiding yes I think Ibelieve number two you know I'll go fornumber two you're hiding if peoplearen't smart enough to understand thisyou know give them the data and let themfigure out uh on their own that they'renot smart enough to understand thatthere's no reason why you should hide itfrom them unless you have something tohide exactlywhy why would you be hiding somethingunless you've got something to hide isthe answer is it you know and then thehide behind us you know why don't youjust say to the pharmaceutical companiesguyspravastatin was launched in 1987. youknow and the patent ran out into I think2001 21 years late we can't see any ofthe data from any of the clinical trialsthis is this is it's almost unbelievableyou know I just didn't think how canthis not be causing people to bestorming Parliament with pitchforks andyou know burning torches we must see thedata but no one seems to be remotelyconcerned about it so if the patent hasrun out so this would make a lot moresense if the drugs were still on thepath because there's a lot of money tobe made but if the pattern was run outthen anyone can manufacture themgenerically and they do and they dothere's no there's no Statin leftabout seven years ago why is it such auh sacred cow of uh modern medicine thatthey need to keep giving it to you ifthey can't even make money off of itwell well the answer iseither either it's because there's someexplanation to do with something orother or they're hidings yeahI guess it's to hide the fact thatthey've made a lot of money when thescientific evidence did not suggest thatthis was uh well there's another longerslightly more complicated explanationwhich is the one I'm currently going onis that if you show that if the datashows that actually they didn't reallywork or or that theythe reduction in LDL was nothing to dowith any benefit they caused that theydo make a lot of money now out of thelatest generation of cholesterollowering agents now if you look at theStatin data and say well actually thisdisproves we there are those of us whothink the data actually disproves thelbl hypothesisno I'm not going to go into that in anyway detail now if you disprove the LDLhypothesis by looking at the data thenall the all of all of the rationale forthe the latest more expensive LDLlowering agents also diesso if you if you attack stat and youattack the entire hypothesis and theentire hypothesis continues to sustainan enormously profitable industry on theback of it so so you can understand whythey fight so hardto do to keep it secret even now is myexplanation for it absolutely wrong onthat but that's what I thinknow so so that so much for theeffectiveness what about the negativeside effects of statins do you thinkthey're really serious I think they canbe very serious I did a a review of wasa study they call it the nocebo effectwhich is the opposite of the placeboeffect and then I would say that no oneactually has any adverse effects instatins it's just because they imaginethey are better they are getting theadverse effects and therefore they don'tactually have any adverse effects that'sthat'sthe nose evil effect I thought well thefirst is true then it means that nodrunk has ever had a negative effect inthe history of medicine becauseeveryone's just imagining everythingI said well why isn't the placebo effectwhich we know exists why doesn't thatcounteract of the nocebo effect andwhatever is left is actually doing soyou've got of course nobody knows whatthe placebo effect is because it's neverbeen measured don't know whether itexists or not I say this is this is oneof my other my other controversies andwhatever the placebo effect we shouldsurely know by now what the placeboeffect is since we've done all thesehundreds of Trials it should have beenquite clear if there is an effect howbig it is and then we could we could wecould control for this in furtherstudies and forget using placebosbecause we know all the adverse effectsof placebos can cause we ask 500questions of people in clinical trialshad headachesdo you sneeze more do you go to thetoilet more have you had stomachacheblah blah blah they ask hundreds ofquestionsall the I don't know if they're all thesame questions I don't know I don't knowif they have the same questions but butby now we should know that when you givesomebody a placebo three percent of themget stomach problems five percent ofthem get a headache eight percent ofthem I don't know get depressed thosethese data should be consistent forPlacebo useone of the reasons that isn't consistentis because we don't know what goes intoplacebosand this is something most people don'teven are blissfully unaware of is thatthere is no requirement and no one doestell you what's in a placebothat's supposed to be an inert pillbut but it's actually Sugarwell it's not sugar it's completelydifferent thingwith sugar right well that's what you'retold rightwell Sugar's nasty enough well it is butit's not going to cause you to to sayI've got a stomach aching a horrible you know I'm not I'm not so sureactually this is something I've alwaysbeen a little bit skeptical about I I amI'm a carnivore I eat only meat Ihaven't had uh sugar practically inseven years I eat meat I drink water soI'm very very sensitive to sugar if Ihad a tiny small pill of sugar which formost people is undetectable because theyeat large quantities of sugar every dayand like all their food is heavily lacedwith sugars that's considered you knowyeah you could think of it as a placeboand they think that it doesn't affectthem but I can feel if I had a tinylittle amount of sugar I will feel itand it will get me triggered it willtrigger the sugar uh addiction cyclewherein you know you get a high and thenyou get a low and then you want moresugar and so I wonder if a big part ofthe reason that drugs do well in Trialsis that the Alternatives you knowthey're being measured against theplacebo that is essentially highlyaddictive and toxic to human beingswhich is sugar even if we take it invery small doses it's still helping youget into the sugar addiction mode makingyou it likely contributes you know eventhough it itself might be a tiny littleaddition to your sugar consumption itlikely helps you eat a little bit morebecause it adds more sugar to you I'mgoing to give you another explanationwhich I know to be true they prove quitenoxious substances into placebos inorder to mimic the noxious effects ofthe medicationsinteresting so they they do that andthen they one of the HPV studies theydeliberately put quite horrible stuffinto the placebo and they said thatthat's still it didn't interfere withwith the the reporting of the studywe don't know what's in Placebo is butwhere it has been reported and where youare able to find outit sure is Helen and then or a sugarfilm is there's all sorts of thingsgoing to Placebo we don't know what theeffect of the team was isummoving that to one side they also willhave clinical trials one of the biggestin statins was called the HBS study doneby the Oxford Group where they had aprolonged running period of about fourweeks where they gave people medicationand people couldn't tolerate themedication were removed from the trialand at the end of it they said we foundabout you know total number of adverseeffects was about six percent but 35percent of people were removed from thestudy after taking the medication forthe first four weeksI'm sorry so we have a running periodwhat does that mean does that so how ifyou're going to remove people from thestarting point you then have to removethe same number of people from theplacebo part so anyone in the startingside that was getting adverse effectswould just removed from the study yeahso the games that are played are quiteextraordinary I mean I know from my Imean it amuses me sometimes I'm not agreat fan of a newspaper called TheDaily Mail which isquite um some quite astonishing stuff init sometimes but whenever they do astudy on statins what you get is about athousand people saying well I took aStatin and I got terrible pain and whenI stopped taking the pain right awayand what these people are saying isbasically well you don't you didn'tactually have that thing you justthought you had the pain um and that'sjust nonsense I mean I've seen people Iremember seeing one lady here well acouple of they say anecdotes are ourdata in my opinion we had a lady in theunit which is looking after elderlyunwell peopledon't we've fallen and broken a hip orsomethingwhen this woman was about to have whatthey call lasting power of attorneywhich means she had no longer hadcapacity she couldn't her brain wasn'tfunctioning properly she was essentiallydecided it was she was demented andcould hardly move and we took thestarting off this lady and two weekslater she was bright as a button andwalked out of the uniton aided such that where people's likewhat happened I saw a patient you knowjust give me a comment I've seen quite afew patients rather than myelysis whichis only supposed to happen in one in amillion cases doses of a lady who wasgoing to have a laparotomy due toextreme abdominal pain and they couldn'tfind a reason for itbut they postponed it I thought it totop taking the Statin and two weekslater the pain had completely goneand they're saying well did you justimagine this pain it's likeit you knowreality is that they call they don'tsome people have no adverse effects Iabsolutely agree with thatbut an awful lot of people do and youhave to ask why why only status why havethey put so much effort into provingthat statins goes no adverse effects whyhave they not done this with all theseother drugs why is that why is thiscomplete focus and to quote Shakespeareyou know I feel that protesters too muchwhat is going on here why are theypartially determined to crush anypossibility of anyone saying that anystatic has ever had an adverse effectthere's a lady called Beatrice Golem whodoes Research into adverse effects inCaliforniawhen she looked at what we call LouGehrig's Disease or amyotrophic lateralsclerosis and found two of the statinsThe increased risk of Lou Gehrig'sDisease amyotrophic lateral sclerosiswhich is a terrible disease increased50-fold in one case 125 volt it's not avery common disease so most doctors arenever going to see thisno one as far as I know is contradictedto these findings but you know therethey areprobably the single most horribledisease you can get I think and there weare the increased risk of 50 50 times54 you're 50 times more likely to get Imean atrophic lateral sclerosisum and potential anyway the list goes onand on but I mean you areum you're shouted down it's it's it'snot something that anyonewill will go on and then again theresearch one of the clinical papers thatfirst promoted this nocebo effect verystronglywhen you track it down it was actuallyuh it was actually funded entirely by bythe pharmaceutical industry well youcan't find that unless you look veryhard yeah I mean just the entire notionthat I think it's an amazing bait andswish that the the entire idea behindscience as being you know something goodwas an advertisement you know it was amarketing campaign done on the idea thatyou know all of humanity until now wouldjust listen to the priest now all ofhumanity was all about some guy was apriest and you just go to them and theytell you what to do as the priest andthe king and you were their surf wellnow we have the enlightenment now wehave science now we have the Age ofReason and we don't listen to priestsanymore we do things with a scientificmethod so we do experiments so you knowanybody can say this thing works or thatthing doesn't work you just need tocarry out an experiment that shouldn'tillustrate it well and sounds reallywonderful and this is what they teach usin school cool and this is how we allget into you know this kind of massivelyappreciative state of mind where wethink science is the savior but then youdig a little bit under the surface andrealize that you're still going with apriest I mean it's it's just instead ofthe priest saying I spoke to God or youknow the ghosts came to me and told methat you should do this the priest isgoing into a room and telling you Icarried out the experiment then here'sthe result well that's not the samething as getting out an experimentthat's the same thing as listening to apriest now if he got it because he spoketo God or because he carried out anexperiment it's still the same thingit's you're still having to go by hisword and this is where we find ourselvesat this point pharmaceutical companiesthey report the data from their studiesbut they report the data you can't lookat it and in my mind I mean this hasbeen normalized but really why shouldn'tit be the case that all data of allthese trials should be out there in thepublic I mean I why shouldn't it bepossible for people to look at the dataCase by case why would it be possiblefor researchers to replicate the case togo and call the people who took thestudy you know these are the 300 peoplethat were in the control group these arethe 300 people that were in the grouplet's follow up with them and anybodycan buy them and contact them and followup with them you know if the data wasout there in the open available foreverybodyI think it would be a very verydifferent world and I think there is anenormous scope for making the data muchmore transparent but there's an enormousamount of effort that goes into makingsure that that that that that does nothappen and I think that's extremelytelling I I've reached the conclusionsort of reluctantly like the medicalresearch what do we call it world isbustnot quite sure when it went bust but Ithink it is it must do a degree thatI don't know what percentage of data hasto be fully reliable or or has to beunreliable before you don't believe youcan no longer believe that the dataum but you have to be very carefulbecause even if it's five percent iswrong you can still go horribly wrong atthat point I really I kind of Despair atit that we are in this situation I feelit's a bit it's almost gone beyond thatpart of the problem is that you can geta politician interested in this at allthere is no politician who's remotelyinterested in itit's almost like it's too big a thing oror they're just not ready to look at itI mean I didn't know that Europeanagencies were asked to look at the theformulation of I think it was themoderna and Pfizer RNA jobs to look atwhat did they actually contain what theysaid that they containthat they contain mRNA that would codefor a spike protein how much of that waswas intact Within These virus it was inthese vaccines and and they couldn'tthey weren't told they werethey had those data are not madeavailable and you think well if youcan't even get data on goodmanufacturing practice in other wordsyou know these RNA vaccines are verycomplex things to produce one wouldimagine they sit in they'll think on theliposome and then then the then the MRNAhas to sit within this manufacturingthose must be very complicated I wouldhave thought and then storing themfreezing and then throwing them out andthen injecting themyou know how much of this stuff isactually going into peopleas advertised on the tin well that'sbeen redacted and the authorities can'teven see it so if you say well if wecan't even find out because I was at aconference you a few years agoum working at looking at vaccines andthings partly out of Interest probablybecause I was giving a talk and umItalian researchers have looked at someof the major vaccinations that weregiven and got hold of them and thentried to analyze them and say well whatwhat do we see actually in the vaccineswhat's there and and in no instancecould they actually find any of of thethe vaccine there was a lot of clumps ofprotein there was other stuff but itwasn't actually anything that remotelyrepresented what was supposed to be inthere so they went to the emea which isthe European medicines evaluation sowhat's in them and it's all we don'tknow you'll have to ask thepharmaceutical industry who made them inthe pharmaceutical industry said we'renot telling you end of the end of thelinesoif we can't even rely on the substancethat's supposed to be in these vaccinesbeing in the vaccine well maybe it isunder vaccines but againwhy not just say it it's why notdemonstrate it why not show itum because you know if we've been givena substance that's supposed to do X orsupposed to contain X and it containshardly any X or or no X at all then thenclearly there's a major issue going onhere and I would like to know personallyis well is it there you know if that's aquestion if people have looked at it andsaid we we didn't find it or we foundyou know that it wasn't workingthis is a serious issue and I'm andagain you think the regulatoryauthorities would be jumping up and downsaying we have to see this we have toknow but you know the industry justredacts the information and says youcan't see ithow can that possibly be you know whatit is yeah I mean it's uh it's amazingand then what's amazing is just how it'sbeen normalized that yeah this is howscience is done and science is openinquiry as long as you're credentialedby the people that are being queriedwell I was going I was writing anarticle at the moment it's called youknow medicine needs a few more planecrashesbecause you know plane falls out the skyand 300 people dieit's very difficult to hide thatand if another one falls out the sky andanother 300 people die you know you'vegot a real problem in your heartbut when things go wrong withmedications or potentially you knowthousands potentially could die and youknow if we look at things like biops orwhatever where it's known that it killeda thousands no one noticed thatthousands of people diedit was only determined researcher whosaid well we must have had thousandshave died if this is what's happeningso you know you can get thousands ofdeaths in the pharmaceutical world andno one's going to noticeexactly that's why I mean I I thinkwe've had an enormous number of planecrashes but they haven't done adifference in in engineering thesethings matter you know Bridge FallsEngineers can take stock but withmedicine it doesn't seem to work thatway and the opioid epidemic is anexcellent example because I mean at thispoint even the most gullible TV viewingpharmaceutical company trusting personknows that the opioid crisis was acomplete massive crime and that thesecompanies made billions of dollars andmurdered many many people and destroyedso many lives and not even destroyedlives I mean you walk around Americancities they've destroyed American citiesby basically creating an an underclassof people that cannot be rehabilitatedinto society because they're addicted tothose opioids and and it's all startedwell maybe not all but it ispredominantly been driven byprescription drugs and so this has beenrevealed it's been reported in the NewYork Times even CNN has talked about iteven you know even even the mouthpiecesof the pharmaceutical critical industrywill run long pieces about how this hasbeen so horribleand what has it done to opioidprescriptions nothingthe pharmaceutical companies have paidbillions in fines less than the moneythat they made so this this is still aprofitable business you know even youjust count the amount of money that youhave to get that you have to pay whenyou get busted as part of the businessoperating expenses and it's still aprofitable model you know you kill tensof thousands of people you pay money asa fine and you still make a profit butnot only did you know you just made aprofit on the stuff that you did beforewhen you were killing people youcontinue so they're still prescribingopioids and they're still making a lotof money off of a few yearsit's just the tax isn't it the killingpeople tax yeah which is I don't knowbut I mean it's it's you know we don'twant to think about it we become ratherdespondent if you if you think about ittoo hard I suppose it's umI just I I don't know where where itgoesI don't know where we go with thisbecause yeahum well just about impossible to getanybody triggered enough to want to doit yeah but this is why I mean withevery episode of this podcast we end ona positive note of how Bitcoin fixesthings and this is why really we thinkBitcoin I mean people laugh at us and itsounds crazy and like don't blame youfor laughing but it's going to startsounding less and less crazy and lessand less funny I think the root cause ofa lot of these problems is the fact thatmoney is corrupt and as I was mentioningat the beginning of the discussion thefact that you have an authority that canprint money whereas everybody else insociety has to work for money justcompletely tips the balances foreverything in the favor of thatAuthority and so the people who are incharge of the money printer dictatemedical reality they dictate scientificreality they take economic realitybecause they can impose it by Fiatbecause they can just continue to throwso much money at things in order to makethem in a certain way and so in my mindyou know why does the medicalestablishment get away with all of thosethings why do pharmaceutical companiesdo all those things I don't think youcan separate that from the very tightweb of control that governments exert onthe medical industry and so a lot ofpeople will tell you well what we needis better regulation what we need isbetter control over the pharmaceuticalcompanies but it was regulation andcontrol that got us to where we arethese are not free market Industriesthese are heavily regulated Industriesyou can't compete with thepharmaceutical industry you can't go andsay well you know what their medicine isactually bad for you those opioids arenot good here's a natural product thatI'm going to sell as a replacement forthis thing that's going to work betteryou go to jail if you Market anything asbeing related to a drug to an illnessunless you have FDA approval and so thethat omnipotence isa function of the money print thatomnipotence did not exist under the goldstandard you did not have this level ofgovernment uh licensing and control ofthe medical industry under the goldstandard becausewith a gold standard you can't printgold and so you can't just imposeReality by Fiat if you keep takingpeople's gold in taxes and spending iton stupid ideas like this you go bustthen it's not a sustainable model but ifyou surreptitiously take people's moneythrough inflationary printing then yeahyou can continue to impose all kinds ofstrange realities and Sciences on themand the implication you know these ideasdie very very hard so opioids or statinsor all kinds of bad theories theycontinue to live becausewith a money printer they can be keptalive until the money printer breaks sothe the the you know there is acorrective mechanism eventually which isthat once you destroy all of money andall economic system in a society and youget hyperinflation then yeah you can nolonger keep enforcing this insanity butuntil then you know a lot of um a lot ofpeople will pay very very very heavyprice so I think you know my case forBitcoin is that and the reason you knowthis podcast even though it's a Bitcoinpodcast we get into all these uh topicsthat might seem extremely unrelated tobitcoin I believe they are related tobitcoin because they are related tomoney and money Printing and money isone half of every transaction in allSociety so if you move from a brokenmonetary system that is designed forthat is optimized for control and forempowering the people in charge at theexpense of the user to A system that isdecentralized which empowers the userand doesn't allow anybody todisenfranchise the user or Rob them thatI think can change things drasticallyand that's why that's why I sent you mybook and I hope spend some time thinkingabout it and we'll win you over to thebitcoiner sideno I've been interested in reading itit's um it's not my world but I thinkthat the control aspect is quite exactlyhow it works it's definitely it seems tobe getting more and more and more soanything that can help to destabilizethat there's power structures I thinkhas to be a good thing because they'vebecome too too potent and andrestrictive but you know as it is likeyou know I feel a bit like I'm I ambeingcrushed by forces which which are BeyondMy Control at the moment I have no moreto say in the mathwell I mean this is this has beenenormously enormously enormouslyinformative and helpful I'm very surethat most of our listeners are going toenjoy this a lot and learn a lot from itI've learned a lot from you over theyears and I want to thank you again foryour bravery for speaking out for aparticular name out there and for takingall the arrows that come with you knowquestioning the dogmas of today's rulingscientific religions and all the manyassorted Cults and their weird primitivebeliefs thank you so much I hope we'llhave you on again to discuss more andmore topics thank you I enjoyed the chatand uh it could be nice to be nice Ipromise I will finish your book shortlyI've I've done pretty well I'm gettingthere and I will finish it's veryinteresting thank you very much allright cheers thanks a lot take care[Music]thank you[Music]",
