  "text": "i mean couldn't you say that at the end of the day there'll be three classifications of  political reaction there'll be some governments that that uh resist reality and they collapse  and and maybe they collapse into civil war and they just collapse into chaos  and there'll be some governments that that fight resist struggle and eventually uh  reconfigure themselves after great deals of pain and agony and there'll be some governments that  that look at the world and they they uh transform themselves in an agile fashion  and they maybe they don't get through without k without stress but they morph into something  different and accommodate the world right what happens if a small country the best example  would be what if a small country that still has a currency starts printing the currency  to buy bitcoin the first one right there's a little bit of room right like like what if uae  right or saudi arabia what if they were to go and just start buying bitcoin with their currency  like how long could i mean in theory couldn't you if you ran a country like emirates  couldn't you go ahead and buy billions two three five ten billion of this before anybody noticed  before and and it might never weaken your currency rightyeah they've got an annoying strength capital right yeah they're hosting world cups that you  know cost them a lot of money they could be buying bitcoin and watching the world cup on tv like a  good uh i mean a good model to consider is norway and sweden and other sovereign wealth funds right  the the really they're you know you've got regressive you've got cuba and venezuela right and  north korea and they're not really good at embracing property rights  and then you've got the middle of the road conventional and their central banks are  holding you know u.s sovereign debt or gold but mainly just sovereign debt and then you've got  progressive nations and norway is one norway's got a massive equity portfolio right switzerland's  got a massive they they didn't use gold they actually used big tech as a store of value  um you know ksa and uae in fact all of the middle eastern countries they generally have sovereign  wealth funds that are holding diversified portfolios of property including equity they  own banks they own big tax sometimes sometimes they own like tons of property real estate reits  not to mention commodities right oil rights like mineral rights and the like soi think uh i think generally the world is a more complicated place than we are able to  predict right like you're trying to predict what the market will do and is is it the whole basis  of austrian economics right that nobody can really predict the market you know yeah it's human action  at the end of the day and so everybody has free will right like microstrategy can do what it did  like microstrategy stock was 120 and then we flipped and it's up by a factor of five  and and what did we do we basically bought some bitcoin and then we started issuing stock to buy  bitcoin isn't that the same as a country buy some bitcoin and start issuing currency to buy bitcoinyeah right yeah so i guess it's a slightly different because it devalues the currency  when you issue more of it but if you back up this bitcoin it isn't slightly different because when  you issue stock you devalue the stock right you if you're issuing equity you're diluting the equity  and if you issue currency you're diluting the currency but but the equity is a claim on the or  on the cash flows of the company and the currency is a claim on the assets of the bank that issued  the currency if it is redeemable and uh if it's redeemable in gold or bitcoin then yeah  so that's what they've got to do they have to go on a bitcoin standard let's let's be  extreme right what happens if uae buys 10 billion dollars of bitcoin and the price of bitcoin then  increases by a factor of 20. and next thing you know they've they've got 200 billion dollars  worth of bitcoin and everybody in the world knows they've got 200 billion dollars worth of bitcoin  well the first thing that's going to happen is the saudis are going to want to buy more thenyeah so i think uh i think the point here really isyou can spend a lot of time fantasizing about how you never want any banks to buy  bitcoin you never want any companies to buy bitcoin you never want any governments to  buy bitcoin and since they're not going to ever buy any bitcoin you're the enemy of the banks  and the companies and the government right yeah right and and you see that narrative  right like like banks are the enemy of bitcoin companies are the enemy of bitcoin not your  keys not your coin the government's the enemy of bitcoin but the other possibility which just turns  the entire thing on its head is what how would you feel if you woke up tomorrow and you found  out that goldman sachs did buy 10 billion dollars of bitcoin and uae bought 20 billion of bitcoin  would you be angry by the way your bitcoin would be trading at like four million dollars of bitcoinand you could be angry and say no no give that back to us i want to go back to 50 000 bitcoin  look if institutions weren't involved in bitcoin bitcoin would be trading at like 8 000 right now  right if you look at you know the last 18 months so you could like just we could  unwind that and you go back to eight thousand dollar bitcoin or you can move forward but  it's just a taste so you know my what's my big point here it's  it's like nobody can predict how the future will evolve except to make this one observation  people are generally rational and they take the path of least resistance and so at some point  it's possible that someone's going to buy the bitcoin  not because they agree that with with your most extreme vision of no governments and no companies  and living together peacefully in one world currency maybe that's not why they're going  to do it maybe they just want the money right yeah for sure uh bitcoin is is far more popular  than anarchist ideology that's for sure i i i totally so where should i understand that  right when that happens then uh the entire thing is going to tilt a different direction  inconceivable right you don't you just don't even know which direction it's going to go  but the world is going to find its way forward and and uh you know like when the lockdowns took place  right there's this phrase life finds a way right you know like the jurassic park phrase when the  lockdowns took place we shut down cruise lines and we shut down airlines and we shut down theme parks  and we shut down movie theaters and if you're if you're uh an investor in the disney corporation  you could look at the disney corporation and you could say well they're in cruise lines  oh and hotels hotels airlines cruise lines theaters everything's shut down you know and  if you're if you're an analyst you could say well it's pretty obvious the stock  is impaired the company is impaired i should just dump my stock or i should short the stock  but at the end of the day someone went on television and said how's disney going to react  and someone went and disney went on television said we're just going to do disney plus streaming  and they said well how many customers do you have like right now you know at the time of the  lockdown they were like the ninth largest you know non-launch streaming service and it would have  accounted for 0.1 of their revenue or one percent of their revenue and minus nothing of their profit  and you could just focus on that narrative or you could get on tv and say yeah well we think by the  year 2025 we're going to actually be growing a hundred percent year over year and everybody said  this is great they've got a plan stuck at an all-time high yeah and so you know and so the  point really is are you going to bet on everybody to lose or and not come up with the right strategy  or what are the odds that they're just going to find a strategy which is a winning strategy and  a winning way to accommodate right i mean nobody on d nobody from disney got on television and said  you know the you know streaming video will never replace the theme parks it will never replace  you know the the movie experience we believe families need to come together in our hotels  and be in our you know disney world rides i mean they didn't spend a lot of time you know  wallowing in self-pity and dealing with that reality they just completely change the focus  talk about the new thing and move forward so i i think that uh everybody loves a winner  and bitcoin's a winner and the winning strategy is let everybody win with us right yes definitely  everybody can win with is it i don't care what government you know can governments win yes all  of them even the ones i don't like even the ones i don't like right can companies win all of can  the banks win yeah sure they can i don't you know you don't like that company because they  censor this thing no they could still win like at the end of the day if everybody wins with you  and you're you know you have the most extreme values like multi-sig coal storage with you know  guns and a cabin and your own source of water and your own food supply you're still going to  be better off right yes you know your bitcoin is still going to be worth 10 million a bitcoin  yeah my view on all of this is to tell people that you know bitcoin's permission list and  that includes that it's uh complete you can't stop people from selling  ious for bitcoin you know people think about it as if we need to stop people from buying bitcoin ious  well no it's bitcoin holders who are selling ious and there's nothing you can do about it and  i think you know generally as a libertarian leaning anarchist i i i don't get upset at  things that are peaceful i can't oppose people doing peaceful things that don't hurt othersyou",
