May. All rights reserved.   See the detailed disclaimer. Use short sections under ‚Äúfair   use‚Äù provisions, with appropriate credit, but don‚Äôt put your   name on my words.1.2. ForewordThe Cypherpunks have existed since September, 1992. In that time, a vast amount has been written on cryptography, key escrow, Clipper, the Net, the Information Superhighway, cyber terrorists, and crypto anarchy. We have found ourselves (or placed ourselves) at the center of the storm.This FAQ may help to fill in some gaps about what we‚Äôre about, what motivates us, and where we‚Äôre going. And maybe some useful knowledge on crypto, remailers, anonymity, digital cash, and other interesting things.The Basic Issues    Great Divide: privacy vs. compliance with laws        free speech and privacy, even if means some criminals cannot be caught (a stand the U.S. Constitution was strongly in favor of, at one time)            a man‚Äôs home is his castle‚Ä¶the essence of the Magna Carta systems‚Ä¶rights of the individual to be secure from random searchesor invasive tactics to catch criminals, regulate behavior, and control the population            the legitimate needs to enforce laws, to respond to situationsthis parallels the issue of self-protection vs. protection by law and police            as seen in the gun debatecrypto = guns in the sense of being an individual‚Äôs preemptive protectionpast the point of no returnStrong crypto as building material for a new ageTransnationalism and Increased Degrees of Freedom        governments can‚Äôt hope to control movements and communications of citizens; borders are transparentNot all list members share all views    This is not ‚Äúthe Official Cypherpunks FAQ.‚Äù No such thing can exist. This is the FAQ I wanted written. Views expressed are my own, with as much input from others, as much consensus, as I can manage. If you want a radically different FAQ, write it yourself.  If you don‚Äôt like this FAQ, don‚Äôt read it. And tell your friends not to read it. But don‚Äôt bog down my mailbox, or the 500 others on the list, with messages about how you would have worded Section 12.4.7.2 slightly differently, or how Section 6.9.12 does not fully reflect your views. For obvious reasons.All FAQs are the products of a primary author, sometimes of a committee. For this FAQ, I am the sole author. At least of the version you are reading now. Future versions may have more input from others, though this makes me nervous (I favor new authors writing their own stuff, or using hypertext links, rather than taking my basic writing and attaching their name to it‚Äìit is true that I include the quotes of many folks here, but I do so by explicitly quoting them in the chunk they wrote‚Ä¶.it will be tough for later authors to clearly mark what Tim May wrote without excessively cluttering the text. The revisionist‚Äôs dilemma.The list has a lot of radical libertarians, some anarcho- capitalists, and even a few socialistsMostly computer-related folks, as might be expected. (There are some political scientists, classical scholars, etc. Even a few current or ex-lawyers.)Do I Speak for Others?        As I said, no. But sometimes I make claims about what ‚Äúmost‚Äù list members believe, what ‚Äúmany‚Äù believe, or what ‚Äúsome‚Äù believe.‚ÄúMost‚Äù is my best judgment of what the majority believe, at least the vocal majority in Cypherpunks discussions (at the physical meetings, parties, etc.) and on the List. ‚ÄúMany‚Äù means fewer, and ‚Äúsome‚Äù fewer still. ‚ÄúA few‚Äù will mean a distinct minority. Note that this is from the last 18 months of activity (so don‚Äôt send in clarifications now to try to ‚Äúsway the vote‚Äù).In particular, some members may be quite uncomfortable being described as anarchists, crypto anarchists, money launderers, etc.My comments won‚Äôt please everyoneon nearly every point ever presented, some have disagreedfeuds, battles, flames, idee fixeson issues ranging from gun control to Dolphin Encrypt to various pet theories held dearlySomeone once made a mundane joke about pseudonyms being like multiple personality disorder‚Äìand a flame came back saying: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not funny. I am MPD and my SO is MPD. Please stop immediately!‚Äùcan‚Äôt be helped‚Ä¶.can‚Äôt present all sides to all argumentsFocus of this FAQ is U.S.-centric, for various reasons    most on list are in U.S., and I am in U.S.NSA and crypto community is largely centered in the U.S., with some strong European activitiesU.S. law is likely to influence overseas lawWe are at a fork in the road,  a Great Divide    Surveillance vs. Freedomnothing in the middle‚Ä¶either strong crypto and privacy is strongly limited, or the things I describe here will be done by some people‚Ä¶.hence the ‚Äútipping factor‚Äù applies (point of no return, horses out of the barn)I make no claim to speaking ‚Äúfor the group.‚Äù If you‚Äôre offended, write your own FAQ. My focus on things loosely called ‚Äúcrypto anarchy‚Äù is just that: my focus. This focus naturally percolates over into something like this FAQ, just as someone primarily interested in the mechanics of PGP would  devote more space to PGP issues than I have.    Gary Jeffers, for example, devotes most of his ‚ÄúCEB‚Äù to issues surrounding PGP.Will leave out some of the highly detailed items‚Ä¶    Clipper, LEAF, escrow, Denning, etc.a myriad of encryption programs, bulk  ciphers, variants on PGP, etc. Some of these I‚Äôve listed‚Ä¶others I‚Äôve had to throw my hands over and just ignore. (Keeping track of zillions of versions for dozens of platforms‚Ä¶)easy to get lost in the details, buried in the bullshit1.3. Motivations 1.3.1. With so much material available, why another FAQ? 1.3.2. No convenient access to archives of the list‚Ä¶.and who could    read 50 MB of stuff anyway? 1.3.3. Why not Web? (Mosaic, Http, URL, etc.)Why not a navigable Web document?This is becoming trendy. Lots of URLs are included here, in fact. But making all documents into Web documents has downsides.Reasons why not:    No easy access for me.Many others also lack access. Text still rules.Not at all clear that a collection of hundreds of fragments is usefulI like the structured editors available on my Mac (specifically, MORE, an outline editor)- 1.3.4. What the Essential Points AreIt‚Äôs easy to lose track of what the core issues are, what the really important points are. In a FAQ like this, a vast amount of ‚Äúcruft‚Äù is presented, that is, a vast amount of miscellaneous, tangential, and epiphenomenal material. Names of PGP versions, variants on steganograhy, and other such stuff, all of which will change over the next few months and years.And yet that‚Äôs partly what a FAQ is for. The key is just not to lose track of the key ideas. I‚Äôve mentioned what I think are the important ideas many times. To wit:    that many approaches to crypto existthat governments essentially cannot stop most of these approaches, short of establishing a police state (and probably not even then)core issues of identity, authentication, pseudonyms, reputations, etc.1.4. Who Should Read This 1.4.1. ‚ÄúShould I read this?‚ÄùYes, reading this will point you toward other sources of information, will answer the most commonly asked questions, and will (hopefully) head off the reappearance of the same tired themes every few months.Use a search tool if you have one. Grep for the things that interest you, etc. The granularity of this FAQ does not lend itself to Web conversion, at least not with present tools.What Won‚Äôt Be Covered Here    basic cryptography        many good texts, FAQs, etc., written by full-time cryptologists and educators            in particular, some of the ideas are not simple, and take several pages of well-written text to get the point acrossnot the focus of this FAQbasic political rants1.5. Comments on Style and Thoroughness 1.5.1. ‚ÄúWhy is this FAQ not in Mosaic form?‚Äùbecause the author (tcmay, as of 7/94) does not have Mosaic access, and even if did, would not necessarily‚Ä¶.linear text is still fine for some things‚Ä¶can be read on all platforms, can be printed out, and can be searched with standard grep and similar tools 1.5.2. ‚ÄúWhy the mix of styles?‚ÄùThere are three main types of styles here:    Standard prose sections, explaining some point or listing things. Mini-essays, like most posts to Cypherpunks.Short, outline-style comments        that I didn‚Äôt have time or willpower to expand into prose formatthat work best in outline format anywaylike thisQuotes from others        Cypherpunks are a bright group. A lot of clever things have been said in the 600 days x 40 posts/day = 24,000 posts, and I am trying to use what I can.Sadly, only a tiny fraction can be used            because I simply cannot read  even a fraction of these posts over again (though I‚Äôve only saved several thousand of the posts)and because including too many of these posts would simply make the FAQ too long (it‚Äôs still too long, I suppose)I hope you can handle the changes in tone of voice, in styles, and even in formats. It‚Äôll just too much time to make it all read uniformly. 1.5.3. Despite the length of this thing, a vast amount of stuff is   missing. There have been hundreds of incisive analyses by   Cypherpunks, dozens of survey articles on Clipper, and   thousands of clever remarks. Alas, only a few of them here.And with 25 or more books on the Internet, hundreds of FAQs and URLs, it‚Äôs clear that we‚Äôre all drowning in a sea of information about the Net.Ironically, good old-fashioned books have a lot more relevant and timeless information. 1.5.4. Caveats on the completeness or accuracy of this FAQnot all points are fully fleshed out‚Ä¶the outline nature means that nearly all points could be further added-to, subdivided, taxonomized, and generally fleshed-out with more points, counterpoints, examples    like a giant tree‚Ä¶branches, leaves, tangled hierarchiesIt is inevitable that conflicting points will be made in a document of this size    views change, but don‚Äôt get corrected in all placesdifferent contexts lead to different viewpointssimple failure by me to be fully consistentand many points raised here would, if put into an essay for the Cypherpunks list, generate comments, rebuttals, debate, and even acrimony‚Ä¶.I cannot expect to have all sides represented fully, especially as the issues are often murky, unresolved, in dispute, and generally controversialinconsistencies in the points here in this FAQ1.6. Corrections and Elaborations‚ÄúHow to handle corrections or clarifications?‚Äù    While I have done my best to ensure accuracy, errors will no doubt exist. And as anyone can see from reading the Cypherpunks list, nearly any statement made about any subject can produce a flurry of rebuttals, caveats, expansions, and whatnot. Some subjects, such as the nature of money, the role of Cypherpunks, and the role of reputations, produce dozens of differing opinions every time they come up!So, it is not likely that my points here will be any different. Fortunately, the sheer number of points here means that not every one of them will be disagreed with. But the math is pretty clear: if every reader finds even one thing to disagree with and then posts his rebuttal or elaboration‚Ä¶.disaster! (Especially if some people can‚Äôt trim quotes properly and end up including a big chunk of text.)Recommendations        Send corrections of fact to meIf you disagree with my opinion, and you think you can change my mind, or cause me to include your opinion as an elaboration or as a dissenting view, then send it. If your point requires long debate or is a deep disagreement, then I doubt I have the time or energy to debate. If you want your views heard, write your own FAQ!Ultimately, send what you want. But I of course will evaluate comments and apply a reputation-based filter to the traffic. Those who send me concise, well-reasoned corrections or clarifications are likelier to be listened to than those who barrage me with minor clarifications and elaborations.In short, this is not a group project. The ‚Äústone soup FAQ‚Äù is not what this is.More information        Please don‚Äôt send me e-mail asking for more information on a particular topic‚ÄìI just can‚Äôt handle custom research. This FAQ is long enough, and the Glossary at the end contains additional information, so that I cannot expand upon these topics (unless there is a general debate on the list). In other words, don‚Äôt assume this FAQ is an entry point into a larger data base I will generate. I hate to sound so blunt, but I‚Äôve seen the requests that come in every time I write a fairly long article.Tips on feedback        Comments about writing style, of the form ‚ÄúI would have written it this way,‚Äù are especially unwelcome.Credit issues    inevitable that omissions or collisions will occurideas have many fatherssome ideas have been ‚Äúin the air‚Äù for many yearsslogans are especially problematic        ‚ÄúThey can have my‚Ä¶.‚Äù‚Ä¶I credit Barlow with this, but I‚Äôve heard others use it independently (I think; at least I used it before hearing Barlow used it)‚ÄúIf crypto is outlawed, only outlaws will have crypto‚Äù‚ÄúBig Brother Inside‚Äùif something really bothers you, send me a note1.7.

SUMMARY: MFAQ‚ÄìMost Frequently Asked Questions 2.2.1. Main PointsThese are the main questions that keep coming up. Not necessarily the most basic question, just the ones that get asked a lot. What most FAQs are. 2.2.2. Connections to Other Sections 2.2.3. Where to Find Additional Informationnewcomers to crypto should buy Bruce Schneier‚Äôs ‚ÄúApplied Cryptography‚Äù‚Ä¶it will save many hours worth of unnecessary questions and clueless remarks about cryptography.the various FAQs publishe in the newsroups (like sci.crypt, alt.security.pgp) are very helpful. (also at rtfm.mit.edu) 2.2.4. Miscellaneous CommentsI wasn‚Äôt sure what to include here in the MFAQ‚Äìperhaps people can make suggestions of other things to include.My advice is that if something interests you, use your editing/searching tools to find the same topic in the main section. Usually (but not always) there‚Äôs more material in the main chapters than here in the MFAQ.2.3. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the ‚ÄòBig Picture‚Äô?‚Äù 2.3.1. Strong crypto is here. It is widely available. 2.3.2. It implies many changes in the way the world works. Private   channels between parties who have never met and who never   will meet are possible. Totally anonymous, unlinkable,   untraceable communications and exchanges are possible. 2.3.3. Transactions can only be voluntary, since the parties are   untraceable and unknown and can withdraw at any time. This   has profound implications for the conventional approach of   using the threat of force, directed against parties by   governments or by others. In particular, threats of force   will fail. 2.3.4. What emerges from this is unclear, but I think it will be a   form of anarcho-capitalist market system I call ‚Äúcrypto   anarchy.‚Äù (Voluntary communications only, with no third   parties butting in.)2.4. Organizational 2.4.1. ‚ÄúHow do I get on‚Äìand off‚Äìthe Cypherpunks list?‚ÄùSend a message to ‚Äúcypherpunks-request@toad.com‚ÄùAny auto-processed commands?don‚Äôt send requests to the list as a whole‚Ä¶.this will mark you as ‚Äúclueless‚Äù 2.4.2. ‚ÄúWhy does the Cypherpunks list sometimes go down, or lose the   subscription list?‚ÄùThe host machine, toad.com, owned by John Gilmore, has had the usual problems such machines have: overloading, shortages of disk space, software upgrades, etc. Hugh Daniel has done an admirable job of keeping it in good shape, but problems do occur.Think of it as warning that lists and communication systems remain somewhat fragile‚Ä¶.a lesson for what is needed to make digital money more robust and trustable.There is no paid staff, no hardware budget for improvements. The work done is strictly voluntarily. 2.4.3. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôve just joined the Cypherpunks list, what should I do?‚ÄùRead for a while. Things will become clearer, themes will emerge, and certain questions will be answered. This is good advice for any group or list, and is especially so for a list with 500 or more people on it. (We hit 700+ at one point, then a couple of list outages knocked the number down a bit.)Read the references mentioned here, if you can. The sci.crypt FAQ should be read. And purchase Bruce Schneier‚Äôs ‚ÄúApplied Cryptography‚Äù the first chance you get.Join in on things that interest you, but don‚Äôt make a fool of yourself. Reputations matter, and you may come to regret having come across as a tedious fool in your first weeks on the list. (If you‚Äôre a tedious fool after the first few weeks, that may just be your nature, of course.)Avoid ranting and raving on unrelated topics, such as abortion (pro or con), guns (pro or con), etc. The  usual topics that usually generate a lot of heat and not much light. (Yes, most of us have strong views on these and other topics, and, yes, we sometimes let our views creep into discussions. There‚Äôs no denying that certain resonances exist. I‚Äôm just urging caution.) 2.4.4. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm swamped by the list volume; what can I do?‚ÄùThis is a natural reaction. Nobody can follow it all; I spend entirely too many hours a day reading the list, and I certainly can‚Äôt follow it all. Pick areas of expertise and then follow them and ignore the rest. After all, not seeing things on the list can be no worse than not even being subscribed to the list!Hit the ‚Äúdelete‚Äù key quicklyfind someone who will digest it for you (Eric Hughes has repeatedly said anyone can retransmit the list this way; Hal Finney has offered an encrypted list)Better mailers may help. Some people have used mail-to-news systems and then read the list as a local newsgroup, with threads.    I have Eudora, which supports off-line reading and sorting features, but I generally end up reading with an online mail program (elm).The mailing list may someday be switched over to a newsgroup, a la ‚Äúalt.cypherpunks.‚Äù (This may affect some people whose sites do not carry alt groups.) 2.4.5. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very easy to get lost in the morass of detail here. Are   there any ways to track what‚Äôs really important?‚ÄùFirst, a lot of the stuff posted in the Usenet newsgroups, and on the Cypherpunks list, is peripheral stuff, epiphenomenal cruft that will blow away in the first strong breeze. Grungy details about PGP shells, about RSA encryption speeds, about NSA supercomputers. There‚Äôs just no reason for people to worry about ‚Äúweak IDEA keys‚Äù when so many more pressing matters exist. (Let the experts worry.) Little of this makes any real difference, just as little of the stuff in daily newspapers is memorable or deserves to be memorable.Second, ‚Äúread the sources.‚Äù Read ‚Äú1984,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Shockwave Rider,‚Äù ‚ÄúAtlas Shrugged,‚Äù ‚ÄúTrue Names.‚Äù Read the Chaum article on making Big Brother obsolete (October 1985, ‚ÄúCommunications of the ACM‚Äù).Third, don‚Äôt lose sight of the core values: privacy, technological solutions over legal solutions, avoiding taxation, bypassing laws, etc. (Not everyone will agree with all of these points.)Fourth, don‚Äôt drown in the detail. Pick some areas of interest and follow them. You may not need to know the inner workings of DES or all the switches on PGP to make contributions in other areas. (In fact, you surely don‚Äôt.) 2.4.6. ‚ÄúWho are the Cypherpunks?‚ÄùA mix of about 500-700Can find out who by sending message to majordomo@toad.com with the message body text ‚Äúwho cypherpunks‚Äù (no quotes, of course).    Is this a privacy flaw? Maybe.Lots of students (they have the time, the Internet accounts). Lots of computer science/programming folks. Lots of libertarians.quote from Wired article, and from ‚ÄúWhole Earth Review‚Äù 2.4.7. ‚ÄúWho runs the Cypherpunks?‚ÄùNobody. There‚Äôs no formal ‚Äúleadership.‚Äù No ruler = no head = an arch = anarchy. (Look up the etymology of anarchy.)However, the mailing list currently resides on a physical machine, and this machine creates some nexus of control, much like having a party at someon‚Äôe house. The list administrator is currently Eric Hughes (and has been since the beginning). He is helped by Hugh Daniel, who often does maintenance of the toad.com, and by John Gilmore, who owns the toad.com machine and account.In an extreme situation of abuse or neverending ranting, these folks could kick someone off the list and block them from resubscribing via majordomo. (I presume they could‚Äì it‚Äôs never happened.)To emphasize: nobody‚Äôs ever been kicked off the list, so far as I know. Not even Detweiler‚Ä¶he asked to be removed (when the list subscribes were done manually).As to who sets policy, there is no policy! No charter, no agenda, no action items. Just what people want to work on themselves. Which is all that can be expected. (Some people get frustrated at this lack of consensus, and they sometimes start flaming and ranting about ‚ÄúCypherpunks never do anything,‚Äù but this lack of consensus is to be expected. Nobody‚Äôs being paid, nobody‚Äôs got hiring and firing authority, so any work that gets done has to be voluntary. Some volunteer groups are more organized than we are, but there are other factors that make this more possible for them than it is for us. C‚Äôest la vie.)Those who get heard on the mailing list, or in the physical meetings, are those who write articles that people find interesting or who say things of note. Sounds fair to me. 2.4.8. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt the issues that interest me get discussed?‚ÄùMaybe they already have been‚Äìseveral times. Many newcomers are often chagrined to find arcane topics being discussed, with little discussion of ‚Äúthe basics.‚ÄùThis is hardly surprising‚Ä¶.people get over the ‚Äúbasics‚Äù after a few months and want to move on to more exciting (to them) topics. All lists are like this.In any case, after you‚Äôve read the list for a while‚Äìmaybe several weeks‚Äìgo ahead and ask away. Making your topic fresher may generate more responses than, say, asking what‚Äôs wrong with Clipper. (A truly overworked topic, naturally.) 2.4.9. ‚ÄúHow did the Cypherpunks group get started?‚Äù2.4.10. ‚ÄúWhere did the name ‚ÄòCypherpunks‚Äô come from?‚ÄùJude Milhon, aka St. Jude, then an editor at ‚ÄúMondo 2000,‚Äù was at the earliest meetings‚Ä¶she quipped ‚ÄúYou guys are just a bunch of cypherpunks.‚Äù The name was adopted immediately.    The ‚Äòcyberpunk‚Äô genre of science fiction often deals with issues of cyberspace and computer security (‚Äúice‚Äù), so the link is natural.  A point of confusion is that cyberpunks are popularly thought of as, well, as ‚Äúpunks,‚Äù while many Cyberpunks are frequently libertarians and anarchists of various stripes. In my view, the two are not in conflict.Some, however, would prefer a more staid name. The U.K. branch calls itself the ‚ÄúU.K. Crypto Privacy Association.‚Äù  However, the advantages of the name are clear. For one thing, many people are bored by staid names. For another, it gets us noticed by journalists and others.-We are actually not very ‚Äúpunkish‚Äù at all. About as punkish as most of our cyberpunk cousins are, which is to say, not very.the name    Crypto Cabal (this before the sci.crypt FAQ folks appeared, I think), Crypto Liberation Front, other namesnot everybody likes the name‚Ä¶such is life2.4.11. ‚ÄúWhy doesn‚Äôt the Cypherpunks group have announced goals, ideologies, and plans?‚ÄùThe short answer: we‚Äôre just a mailing list, a loose association of folks interested in similar thingsno budget, no voting, no leadership (except the ‚Äúleadership of the soapbox‚Äù)How could such a consensus emerge? The usual approach is for an elected group (or a group that seized power) to write the charter and goals, to push their agenda. Such is not the case here.Is this FAQ a de facto statement of goals? Not if I can help it, to be honest. Several people before me planned some sort of FAQ, and had they completed them, I certainly would not have felt they were speaking for me or for the group. To be consistent, then, I cannot have others think this way about this FAQ!2.4.12. ‚ÄúWhat have the Cypherpunks actually done?‚Äùspread of crypto: Cypherpunks have helped (PGP)‚Ä¶publicity, an alternative forum to sci.crypt (in many ways, better‚Ä¶better S/N ratio, more polite)Wired, Whole Earth Review, NY Times, articlesremailers, encrypted remailersThe Cypherpunk- and Julf/Kleinpaste-style remailers were both written very quickly, in just days    Eric Hughes wrote the first Cypherpunks remailer in a weekend, and he spent the first day of that weekend learning enough Perl to do the job.Karl Kleinpaste wrote the code that eventually turned into Julf‚Äôs remailer (added to since, of course) in a similarly short time:        ‚ÄúMy original anon server, for godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu 2 years ago, was written in a few hours one bored afternoon.  It wasn‚Äôt as featureful as it ended up being, but it was ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù for its initial goals, and bug-free.‚Äù [Karl_Kleinpaste@cs.cmu.edu, alt.privacy.anon-server, 1994-09-01]That other interesting ideas, such as digital cash, have not yet really emerged and gained use even after years of active discussion, is an interesting contrast to this rapid deployment of remailers. (The text-based nature of both straight encryption/signing and of remailing is semantically simpler to understand and then use than are things like digital cash, DC-nets, and other crypto protocols.)ideas for Perl scripts, mail handlersgeneral discussion, with folks of several political persuasionsconcepts: pools, Information Liberation Front, BlackNet  -2.4.13. ‚ÄúHow Can I Learn About Crypto and Cypherpunks Info?‚Äù2.4.14. ‚ÄúWhy is there sometimes disdain for the enthusiasm and   proposals of newcomers?‚ÄùNone of us is perfect, so we sometimes are impatient with newcomers. Also, the comments seen tend to be issues of disagreement‚Äìas in all lists and newsgroups (agreement is so boring).But many newcomers also have failed to do the basic reading that many of us did literally years before joining this list. Cryptology is a fairly technical subject, and one can no more jump in and expect to be taken seriously without any preparation than in any other technical field.Finally, many of us have answered the questions of newcomers too many times to be enthusiastic about it anymore. Familiarity breeds contempt.Newcomers should try to be patient about our impatience. Sometimes recasting the question generates interest. Freshness matters.

Most people don‚Äôt have the inclination to try to break a cipher unless there‚Äôs some incentive, such as fame or money involved.And new ciphers are notoriously hard to design. Experts are the best folks to do this. With all the stuff waiting to be done (described here), working on a new cipher is probably the least effective thing an amateur can do. (If you are not an amateur, and have broken other people‚Äôs ciphers before, then you know who you are, and these comments don‚Äôt apply. But I‚Äôll guess that fewer than a handful of folks on this list have the necessary background to do cipher design.)There are a vast number of ciphers and systems, nearly all of no lasting significance.

Most are very low volume.That few folks have heard of any of them, and that traffic volumes are extremely low, or zero, is not all that surprising, and matches experiences elsewhere. Several reasons:    Sublists are a bother to remember; most people forget they exist, and don‚Äôt think to post to them. (This ‚Äúforgetting‚Äù is one of the most interesting aspects of cyberspace; successful lists seem to be Schelling points that accrete even more members, while unsuccessful lists fade away into nothingness.)There‚Äôs a natural desire to see one‚Äôs words in the larger of two forums, so people tend to post to the main list.The sublists were sometimes formed in a burst of exuberance over some topic, which then faded.Topics often span several subinterest areas, so posting to the main list is better than copying all the relevant sublists.In any case, the Cypherpunks main list  is ‚Äúit,‚Äù for now, and has driven other lists effectively out of business.

Multiply them together, equals 35.  Now you calculate the product of one less than each number, plus one.  (5-1)(7- 1)+1=21.  There is a mathematical relationship that says that x = x^21 mod 35 for any x from 0 to 34.

And what about RSA?‚ÄùDES: Brute-force search of the keyspace in chosen-plaintext attacks is feeasible in around 2^47 keys, according to Biham and Shamir. This is about 2^9 times easier than the ‚Äúraw‚Äù keyspace. Michael Wiener has estimated that a macine of special chips could crack DES this way for a few thousand dollars per key. The NSA may have such machines.In any case, DES was not expected to last this long by many (and, in fact, the NSA and NIST proposed a phaseout some years back, the ‚ÄúCCEP‚Äù (Commercial COMSEC Endorsement Program), but it never caught on and seems forgotten today. Clipper and EES seem to have grabbed the spotlight.IDEA, from Europe, is supposed to be much better.As for RSA, this is unlikely.

With Wiener‚Äôs estimate of 3.5 hours to break DES, this implies 6700 years using today‚Äôs hardware. Assuming an optimistic doubling of hardware power per year (for the same cost), it will take 24 years before the hardware costs of a brute force attack on Skipjack come down to what it now costs to attack DES. Assuming no other weaknesses in Skipjack.And note that intelligence agencies are able to spend much more than what Wiener calculated (recall Norm Hardy‚Äôs description of Harvest)2.5.13. ‚ÄúDid the NSA know about public key ideas before Diffie and   Hellman?‚Äùmuch debate, and some sly and possibly misleading innuendo    Simmons claimed he learned of PK in Gardner‚Äôs column, and he certainly should‚Äôve been in a position to know (weapons, Sandia)-Inman has claimed that NSA had a P-K concept in 1966    fits with Dominik‚Äôs point about sealed cryptosystem boxes with no way to load new keysand consistent with NSA having essentially sole access to nation‚Äôs top mathematicians (until Diffies and Hellmans foreswore government funding, as a result of the anti- Pentagon feelings of the 70s)2.5.14. ‚ÄúDid the NSA know about public-key approaches before Diffie and Hellman?‚Äùcomes up a lot, with some in the NSA trying to slyly suggest that of course they knew about it‚Ä¶Simmons, etc.Bellovin comments (are good)2.5.15. ‚ÄúCan NSA crack RSA?‚ÄùProbably not.Certainly not by ‚Äúsearching the keyspace,‚Äù an idea that pops up every few months . It can‚Äôt be done. 1024-bit keys implies roughly 512-bit primes, or 153-decimal digit primes. There are more than 10^150 of them! And only about 10^73 particles in the entire universe.Has the factoring problem been solved? Probably not. And it probably won‚Äôt be, in the sense that factoring is probably in NP (though this has not been proved) and P is probably not NP (also unproved, but very strongly suspected). While there will be advances in factoring, it is extremely unlikely (in the religious sense) that factoring a 300- digit number will suddenly become ‚Äúeasy.‚ÄùDoes the RSA leak information so as to make it easier to crack than it is to factor the modulus? Suspected by some, but basically unknown. I would bet against it. But more iffy than the point above.‚ÄúHow strong is strong crypto?‚Äù    Basically, stronger than any of the hokey ‚Äúcodes‚Äù so beloved of thriller writers and movie producers. Modern ciphers are not crackable by ‚Äútelling the computer to run through all the combinations‚Äù (more precisely, the number of combinations greatly exceeds the number of atoms in the universe).2.5.16. ‚ÄúWon‚Äôt more powerful computers make ciphers breakable?‚ÄùThe effects of increasing computer power confer even greater advantage to the cipher user than to the cipher breaker. (Longer key lengths in RSA, for example, require polynomially more time to use, but exponentially more time to break, roughly speaking.) Stunningly, it is likely that we are close to being able to use key lengths which cannot be broken with all the computer power that will ever exist in the universe.    Analogous to impenetrable force fields protecting the data, with more energy required to ‚Äúpunch through‚Äù than exists in the universe        Vernor Vinge‚Äôs ‚Äúbobbles,‚Äù in ‚ÄúThe Peace War.‚ÄùHere I am assuming that no short cuts to factoring exist‚Ä¶this is unproven, but suspected. (No major shortcuts, i.e., factoring is not ‚Äúeasy.‚Äù)A modulus of thousands of decimal digits may require more total ‚Äúenergy‚Äù to factor, using foreseeable approaches, than is available        reversible computation may help, but I suspect not muchShor‚Äôs quantum-mechanical approach is completely untested‚Ä¶and may not scale well (e.g., it may be marginally possible to get the measurement precision to use this method for, say, 100-digit numbers, but utterly impossible to get it for 120-digit numbers, let alone 1000-digit numbers)2.5.17. ‚ÄúWill strong crypto help racists?‚ÄùYes, this is a consequence of having secure virtual communities.  Free speech tends to work that way!The Aryan Nation can use crypto to collect and disseminate information, even into ‚Äúcontrolled‚Äù nations like Germany that ban groups like Aryan Nation.Of course, ‚Äúon the Internet no one knows you‚Äôre a dog,‚Äù so overt racism based on superficial external characteristics is correspondingly harder to pull off.But strong crypto will enable and empower groups who have different beliefs than the local majority, and will allow them to bypass regional laws.2.5.18. Working on new ciphers‚Äìwhy it‚Äôs not a Cypherpunks  priority   (as I see it)It‚Äôs an issue of allocation of resources. (‚ÄúAll crypto is economics.‚Äù E. Hughes) Much work has gone into cipher design, and the world seems to have several stable, robust ciphers to choose from. Any additional work by crypto amateurs‚Äìwhich most of us are, relative to professional mathematicians and cipher designers‚Äìis unlikely to move things forward significantly. Yes, it could happen‚Ä¶but it‚Äôs not likely.Whereas there are areas where professional cryptologists have done very little:    PGP (note that PRZ did not take time out to try to invent his own ciphers, at least not for Version 2.0)‚Ä¶he concentrated on where his efforts would have the best payoffimplementation of remailersissues involving shells and other tools for crypto usedigital cashrelated issues, such as reputations, language design, game theory, etc.These are the areas of ‚Äúlow-hanging fruit,‚Äù the areas where the greatest bang for the buck lies, to mix some metaphors (grapeshot?).2.5.19. ‚ÄúAre there any unbreakable ciphers?‚ÄùOne time pads are of course information-theoretically secure, i.e., unbreakable by computer power.For conventional ciphers, including public key ciphers, some ciphers may not be breakable in our universe, in any amount of time. The logic goes as follows:    Our universe presumably has some finite number of particles (currently estimated to be 10^73 particles). This leads to the ‚Äúeven if every particle were a Cray Y- MP it would take‚Ä¶‚Äù sorts of thought experiments.But I am considering energy here. Ignoring reversible computation for the moment, computations dissipate energy (some disagree with this point). There is some uppper limit on how many basic computations could ever be done with the amount of free energy in the universe. (A rough calculation could be done by calculating the energy output of stars, stuff falling into black holes, etc., and then assuming about kT per logical operation. This should be accurate to within a few orders of magnitude.) I haven‚Äôt done this calculation, and won‚Äôt here, but the result would likely be something along the lines of X joules of energy that could be harnessed for computation, resulting in Y basic primitive computational steps.I can then find a modulus of 3000 digits or 5000 digits, or whatever, that takes more than this number of steps to factor. Therefore, unbreakable in our universe.Caveats:Maybe there are really shortcuts to factoring. Certainly improvements in factoring methods will continue. (But of course these improvements are not things that convert factoring into a less than exponential-in-length problem‚Ä¶that is, factoring appears to remain ‚Äúhard.‚Äù)Maybe reversible computations (a la Landauer, Bennett, et. al.) actually work. Maybe this means a ‚Äúfactoring machine‚Äù can be built which takes a fixed, or very slowly growing, amount of energy. In this case, ‚Äúforever‚Äù means Lefty is probably right.Maybe the quantum-mechanical idea of Peter Shor is possible. (I doubt it, for various reasons.)2.5.20. ‚ÄúHow safe is RSA?‚Äù ‚ÄúHow safe is PGP?‚Äù ‚ÄúI heard that PGP has   bugs?‚ÄùThis cloud of questions is surely the most common sort that appears in sci.crypt. It sometimes gets no answers, sometimes gets a rude answer, and only occasionally does it lead to a fruiful discussion.The simple anwer: These ciphers appear to be safe, to have no obvious flaws.More details can be found in various question elsewhere in this FAQ and in the various FAQs and references others have published.2.5.21. ‚ÄúHow long does encryption have to be good for?‚ÄùThis obviously depends on what you‚Äôre encrypting. Some things need only be safe for short periods of time, e.g., a few years or even less. Other things may come back to haunt you‚Äìor get you thrown in prison‚Äìmany years later. I can imagine secrets that have to be kept for many decades, even centuries (for example, one may fear one‚Äôs descendents will pay the price for a secret revealed).It is useful to think now about the computer power likely to be available in the year 2050, when many of you reading this will still be around. (I‚Äôm not arguing that parallelism, etc., will cause RSA to fall, only that some key lengths (e.g., 512-bit) may fall by then. Better be safe and use 1024 bits or even more. Increased computer power makes longer keys feasible, too.).2.6. PGP 2.6.1. There‚Äôs a truly vast amount of information out there on PGP,   from current versions, to sites, to keyserver issues, and so   on. There are also several good FAQs on PGP, on MacPGP, and   probably on nearly every major version of PGP. I don‚Äôt expect   to compete here with these more specialized FAQs.I‚Äôm also not a PGP expert, using it only for sending and receiving mail, and rarely doing much more with it.The various tools, for all major platforms, are a specialty unto themselves. 2.6.2. ‚ÄúWhere do I get PGP?‚Äù 2.6.3. ‚ÄúWhere can I find PGP?‚ÄùWait around for several days and a post will come by which gives some pointers.Here are some sites current at this writing: (watch out for changes) 2.6.4. ‚ÄúIs PGP secure?

NSA is apparently worried about PGP, worried about the spread   of PGP to other countries, and worried about the growth of   ‚Äúinternal communities‚Äù that communicate via ‚Äúblack pipes‚Äù or   ‚Äúencrypted tunnels‚Äù that are impenetrable to them.2.7.

Hundreds of articles and editorials have condemned it. Cyperpunks currently has no active supporters of mandatory key escrow, from all indications, so there is nothing to debate.2.8. Other Ciphers and Crypto Products2.9. Remailers and Anonymity 2.9.1. ‚ÄúWhat are remailers?‚Äù 2.9.2. ‚ÄúHow do remailers work?‚Äù (a vast number of postings have   dealt with this)The best way to understand them is to ‚Äújust do it,‚Äù that is, send a few remailed message to yourself, to see how the syntax works. Instructions are widely available‚Äìsome are cited here, and up to date instructions will appear in the usual Usenet groups.The simple view: Text messages are placed in envelopes and sent to a site that has agreed to remail them based on the instructions it finds. Encryption is not necessary‚Äìthough it is of course recommended. These ‚Äúmessages in bottles‚Äù are passed from site to site and ultimately to the intended final recipient.The message is pure text, with instructions contained in the text itself (this was a fortuitous choice of standard by Eric Hughes, in 1992, as it allowed chaining, independence from particular mail systems, etc.).A message will be something like this::: Request-Remailing-To: remailer@bar.bazBody of text, etc., etc. (Which could be more remailing instructions, digital postage, etc.)These nested messages make no assumptions about the type of mailer being used, so long as it can handle straight ASCII text, which all mailers can of course. Each mail message then acts as a kind of ‚Äúagent,‚Äù carrying instructions on where it should be mailed next, and perhaps other things (like delays, padding, postage, etc.)It‚Äôs very important to note that any given remailer cannot see the contents of the envelopes he is remailing, provided encryption is used. (The orginal sender picks a desired trajectory through the labyrinth of remailers, encrypts in the appropriate sequence (last is innermost, then next to last, etc.), and then the remailers sequentially decrypt the outer envelopes as they get them.  Envelopes within envelopes.) 2.9.3. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt remailers be used to harass people?‚ÄùSure, so can free speech, anonymous physical mail (‚Äúpoison pen letters‚Äù), etc.With e-mail, people can screen their mail, use filters, ignore words they don‚Äôt like, etc. Lots of options. ‚ÄúSticks and stones‚Äù and all that stuff we learned in Kindergarten (well, I‚Äôm never sure what the the Gen Xers learned‚Ä¶.).Extortion is made somewhat easier by anonymous mailers, but extortion threats can be made in other ways, such as via physical mail, or from payphones, etc.Physical actions, threats, etc. are another matter. Not the domain of crypto, per se.2.10. Surveillance and Privacy2.10.1. ‚ÄúDoes the NSA monitor this list?‚ÄùProbably. We‚Äôve been visible enough, and there are many avenues for monitoring or even subscribing to the List. Many aliases, many points of presence.some concerns that Cypherpunks list has been infiltrated and is a ‚Äúround up list‚ÄùThere have even been anonymous messages purporting to name likely CIA, DIA, and NSA spooks. (‚ÄúBe aware.‚Äù)Remember, the list of subscribers is not a secret‚Äìit can be gotten by sending a ‚Äúwho cypherpunks‚Äù message to majordomo@toad.com. Anyone in the world can do this.2.10.2. ‚ÄúIs this list illegal?‚ÄùDepends on the country. In the U.S., there are very strong protections against ‚Äúprior restraint‚Äù for published material, so the list is fairly well -protected‚Ä¶.shutting it down would create a First Amendment case of major importance. Which is unlikely. Conspiracy and sedition laws are more complex to analyze; there are no indications that material here or on the list is illegal.Advocacy of illegal acts (subversion of export laws, espionage, etc.) is generally legal. Even advocating the overthrow of the government.The situation in other countries is different. Some countries ban unapproved encryption, so this list is suspect.Practically speaking, anyone reading this list is probably in a place which either makes no attempt to control encryption or is unable to monitor what crosses its borders.2.10.3. ‚ÄúCan keystrokes really be monitored remotely? How likely is   this?‚ÄùYes. Van Eck, RF, monitors, easy (it is claimed) to build thisHow likely? Depends on who you are. Ames, the KGB spy, was probably monitored near the end, but I doubt many of us are. The costs are simply too high‚Ä¶the vans outside, the personnel needed, etc.the real hazards involve making it ‚Äúeasy‚Äù and ‚Äúalmost automatic‚Äù for such monitoring, such as with Clipper and EES. Then they essentially just flip a switch and the monitoring happens‚Ä¶no muss, no fuss.2.10.4. ‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt some crimes be stopped if the government could   monitor what it wanted to?‚ÄùSure. This is an old story. Some criminals would be caught if their diaries could be examined. Television cameras in all homes would reduce crimes of ‚Ä¶. (Are you listening, Winston?).Orwell, fascism, surveillance states, what have you got to hide, etc.2.11. Legal2.11.1. ‚ÄúCan encryption be banned?‚Äùham operators, shortwaveil gelepal, looi to waptime aolditolqhow is this any different from requiring speech in some language?    Navaho code talkers of WW2,,,,modern parallel2.11.2. ‚ÄúWill the government try to ban encryption?‚ÄùThis is of course the major concern most of us have about Clipper and the Escrowed Encryption Standard in general. Even if we think the banning of crypto will ultimately be a failure (‚Äúworse than Prohibition,‚Äù someone has said), such a ban could make things very uncomfortable for many and would be a serious abridgement of basic liberties.We don‚Äôt know, but we fear something along these lines. It will be difficult to enforce such a ban, as so many avenues for communication exist, and encrypted messages may be hard to detect.Their goal, however, may be control and the chilling effect that using ‚Äúcivil forfeiture‚Äù may have on potential crypto users. Like the drug laws. (Whit Diffie was the first to emphasize this motivation.)2.11.3. ‚ÄúHow could encryption be banned?‚Äùmost likely way: restrictions on networks, a la airwaves or postal servicecould cite various needs, but absent a mechanism as above, hard to doan outright  ban, enforced with civil forfeiture penaltieswartime sorts of policies (crypto treated as sedition, treason‚Ä¶some high-profile prison sentences)scenario posted by Sandfort?2.11.4. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the situation about export of crypto?‚ÄùThere‚Äôs been much debate about this, with the case of Phil Zimmermann possibly being an important test case, should charges be filed.    as of 1994-09, the Grand Jury in San Jose has not said anything (it‚Äôs been about 7-9 months since they started on this issue)Dan Bernstein has argued that ITAR covers nearly all aspects of exporting crypto material, including codes, documentation, and even ‚Äúknowledge.‚Äù (Controversially, it may be in violation of ITAR for knowledgeable crypto people to even leave the country with the intention of developing crypto tools overseas.)The various distributions of PGP that have occurred via anonymous ftp sources don‚Äôt imply that ITAR is not being enforced, or won‚Äôt be in the future.2.11.5. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the legal status of digital signatures?‚ÄùNot yet tested in court. Ditto for most crypto protocols, including digital timestamping, electronic contracts, issues of lost keys, etc.2.11.6. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt I just claim I forgot my password?‚Äù2.11.7. ‚ÄúIs it dangerous to talk openly about these ideas?‚ÄùDepends on your country. In some countries, perhaps no. In the U.S., there‚Äôs not much they can do (though folks should be aware that the Cypherpunks have received a lot of attention by the media and by policy makers, and so a vocal presence on this list very likely puts one on a list of crypto trouble makers).Some companies may also feel views expressed here are not consistent with their corporate policies. Your mileage may vary.Sedition and treason laws are not likely to be applicable.some Cypherpunks think soOthers of us take the First Amendment pretty seriously: that all talk is permissableNSA agents threatened to have Jim Bidzos killed2.11.8. ‚ÄúDoes possession of a key mean possession of identity?‚ÄùIf I get your key, am I you?Certainly not outside the context of the cryptographic transaction. But within the context of a transaction, yes. Additional safeguards/speedbumps can be inserted (such as biometric credentials, additional passphrases, etc.), but these are essentially part of the ‚Äúkey,‚Äù so the basic answer remains ‚Äúyes.‚Äù (There are periodically concerns raised about this, citing the dangers of having all identity tied to a single credential, or number, or key. Well, there are ways to handle this, such as by adopting protocols that limit one‚Äôs exposure, that limits the amount of money that can be withdrawn, etc. Or people can adopt protocols that require additional security, time delays, countersigning, etc.)This may be tested in court soon enough, but the answer for many contracts and crypto transactions will be that possession of key = possession of identity. Even a court test may mean little, for the types of transactions I expect to see.    That is, in anonymous systems, ‚Äúwho ya gonna sue?‚ÄùSo, guard your key.2.12. Digital Cash2.12.1. ‚ÄúWhat is digital money?‚Äù2.12.2. ‚ÄúWhat are the main uses of strong crypto for business and   economic transactions?‚ÄùSecure communications. Ensuring privacy of transaction records (avoiding eavesdroppes, competitors)Digital signatures on contracts (will someday be standard)Digital cash.Reputations.Data Havens. That bypass local laws about what can be stored and what can‚Äôt (e.g., silly rules on how far back credit records can go).2.12.3. ‚ÄúWhat are smart cards and how are they used?‚ÄùMost smart cards as they now exist are very far from being the anonymous digital cash of primary interest to us. In fact, most of them are just glorified credit cards.    with no gain to consumers, since consumes typically don‚Äôt pay for losses by fraud(so to entice consumes, will they offer inducements?)Can be either small computers, typically credit-card-sized, or  just cards that control access via local computers.Tamper-resistant modules, e.g., if tampered with, they destroy the important data or at the least give evidence of having been tampered with.

Crypto Anarchy2.13.1. ‚ÄúWhat is Crypto Anarchy?‚ÄùSome of us believe various forms of strong cryptography will cause the power of the state to decline, perhaps even collapse fairly abruptly. We believe the expansion into cyberspace, with secure communications, digital money, anonymity and pseudonymity, and other crypto-mediated interactions, will profoundly change the nature of economies and social interactions.Governments will have a hard time collecting taxes, regulating the behavior of individuals and corporations (small ones at least), and generally coercing folks when it can‚Äôt even tell what continent folks are on!Read Vinge‚Äôs ‚ÄúTrue Names‚Äù and Card‚Äôs ‚ÄúEnder‚Äôs Game‚Äù for some fictional inspirations. ‚ÄúGalt‚Äôs Gulch‚Äù in cyberspace, what the Net is rapidly becoming already.I call this set of ideas ‚Äúcrypto anarchy‚Äù (or ‚Äúcrypto- anarchy,‚Äù as you wish) and have written about this extensively. The magazines ‚ÄúWired‚Äù (issue 1.2), ‚ÄúWhole Earth Review‚Äù (Summer, 1993), and ‚ÄúThe Village Voice‚Äù (Aug. 6th, 1993) have all carried good articles on this.2.13.2. The Crypto Anarchist Manifestoa complete copy of my 1988 pastiche of the Communisto Manifesto is included in the chapter on Crypto Anarchy.it needs rewriting, but for historical sake I‚Äôve left it unchanged.I‚Äôm proud that so much of it remains accurate.2.13.3. ‚ÄúWhat is BlackNet?‚ÄùBlackNet ‚Äì an experiment in information markets, using anonymous message pools for exchange of instructions and items. Tim May‚Äôs experiment in guerilla ontology.BlackNet ‚Äì an experimental scheme devised by T. May to underscore the nature of anonymous information markets. ‚ÄúAny and all‚Äù secrets can be offered for sale via anonymous mailers and message pools. The experiment was leaked via remailer to the Cypherpunks list (not by May) and thence to several dozen Usenet groups by Detweiler. The authorities are said to be investigating it.2.13.4. ‚ÄúWhat effect will crypto have on governments?‚ÄùA huge topic, one I‚Äôve been thinking about since late 1987 when it dawned on me that public key crypto and anonymous digital cash systems, information markets, etc. meant the end of governments as we know them. (I called this development ‚Äúcrypto anarchy.‚Äù Not everyone is a fan of it. But it‚Äôs coming, and fast.)‚ÄúPutting the NSA out of business,‚Äù as the NYT article put itEspionage is changing. To pick one example, ‚Äúdigital dead drops.‚Äù Any message can be sent through an untraceable path with remailers‚Ä¶.and then posted in encrypted form in a newsgroup readable in most countries, including the Former Soviet Union. This means the old stand by of the microfilm in a Coke can left by a certain tree on a rural road‚Äìa method fraught with delays, dangers, and hassles‚Äìis now passe. The same message can be send from the comfort of one‚Äôs home securely and untraceably. Even with a a digital signature to prevent spoofing and disinformation. This spy can be a Lockheed worker on the Aurora program, a SIGINT officer at Woomera, or a disgruntled chip designer at Motorola.  (Yes, a countermeasure is to limit access to personal computers, to run only standard software that has no such crypto capability. Such embargoes may already apply to some in sensitive positions, and may someday be a condition of employment.)Money-launderingTax collection. International consultants. Perpetual tourists. Virtual corporations.Terrorism, assassination, crime, Triads, Yakuza, Jamaicans, Russian Mafia‚Ä¶virtual networks‚Ä¶ Aryan Nation gone digital2.13.5. ‚ÄúHow quickly could something like crypto anarchy come?‚ÄùParts of it are happening already, though the changes in the world are not something I take any credit for. Rather, there are ongoing changes in the role of nations, of power, and of the ability to coerce behaviors. When people can drop out of systems they don‚Äôt like, can move to different legal or tax jurisdictions, then things change.But a phase change could occur quickly, just as the Berlin Wall was impregnable one day, and down the next.    ‚ÄúPublic anger grows quietly and explodes suddenly. T.C. May‚Äôs ‚Äúphase change‚Äù may be closer than we think. Nobody in Russia in 1985 really thought the country would fall apart in 6 years.‚Äù [Mike Ingle, 1994-01-01]2.13.6. ‚ÄúCould strong crypto be used for sick and disgusting and dangerous purposes?‚ÄùOf course. So can locked doors, but we don‚Äôt insist on an ‚Äúopen door policy‚Äù (outside of certain quaint sorority and rooming houses!) So do many forms of privacy allow plotters, molestors, racists, etc. to meet and plot.Crypto is in use by the Aryan Nation, by both pro- and anti- abortion groups, and probably by other kinds of terrorists. Expect more uses in the future, as things like PGP continue to spread.Many of us are explicity anti-democratic, and hope to use encryption to undermine the so-called democratic governments of the world2.13.7. ‚ÄúWhat is the Dining Cryptographers Problem, and why is it so   important?‚ÄùThis is dealt with in the main section, but here‚Äôs David Chaum‚Äôs Abstract, from his 1988 paper‚Äù    Abstract: ‚ÄúKeeping confidential who sends which messages, in a world where any physical transmission can be traced to its origin, seems impossible. The solution presented here is unconditionally or cryptographically secure, depending on whether it is based on one-time-use keys or on public keys. respectively. It can be adapted to address efficiently a wide variety of practical considerations.‚Äù [‚ÄúThe Dining Cryptographers Problem: Unconditional Sender and Recipient Untraceability,‚Äù David Chaum, Journal of Cryptology, I, 1, 1988.]-DC-nets have yet to be implemented, so far as I know, but they represent a ‚Äúpurer‚Äù version of the physical remailers we are all so familiar with now. Someday they‚Äôll have have a major impact. (I‚Äôm a bigger fan of this work than many seem to be, as there is little discussion in sci.crypt and the like.)2.13.8. ‚ÄúWhy won‚Äôt government simply ban  such encryption methods?‚ÄùThis has always been the Number One Issue!    raised by Stiegler, Drexler, Salin, and several others (and in fact raised by some as an objection to my even discussing these issues, namely, that action may then be taken to head off the world I describe)Types of Bans on Encryption and Secrecy    Ban on Private Use of EncryptionBan on Store-and-Forward NodesBan on Tokens and ZKIPS AuthenticationRequirement for public disclosure of all transactionsRecent news (3-6-92, same day as Michaelangelo and Lawnmower Man) that government is proposing a surcharge on telcos and long distance services to pay for new equipment needed to tap phones!        S.266 and related billsthis was argued in terms of stopping drug dealers and other criminalsbut how does the government intend to deal with the various forms fo end-user encryption or ‚Äúconfusion‚Äù (the confusion that will come from compression, packetizing, simple file encryption, etc.)Types of Arguments Against Such Bans    The ‚ÄúConstitutional Rights‚Äù ArgumentsThe ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Too Late‚Äù Arguments        PCs are already widely scattered, running dozens of compression and encryption programs‚Ä¶it is far too late to insist on ‚Äúin the clear‚Äù broadcasts, whatever those may be (is program code distinguishable from encrypted messages? No.)encrypted faxes, modem scramblers (albeit with some restrictions)wireless LANs, packets, radio, IR, compressed text and images, etc‚Ä¶.all will defeat any efforts short of police state intervention (which may still happen)The ‚ÄúFeud Within the NSA‚Äù Arguments        COMSEC vs. PRODWill affect the privacy rights of corporations        and there is much evidence that corporations are in fact being spied upon, by foreign governments, by the NSA, etc.They Will Try to Ban Such Encryption Techniques    Stings (perhaps using viruses and logic bombs)        or ‚Äúbarium,‚Äù to trace the codeLegal liability for companies that allow employees to use such methods        perhaps even in their own time, via the assumption that employees who use illegal software methods in their own time are perhaps couriers or agents for their corporations (a tenuous point)2.13.9. ‚ÄúCould anonymous markets facilitate repugnant services, such as killings for hire?‚ÄùYes, though there are some things which will help lessen the full impact.To make this brutally concrete, here‚Äôs how escrow makes murder contracts much safer than they are today to negotiate. Instead of one party being caught in an FBI sting, as is so often the case when amateurs try to arrange hits, they can use an escrow service to insulate themselves from:From being traced, because the exchanges are handled via pseudonymsFrom the killer taking the money and then not performing the hit, because the escrow agent holds the money until the murder is verified (according to some prototocol, such a newspaper report‚Ä¶again, an area for more work, thankfully).From being arrested when the money is picked up, as this is all done via digital cash.There are some ways to reduce the popularity of this Murder, Incorporated system. (Things I‚Äôve been thinking about for about 6 years, and which we discussed on the Cypherpunks list and on the Extropians list.)2.14. Miscellaneous2.14.1. ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt people just agree on an approach?‚Äù‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt everyone just support my proposal?‚Äù‚ÄúI‚Äôve proposed a new cipher, but nobody‚Äôs interested‚Ä¶you Cypherpunks just never do anything!‚ÄùThis is one of the most consistently divisive issues on the list. Often a person will become enamored of some approach, will write posts exhorting others to become similarly enamored, urging others to ‚Äúdo something!,‚Äù and will then, when no interest is evidenced, become irate. To be more concrete, this happens most often with various and sundry proposals for ‚Äúdigital money.‚Äù A close second is for various types of ‚ÄúCypherpunks activism,‚Äù with proposals that we get together and  collect a few million dollars to run Ross Perot-type advertisements urging people to use PGP, with calls for a ‚ÄúCypherpunks radio show,‚Äù and so on. (Nothing wrong with people doing these things, I suppose. The problem lies in the exhortation of others to do these things.)This collective action is always hard to achieve, and rightly so, in my opinion. Emergent behavior is more natural, and more efficient. And hence better.the nature of markets, agents, different agendas and goals    real standards and markets evolvesometimes because of a compelling exemplar (the Walkman, PGP), sometimes because of hard work by standards committees (NTSC, electric sockets, etc.)but almost never by simple appeals to correctness or ideological rightness2.14.2. ‚ÄúWhat are some of the practical limits on the deployment of crypto, especially things like digital cash and remailers?‚ÄùLack of reliable services    Nodes go down, students go home for the summer, downtime for various reasonsLack of robustness2.14.3. ‚ÄúIs crypto dominated by mistrust? I get the impression that   everything is predicated on mutual mistrust.‚ÄùWe lock our doors‚Ä¶does this mean we are lacking in trust? No, it means we understand there are some out there who will exploit unlocked doors. Ditto for the crypto world.‚ÄúTrust, but verify,‚Äù as Ronald Reagan used to say. Mutual mistrust can actually make for a more trustworthy environment, paradoxical as that may sound. ‚ÄúEven paranoids have enemies.‚ÄùThe danger in a trusting environment that lacks other mechanisms is that ‚Äúpredators‚Äù or ‚Äúdefectors‚Äù (in game- theoretic terms) can exploit this trusting environment. Confidence games, scams, renegging on deals, and even outright theft.Crypto offers the opportunity for ‚Äúmutually suspicious agents‚Äù to interact without explicit ‚Äútrust.‚Äù2.14.4. ‚ÄúWho is Detweiler?‚ÄùS. Boxx, an12070, ldxxyyy, Pablo Escobar, Hitler, Linda Lollipop, Clew Lance Simpleton, tmp@netcom.com, Jim Riverman    often with my sig block, or variants of it, attachedeven my phone numberhe lost his ColoState account for such tactics‚Ä¶electrocrisycypherwonks2.14.5. ‚ÄúWho is Sternlight?‚ÄùA retired policy analyst who is often contentious in Usenet groups and supportive of government policies on crypto policy. Not nearly as bad as Detweiler.2.15. More Information and References2.15.1. ‚ÄúWhere can I find more information?‚ÄùWell, this is a start. Also, lots of other FAQs and Mosaic home pages (URLs) exist, encompassing a vast amount of knowledge.As long as this FAQ is, it can only scratch the surface on many topics. (I‚Äôm especially amused when someone says they‚Äôve looked for a FAQ on some obscure topic. No FAQ is likely to answer all questions, especially obcure ones.)Many articles and papers are available at the ftp.csua.berkeley.edu site, in pub/cypherpunks. Look around there. The 1981 Chaum paper on untraceabel e-mail is not (too many equations for easy scanning), but the 1988 paper on Dining Cryptographers Nets is. (I laboriously scanned it and OCRed it, back when I used to have the energy to do such thankless tasks.)Some basic sources:    Sci.crypt FAQ, published regularly, Also available by anonymous ftp at rtfm.mit.edu. And in various URLs, including:        URLs for sci.crypt FAQ: xxxxxxRSA Data Security Inc. FAQBruce Schneier‚Äôs ‚ÄúApplied Cryptography‚Äù book, 1993. Every reader of this list should get this book!The ‚Äúonline generation‚Äù tends to want all material online, I know, but most of the good stuff is to be found in paper form, in journals and books. This is likely to be the case for many years to come, given the limitation of ASCII, the lack of widespread standards (yes, I know about LaTex, etc.), and the academic prestige associated with bound journals and books. Fortunately, you can all find universit libraries within driving range. Take my advice: if you do not spend at least an entire Saturday immersing yourself in the crypto literature in the math section of a large library, perusing the ‚ÄúProceeedings of the Crypto Conference‚Äù volumes, scanning the textbooks, then you have a poor foundation for doing any crypto work.2.15.2. ‚ÄúThings are changing quickly. Not all of the addresses and   URLs given here are valid. And the software versions‚Ä¶ How   do I get the latest information?‚ÄùYes, things are changing quickly. This document can‚Äôt possibly keep up with the rapid changes (nor can its author!).Reading the various newsgroups is, as always, the best way to hear what‚Äôs happening on a day to day basis. Web pages, gopher, archie, veronica, etc. should show the latest versions of popular software packages.2.15.3. ‚ÄúFUQs: ‚ÄúFrequently Unanswered Questions‚Äù?‚Äù(more to be added)With 700 or more people on the Cypherpunks list (as of 94- 09), it is inevitable that some FAQs will go unanswered when newbies (or others) ask them. Sometimes the FUQs are ignored because they‚Äôre so stale, other times because to answer them is to continue and unfruitful thread.‚ÄúP = NP?‚Äù    Steve Smale has called this the most important new unsolved problem of the past half-century.If P were (unexpectedly) proved to be NPIs RSA and factoring in NP?    not yet provedfactoring might be easierand RSA might be easier than factoring in general (e.g., chosen- and known-plaintext may provide clues)‚ÄúWill encryption be outlawed? What will happen?‚Äù‚ÄúIs David Sternlight an NSA agent?‚Äù    Seriously, David S. is probably what he claims: a retired economist who was once very senior in government and corporate policy circles. I have no reason to doubt him.He has views at odds with most of us, and a baiting style of expressing his views, but this does not mean he is a government agent as so many people claim.Not in the same class as Detweiler.Cypherpunks ‚Äì History, Organization, Agenda3.1. copyright   THE  CYPHERNOMICON: Cypherpunks FAQ and More, Version 0.666,   1994-09-10, Copyright Timothy C.

Main PointsCypherpunks formed in September, 1992formed at an opportune time, with PGP 2.0, Clipper, etc. hittingearly successes: Cypherpunks remailers, publicity 3.2.2. Connections to Other Sections 3.2.3. Where to Find Additional Information‚ÄúWired,‚Äù issue 1.2, had a cover story on Cypherpunks.‚ÄúWhole Earth Review,‚Äù Summer 1993, had a long article on crypto and Cypherpunks (included in the book ‚ÄúOut of Control,‚Äù by Kevin Kelly.‚ÄúVillage Voice,‚Äù August 6th (?). 1993, had cover story on ‚ÄúCrypto Rebels‚Äù (also reprinted in local weeklies)and numerous articles in various magazines 3.2.4. Miscellaneous Commentsthe best way to get a feel for the List is to simply read it for a while; a few months should do.3.3. The Cypherpunks Group and List 3.3.1. What is it?Formal Rules, Charter, etc.?    no formal rules or charterno agreed-upon mission 3.3.2. ‚ÄúWho are the Cypherpunks?‚ÄùA mix of about 500-700Can find out who by sending message to majordomo@toad.com with the message body text ‚Äúwho cypherpunks‚Äù (no quotes, of course).    Is this a privacy flaw? Maybe.Lots of students (they have the time, the Internet accounts). Lots of computer science/programming folks. Lots of libertarians.quote from Wired article, and from ‚ÄúWhole Earth Review‚Äù 3.3.3. ‚ÄúHow did the Cypherpunks group get started?‚ÄùHistory?    Discussions between Eric Hughes and me, led to Eric‚Äôs decision to host a gatheringFirst meeting was, by coincidence, the same week that PGP 2.0 was released‚Ä¶we all got copies that day        morning session on basicssitting on the floorafternoon we played the ‚ÄúCrypto Game‚Äù            remailers, digital money, information for sale, etc.John Gilmore offered his site to host a mailing list, and his company‚Äôs offices to hold monthly meetingsThe mailing list began almost immediatelyThe Name ‚ÄúCypherpunks‚Äù? 3.3.4. ‚ÄúShould I join the  Cypherpunks mailing list?‚ÄùIf you are reading this, of course, you are most likely on the Cypherpunks list already and this point is moot‚Äìyou may instead be asking if you should_leave_  the List!Only if you are prepared to handle 30-60 messages a day, with volumes fluctuating wildly 3.3.5. ‚ÄúHow can I join the Cypherpunk mailing list?‚Äùsend message to ‚Äúmajordomo@toad.com‚Äù with a body text of ‚Äúsubscribe cypherpunks‚Äù (no quote marks in either, of course). 3.3.6. ‚ÄúMembership?‚Äùabout 500-700 at any given timemany folks join, are overwhelmed, and quitother groups: Austin, Colorado, Boston, U.K. 3.3.7. ‚ÄúWhy are there so many libertarians on the Cypherpunks list?‚ÄùThe same question is often asked about the Net in general. Lots of suggested reasons:    A list like Cypherpunks is going to have privacy and freedom advocates. Not all privacy advocates are libertarians (e.g., they may want laws restricting data collection), but many are. And libertarians naturally gravitate to causes like ours.Net grew anarchically, with little control. This appeals to free-wheeling types, used to making their own choices and building their own worlds.Libertarians are skeptical of central control structures, as are most computer programming types. They are skeptical that a centrally-run control system can coordinate the needs and desires of people. (They are of course more than just ‚Äúskeptical‚Äù about this.)In any case, there‚Äôs not much of a coherent ‚Äúopposition camp‚Äù to the anarcho-capitalist, libertarian ideology. Forgive me for saying this, my non-libertarian friends on the list, but most non-libertarian ideologies I‚Äôve seen expressed on the list have been fragmentary, isolated, and not coherent‚Ä¶comments about ‚Äúhow do we take care of the poor?‚Äù and Christian fundamentalism, for example. If there is a coherent alternative to a basically libertarian viewpoint, we haven‚Äôt seen it on the list.(Of course, some might say that the libertarians outshout the alternatives‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt think this is really so.) 3.3.8. ‚ÄúHow did the mailing list get started?‚ÄùHugh Daniel, Eric Hughes, and I discussed this the day after the first meetingmailing list brought together diverse interestsHow to hoin? 3.3.9. ‚ÄúHow did Cypherpunks get so much early publicity?‚Äùstarted at the right time, just as PGP was gaining popularity, as plans for key escrow were being laid (I sounded an alarm in October, 1992, six months before the Clipper announcement), and just as ‚ÄúWired‚Äù was preparing its first issueKevin Kelly and Steven Levy attended some of our early meetings, setting the stage for very favorable major stories in ‚ÄúWired‚Äù (issue 1.2, the cover story), and ‚ÄúWhole Earth Review‚Äù (Summer, 1993)a niche for a ‚Äúrenegade‚Äù and ‚Äúmonkey-wrenching‚Äù group, with less of a Washington focuspublicity in ‚ÄúWired,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Whole Earth Review,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Village Voice‚ÄùClipper bombshell occupied much of our time, with some effect on policy    climate of repudiationlinks to EFF, CPSR, etc.3.3.10. ‚ÄúWhy the name?‚ÄùJude Milhon nicknames uscypherpunkts? (by analogy with Mikropunkts, microdots)3.3.11. ‚ÄúWhat were the early meetings like?‚Äùcypherspiel, Crypto Anarchy Game3.3.12. ‚ÄúWhere are places that I can meet other Cypherpunks?‚Äùphysical meetingsstart your own‚Ä¶pizza place, classroomother organizations‚ÄúThese kind of meetings (DC 2600 meeting at Pentagon City Mall, 1st Fri. of        every month in the food court, about 5-7pm or so) might be good places forlocal cypherpunks gatherings as well.  I‚Äôm sure there are a lot of othersuch meetings, but the DC and Baltimore ones are the ones I know of.  <Stanton McCandlish, 7 April 1994>(note that the DC area already meets‚Ä¶)Hackers, ravesregional meetings3.3.13. ‚ÄúIs the Cypherpunks list monitored? Has it been infiltrated?‚ÄùUnknown. It wouldn‚Äôt be hard for anyone to be monitoring the list.As to infiltration, no evidence for this. No suspicious folks showing up at the physical meetings, at least so far as I can see. (Not a very reliable indication.)3.3.14. ‚ÄúWhy isn‚Äôt there a recruiting program to increase the number   of Cypherpunks?‚ÄùGood question. The mailing list reached about 500 subscribers a year or so ago and has remained relatively constant since then; many subscribers learned of the list and its address in the various articles that appeared.Informal organizations often level out in membership because no staff exists to publicize, recruit, etc. And size is limited because a larger group loses focus. So, some stasis is achieved. For us, it may be at the 400-700 level. It seems unlikely that list membership would ever get into the tens of thousands.3.3.15. ‚ÄúWhy have there been few real achievements in crypto   recently?‚ÄùDespite the crush of crypto releases‚Äìthe WinPGPs, SecureDrives, and dozen other such programs‚Äìthe fact is that most of these are straightforward variants on what I think have been the two major product classes to be introduced in the last several years‚Äù    PGP, and variants.Remailers, and variants.These two main classes account for about 98% of all product- or version-oriented debate on the Net, epitomized by the zillions of ‚ÄúWhere can I find PGP2.6ui for the Amiga?‚Äù sorts of posts.Why is this so? Why have these dominated? What else is needed?    First, PGP gave an incredible impetus to the whole issue of public use of crypto. It brought crypto to the masses, or at least to the Net-aware masses. Second, the nearly simultaneous appearance of remailers (the Kleinpaste/Julf- style and the Cypherpunks ‚Äúmix‚Äù-style) fit in well with the sudden awareness about PGP and crypto issues. And other simultaneous factors appeared:        the appearance of ‚ÄúWired‚Äù and its spectacular success, in early 1993the Clipper chip firestorm, beginning in April 1993the Cypherpunks group got rolling in late 1992, reaching public visibility in several articles in 1993. (By the end of ‚Äò93, we seemed to be a noun, as Bucky might‚Äôve said.)But why so little progress in other important areas?        digital money, despite at least a dozen reported projects, programs (only a few of which are really anything like Chaum‚Äôs ‚Äúdigital cash‚Äù)data havens, information markets, etc.money-laundering schemes, etc.What could change this?    Mosaic, WWW, WebA successful digital cash effort3.4. Beliefs, Goals, Agenda 3.4.1. ‚ÄúIs there a set of beliefs that most Cypherpunks support?‚ÄùThere is nothing official (not much is), but there is an emergent, coherent set of beliefs which most list members seem to hold:    that the government should not be able to snoop into our affairsthat protection of conversations and exchanges is a basic rightthat these rights may need to be secured through technology rather than through lawthat the power of technology often creates new political realities (hence the list mantra: ‚ÄúCypherpunks write code‚Äù)Range of Beliefs    Many are libertarian, most support rights of privacy, some are more radical in apppoach 3.4.2. ‚ÄúWhat are Cypherpunks interested in?‚Äùprivacytechnologyencryitionpoliticscrypto anarchydigital moneyprotocols 3.4.3. Personal Privacy and Collapse of GovernmentsThere seem to be two main reasons people are drawn to Cypherpunks, besides the general attractiveness of a ‚Äúcool‚Äù group such as ours. The first reason is personal privacy. That is, tools for ensuring privacy, protection from a surveillance society, and individual choice. This reason is widely popular, but is not always compelling (after all, why worry about personal privacy and then join a list that has been identified as a ‚Äúsubversive‚Äù group by the Feds? Something to think about.)The second major is personal liberty through reducing the power of governments to coerce and tax. Sort of a digital Galt‚Äôs Gulch, as it were. Libertarians and anarchocapitalists are especially drawn to this vision, a vision which may bother conventional liberals (when they realize strong crypto means things counter to welfare, AFDC, antidiscrimination laws‚Ä¶.).This second view is more controversial, but is, in my opinion, what really powers the list. While others may phrase it differently,  most of us realize we are on to something that will change‚Äìand already is changing‚Äìthe nature of the balance of power between individuals and larger entities. 3.4.4.  Why is Cypherpunks called an ‚Äúanarchy‚Äù?Anarchy means ‚Äúwithout a leader‚Äù (head). Much more common than people may think.The association with bomb-throwing ‚Äúanarchists‚Äù is misleading. 3.4.5. Why is there no formal agenda, organization, etc.?no voting, no organization to administer such things‚Äúif it ain‚Äôt broke, don‚Äôt fix it‚Äùand it‚Äôs how it all got started and evolvedalso, nobody to arrest and hassle, no nonsense about filling out forms and getting tax exemptions, no laws about campaign law violations (if we were a formal group and lobbied against Senator Foo, could be hit with the law limiting ‚Äúspecial interests,‚Äù conceivably) 3.4.6. How are projects proposed and completed?If an anarchy, how do things get done?The way most things get done: individual actions and market decisions. 3.4.7.

This often comes up in two contexts:Charges of hypocrisy because people either use pseudonyms or, paradoxically, that they don‚Äôt use pseudonyms, digital signatures3.4.17. ‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt crypto be regulated?‚ÄùMany people make comparisons to the regulation of automobiles, of the radio spectrum, and even of guns. The comparison of crypto to guns is especially easy to make, and especially dangerous.  -A better comparison is ‚Äúuse of crypto = right to speak as you wish.‚Äù    That is, we cannot demand that people speak in a language or form that is easily understandable by eavesdroppers, wiretappers, and spies.If I choose to speak to my friends in Latvian, or in Elihiuish, or in        triple DES, that‚Äôs my business. (Times of true war, as in World WarII, may be slightly different. As a libertarian, I‚Äôm not advocatingthat, but I understand the idea that in times of war speaking in codeis suspect. We are not in a time of war, and haven‚Äôt been.)-Should we have ‚Äúspeech permits‚Äù? After all, isn‚Äôt the regulation ofspeech consistent with the regulation of automobiles?I did a satirical essay along these lines a while back. I won‚Äôtincluded it here, though. (My speech permit for satire expired and Ihaven‚Äôt had time to get it renewed.)In closing, the whole comparison of cryptography to armaments ismisleading. Speaking or writing in forms not readily understandable toyour enemies, your neighbors, your spouse, the cops, or your localeavesdropper is as old as humanity.3.4.18. Emphasize the ‚Äúvoluntary‚Äù nature of cryptothose that don‚Äôt want privacy, can choose not to use crypto    just as they can take the locks of their doors, install wiretaps on their phones, remove their curtains so as not to interfere with peeping toms and police surveillance teams, etc.as PRZ puts it, they can write all their letters on postcards, because they have ‚Äúnothing to hide‚Äùwhat we want to make sure doesn‚Äôt happen is others insisting that we cannot use crypto to maintain our own privacy‚ÄúBut what if criminals have access to crypto and can keep secrets?‚Äù    this comes up over and over againdoes this mean locks should not exist, or‚Ä¶..?3.4.19. ‚ÄúAre most Cypherpunks anarchists?‚ÄùMany are, but probably not most. The term ‚Äúanarchy‚Äù is often misunderstood.As Perry Metzger puts it ‚ÄúNow, it happpens that I am an anarchist, but that isn‚Äôt what most people associated with the term ‚Äúcypherpunk‚Äù believe in, and it isn‚Äôt fair to paint them that way ‚Äì hell, many people on this mailing list are overtly hostile to anarchism.‚Äù [P.M., 1994-07-01]comments of Sherry Mayo, othersBut the libertarian streak is undeniably strong. And libertarians who think about the failure of politics and the implications of cryptgraphy generally come to the anarcho-capitalist or crypto-anarchist point of view.In any case, the ‚Äúother side‚Äù has not been very vocal in espousing a consistent ideology that combines strong crypto and things like welfare, entitlements, and high tax rates. (I am not condemning them. Most of my leftist friends turn out to believe in roughly the same things I believe in‚Ä¶they just attach different labels and have negative reactions to words like ‚Äúcapitalist.‚Äù)3.4.20. ‚ÄúWhy is there so much ranting on the list?‚ÄùArguments go on and on, points get made dozens of times, flaming escalates. This has gotten to be more of a problem in recent months. (Not counting the spikes when Detweiler was around.)Several reasons:    the arguments are often matters of opinion, not fact, and hence people just keep repeating their arguments        made worse by the fact that many people are too lazy to do off-line reading, to learn about what they are expressing an opinion onsince nothing ever gets resolved, decided, vote upon, etc., the debates continuesince anyone is free to speak up at any time, some people will keep making the same points over and over again, hoping to win through repetition (I guess)since people usually don‚Äôt personally know the other members of the list, this promotes ranting (I‚Äôve noticed that the people who know each other, such as the Bay Area folks, tend not to be as rude to each other‚Ä¶any sociologist or psychologist would know why this is so immediately).        the worst ranters tend to be the people who are most isolated from the other members of the list community; this is generally a well-known phenomenon of the Net            and is yet more reason for regional Cypherpunks groups to occasionally meet, to at least make some social and conversational connections with folks in their region.on the other hand, rudeness is often warranted; people who assault me and otherwise plan to deprive me of my property of deserving of death, not just insults [Don‚Äôt be worried, there are only a handful of people on this list I would be happy to see dead, and on none of them would I expend the $5000 it might take to buy a contract. Of course, rates could drop.]3.4.21. The ‚Äúrejectionist‚Äù stance so many Cypherpunks havethat compromise rarely helps when very basic issues are involvedthe experience with the NRA trying compromise, only to find ever-more-repressive laws passedthe debacle with the EFF and their ‚ÄúEFF Digital Telephony Bill‚Äù (‚ÄúWe couldn‚Äôt have put this bill together without your help‚Äù) shows the corruption of power; I‚Äôm ashamed to have ever been a member of the EFF, and will of course not be renewing my membership.I have jokingly suggested we need a ‚ÄúPopular Front for the Liberation of Crypto,‚Äù by analogy with the PFLP.3.4.22. ‚ÄúIs the Cypherpunks group an illegal or seditious   organization?‚ÄùWell, there are those ‚ÄúCypherpunk Criminal‚Äù t-shirts a lot of us have‚Ä¶Depends on what country you‚Äôre in.Probably in a couple of dozen countries, membership would be frowned onthe material may be illegal in other countriesand many of us advocate things like using strong crypto to avoid and evade tzxes, to bypass laws we dislike, etc.3.5. Self-organizing Nature of Cypherpunks 3.5.1. Contrary to what people sometimes claim, there is no ruling   clique of Cypherpunks. Anybody is free to do nearly anything,   just not free to commit others to course of action, or   control the machine resources the list now runs on, or claim   to speak for the ‚ÄúCypherpunks‚Äù as a group (and this last   point is unenforceable except through reptutation and social   repercussions). 3.5.2. Another reason to be glad there is no formal Cypherpunks   structure, ruling body, etc., is that there is then no direct   target for lawsuits, ITAR vioalation charges, defamation or   copyright infringement claims, etc.3.6. Mechanics of the List 3.6.1. Archives of the Cyperpunks ListKarl Barrus has a selection of posts at the site chaos.bsu.edu, available via gopher. Look in the ‚ÄúCypherpunks gopher site‚Äù directory. 3.6.2. ‚ÄúWhy isn‚Äôt the list sent out in encrypted form?‚ÄùToo much hassle, no additional security, would only make people jump through extra hoops (which might be useful, but probably not worth the extra hassle and ill feelings).‚ÄúWe did this about 8 years ago at E&S using DEC VMS NOTES. We used a plain vanilla secret key algorithm and a key shared by all legitimate members of the group.  We could do it today ‚Äì but why bother?  If you have a key that widespread, it‚Äôs effectively certain that a ‚Äúwrong person‚Äù (however you define him/her) will have a copy of the key.‚Äù [Carl Ellison, Encrypted BBS?, 1993-08-02] 3.6.3. ‚ÄúWhy isn‚Äôt the list moderated?‚ÄùThis usually comes up during severe flaming episodes, notably when Detweiler is on the list in one of his various personnas. Recently, it has not come up, as things have been relatively quiet.Moderation will not happen    nobody has the time it takesnobody wants the onushardly consistent with many of our anarchist leanings, is it?        (Technically, moderation can be viewed as ‚Äúmy house, my rules, and hence OK, but I think you get my point.)‚ÄúNo, please let‚Äôs not become a ‚Äòmoderated‚Äô newsgroup.  This would be the end of freedom!  This is similar to giving the police more powers because crime is up.  While it is a tactic to fight off the invaders, a better tactic is knowledge.‚Äù [RWGreene@vnet.net, alt.gathering.rainbow, 1994- 07-06]‚Äù 3.6.4. ‚ÄúWhy isn‚Äôt the list split into smaller lists?‚ÄùWhat do you call the list outages?Seriously, several proposals to split the list into pieces have resulted in not much    a hardware group‚Ä¶never seen again, that I know ofa ‚Äúmoderated cryptography‚Äù group, dittoa DC-Net group‚Ä¶dittoseveral regional groups and meeting planning groups, which are apparently moribunda ‚ÄúDig Lib‚Äù group‚Ä¶dittouse Rishab‚Äôs comment:Reasons are clear: one large group is more successful in traffic than smaller, low-volume groups‚Ä¶out of sight, out of mind        and topics change anyway, so the need for a ‚Äústeganography‚Äù mailing list (argued vehemently for by one person, not Romana M., by the way) fades away when the debate shifts.

Miscellaneous CommentsMost of the list members are libertarians, or leaning in that direction, so the bias toward this is apparent.(If there‚Äôs a coherent non-libertarian ideology, that‚Äôs also consistent with supporting strong crypto, I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs been presented.)4.3. Why a Statement of Ideology? 4.3.1. This is perhaps a controversial area. So why include it? The   main reason is to provide some grounding for the later   comments on many issues. 4.3.2. People should not expect a uniform ideology on this list.   Some of us are anarcho-capitalist radicals (or ‚Äúcrypto   anarchists‚Äù), others of us are staid Republicans, and still   others are Wobblies and other assored leftists.4.4. ‚ÄúWelcome to Cypherpunks‚Äù 4.4.1. This is the message each new subscriber to the Cypherpunks   lists gets, by Eric Hughes: 4.4.2. ‚ÄúCypherpunks assume privacy is a good thing and wish there   were more of it.  Cypherpunks acknowledge that those who want   privacy must create it for themselves and not expect   governments, corporations, or other large, faceless   organizations to grant them privacy out of beneficence.   Cypherpunks know that people have been creating their own   privacy for centuries with whispers, envelopes, closed doors,   and couriers.  Cypherpunks do not seek to prevent other   people from speaking about their experiences or their   opinions.‚ÄúThe most important means to the defense of privacy is   encryption. To encrypt is to indicate the desire for privacy.   But to encrypt with weak cryptography is to indicate not too   much desire for privacy. Cypherpunks hope that all people   desiring privacy will learn how best to defend it.‚ÄúCypherpunks are therefore devoted to cryptography.   Cypherpunks wish to learn about it, to teach it, to implement   it, and to make more of it.  Cypherpunks know that   cryptographic protocols make social structures.  Cypherpunks   know how to attack a system and how to defend it.   Cypherpunks know just how hard it is to make good   cryptosystems.‚ÄúCypherpunks love to practice.  They love to play with public   key cryptography.  They love to play with anonymous and   pseudonymous mail forwarding and delivery.  They love to play   with DC-nets.  They love to play with secure communications   of all kinds.‚ÄúCypherpunks write code.  They know that someone has to write   code to defend privacy, and since it‚Äôs their privacy, they‚Äôre   going to write it.  Cypherpunks publish their code so that   their fellow cypherpunks may practice and play with it.   Cypherpunks realize that security is not built in a day and   are patient with incremental progress.‚ÄúCypherpunks don‚Äôt care if you don‚Äôt like the software they   write. Cypherpunks know that software can‚Äôt be destroyed.   Cypherpunks know that a widely dispersed system can‚Äôt be shut   down.‚ÄúCypherpunks will make the networks safe for privacy.‚Äù [Eric   Hughes, 1993-07-21 version]4.5. ‚ÄúCypherpunks Write Code‚Äù 4.5.1. ‚ÄúCypherpunks write code‚Äù is almost our mantra. 4.5.2. This has come to be a defining statement. Eric Hughes used it   to mean that Cypherpunks place more importance in actually   changing things, in actually getting working code out, than   in merely talking about how things ‚Äúought‚Äù to be.Eric Hughes statement needed here:Karl Kleinpaste, author of one of the early anonymous posting services (Charcoal) said this about some proposal made: ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôve got serious plans for how to implement such a thing, please implement it at least skeletally and deploy it.  Proof by example, watching such a system in action, is far better than pontification about it.‚Äù [Karl_Kleinpaste@cs.cmu.edu, news.admin.policy, 1994-06-30] 4.5.3. ‚ÄúThe admonition, ‚ÄúCypherpunks write code,‚Äù should be taken   metaphorically.  I think ‚Äúto write code‚Äù means to take   unilateral effective action as an individual.  That may mean   writing actual code, but it could also mean dumpster diving   at Mycrotronx and anonymously releasing the recovered   information.  It could also mean creating an offshore digital   bank.  Don‚Äôt get too literal on us here.  What is important   is that Cypherpunks take personal responsibility for   empowering themselves against threats to privacy.‚Äù [Sandy   Sandfort, 1994-07-08] 4.5.4. A Cypherpunks outlook: taking the abstractions of academic   conferences and making them concreteOne thing Eric Hughes and I discussed at length (for 3 days of nearly nonstop talk, in May, 1992) was the glacial rate of progress in converting the cryptographic primitive operations of the academic crypto conferences into actual, workable code. The basic RSA algorithm was by then barely available, more than 15 years after invention. (This was before PGP 2.0, and PGP 1.0 was barely available and was disappointing, with RSA Data Security‚Äôs various products in limited niches.) All the neat stuff on digital cash, DC- Nets, bit commitment, olivioius transfer, digital mixes, and so on, was completely absent, in terms of avialable code or ‚Äúcrypto ICs‚Äù (to borrow Brad Cox‚Äôs phrase). If it took 10-15 years for RSA to really appear in the real world, how long would it take some of the exciting stuff to get out?We thought it would be a neat idea to find ways to reify these things, to get actual running code. As it happened, PGP 2.0 appeared the week of our very first meeting, and both the Kleinpaste/Julf and Cypherpunks remailers were quick, if incomplete, implementations of David Chaum‚Äôs 1981 ‚Äúdigital mixes.‚Äù (Right on schedule, 11 years later.)Sadly, most of the abstractions of cryptology remain residents of academic space, with no (available) implementations in the real world. (To be sure, I suspect many people have cobbled-together versions of many of these things, in C code, whatever. But their work is more like building sand castles, to be lost when they graduate or move on to other projects. This is of course not a problem unique to cryptology.)Today, various toolkits and libraries are under development. Henry Strickland (Strick) is working on a toolkit based on John Ousterhout‚Äôs ‚ÄúTCL‚Äù system (for Unix), and of course RSADSI provides RSAREF. Pr0duct Cypher has ‚ÄúPGP Tools.‚Äù Other projects are underway. (My own longterm interest here is in building objects which act as the cryptography papers would have them act‚Ä¶building block objects. For this, I‚Äôm looking at Smalltalk of some flavor.)It is still the case that most of the modern crypto papers discuss theoretical abstractions that are not even close to being implemented as reusable, robust objects or routines. Closing the gap between theoretical papers and practical realization is a major Cypherpunk emphasis. 4.5.5. Prototypes, even if fatally flawed, allow for evolutionary   learning and improvement. Think of it as engineering in   action.4.6. Technological empowerment 4.6.1. (more needed here‚Ä¶.) 4.6.2. As Sandy Sandfort notes, ‚ÄúThe real point of Cypherpunks is   that it‚Äôs better to use strong crypto than weak crypto or no   crypto at all.  Our use of crypto doesn‚Äôt have to be totally   bullet proof to be of value.  Let them worry about the   technicalities while we make sure they have to work harder   and pay more for our encrypted info than they would if it   were in plaintext.‚Äù [S.S. 1994-07-01]4.7. Free Speech Issues 4.7.1. Speech‚ÄúPublic speech is not a series of public speeches, but rather one‚Äôs own words spoken openly and without shame‚Ä¶.I desire a society where all may speak freely about whatever topic they will. I desire that all people might be able to choose to whom they wish to speak and to whom they do not wish to speak. I desire a society where all people may have an assurance that their words are directed only at those to whom they wish.  Therefore I oppose all efforts by governments to eavesdrop and to become unwanted listeners.‚Äù [Eric Hughes, 1994-02-22]‚ÄúThe government has no right to restrict my use of cryptography in any way.  They may not forbid me to use whatever ciphers I may like, nor may they require me to use any that I do not like.‚Äù [Eric Hughes, 1993-06-01] 4.7.2. ‚ÄúShould there be any limits whatsoever on a person‚Äôs use of   cryptography?‚ÄùNo. Using the mathematics of cryptography is merely the manipulation of symbols. No crime is involved, ipso facto.Also, as Eric Hughes has pointed out, this is another of those questions where the normative ‚Äúshould‚Äù or ‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt‚Äù invokes ‚Äúthe policeman inside.‚Äù A better way to look at is to see what steps people can take to make any question of ‚Äúshould‚Äù this be allowed just moot.The ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù are actual physical acts like murder and kidnapping. The fact that crypto may be used by plotters and planners, thus making detection more difficult, is in no way different from the possibility that plotters may speak in an unusual language to each other (ciphers), or meet in a private home (security), or speak in a soft voice when in public (steganography). None of these things should be illegal, and none of them would be enforceable except in the most rigid of police states (and probably not even there).‚ÄúCrypto is thoughtcrime‚Äù is the effect of restricting cryptography use. 4.7.3. Democracy and censorshipDoes a community have the right to decide what newsgroups or magazines it allows in its community? Does a nation have the right to do the same? (Tennessee, Iraq, Iran, France. Utah?)This is what bypasses with crypto are all about: taking these majoritarian morality decisions out of the hands of the bluenoses. Direct action to secure freedoms.4.8. Privacy Issues 4.8.1. ‚ÄúIs there an agenda here beyond just ensuring privacy?‚ÄùDefinitely! I think I can safely say that for nearly all political persuasions on the Cypherpunks list. Left, right, libertarian, or anarchist, there‚Äôs much more to to strong crypto than simple privacy. Privacy qua privacy is fairly uninteresting. If all one wants is privacy, one can simply keep to one‚Äôs self, stay off high-visibility lists like this, and generally stay out of trouble.Many of us see strong crypto as the key enabling technology for a new economic and social system, a system which will develop as cyberspace becomes more important. A system which dispenses with national boundaries, which is based on voluntary (even if anonymous) free trade. At issue is the end of governments as we know them today. (Look at interactions on the Net‚Äìon this list, for example‚Äìand you‚Äôll see many so-called nationalities, voluntary interaction, and the almost complete absence of any ‚Äúlaws.‚Äù Aside from their being almost no rules per se for the Cypherpunks list, there are essentially no national laws that are invokable in any way. This is a fast-growing trend.)Motivations for Cypherpunks    Privacy. If maintaining privacy is the main goal, there‚Äôs not much more to say. Keep a low profile, protect data, avoid giving out personal information, limit the number of bank loans and credit applications, pay cash often, etc.Privacy in activism.New Structures. Using cryptographic constructs to build new political, economic, and even social structures.

When informed about the Clipper Chip, 80% said they opposed it.‚Äù [Philip Elmer-Dewitt, ‚ÄúWho Should Keep the Keys,‚Äù TIME, 1994-03-04.]The answer given is clearly a function of how the question is phrased. Ask folks if they favor ‚Äúunbreakable encryption‚Äù or ‚Äúfortress capabilities‚Äù for terrorists, pedophiles, and other malefactors, and they‚Äôll likely give a quite different answer. It is this tack now being taken by the Clipper folks. Watch out for this!Me, I have no doubts.As Perry Metzger puts it, ‚ÄúI find the recent disclosures concerning U.S. Government testing of the effects of radiation on unknowing human subjects to be yet more evidence that you simply cannot trust the government with your own personal safety. Some people, given positions of power, will naturally abuse those positions, often even if such abuse could cause severe injury or death. I see little reason, therefore, to simply ‚Äútrust‚Äù the U.S. government ‚Äì and given that the U.S. government is about as good as they get, its obvious that NO government deserves the blind trust of its citizens. ‚ÄúTrust us, we will protect you‚Äù rings quite hollow in the face of historical evidence. Citizens must protect and preserve their own privacy ‚Äì the government and its centralized cryptographic schemes emphatically cannot be trusted.‚Äù [P.M., 1994-01-01] 4.8.3. ‚ÄúHow is 1994 like 1984?‚ÄùThe television ad for Clipper: ‚ÄúClipper‚Äìwhy 1994 will be like 1984‚ÄùAs Mike Ingle puts it:    1994: Wiretapping is privacy       Secrecy is openness       Obscurity is security 4.8.4. ‚ÄúWe anticipate that computer networks will play a more and more important role in many parts of our lives.  But this increased computerization brings tremendous dangers for infringing privacy.  Cypherpunks seek to put into place structures which will allow people to preserve their privacy if they choose.  No one will be forced to use pseudonyms or post anonymously. But it should be a matter of choice how much information a person chooses to reveal about himself when he communicates.  Right now, the nets don‚Äôt give you that much choice.  We are trying to give this power to people.‚Äù  [Hal Finney, 1993-02-23] 4.8.5. ‚ÄúIf cypherpunks contribute nothing else we can create a real privacy advocacy group, advocating means of real self- empowerment, from crypto to nom de guerre credit cards, instead of advocating further invasions of our privacy as the so-called privacy advocates are now doing!‚Äù [Jim Hart, 1994- 09-08]4.9.

Each person has to decide when to use it, and how. Me, I dislike having to download messages to my home machine before I can read them. Others use it routinely.4.10. Libertarian Issues4.10.1. A technological approach to freedom and privacy:‚ÄúFreedom is, practically, given as much (or more) by the tools we can build to protect it, as it is by our ability to convince others who violently disagree with us not to attack us.  On the Internet we have tools like anon remailers and PGP that give us a great deal of freedom from coercion even in the midst of censors. Thus, these tools piss off fans of centralized information control, the defenders of the status quo, like nothing else on the Internet.‚Äù  [an50@desert.hacktic.nl (Nobody),  libtech- l@netcom.com, 1994-06-08]Duncan Frissell, as usual, put it cogently:    ‚ÄúIf I withhold my capital from some country or enterprise I am not  threatening to kill anyone.  When a ‚ÄúDemocratic State‚Äù decides to do something, it does so with armed men.  If you don‚Äôt obey, they tend to shoot‚Ä¶.[I]f technological change enhances the powers of individuals, their power is enhanced no matter what the government does.‚ÄúIf the collective is weakened and the individual strengthened by the fact that I have the power of cheap guns, cars, computers, telecoms, and crypto then the collective has been weakened and we should ease the transition to a society based on voluntary rather than coerced interaction.‚ÄúUnless you can figure out a new, improved way of controlling others; you have no choice.‚Äù [D.F., Decline and Fall, 1994-06-19]4.10.2.  ‚ÄúThey that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.‚Äù [Benjamin Franklin]4.10.3. a typical view of government‚ÄúAs I see it, it‚Äôs always a home for bullies masquerading as a collective defense.

Sadly, several of our speculative scenarios for various laws   have come to pass. Even several of my own, such as:‚Äú(Yet Another May Prediction Realized)‚Ä¶The text of a ‚Äúdigital stalking bill‚Äù was just sent to Cyberia-l.‚Äù [L. Todd Masco, 1994-08-31] (This was a joking prediction I made that ‚Äúdigital stalking‚Äù would soon be a crime; there had been news articles about the horrors of such cyberspatial stalkings, regardless of there being no real physical threats, so this move is not all that surprising. Not surprising in an age when free speech gets outlawed as ‚Äúassault speech.‚Äù)4.10.5. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tread on me.‚Äù4.10.6. However, it‚Äôs easy to get too negative on the situation, to   assume that a socialist state is right around the corner. Or   that a new Hitler will come to power. These are unlikely   developments, and not only because of strong crypto.   Financial markets are putting constraints on how fascist a   government can get‚Ä¶the international bond markets, for   example, will quickly react to signs like this. (This is the   theory, at least.)4.10.7. Locality of reference, cash, TANSTAAFL, privacyclosure, local computation, local benefitsno accounting system neededmarkets clearmarket distortions like rationing, coupons, quotas, all require centralized record-keepinganything that ties economic transactions to identity (rationing, entitlements, insurance) implies identity- tracking, credentials, etc.Nonlocality also dramatically increases the opportunities for fraud, for scams and con jobs    because something is being promised for future delivery (the essence of many scams) and is not verifiable locallybecause ‚Äútrust‚Äù is invokedLocality also fixes the ‚Äúpoliceman inside‚Äù problem: the costs of decisions are borne by the decider, not by others.4.11. Crypto Anarchy4.11.1. The Crypto Anarchy Principle: Strong crypto permits   unbreakable encrypion, unforgeable signatures, untraceable   electronic messages, and unlinkable pseudonomous identities.   This ensures that some transactions and communications can be   entered into only voluntarily. External force, law, and   regulation cannot be applied. This is ‚Äúanarchy,‚Äù in the sense   of no outside rulers and laws. Voluntary arrangements, back-   stopped by voluntarily-arranged institutions like escrow   services, will be the only form of rule. This is ‚Äúcrypto   anarchy.‚Äù4.11.2. crypto allows a return to contracts that governments cannot   breachbased on reputation, repeat businessexample: ordering illegal material untraceably and anonymously,,,governments are powerless to do anythingprivate spaces, with the privacy enforced via cryptographic permissions (access credentials)escrows (bonds)4.11.3. Technological solutions over legalistic regulationsMarc Ringuette summarized things nicely:    ‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre after is some ‚Äúcommunity standards‚Äù for cyberspace, and what I‚Äôm suggesting is the fairly libertarian standard that goes like this:‚Äù    Prefer technological solutions and self-protection solutions     over rule-making, where they are feasible.‚ÄúThis is based on the notion that the more rules there are, the more people will call for the ‚Äúnet police‚Äù to enforce them.  If we can encourage community standards which emphasize a prudent level of self-protection, then we‚Äôll be able to make do with fewer rules and a less intrusive level of policing.‚Äù[Marc Ringuette, 1993-03-14]Hal Finney has made cogent arguments as to why we should not become too complacent about the role of technology vis- a-vis politics. He warns us not to grow to confident:    ‚ÄúFundamentally, I believe we will have the kind of society that most people want.  If we want freedom and privacy, we must persuade others that these are worth having.  There are no shortcuts.  Withdrawing into technology is like pulling the blankets over your head. It feels good for a while, until reality catches up.  The next Clipper or Digital Telephony proposal will provide a rude awakening.‚Äù [Hal Finney, POLI: Politics vs Technology, 1994-01-02]‚ÄúThe idea here is that the ultimate solution to the low signal-to-noise ratio on the nets is not a matter of forcing people to ‚Äústand behind their words‚Äù.  People can stand behind all kinds of idiotic ideas.  Rather, there will need to be developed better systems for filtering news and mail, for developing ‚Äúdigital reputations‚Äù which can be stamped on one‚Äôs postings to pass through these smart filters, and even applying these reputations to pseudonyms. In such a system, the fact that someone is posting or mailing pseudonymously is not a problem, since nuisance posters won‚Äôt be able to get through.‚Äù  [Hal Finney, 1993- 02-23]4.11.4. Reputations4.11.5. I have a moral outlook that many will find unacceptable or   repugnant. To cut to the chase: I support the killing of   those who break contracts, who steal in serious enough ways,   and who otherwise commit what I think of as crimes.I don‚Äôt mean this abstractly. Here‚Äôs an example:    Someone is carrying drugs. He knows what he‚Äôs involved in. He knows that theft is punishable by death. And yet he steals some of the merchandise.Dealers understand that they cannot tolerate this, that an example must be made, else all of their employees will steal.Understand that I‚Äôm not talking about the state doing the killing, nor would I do the killing. I‚Äôm just saying such things are the natural enforcement mechanism for such markets. Realpolitik.(A meta point: the drug laws makes things this way. Legalize all drugs and the businesses would be more like ‚Äúordinary‚Äù businesses.)In my highly personal opinion, many people, including most Congressrodents, have committed crimes that earn them the death penalty; I will not be sorry to see anonymous assassination markets used to deal with them.4.11.6. Increased espionage will help to destroy nation-state-empires   like the U.S., which has gotten far too bloated and far too   dependent on throwing its weight around; nuclear ‚Äúterrorism‚Äù   may knock out a few cities, but this may be a small price to   pay to undermine totally the socialist welfare states that   have launched so many wars this century.4.12. Loose Ends4.12.1. ‚ÄúWhy take a ‚Äúno compromise‚Äù stance?‚ÄùCompromise often ends up in the death of a thousand cuts. Better to just take a rejectionist stance.The National Rifle Association (NRA) learned this lesson the hard way. EFF may eventually learn it; right now they appear to be in the ‚Äúcoopted by the power center‚Äù mode, luxuriating in their inside-the-Beltway access to the Veep, their flights on Air Force One, and their general schmoozing with the movers and shakers‚Ä¶getting along by going along.Let‚Äôs not compromise on basic issues. Treat censorship as a problem to be routed around (as John Gilmore suggests), not as something that needs to be compromised on. (This is directed at rumblings about how the Net needs to ‚Äúpolice itself,‚Äù by the ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù censorship of offensive posts, by the ‚Äúmoderation‚Äù of newsgroups, etc. What should concern us is the accomodation of this view by well-meaning civil liberties groups, which are apparently willing to play a role in this ‚Äúself-policing‚Äù system. No thanks.)(And since people often misunderstand this point, I‚Äôm not saying private companies can‚Äôt set whatever policies they wish, that moderated newsgroups can‚Äôt be formed, etc. Private arrangements are just that. The issue is when censorship is forced on those who have no other obligations. Government usually does this, often aided and abetted by corporations and lobbying groups. This is what we need to fight. Fight by routing around, via technology.)4.12.2. The inherent evils of democracyTo be blunt about it, I‚Äôve come to despise the modern version of democracy we have. Every issue is framed in terms of popular sentiment, in terms of how the public would vote. Mob rule at its worst.Should people be allowed to wear blue jeans? Put it to a vote. Can employers have a policy on blue jeans? Pass a law. Should health care be provided to all? Put it to a vote. And so on, whittling away basic freedoms and rights. A travesty. The tyranny of the majority.De Toqueville warned of this when he said that the American experiment in democracy would last only until citizens discovered they could pick the pockets of their neighbors at the ballot box.But maybe we can stop this nonsense. I support strong crypto (and its eventual form, crypto anarchy) because it undermines this form of democracy. It takes some (and perhaps many) transactions out of the realm of popularity contests, beyond the reach of will of the herd. (No, I am not arguing there will be a complete phase change. As the saying goes, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt eat cyberspace.‚Äù But a lot of consulting, technical work, programming, etc., can in fact be done with crypto anarchic methods, with the money gained transferred in a variety of ways into the ‚Äúreal world.‚Äù More on this elsewhere.)Crypto anarchy effectively allows people to pick and choose which laws they support, at least in cyberspatial contexts. It empowers people to break the local bonds of their majoritarian normative systems and decide for themselves which laws are moral and which are bullshit.    I happen to have faith that most people will settle on a relatively small number of laws that they‚Äôll (mostly) support, a kind of Schelling point in legal space.4.12.3. ‚ÄúIs the Cypherpunks agenda too extreme?‚ÄùBear in mind that most of the ‚ÄúCypherpunks agenda,‚Äù to the extent we can identify it, is likely to provoke ordinary citizens into outrage. Talk of anonymous mail, digital money, money laundering, information markets, data havens, undermining authority, transnationalism, and all the rest (insert your favorite idea) is not exactly mainstream.4.12.4. ‚ÄúCrypto Anarchy sounds too wild for me.‚ÄùI accept that many people will find the implications of crypto anarchy (which follows in turn from the existence of strong cryptography, via the Crypto Anarchy Principle) to be more than they can accept.This is OK (not that you need my OK!). The house of Cypherpunks has many rooms.Cryptology5.1. copyright   THE  CYPHERNOMICON: Cypherpunks FAQ and More, Version 0.666,   1994-09-10, Copyright Timothy C. May. All rights reserved.

Why is public key cryptography so important?The chief advantage of public keys cryptosystems over conventional symmetric key (one key does both encryption and decryption) is one connectivity to recipients: one can communicate securely with people without exchanging key material.    by looking up their public key in a directoryby setting up a channel using Diffie-Hellman key exchange (for example)5.4.11. ‚ÄúDoes possession of a key mean possession of identity?‚ÄùIf I get your key, am I you?Certainly not outside the context of the cryptographic transaction. But within the context of a transaction, yes. Additional safeguards/speedbumps can be inserted (such as biometric credentials, additional passphrases, etc.), but these are essentially part of the ‚Äúkey,‚Äù so the basic answer remains ‚Äúyes.‚Äù (There are periodically concerns raised about this, citing the dangers of having all identity tied to a single credential, or number, or key. Well, there are ways to handle this, such as by adopting protocols that limit one‚Äôs exposure, that limits the amount of money that can be withdrawn, etc. Or people can adopt protocols that require additional security, time delays, countersigning, etc.)This may be tested in court soon enough, but the answer for many contracts and crypto transactions will be that possession of key = possession of identity. Even a court test may mean little, for the types of transactions I expect to see.    That is, in anonymous systems, ‚Äúwho ya gonna sue?‚ÄùSo, guard your key.5.4.12.

Ciphers require careful analysis, and should be in paper form (that is, presented in a detailed paper, with the necessary references to show that due diligence was done, the equations, tables, etc. The Net is a poor substitute.Also, breaking a randomly presented cipher is by no means trivial, even if the cipher is eventually shown to be weak. Most people don‚Äôt have the inclination to try to break a cipher unless there‚Äôs some incentive, such as fame or money involved.And new ciphers are notoriously hard to design. Experts are the best folks to do this. With all the stuff waiting to be done (described here), working on a new cipher is probably the least effective thing an amateur can do. (If you are not an amateur, and have broken other people‚Äôs ciphers before, then you know who you are, and these comments don‚Äôt apply. But I‚Äôll guess that fewer than a handful of folks on this list have the necessary background to do cipher design.)There are a vast number of ciphers and systems, nearly all of no lasting significance.

Obviously, most strings used in crypto are cryptoregular in that they appear to be random, and pass various randomness measures, but are not.‚ÄúHow can the randomness of a bit string be measured?‚Äù    It can roughly be estimated by entropy measures, how compressible it is (by various compression programs), etc.It‚Äôs important to realize that measures of randomness are, in a sense, ‚Äúin the eye of the beholder‚Äù‚Äìthere just is no proof that a string is random‚Ä¶there‚Äôs always room for cleverness, if you willChaitin-Kolmogoroff complexity theory makes this clearer. To use someone else‚Äôs words:        ‚ÄúActually, it can‚Äôt be done.  The consistent measure of entropy for finite objects like a string or a (finite) series of random numbers is the so-called program length complexity''.  This is defined as the length of the shortest program for some given universal Turing machine which computes the string.  It's consistent in the sense that it has the familiar properties ofordinary‚Äô‚Äô (Shannon) entropy.  Unfortunately, it‚Äôs uncomputable: there‚Äôs no algorithm which, given an arbitrary finite string S, computes the program-length complexity of S.Program-length complexity is well-studied in the literature.  A good introductory paper is ``A Theory of Program Size Formally Identical to Information Theory‚Äô‚Äô by  G. J.

And Bob‚Äôs digital signature will appear on the original, although he didn‚Äôt sign the original directly.‚ÄúMathematically, blinding a message means multiplying it by a number (think of the message as being a number). Unblinding is simply dividing the original blinding factor out.‚Äù [Karl Barrus, 1993-08-24]And another explanation by Hal Finney, which came up in the context of how to delink pharmacy prescriptions from personal identity (fears of medial dossiers(:    ‚ÄúChaum‚Äôs ‚Äúblinded credential‚Äù system is intended to solve exactly this kind of problem, but it requires an extensive infrastructure.  There has to be an agency where you physically identify yourself.  It doesn‚Äôt have to know anything about you other than some physical ID like fingerprints.  You and it cooperate to create pseudonyms of various classes, for example, a ‚Äúgo to the doctor‚Äù pseudonym, and a ‚Äúgo to the pharmacy‚Äù pseudonym. These pseudonyms have a certain mathematical relationship which allows you to re-blind credentials written to one pseudonym to apply to any other.  But the agency uses your physical ID to make sure you only get one pseudonym of each kind‚Ä¶.So, when the doctor gives you a prescription, that is a credential applied to your ‚Äúgo to the doctor‚Äù pseudonym.  (You can of course also reveal your real name to the doctor if you want.)  Then you show it at the pharmacy using your ‚Äúgo to the pharmacy‚Äù pseudonym.  The credential can only be shown on this one pseudonym at the pharamacy, but it is unlinkable to the one you got at the doctor‚Äôs.  ‚Äú [Hal Finney, 1994-09-07] 5.7.2. ‚ÄúCrypto protocols are often confusing. Is there a coherent theory of these things?‚ÄùYes, crypto protocols are often expressed as scenarios, as word problems, as ‚ÄúAlice and Bob and Eve‚Äù sorts of complicated interaction protocols.

I‚Äôm including his explanation, despite its length, to help readers who are not cryptologists get some flavor of the type of math involved. The thing to notice is the use of exponentiations and modular arithmetic (the ‚Äúclock arithmetic‚Äù of our ‚Äúnew math‚Äù childhoods, except with really, really big numbers!). The difficulty of inverting the exponention (the discrete log problem) is what makes this a cryptographically interesting approach.        ‚ÄúThe basic idea is simple.  Pick a large number p (probably a prime), and a base b that is a generator of the group of integers modulo p. Now, it turns out that given a known p, b, and (b^x) mod p, it‚Äôs extremely hard to find out x.  That‚Äôs known as the discrete log problem.‚ÄúHere‚Äôs how to use it.  Let two parties, X and Y, pick random numbers x and y, 1 < x,y < p.  They each calculate (b^x) mod p and     (b^y) mod p and transmit them to each other.  Now, X knows x and (b^y) mod p, so s/he can calculate (b^y)^x mod p = (b^(xy)) mod p.  Y can do the same calculation.  Now they both know (b^(xy)) mod p.  But eavesdroppers know only (b^x) mod p and (b^y) mod p, and can‚Äôt use those quantities to recover the shared secret.  Typically, of course, X and Y will use that shared secret as a key to a conventional cryptosystem.‚ÄúThe biggest problem with the algorithm, as outlined above, is that there is no authentication.  An attacker can sit in the middle and speak that protocol to each legitimate party.‚ÄúOne last point ‚Äì you can treat x as a secret key, and publish (b^X) mod p as a public key.  Proof is left as an exercise for the reader.‚Äù  [Steve Bellovin, 1993-07-17]Why it‚Äôs importantUsing it    Matt Ghio has made available Phil Karn‚Äôs program for generating numbers useful for D-H:        ftp cs.cmu.edu: /afs/andrew.cmu.edu/usr12/mg5n/public/Karn.DH.generatorVariants and Comments    Station to Station protocol        ‚ÄúThe STS protocol is a regular D-H followed by a (delicately designed) exchange of signatures on the key exchange parameters.

Ciphers often fail when things are not as random as designers thought they would be.Entropy, randomness, predictablility. Can never actually prove a data set is random, though one can be fairly confident (cf. Kolmogorov-Chaitin complexity theory).Still, tricks can make a random-looking text block look regular‚Ä¶.this is what decryption does; such files are said to be cryptoregular.As to how much testing is needed, this depends on the use, and on the degree of confidence needed. It may take millions of test samples, or even more, to establish randomness in set of data. For example:    ‚ÄúThe standard tests for ‚Äòrandomness‚Äô utilized in govt systems requires 1X10^6 samples. Most of the tests are standard probability stuff and some are classified. ‚Äú [Wray Kephart, sci.crypt, 1994-08-07]never assume something is really random just becuase it looks random! (Dynamic Markov compressors can find nonrandomness quickly.) 5.7.8. ‚ÄúIs it possible to tell if a file is encrypted?‚ÄùNot in general. Undecideability and all that. (Can‚Äôt tell in general if a virus exists in code, Adleman showed, and can‚Äôt tell in general if a file is encrypted, compressed, etc. Goes to issues of what we mean by encrypted or compressed.)Sometimes we can have some pretty clear signals:    headers are attachedother characteristic signsentropy per characterBut files encrypted with strong methods typically look random; in fact, randomness is closely related to encyption.    regularity: all symbols represented equally, in all bases (that is, in doubles, triples, and all n-tuples)        ‚Äúcryptoregular‚Äù is the term: file looks random (regular) until proper key is applied, then the randomness vaDCharles Bennett, ‚ÄúPhysics of Computation Workshop,‚Äù 1993]‚Äúentropy‚Äù near the maximum (e.g., near 6 or 7 bits per character, whereas ordinary English has roughly 1.5-2 bits per character of entropy) 5.7.9. ‚ÄúWhy not use CD-ROMs for one-time pads?‚ÄùThe key distribution problem, and general headaches. Theft or compromise of the keying material is of course the greatest threat.And one-time pads, being symmetric ciphers, give up the incredible advantages of public key methods.‚ÄúCD ROM is a terrible medium for the OTP key stream. First, you want exactly two copies of the random stream. CD ROM has an economic advantage only for large runs. Second, you want to destroy the part of the stream already used.  CD ROM has no erase facilities, outside of physical destruction of the entire disk.‚Äù [Bryan G. Olson, sci.crypt, 1994-08-31]If you have to have a one-time pad, a DAT makes more sense; cheap, can erase the bits already used, doesn‚Äôt require pressing of a CD, etc. (One company claims to be selling CD- ROMs as one-time pads to customers‚Ä¶the security problems here should be obvious to all.)5.8. The Nature of Cryptology 5.8.1. ‚ÄúWhat are the truly basic, core, primitive ideas of   cryptology, crypto protocols, crypto anarchy, digital cash,   and the things we deal with here?‚ÄùI don‚Äôt just mean things like the mechanics of encryption, but more basic conceptual ideas. 5.8.2. Crypto is about the creation and linking of private spaces‚Ä¶ 5.8.3. The ‚ÄúCore‚Äù Ideas of Cryptology and What we Deal WithPhysics has mass, energy, force, momentum, angular momentum, gravitation, friction, the Uncertainty Principle, Complementarity, Least Action, and a hundred other such concepts and prinicples, some more basic than others. Ditto for any other field.It seems to many of us that crypto is part of a larger study of core ideas involving: identity, proof, complexity, randomness, reputations, cut-and-choose protocols, zero knowledge, etc. In other words, the buzzwords.    But which of these are ‚Äúcore‚Äù concepts, from which others are derived?Why, for example, do the ‚Äúcut-and-choose‚Äù protocols work so well, so fairly? (That they do has been evident for a long time, and they literally are instances of Solomonic wisdom. Game theory has explanations in terms of payoff matrices, Nash equilibria, etc. It seems likely to me that the concepts of crypto will be recast in terms of a smaller set of basic ideas taken from these disparate fields of economics, game theory, formal systems, and ecology. Just my hunch.)statements, assertions, belief, proof    ‚ÄúI am Tim‚Äùpossession of a key to a lock is usually treated as proof of‚Ä¶        not always, but that‚Äôs the default assumption, that someone who unlocks a door is one of the proper people..access privileges, etc. 5.8.4. We don‚Äôt seem to know the ‚Äúdeep theory‚Äù about why certain protocols ‚Äúwork.‚Äù For example, why is ‚Äúcut-and-choose,‚Äù where Alice cuts and Bob chooses (as in fairly dividing a pie), such a fair system? Game theory has a lot to do with it. Payoff matrices, etc.But many protocols have not been fully studied. We know they work, but I think we don‚Äôt know fully why they work. (Maybe I‚Äôm wrong here, but I‚Äôve seen few papers looking at these issues in detail.)Economics is certainly crucial, and tends to get overlooked in analysis of crypto protocols‚Ä¶.the various ‚ÄúCrypto Conference Proceedings‚Äù papers typically ignore economic factors (except in the area of measuring the strength of a system in terms of computational cost to break).‚ÄúAll crypto is economics.‚ÄùWe learn what works, and what doesn‚Äôt. My hunch is that complex crypto systems will have emergent behaviors that are discovered only after deployment, or good simulation (hence my interest in ‚Äúprotocol ecologies‚Äù). 5.8.5. ‚ÄúIs it possible to create ciphers that are unbreakable in any   amount of time with any amount of computer power?‚ÄùInformation-theoretically secure vs. computationally-secure    not breakable even in principle, e.g., a one-time pad with random characters selected by a truly random process (die tosses, radioactive decay, certain types of noise, etc.)        and ignoring the ‚Äúbreakable by break-ins‚Äù approach of stealing the one-time pad, etc. (‚ÄúBlack bag cryptography‚Äù)not breakable in ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù amounts of time with computersOf course, a one-time pad (Vernam cipher) is theoretically unbreakable without the key. It is ‚Äúinformation- theoretically secure.‚ÄùRSA and similar public key algorithms are said to be only ‚Äúcomputationally-secure,‚Äù to some level of security dependent on modulus lenght, computer resources and time available, etc. Thus, given enough time and enough computer power, these ciphers are breakable.However, they may be practically impossible to break, given the amount of energy in the universe.Not to split universes here, but it is interesting to consider that some ciphers may not be breakable in our universe, in any amount of time. Our universe presumably has some finite number of particles (currently estimated to be 10^73 particles). This leads to the ‚Äúeven if every particle were a Cray Y-MP it would take‚Ä¶‚Äù sorts of thought experiments.But I am considering energy here. Ignoring reversible computation for the moment, computations dissipate energy (some disagree with this point). There is some uppper limit on how many basic computations could ever be done with the amount of free energy in the universe. (A rough calculation could be done by calculating the energy output of stars, stuff falling into black holes, etc., and then assuming about kT per logical operation. This should be accurate to within a few orders of magnitude.) I haven‚Äôt done this calculation, and won‚Äôt today, but the result would likely be something along the lines of X joules of energy that could be harnessed for computation, resulting in Y basic primitive computational steps.I can then find a modulus of 3000 digits or 5000 digits, or whatever,that takes more than this number of steps to factor.Caveats:Maybe there are really shortcuts to factoring. Certainly improvements in factoring methods will continue. (But of course these improvements are not things that convert factoring into a less than exponential-in-length problem‚Ä¶that is, factoring appears to remain ‚Äúhard.‚Äù)Maybe reversible computations (a la Landauer, Bennett, et. al.) actually work. Maybe this means a ‚Äúfactoring machine‚Äù can be built which takes a fixed, or very slowly growing, amount of energy.Maybe the quantum-mechanical idea of Shore is possible. (I doubt it, for various reasons.)I continue to find it useful to think of very large numbers as creating ‚Äúforce fields‚Äù or ‚Äúbobbles‚Äù (a la Vinge) around data. A 5000-decimal-digit modulus is as close to being unbreakable as anything we‚Äôll see in this universe.5.9. Practical Crypto 5.9.1. again, this stuff is covered in many of the FAQs on PGP and   on security that are floating around‚Ä¶ 5.9.2. ‚ÄúHow long should crypto be valid for?‚ÄùThat is, how long should a file remain uncrackable, or a digital signature remain unforgeable?    probabalistic, of course, with varying confidence levelsdepends on breakthroughs, in math and in computer powerSome messages may only need to be valid for a few days or weeks. Others, for decades. Certain contracts may need to be unforgeable for many decades. And given advances in computer power, what appears to be a strong key today may fail utterly by 2020 or 2040.  (I‚Äôm of course not suggesting that a 300- or 500-digit RSA modulus will be practical by then.)    many people only need security for a matter of months or so, while others may need it (or think they need it) for decades or even for generations        they may fear retaliation against their heirs, for example, if certain communications were ever made public‚ÄúIf you are signing the contract digitally, for instance, you would want to be sure that no one could forge your signature to change the terms after the fact ‚Äì a few months isn‚Äôt enough for such purposes, only something that will last for fifteen or twenty years is okay.‚Äù [Perry Metzger, 1994-07-06] 5.9.3. ‚ÄúWhat about commercial encryption programs for protecting   files?‚ÄùViaCrypt, PGP 2.7Various commercial programs have existed for years (I got ‚ÄúSentinel‚Äù back in 1987-8‚Ä¶long since discontinued).

Picking (and remembering) passwordsMany of the issues here also apply to choosing remailers, etc. Things are often trickier than they seem. The ‚Äústructure‚Äù of these spaces is tricky. For example, it may seem really sneaky (and ‚Äúhigh entropy‚Äù to permute some words in a popular song and use that as a pass phrase‚Ä¶.but this is obviously worth only a few bits of extra entropy.

For example, the site ‚Äúbitbucket@ee.und.ac.za‚Äù is advertised on the Net as a place to send ‚ÄúNSA food‚Äù to‚Ä¶mail sent to it gets discarded. So , a great place to send cover traffic to, no? No, as the NSA will mark this site for what it is and its usefulness is blown. (Unless its usefulness is actually something else, in which case the recursive descent has begun.)Bohdan Tashchuk suggests [1994-07-04] using telephone-like numbers, mixed in with words, to better fit with human memorization habits; he notes that 30 or more bits of entropy are routinely memorized this way. 5.9.6. ‚ÄúHow can I remember long passwords or passphrases?‚ÄùLots of security articles have tips on picking hard-to- guess (high entropy) passwords and passphrases.Just do it.    People can learn to memorize long sequences. I‚Äôm not good at this, but others apparently are. Still, it seems dangerous, in terms of forgetting. (And writing down a passphrase may be vastly more risky than a shorter but more easily memorized passphrase is.  I think theft of keys and keystroke capturing on compromised machines are much more important practical weaknesses.)The first letters of long phrases that have meaning only to the owner.    e.g., ‚ÄúWhen I was ten I ate the whole thing.‚Äù‚Äî> ‚Äúwiwtiatwt‚Äù (Purists will quibble that prepositional phrases like ‚Äúwhen i was‚Äù have lower entropy. True, but better than ‚ÄúJoshua.‚Äù)Visual systems    Another approach to getting enough entropy in passwords/phrases is a ‚Äúvisual key‚Äù where one mouses from position to position in a visual environment. That is, one is presented with a scene containg some number of nodes, perhaps representing familiar objects from one‚Äôs own home, and a path is chosen.  The advantage is that most people can remember fairly complicated (read: high entropy) ‚Äústories.‚Äù Each object triggers a memory of the next object to visit. (Example: door to kitchen to blender to refrigerator to ‚Ä¶.. ) This is the visual memory system said to be favored by Greek epic poets. This also gets around the keyboard-monitoring trick (but not necessarily the CRT-reading trick, of course).It might be an interesting hack to offer this as a front end for PGP. Even a simple grid of characters which could be moused on could be an assist in using long passphrases.5.10. DES5.10.1. on the design of DESBiham and Shamir showed how ‚Äúdifferential cryptanalyis‚Äù could make the attack easier than brute-force search of the 2^56 keyspace. Wiener did a thought experiment design of a ‚ÄúDES buster‚Äù machine (who ya gonna call?) that could break a DES key in a matter of days. (Similar to the Diffie and Hellman analysis of the mid-70s, updated to current technology.)The IBM designers knew about differential cryptanalyis, it is now clear, and took steps to optimize DES. After Shamir and Biham published, Don Coppersmith acknowledged this. He‚Äôs written a review paper:    Coppersmith, D.,  ‚ÄúThe Data Encryption Standard (DES) and its strength against attacks.‚Äù  IBM Journal of Research and Development.  38(3): 243-250.

(This follows the 1993 paper on a similar machine to break   DES.)Hal Finney did some calculations and reported to us:‚ÄúI mentioned a few days ago that one of the ‚Äúrump session‚Äù papers at the crypto conference claimed that a machine could be built which would find MD5 collisions for $10M in about 20 days‚Ä¶..The net result is that we have taken virtually no more time (the 2^64 creations of MD5 will dominate) and virtually no space (compared to 2^64  stored values) and we get the effect of a birthday attack.

SUMMARY: The Need For Strong Crypto 6.2.1. Main PointsStrong crypto reclaims the power to decide for one‚Äôs self, to deny the ‚ÄúCensor‚Äù the power to choose what one reads, watches, or listens to. 6.2.2.

Miscellaneous Commentsthis section is short, but is less focussed than other sections; it is essentially a ‚Äútransition‚Äù chapter.6.3. General Uses of and Reasons for Crypto 6.3.1. (see also the extensive listing of ‚ÄúReasons for Anonymity,‚Äù   which makes many points about the need and uses for strong   crypto) 6.3.2. ‚ÄúWhere is public key crypto really needed?‚Äù‚ÄúIt is the case that there is relatively little need for asymmetric key cryptography in small closed populations. For example, the banks get along quite well without.  The advantage of public key is that it permits private communication in a large and open population and with a minimum of prearrangement.‚Äù [WHMurray, sci.crypt, 1994-08- 25]That is, symmetric key systems (such as conventional ciphers, one time pads, etc.) work reasonably well by prearrangement between parties. And of course one time pads have the additional advantage of being information- theoretically secure. But asymmetric or public key methods are incredibly useful when: the parties have not met before, when key material has not been exchanged, and when concerns exist about storing the key material. The so- called ‚Äúkey management problem‚Äù when N people want to communicate pairwise with each other is well-founded.And of course public key crypto makes possible all the other useful stuff like digital money, DC-Nets, zero knowledge proofs, secret sharing, etc. 6.3.3. ‚ÄúWhat are the main reasons to use cryptography?‚Äùpeople encrypt for the same reason they close and lock their doorsPrivacy in its most basic forms    text ‚Äì records, diaries, letters, e-mailsound ‚Äì phone conversationsother ‚Äìvideophones, intercepts, cellular, wireless, car phones, scanners        making listening illegal is useless (and wrong-headed)            and authorites are exempt from such lawspeople need to protect, end to end‚ÄúHow should I protect my personal files, and my phone calls?‚Äù        Personally, I don‚Äôt worry too much. But many people do. Encryption tools are widely available.Cellular telephones are notoriously insecure, as are cordless phones (even less secure). There are laws about monitoring, small comfort as that may be. (And I‚Äôm largely opposed to such laws, for libertarian reasons and because it creates a false sense of security.)Laptops are probably less vulnerable to Van Eck types of RF monitoring than are CRTs. The trend to lower power, LCDs, etc., all works toward decreasing vulnerability. (However, computer power for extracting weak signals out of noise is increasing faster than RF are decreasing‚Ä¶.tradeoffs are unclear.)encrypting messages because mail delivery is so flaky    that is, mail is misdelivered,via hosts incorrectly processing the addressesencryption obviously prevents misunderstandings (though it does little to get the mail delivered correctly)Encryption to Protect Information    the standard reasonencryption of e-mail is increasing        the various court cases about employers reading ostensibly private e-mail will sharpen this debate (and raise the issue of employers forbidding encryption; resonances with the mostly-settled issue of reasonable use of company phones for private calls-more efficient to let some personal calls be made than to lose the time of employees going to public phones)encryption of faxes will increase, too, especially as technology advances and as the dangers of interception become more apparent        also, tighter links between sender and receive, as opposed to the current ‚Äúdial the number and hope it‚Äôs the right one‚Äù approach, will encourage the additional use of encryption‚Äúelectronic vaulting‚Äù of large amounts of information, sent over T1 and T3 data networks, e.g., backup material for banks and large corporationsthe miles and miles of network wiring within a corporation-LANs, WANs, Novell, Ethernet, TCP-IP, Banyan, and so on-cannot all be checked for taps‚Ä¶who would even have the records to know if some particular wire is going where it should?

Encryption to Protect Informationthe standard reasonencryption of e-mail is increasing    the various court cases about employers reading ostensibly private e-mail will sharpen this debate (and raise the issue of employers forbidding encryption; resonances with the mostly-settled issue of reasonable use of company phones for private calls-more efficient to let some personal calls be made than to lose the time of employees going to public phones)encryption of faxes will increase, too, especially as technology advances and as the dangers of interception become more apparent    also, tighter links between sender and receive, as opposed to the current ‚Äúdial the number and hope it‚Äôs the right one‚Äù approach, will encourage the additional use of encryption‚Äúelectronic vaulting‚Äù of large amounts of information, sent over T1 and T3 data networks, e.g., backup material for banks and large corporationsthe miles and miles of network wiring within a corporation-LANs, WANs, Novell, Ethernet, TCP-IP, Banyan, and so on-cannot all be checked for taps‚Ä¶who would even have the records to know if some particular wire is going where it should?

Beyond Good and Evil, or, Why Crypto is Needed 6.7.1. ‚ÄúWhy is cryptography good? Why is anonymity good?‚ÄùThese moral questions pop up on the List once in a while, often asked by someone preparing to write a paper for a class on ethics or whatnot. Most of us on the list probably think the answers are clearly ‚Äúyes,‚Äù but many in the public may not think so. The old dichotomy between ‚ÄúNone of your damned business‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat have you got to hide?‚Äù‚ÄúIs it good that people can write diaried unread by others?‚Äù ‚ÄúIs it good that people can talk to each other without law enforcement knowing what they‚Äôre saying?‚Äù ‚ÄúIs it good that people can lock their doors and hide from outsiders?‚Äù These are all essentially equivalent to the questions above.Anonymity may not be either good or not good, but the outlawing of anonymity would require a police state to enforce, would impinge on basic ideas about private transactions, and would foreclose many options that some degree of anonymity makes possible.‚ÄúPeople should not be anonymous‚Äù is a normative statement that is impractical to enforce. 6.7.2. Speaking of the isolation from physical threats and pressures   that cyberspace provides, Eric Hughes writes: ‚ÄúOne of the   whole points of anonymity and pseudonymity is to create   immunity from these threats, which are all based upon the   human body and its physical surroundings.  What is the point   of a system of anonymity which can be pierced when something   ‚Äúbad‚Äù happens?  These systems do not reject the regime of   violence; rather, they merely mitigate it slightly further   and make their morality a bit more explicit‚Ä¶..I desire   systems which do not require violence for their existence and   stability.  I desire anonymity as an ally to break the hold   of morality over culture.‚Äù [Eric Hughes, 1994-08-31] 6.7.3. Crypto anarchy means prosperity for those who can grab it,   those competent enough to have something of value to offer   for sale; the clueless 95% will suffer, but that is only   just. With crypto anarchy we can painlessly, without   initiation of aggression, dispose of the nonproductive, the   halt and the lame. (Charity is always possible, but I suspect   even the liberal do-gooders will throw up their hands at the   prospect of a nation of mostly unskilled and essentially   illiterate and innumerate workers being unable to get   meaninful, well-paying jobs.) 6.7.4.

Introduction 7.3.1. Why does PGP rate its own section?Like Clipper, PGP is too big a set of issues not to have its own section 7.3.2. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the fascination in Cypherpunks with PGP?‚ÄùIronically, our first meeting, in September 1992, coincided within a few days of the release of PGP 2.0. Arthur Abraham provided diskettes of 2.0, complete with laser-printed labels. Version 2.0 was the first truly useful version of PGP (so I hear‚Ä¶.I never tried Version 1.0, which had limited distribution). So PGP and Cypherpunks shared a history‚Äìand Phil Zimmermann has been to some physical meetings.A practical, usable, understandable tool. Fairly easy to use. In contrast, many other developments are more abstract and do not lend themselves to use by hobbyists and amateurs. This alone ensures PGP an honored place (and might be an object lesson for developers of other tools). 7.3.3. The points here focus on PGP, but may apply as well to   similar crypto programs, such as commercial RSA packages   (integrated into mailers, commercial programs, etc.).7.4. What is PGP? 7.4.1. ‚ÄúWhat is PGP?‚Äù 7.4.2. ‚ÄúWhy was PGP developed?‚Äù 7.4.3. Who developed PGP?7.5. Importance of PGP 7.5.1. PGP 2.0 arrived at an important timein September 1992, the very same week the Cypherpunks had their first meeting, in Oakland, CA. (Arthur Abraham printed up professional-looking diskette labels for the PGO 2.0 diskettes distributed. A general feeling that we were forming at the ‚Äúright time.‚Äù)just 6 months before the Clipper announcement caused a firestorm of interest in public key cryptography 7.5.2. PGP has been the catalyst for major shifts in opinionhas educated tens of thousands of users in the nature of strong cryptohas led to other tools, including encrypted remailers, experiments in digital money, etc. 7.5.3. ‚ÄúIf this stuff is so important, how come not everyone is   digitally signing their messages?‚Äù(Me, for example. I never sign my messages, and this FAQ is not signed. Maybe I will, later.)convenience, ease of use, ‚Äúall crypto is economics‚Äùinsecurity of host Unix machines (illusory)better integration with mailers needed 7.5.4. Ripem appears to be dead; traffic in alt.security.ripem is   almost zero. PGP has obviously won the hearts and minds of   the user community; and now that it‚Äôs ‚Äúlegal‚Äù‚Ä¶7.6. PGP Versions 7.6.1. PGP Versions and Implementations2.6ui is the version compatible with 2.3What is the difference between versions 2.6 and 2.6ui?    ‚ÄúPGP 2.6 is distributed from MIT and is legally available to US and Canadian residents. It uses the RSAREF library. It has code that will prevent interoperation with earlier versions of PGP. ‚ÄúPGP 2.6ui is a modified version of PGP 2.3a which functions almost identically to MIT PGP 2.6, without the ‚Äúcripple code‚Äù of MIT PGP 2.6.

What versions of PGP exist?PGP 2.7 is ViaCrypt‚Äôs commercial version of PGP 2.6 7.6.3. PGP 2.6 issuesThere has been much confusion, in the press and in discussion groups, about the issues surrounding 2.5, 2.6, 2.6ui, and various versions of these. Motivations, conspiracies, etc., have all been discussed. I‚Äôm not involved as others on our list are, so I‚Äôm often confused too.Here are some comments by Phil Zimmermann, in response to a misleading press report:    ‚ÄúPGP 2.6 will always be able to read messages, signatures, and keys from olderversions, even after September 1st.  The older versions will not be able to read messages, signatures and keys produced by PGP 2.6 after September 1st.  This is an entirely different situation.  There is every reason for people to switch to PGP 2.6, because it will be able to handle both data formats, while the older versions will not.  Until September, the new PGP will continue to produce the old format that can be read by older versions, but will start producing the new format after that date.  This delay allows time for everyone to obtain the new version of PGP, so that they will not be affected by the change. Key servers will still be able to carry the keys made in the old format, because PGP 2.6 will still read them with no problems. ‚Äú  [Phil Zimmermann, 1994-07-07, also posted to Usenet groups] [all dates here refer to 1994]‚ÄúI developed PGP 2.6 to be released by MIT, and I think this new arrangement is a breakthrough in the legal status of PGP, of benefit to all PGP users.  I urge all PGP users to switch to PGP 2.6, and abandon earlier versions.  The widespread replacement of the old versions with this new version of PGP fits in with future plans for the creation of a PGP standard.‚Äù  [Phil Zimmermann, 1994-07-07, also posted to Usenet groups] 7.6.4. PGP version 2.6.1‚ÄúMIT will be releasing Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) version 2.6.1 real soon now.  By tomorrow, I think.  The MSDOS release filename will be pgp261.zip, and the source code will be in pgp261s.zip.  The MIT FTP site is net- dist@mit.edu, in the pub/PGP directory.‚Äù [corrected by Derek Atkins to be: net-dist.mit.edu, not net- dist@mit.edu.]‚ÄúThis new version has a lot of bug fixes over version 2.6. I hope this is the final release of this family of PGP source code.  We‚Äôve been working on an entirely new version of PGP, rewritten from scratch, which is much cleaner and faster, and better suited for the future enhancements we have planned.  All PGP development efforts will be redirected toward this new code base, after this 2.6.1 release.‚Äù [Phil Zimmermann, Cypherpunks list, 1994-09-02]7.7.

And a subtle bug in the random number generator eluded even Colin Plumb for a while.The value of the source being available is that others can, if they wish, make the confirmation that the executable correspond to the source. That this can be done is enough for me. (Strategy: Hold on to the code for a while, wait for reports of flaws or holes, then use with confidence.)Signatures can be checked. Maybe timestamped versions, someday.Frankly, the odds are much higher that one‚Äôs messages or pseudonymous identity will be exposed in others ways than that PGP has been compromised. Slip-ups in sending messages sometimes reveal identities, as do inadvertent comments and stylistic cues.7.8. How to Use PGP 7.8.1. How does PGP work? 7.8.2. ‚ÄúHow should I store the secret part of my key? Can I memorize   it?‚ÄùModern ciphers use keys that are far beyond memorization (or even typing in!). The key is usually stored on one‚Äôs home machine, or a machine that is reasonably secure, or on diskette. The passphrase should always be memorized or written down (ugh) in one‚Äôs wallet or other such place. Secure ‚Äúdongles‚Äù worn around the neck, or a ring or watch, may eventually be used.

This document defines one particular type of MIME data, the application/pgp type, for ‚Äúpretty good‚Äù privacy, authentication, and encryption in Internet mail.

PGP supports a completely decentralized, personalized web of trust and also the most highly structured bureaucratic centralized scheme you could imagine. One problem with relying solely on a personalized web of trust is that it limitsyour universe of correspondents. We can‚Äôt expect Phil Zimmermann and a few well-known others to sign everyone‚Äôs key, and I would not want to limit my private correspondence to just those people I know and trust plus those people whose keys have been signed by someone I know and trust.‚Äù [William Stallings, SLED key verification, alt.security.pgp, 1994-09- 01] 7.9.2.

Use of PGP key fingerprints‚ÄúOne of the better uses for key fingerprints is for inclusion in signature files and other places that a key itself is too bulky.  By widespread dissemination of the fingerprint, the chances of a bogus key being undetected are decreased, since there are more channels for the fingerprint to get to recipients, and more channels for the owner of a key to see any bogus fingerprints out on the net. [Bill Stewart, 1994-08-31] 7.9.5. ‚ÄúHow should address changes be handled? Do old keys have to   be revoked?‚ÄùFuture versions of PGP may handle betterOne way is to issue ‚Ä¶. ‚ÄúUser-id revocation certificates are a good idea and the PGP key format allows for them - maybe one day PGP will do something about it.‚Äù [Paul Allen, alt.security.pgp, 1994-07-01]Persistent e-mail addresses is one approach. Some  people are using organization like the ACM to provide this (e.g., Phil Zimmermann is prz@acm.org). Others are using remapping services.  For example, ‚ÄúI signed up with the SLED (Stable Large E-mail Database), which is a cross-referencing database for linking old, obsolete E-mail addresses with current ones over the course of time‚Ä¶. Anyone using this key will always be able to find me on the SLED by conducting a search with ‚Äúblbrooks‚Ä¶‚Äù as the keyword. Thus my key and associated sigs always remain good‚Ä¶.

You can use PGP to verify your keyring, and using the web-of-trust, you can then have it verify your signatures all the keys that you signed, and recurse through your circle-of-friends.  To verify that your own key was not munged, you can sign something with your secret key and then try to verify it.  This will ensure that your public key wasn‚Äôt munged.‚Äù [Derek Atkins, sci.crypt, 1994- 07-06] 7.9.7. ‚ÄúWhy are key revocations needed?‚ÄùKey revocation is the ‚Äúebb-of-trust‚Äù‚ÄúThere are a number of real reasons.  Maybe you got coerced into signing the key, or you think that maybe the key was signed incorrectly, or maybe that person no longer uses that email address, because they lost the account, or that maybe you don‚Äôt believe that the binding of key to userID is valid for any number of reasons.‚Äù [Derek Atkins, 4-28- 94] 7.9.8. ‚ÄúIs-a-person‚Äù registriesThere have been proposals that governments could and should create registries of ‚Äúlegal persons.‚Äù This is known in the crypto community as ‚Äúis-a-person‚Äù credentialling, and various papers (notably Fiat-Shamir) have dealt with issues    of spoofing by malicious governmentsof the dangers of person-trackingWe need to be very careful here!    this could limit the spread of ‚Äòad hoc crypto‚Äô (by which I mean the use of locally-generated keys for reasons other than personal use‚Ä¶digital cash, pseudonyms etc.)any system which ‚Äúissues‚Äù permission slips to allow keys to be generated is dangerous!Could be an area that governments want to get into.    a la Fiat-Shamir ‚Äúpassport‚Äù issues (Murdoch, Libyan example)I favor free markets‚Äìno limitations on which registries I can use 7.9.9.

Contrast this with a commercial program, where such a bug might go undetected for years.‚Äù [Paul Rubin, alt.security.pgp, 1994-09-06]7.13.6. ‚ÄúCan I run PGP on a machine I don‚Äôt control, e.g., the campus computer system?‚ÄùSure, but the sysops and others may then have access to your key and passphrase. Only machines the user directly controls, and that are adequately firewalled from other machines, offer reasonable amounts of security.  Arguing about whether 1024-bit keylengths are ‚Äúenough‚Äù is rather moot if the PGP program is being run on a corportate computer, or a university network. The illusion of security may be present, but no real security. Too many people are kidding themselves that their messages are secure.  That their electronic identities cannot be spoofed.I‚Äôm not interested in the various elm and emacs PGP packages (several such shells and wrappers exist). Any sysop can not only obtain your secret key, stored on hissystem, but he can also capture your passphrase as you feed it to the PGP program (assuming you do‚Ä¶many people automate this part as well). Since this sysop or one of his cronies can then compromise your mail, sign messages and contracts as ‚Äúyou,‚Äù I consider this totally unacceptable. Others apparently don‚Äôt.What can be done? Many of us only run PGP on home machines, or on machines we directly control. Some folks who use PGP on such machines at least take steps to better secure things‚Ä¶.Perry Metzger, for example, once described the multi-stage process he went through each day to reload his key material in a way he felt was quasi-safe.Until the ‚ÄúInternet-in-a-box‚Äù or TIA-type products are more widespread, many people will be connecting home or office machines to other systems they don‚Äôt control. (To put this in sharper focus: do you want your electronic money being run out of an account that your sysop and his friends can monitor? Not hardly. ‚ÄúElectronic purses,‚Äù which may be smart cards, Newton-like PDAs, or dongle-like rings or pendants, are clearly needed. Another entire discussion.)7.14. The Future of PGP7.14.1. ‚ÄúDoes PGP help or hurt public key methods in general and RSA   Data Security Inc. in particular?‚ÄùThe outcome is not final, but on balance I think the position of RSADSI is helped by the publicity PGP has generated. Users of PGP will ‚Äúgraduate‚Äù to fully-licensed versions, in many cases. Corporations will then use RSADSI‚Äôs products.Interestingly, PGP could do the ‚Äúradical‚Äù things that RSADSI was not prepared to do. (Uses familiar to Cypherpunks.)    bypassing export restrictions is an example of thisincorporation into experimental digital cash systemsParasitism often increases the rate of evolution. Certainly PGP has helped to light a fire under RSADSI.7.14.2. Stealth PGPXenon, Nik, S-Tools,7.14.3. ‚ÄúShould we work on a more advanced version, a Really Good   Privacy?‚Äùeasier said than done‚Ä¶strong committment of timenot clear what is needed‚Ä¶7.14.4. ‚ÄúCan changes and improvements be made to PGP?‚ÄùI consider it one of the supreme ironies of our age that Phil Zimmermann has denounced Tom Rollins for making various changes to a version of PGP he makes available.Issues:    Phil‚Äôs reputation, and that of PGPintellectual propertyGNU Public licensethe mere name of PGPConsider that RSA said much the same thing, that PGP would degrade the reputation of public key (esp. as Phil was an ‚Äúamateur,‚Äù the same exact phrasing PRZ uses to criticize Tom Rollins!)I‚Äôm not taking a stand here‚Ä¶.I don‚Äôt know the details. Just some irony.7.15. Loose Ends7.15.1. Security measures on login, passwords, etc.Avoid entering passwords over the Net (such as in rlogins or telnets). If someone or some agent asks for your password, be paranoid.Can use encrypted telnet, or something like Kerberos, to avoid sending passwords in the clear between machines. Lots of approaches, almost none of them commonly used (at least I never see them).Anonymity, Digital Mixes, and Remailers8.1. copyright   THE  CYPHERNOMICON: Cypherpunks FAQ and More, Version 0.666,   1994-09-10, Copyright Timothy C.

SUMMARY: Anonymity, Digital Mixes, and Remailers 8.2.1. Main PointsRemailers are essential for anonymous and pseudonymous systems, because they defeat traffic analysisCypherpunks remailers have been one of the major successes, appearing at about the time of the Kleinpaste/Julf remailer(s), but now expanding to many sitesTo see a list of sites:  finger remailer- list@kiwi.cs.berkeley.edu ( or http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~raph/remailer-list.html)Anonymity in general is a core idea 8.2.2. Connections to Other SectionsRemailers make the other technologies possible 8.2.3. Where to Find Additional InformationVery little has been written (formally, in books and journals) about remailersDavid Chaum‚Äôs papers are a start 8.2.4. Miscellaneous CommentsThis remains one of the most jumbled and confusing sections, in my opinion. It needs a lot more reworking and reorganizing.Partly this is because of several factors    a huge number of people have worked on remailers, contributing ideas, problems, code, and whatnotthere are many versions, many sites, and the sites change from day to daylots of ideas for new featuresin a state of fluxThis is an area where actual experimentation with remailers is both very easy and very instructive‚Ä¶the ‚Äútheory‚Äù of remailers is straighforward (compared to, say, digital cash) and the learning experience is better than theory anyway.There are a truly vast number of features, ideas, proposals, discussion points, and other such stuff. No FAQ could begin to cover the ground covered in the literally thousands of posts on remailers.8.3. Anonymity and Digital Pseudonyms 8.3.1. Why is anonymity so important?It allows escape from past, an often-essential element of straighening out (an important function of the Western frontier, the French Foreign Legion, etc., and something we are losing as the dossiers travel with us wherever we go)It allows new and diverse types of opinions, as noted belowMore basically, anonymity is important because identity is not as important as has been made out in our dossier society. To wit, if Alice wishes to remain anonymous or pseudonymous to Bob, Bob cannot ‚Äúdemand‚Äù that she provide here ‚Äúreal‚Äù name. It‚Äôs a matter of negotiation between them. (Identity is not free‚Ä¶it is a credential like any other and cannot be demanded, only negotiated.)Voting, reading habits, personal behavior‚Ä¶all are examples where privacy (= anonymity, effectively) are critical. The next section gives a long list of reasons for anonymity. 8.3.2. What‚Äôs the difference between anonymity and pseudonymity?Not much, at one level‚Ä¶we often use the term ‚Äúdigital pseudonym‚Äù in a strong sense, in which the actual identity cannot be deduced easily    this is ‚Äúanonymity‚Äù in a certain senseBut at another level, a pseudonym carries reputations, credentials, etc., and is not ‚Äúanonymous‚Äùpeople use pseudonyms sometimes for whimsical reasons (e.g., ‚ÄúFrom spaceman.spiff@calvin.hobbes.org   Sep 6, 94 06:10:30‚Äù), sometimes to keep different mailing lists separate (different personnas for different groups), etc. 8.3.3. Downsides of anonymitylibel and other similar dangers to reputationshit-and-runs actions (mostly on the Net)    on the other hand, such rantings can be ignored (KILL file)        positive reputationsaccountability based on physical threats and tracking is lostPractical issue. On the Cypherpunks list, I often take ‚Äúanonymous‚Äù messages less seriously.    They‚Äôre often more bizarre and inflammatory than ordinary posts, perhaps for good reason, and they‚Äôre certainly harder to take seriously and respond to. This is to be expected. (I should note that some pseudonyms, such as Black Unicorn and Pr0duct Cypher, have established reputable digital personnas and are well worth replying to.)repudiation of debts and obligationsinfantile flames and run-amok postings    racism, sexism, etc.like ‚ÄúRumormonger‚Äù at Apple?but these are reasons for pseudonym to be used, where the reputation of a pseudonym is importantCrimes‚Ä¶murders, bribery, etc.    These are dealt with in more detail in the section on crypto anarchy, as this is a major concern (anonymous markets for such services) 8.3.4. ‚ÄúHow will privacy and anonymity be attacked?‚Äùthe downsides just listed are often cited as a reason we can‚Äôt have ‚Äúanonymity‚Äùlike so many other ‚Äúcomputer hacker‚Äù items, as a tool for the ‚ÄúFour Horsemen‚Äù: drug-dealers, money-launderers, terrorists, and pedophiles.as a haven for illegal practices, e.g., espionage, weapons trading, illegal markets, etc.tax evasion (‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt tax it if we can‚Äôt see it.‚Äù)    same system that makes the IRS a ‚Äúsilent partner‚Äù in business transactions and that gives the IRS access to‚Äì and requires‚Äìbusiness records‚Äúdiscrimination‚Äù    that it enables discrimination (this used to be OK)exclusionary communities, old boy networks 8.3.5. ‚ÄúHow will random accusations and wild rumors be controlled in anonymous forums?‚ÄùFirst off, random accusations and hearsay statements are the norm in modern life; gossip, tabloids, rumors, etc. We don‚Äôt worry obsessively about what to do to stop all such hearsay and even false comments. (A disturbing trend has been the tendency to sue, or threaten suits. And increasingly the attitude is that one can express opinions, but not make statements ‚Äúunless they can be proved.‚Äù That‚Äôs not what free speech is all about!)Second, reputations matter. We base our trust in statements on a variety of things, including: past history, what others say about veracity, external facts in our possession, and motives. 8.3.6. ‚ÄúWhat are the legal views on anonymity?‚ÄùReports that Supreme Court struck down a Southern law requiring pamphlet distributors to identify themselves. 9I don‚Äôt have a cite on this.)    However, Greg Broiles provided this quote, from Talley v. State of California, 362 U.S. 60, 64-65, 80 S.Ct. 536, 538-539 (1960) : ‚ÄúAnonymous pamphlets, leaflets, brochures and even books have played an important role in the progress of mankind. Persecuted groups and sects from time to time throughout history have been able to criticize oppressive practices and laws either anonymously or not at all.‚ÄùGreg adds: ‚ÄúIt later says ‚ÄúEven the Federalist Papers, written in favor of the adoption of our Constitution, were published under fictitious names. It is plain that anonymity has sometimes been assumed for the most constructive purposes.‚Äù [Greg Broiles, 1994-04-12]And certainly many writers, journalists, and others use pseudonyms, and have faced no legal action.    Provided they don‚Äôt use it to evade taxes, evade legal judgments, commit fraud, etc.I have heard (no cites) that ‚Äúgoing masked for the purpose of going masked‚Äù is illegal in many jurisdictions. Hard to believe, as many other disguises are just as effective and are presumably not outlawed (wigs, mustaches, makeup, etc.). I assume the law has to do with people wearning ski masks and such in ‚Äúinappropriate‚Äù places. Bad law, if real. 8.3.7. Some Other Uses for Anonymous Systems:Groupware and Anonymous Brainstorming and Voting    systems based on Lotus Notes and designed to encourage wild ideas, comments from the shy or overly polite, etc.these systems could initially start in meeting and then be extended to remote sites, and eventually to nationwide and international forumsthe NSA may have a heart attack over these trends‚Ä¶‚ÄúDemocracy Wall‚Äù for encrypted messages    possibly using time-delayed keys (where even the public key, for reading the plaintext, is not distributed for some time)under the cover of an electronic newspaper, with all of the constitutional protections that entails: letters to the editor can be anonymous, ads need not be screened for validity, advertising claims are not the responsibility of the paper, etc.Anonymous reviews and hypertext (for new types of journals)    the advantages        honestyincreased ‚Äútemperature‚Äù of discoursedisadvantages        increased flamesintentional misinformationStore-and-forward nodes    used to facillitate the anonymous voting and anonymous inquiry (or reading) systemsChaum‚Äôs ‚Äúmix‚Äùtelephone forwarding systems, using digital money to pay for the service        and TRMs?Fiber optics    hard to trace as millions of miles are laid, including virtually untraceable lines inside private buildings        suppose government suspects encrypted packets are going in to the buildings of Apple‚Ä¶absent any direct knowledge of crimes being aided and abetted, can the government demand a mapping of messages from input to output?That is, will the government demand full disclosure of all routings?high bandwidth means many degrees of freedom for such systems to be deployedWithin systems, i.e., user logs on to a secure system and is given access to his own processor    in a 288-processor system like the NCR/ATT 3600 (or even larger)under his cryptonym he can access certain files, generate others, and deposit message untraceably in other mail locations that other agents or users can later  retrieve and forward‚Ä¶.in a sense, he can use this access to launch his own agent processes (anonymity is essential for many agent- based systems, as is digital money)Economic incentives for others to carry mail to other sites‚Ä¶    further diffusion and hiding of the true functionsBinary systems (two or more pieces needed to complete the message)    possibly using viruses and worms to handle the complexities of distributing these messagesagents may handle the transfers, with isolation between the agents, so routing cannot be traced (think of scene in ‚ÄúDouble-Crossed‚Äù where bales of marijuana are passed from plane to boat to chopper to trucks to cars)this protects against conspiraciesSatellites    physical security, in that the satellites would have to be shot down to halt the broadcasting        scenario: WARC (or whomever) grants broadcast rights in 1996 to some country or consortium, which then accepts any and all paying customers            cold cashthe BCCI of satellite operatorsVSATs, L-Band, Satellites, Low-Earth Orbit        Very Small Aperture TerminalsL-Band‚Ä¶what frequency?LEO, as with Motorola‚Äôs Iridium, offers several advantages            lower-power receivers and smaller antennaslow cost to launch, due to small size and lower need for 10-year reliabilityavoidance of the ‚Äúorbital slot‚Äù licensing morass (though I presume some licensing is still involved)can combine with impulse or nonsinusoidal transmissions 8.3.8. ‚ÄúTrue Names‚Äù 8.3.9. Many ways to get pseudonyms:Telnet to ‚Äúport 25‚Äù or use SLIP connections to alter domain name; not very secureRemailers8.3.10. ‚ÄúHow is Pseudonymity Compromised?‚Äùslip-ups in style, headers, sig blocks, etc.inadvertent revealing, via the remailerstraffic analysis of remailers (not very likely, at least not for non-NSA adversaries)correlations, violations of the ‚Äúindistinguishability principle‚Äù8.3.11. Miscellaneous IssuesEven digital pseudonyms can get confusing‚Ä¶someone recently mistook ‚ÄúTommy the Tourist‚Äù for being such an actual digital pseudonym (when of course that is just attached to all posts going througha particular remailer).8.4. Reasons for Anonymity and Digital Pseudonyms (and Untraceable E-Mail) 8.4.1. (Thre are so many reasons, and this is asked so often, that   I‚Äôve collected these various reasons here. More can be added,   of course.) 8.4.2. Privacy in general 8.4.3. Physical Threats‚Äúcorporate terrrorism‚Äù is not a myth: drug dealers and other ‚Äúmarginal‚Äù businessmen face this every day    extortion, threats, kidnappingsand many businesses of the future may well be less ‚Äúgentlemanly‚Äù than the conventional view has it    witness the bad blood between Intel and AMD, and then imagine it getting ten times worseand national rivalries, even in ostensibly legal businesses (think of arms dealers), may cause more use of violenceMafia and other organized crime groups may try to extort payments or concessions from market participants, causing them to seek the relative protection of anonymous systems        with reputationsNote that calls for the threatened to turn to the police for protection has several problems        the activities may be illegal or marginally illegal (this is the reason the Mafia can often get involved and why it may even sometimes have a positive effect, acting as the cop for illegal activities)the police are often too busy to get involved, what with so much physical crime clogging the courtsextortion and kidnappings can be done using these very techniques of cryptoanarchy, thus causing a kind of arms racebattered and abused women and families may need the equivalent of a ‚Äúwitness protection program‚Äù    because of the ease of tracing credit card purchases, with the right bribes and/or court orders (or even hacking), battered wives may seek credit cards under pseudonyms        and some card companies may oblige, as a kind of politically correct social gestureor groups like NOW and Women Against Rape may even offer their own cards            perhaps backed up by some kind of escrow fundcould be debit cardspeople who participate in cyberspace businesses may fear retaliation or extortion in the real world    threats by their governments (for all of the usual reasons, plus kickbacks, threats to close them down, etcl)ripoffs by those who covet their success‚Ä¶ 8.4.4. VotingWe take it for granted in Western societies that voting should be ‚Äúanonymous‚Äù‚Äìuntraceable, unlinkablewe don‚Äôt ask people ‚ÄúWhat have you got to hide?‚Äù or tell them ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre doing something anonymously, it must be illegal.‚ÄùSame lesson ought to apply to a lot of things for which the government is increasingly demanding proof of identity forAnonymous Voting in Clubs, Organizations, Churches, etc.    a major avenue for spreading CA methods: ‚Äúelectronic blackballing,‚Äù weighted voting (as with number of shares)        e.g., a corporation issues ‚Äúvoting tokens,‚Äù which can be used to vote anonymously            or even sold to others (like selling shares, except selling only the voting right for a specific election is cheaper, and many people don‚Äôt much care about elections)a way to protect against deep pockets lawsuits in, say, race discrimination cases            wherein a director is sued for some action the company takes-anonymity will give him some legal protection, some ‚Äúplausible deniability‚Äùis possible to set up systems (cf. Salomaa) in which some ‚Äúsupervotes‚Äù have blackball power, but the use of these vetos is indistinguishable from a standard majority rules vote            i.e., nobody, except the blackballer(s), will know whether the blackball was used!will the government seek to limit this kind of protocol?                claiming discrimination potential or abuse of voting rights?will Justice Department (or SEC) seek to overturn anonymous voting?        as part of the potential move to a ‚Äúfull disclosure‚Äù society?related to antidiscrimination laws, accountability, etc.Anonymous Voting in Reputation-Based Systems (Journals, Markets)        customers can vote on products, on quality of service, on the various deals they‚Äôve been involved in            not clear how the voting rights would get distributedthe idea is to avoid lawsuits, sanctions by vendors, etc. (as with the Bose suit)Journals            a canonical example, and one which I must include, as it combines anonymous refereeing (already standard, in primitive forms), hypertext (links to reviews), and basic freedom of speech issuesthis will likely be an early area of usethis whole area of consumer reviews may be a way to get CA bandwidth up and running (lots of PK-encrypted traffic sloshing around the various nets) 8.4.5. Maintenance of free speechprotection of speechavoiding retaliation for controversial speech    this speech may be controversial, insulting, horrific, politically incorrect, racist, sexist, speciesist, and other horrible‚Ä¶but remailers and anonymity make it all impossible to stopwhistleblowingpolitical speech    KKK, Aryan Resistance League, Black National Front, whatevercf. the ‚Äúdebate‚Äù between ‚ÄúLocke‚Äù and ‚ÄúDemosthenes‚Äù in Orson Scott Card‚Äôs novel, ‚ÄúEnder‚Äôs Game.‚Äù(Many of these reasons are also why ‚Äòdata havens‚Äô will eventually be set up‚Ä¶indeed, they already exist‚Ä¶homolka trial, etc.) 8.4.6. Adopt different personnas, pseudonyms 8.4.7. Choice of reading material, viewing habits, etc.to prevent dossiers on this being formed, anonymous purchases are needed (cash works for small items, not for video rentals, etc.)video rentals    (Note: There are ‚Äúlaws‚Äù making such releases illegal, but‚Ä¶)cable t.v. viewing habitsmail-order purchases    yes, they need your address to ship to, but there may be cutouts that delink (e.g., FedEx might feature such a service, someday 8.4.8. Anonymity in Requesting Information, Services, Goodsa la the controversy over Caller ID and 900 numbers: people don‚Äôt want their telephone numbers (and hence identities) fed into huge consumer-preference data banks    of the things they buy, the videos they rent, the books they read. etc. (various laws protect some of these areas, like library books, video rentals)subscription lists are already a booming resale market‚Ä¶this will get faster and more finely ‚Äútuned‚Äù with electronic subscriptions: hence the desire to subscribe anonymouslysome examples of ‚Äúsensitive‚Äù services that anonymity may be desired in (especially related to computers, modems, BBSes)    reading unusual or sensitive groups: alt.sex.bondage, etc.        or posting to these groups!recent controversy over NAMBLA may make such protections more desirable to some (and parallel calls for restrictions!)posting to such groups, especially given that records are perpetual and that government agencies read and file postings (an utterly trivial thing to do)requesting help on personal issues (equivalent to the ‚ÄúName Witheld‚Äù seen so often)discussing controversial political issues (and who knows what will be controversial 20 years later when the poster is seeking a political office, for example?)        given that some groups have already (1991) posted the past postings of people they are trying to smear!Note: the difference between posting to a BBS group or chat line and writing a letter to an editor is significant        partly technological: it is vastly easier to compile records of postings than it is to cut clippings of letters to editors (though this will change rapidly as scanners make this easy)partly sociological: people who write letters know the letters will be with the back issues in perpetuity, that bound issues will preserve their words for many decades to come (and could conceivably come back to haunt them), but people who post to BBSes probably think their words are temporaryand there are some other factors            no editingno time delays (and no chance to call an editor and retract a letter written in haste or anger)and letters can, and often are, written with the ‚ÄúName Witheld‚Äù signature-this is currently next to impossible to do on networks                though some ‚Äúforwarding‚Äù services have informally sprung upBusinesses may wish to protect themselves from lawsuits over comments by their employees    the usual ‚ÄúThe opinions expressed here are not those of my employer‚Äù may not be enough to protect an employer from lawsuits        imagine racist or sexist comments leading to lawsuits (or at least being brought up as evidence of the type of ‚Äúattitude‚Äù fostered by the company, e.g., ‚ÄúI‚Äôve worked for Intel for 12 years and can tell you that blacks make very poor engineers.‚Äù)employees may make comments that damage the reputations of their companies        Note: this differs from the current situation, where free speech takes priority over company concerns, because the postings to a BBS are carried widely, may be searched electronically (e.g., AMD lawyers search the UseNet postings of 1988-91 for any postings by Intel employees besmirching the quality or whatever of AMD chips),and so employees of corporations may protect themselves, and their employers, by adopting pseudonymsBusinesses may seek information without wanting to alert their competitors    this is currently done with agents, ‚Äúexecutive search firms,‚Äù and lawyersbut how will it evolve to handle electronic searches?there are some analogies with filings of ‚ÄúFreedom of Information Act‚Äù requests, and of patents, etc.        these ‚Äúfishing expeditions‚Äù will increase with time, as it becomes profitable for companies to search though mountains of electronically-filed materials            environmental impact studies, health and safety disclosures, etc.could be something that some companies specialize inAnonymous Consultation Services, Anonymous Stringers or Reporters    imagine an information broker, perhaps on an AMIX-like service, with a network of stringers        think of the arms deal newsletter writer in Hallahan‚Äôs The Trade, with his network of stringers feeding him tips and inside information            instead of meeting in secretive locations, a very expensive proposition (in time and travel), a secure network can be usedwith reputations, digital pseudonyms, etc.they may not wish their actual identities known        threats from employers, former employers, government agenciesharassment via the various criminal practices that will become more common (e.g., the ease with which assailants and even assassins can be contracted for)            part of the overall move

real name-if they don‚Äôt care about real-world repercussions-or one of their digital pseudonyms (may as well use cryptonyms) is attached                    various algorithms for reputations                        sum total of everything ever written, somehow measured by other comments made, by ‚Äúvoting,‚Äù etc.a kind of moving average, allowing for the fact that learning will occur, just as a researcher probably gets better with time, and that as reputation-based systems become better understood, people come to appreciate the importance of writing carefullyand one of the most controversial of all: Yardley‚Äôs Intelligence Daily            though it may come out more than daily!an ex-agent set this up in the mid-90s, soliciting contributions via an anonymous packet-switching sysem

whistleblower, the government, whoever-will call for an opening of the files        under various ‚ÄúData Privacy‚Äù lawsor just in general (tort law, lawsuits, ‚Äúdiscovery‚Äù)thus, steps will be taken to isolate the actual data from actual users, perhaps via cutouts        e.g., a data service sells access, but subcontracts out the searches to other services via paths that are untraceable            this probably can‚Äôt be outlawed in general-though any specific transaction might later be declared illegal, etc., at which time the link is cut and a new one is established-as this would outlaw all subcontracting arrangements!                i.e., if Joe‚Äôs Data Service charges $1000 for a search on widgets and then uses another possibly transitory (meaning a cutout) data service, the most a lawsuit can do is to force Joe to stop using this untraceble servicelevels of indirection (and firewalls that stop the propagation of investigations)Medical Polls (a la AIDS surveys, sexual

Chaum‚Äôs Digital MixesHow do digital mixes work? 8.5.6. ‚ÄúAre today‚Äôs remailers secure against traffic analysis?‚ÄùMostly not. Many key digital mix features are missing, and the gaps can be exploited.Depends on features used:    Reordering (e.g., 10 messages in, 10 messages out)Quantization to fixed sizes (else different sizes give clues)Encryption at all stages (up to the customer, of course)But probably not, given that current remailers often lack necessary features to deter traffic analysis. Padding is iffy, batching is often not done at all (people cherish speed, and often downcheck remailers that are ‚Äútoo slow‚Äù)Best to view today‚Äôs remailers as experiments, as prototypes.8.6.

One of the simplest and least controversial would be to defeat traffic analysis on ordinary email‚Ä¶..Two people who wish to communicate privately can use PGP or some other encryption system to hide the content of their messages.  But the fact that they are communicating with each other is still visible to many people: sysops at their sites and possibly at intervening sites, as well as various net snoopers.  It would be natural for them to desire an additional amount of privacy which would disguise who they were communicating with as well as what they were saying.‚ÄúAnonymous remailers make this possible.  By forwarding mail between themselves through remailers, while still identifying themselves in the (encrypted) message contents, they have even more communications privacy than with simple encryption.‚Äú(The Cypherpunk vision includes a world in which literally hundreds or thousands of such remailers operate.  Mail could be bounced through dozens of these services, mixing in with tens of thousands of other messages, re-encrypted at each step of the way.  This should make traffic analysis virtually impossible.  By sending periodic dummy messages which just get swallowed up at some step, people can even disguise when they are communicating.)‚Äù [Hal Finney, 1993-02-23]‚ÄúThe more controversial vision associated with anonymous remailers is expressed in such science fiction stories as ‚ÄúTrue Names‚Äù, by Vernor Vinge, or ‚ÄúEnder‚Äôs Game‚Äù, by Orson Scott Card.  These depict worlds in which computer networks are in widespread use, but in which many people choose to participate through pseudonyms.  In this way they can make unpopular arguments or participate in frowned-upon transactions without their activities being linked to their true identities.  It also allows people to develop reputations based on the quality of their ideas, rather than their job, wealth, age, or status.‚Äù [Hal Finney, 1993-02-23]‚ÄúOther advantages of this approach include its extension to electronic on-line transactions.  Already today many records are kept of our financial dealings - each time we purchase an item over the phone using a credit card, this is recorded by the credit card company.  In time, even more of this kind of information may be collected and possibly sold. One Cypherpunk vision includes the ability to engage in transactions anonymously, using ‚Äúdigital cash‚Äù, which would not be traceable to the participants.  Particularly for buying ‚Äúsoft‚Äù products, like music, video, and software (which all may be deliverable over the net eventually), it should be possible to engage in such transactions anonymously.  So this is another area where anonymous mail is important.‚Äù  [Hal Finney, 1993-02-23] 8.6.6. ‚ÄúHow do I actually use a remailer?‚Äù(Note: Remailer instructions are posted frequently. There is no way I can keep up to date with them here.

Why aren‚Äôt signatures stripped off by remailers?‚Äù    ‚ÄúThe reason to build mailers that faithfully pass on the entire body of the message, without any kind of alteration, is that it permits you to send ANY body through that mailer and rely on its faithful arrival at the destination.‚Äù [John Gilmore, 93-01-01]The ‚Äú::‚Äù special form is an exceptionSignature blocks at the end of message bodies specifically should not be stripped, even though this can cause security breaches if they are accidentally left in when not intended. Attempting to strip sigs, which come in many flavors, would be a nightmare and could strip other stuff, too. Besides, some people may want a sig attached, even to an encrypted message.As usual, anyone is of course free to have a remailer which munges message bodies as it sees fit, but  I expect such remailers will lose customers.Another possibility is another special form, such as ‚Äú::End‚Äù, that could be used to delimit the block to be remailed. But it‚Äôll be hard getting such a ‚Äúfrill‚Äù accepted.‚ÄúHow do remailers handle subject lines?‚Äù    In various ways. Some ignore it, some preserve it, some even can accept instructions to create a new subject line (perhaps in the last remailer).There are reasons not to have a subject line propagated through a chain of remailers: it tags the message and hence makes traffic analysis trivial. But there are also reasons to have a subject line‚Äìmakes it easier on the recipient‚Äìand so these schemes to add a subject line exist.‚ÄúCan nicknames or aliases be used with the Cypherpunks remailers?‚Äù    Certainly digitally signed IDs are used (Pr0duct Cypher, for example), but not nicknames preserved in fields in the remailing and mail-to-Usenet gateways.This could perhaps be added to the remailers, as an extra field. (I‚Äôve heard the mail fields are more tolerant of added stuff than the Netnews fields are, making mail-to- News gateways lose the extra fields.)Some remailer sites support them        ‚ÄúIf you want an alias assigned at vox.hacktic.nl, one - only- needs to send some empty mail to ping@vox.hacktic.nl and the adress the mail was send from will be inculded in the data-base‚Ä¶..Since vox.hacktic.nl is on a UUCP node the reply can take some time, usually something like 8 to 12 hours.‚Äù[Alex de Joode, usura@vox.hacktic.nl, 1994-08-29]‚ÄúWhat do remailers do with the various portions of messages? Do they send stuff included after an encrypted block? Should they? What about headers?‚Äù    There are clearly lots of approaches that may be taken:        Send everything as is, leaving it up to the sender to ensure that nothing incriminating is leftMake certain choicesI favor sending everything, unless specifically told not to, as this makes fewer assumptions about the intended form of the message and thus allows more flexibility in designing new functions.For example, this is what Matthew Ghio had to to say about his remailer:        ‚ÄúEverything after the encrypted message gets passed along in the clear. If you don‚Äôt want this, you can remove it using the cutmarks feature with my remailer. (Also, remail@extropia.wimsey.com doesn‚Äôt append the text after the encrypted message.)  The reason for this is that it allows anonymous replies.  I can create a pgp message for a remailer which will be delivered to myself.  I send you the PGP message, you append some text to it, and send it to the remailer.  The remailer decrypts it and remails it to me, and I get your message. [M.G., alt.privacy.anon-server, 1994-07-03] 8.6.7. Remailer SitesThere is no central administrator of sites, of course, so a variety of tools are the best ways to develop one‚Äôs own list of sites. (Many of us, I suspect, simply settle on a dozen or so of our favorites.

Dealing with Remailer AbuseThe Hot Potato    a remailer who is being used very heavily, or suspects abuse, may choose to distribute his load to other remailers. Generally, he can instead of remailing to the next site, add sites of his own choosing. Thus, he can both reduce the spotlight on him and also increase cover traffic by scattering some percentage of his traffic to other sites (it never reduces his traffic, just lessens the focus on him).Flooding attacks    denial of service attackslike blowing whistles at sports events, to confuse the actionDC-Nets, disruption (disruptionf of DC-Nets by flooding is a very similar problem to disruption of remailers by mail bombs)‚ÄúHow can remailers deal with abuse?‚Äù    Several remailer operators have shut down their remailers, either because they got tired of dealing with the problems, or because others ordered them to.Source level blockingPaid messages: at least this makes the abusers pay  and stops certain kinds of spamming/bombing attacks.Disrupters are dealt with in anonymous ways in Chaum‚Äôs DC- Net schemes; there may be a way to use this here.Karl Kleinpaste was a pioneer (circa 1991-2) of remailers. He has become disenchanted:    ‚ÄúThere are 3 sites out there which have my software: anon.penet.fi, tygra, and uiuc.edu.  I have philosophical disagreement with the ‚Äúuniversal reach‚Äù policy of anon.penet.fi (whose code is now a long-detached strain from the original software I gave Julf ‚Äì indeed, by now it may be a complete rewrite, I simply don‚Äôt know); ‚Ä¶.Very bluntly, having tried to run anon servers twice, and having had both go down due to actual legal difficulties, I don‚Äôt trust people with them any more.‚Äù [Karl_Kleinpaste@cs.cmu.edu, alt.privacy.anon-server, 1994-08-29]see discussions in alt.privacy.anon-server for more on his legal problems with remailers, and why he shut his down8.6.11.

Remailer FeaturesThere are dozens of proposed variations, tricks, and methods which may or may not add to overall remailer security (entropy, confusion). These are often discussed on the list, one at a time. Some of them are:    Using one‚Äôs self as a remailer node. Route traffic back through one‚Äôs own system.        even if all other systems are compromised‚Ä¶Random delays, over and above what is needed to meet reordering requirementsMIRVing, sending a packet out in multiple piecesEncryption is of course a primary feature.Digital postage.        Not so much a feature as an incentive/inducement to get more remailers and support them better.‚ÄúWhat are features of a remailer network?‚Äù    A vast number of features have been considered; some are derivative of other, more basic features (e.g., ‚Äúrandom delays‚Äù is not a basic feature, but is one proposed way of achieving ‚Äúreordering,‚Äù which is what is really needed. And ‚Äúreordering‚Äù is just the way to achieve ‚Äúdecorrelation‚Äù of incoming and outgoing messages).The ‚ÄúIdeal Mix‚Äù is worth considering, just as the ‚Äúideal op amp‚Äù is studied by engineers, regardless of whether one can ever be built.        a black box that decorrelates incoming and outgoing packets to some level of diffusiontamper-proof, in that outside world cannot see the internal process of decorrelation (Chaum envisioned tamper-resistant or tamper-responding circuits doing the decorrelation)Features of Real-World Mixes:        Decorrelation of incoming and outgoing messages. This is the most basic feature of any mix or remailer: obscuring the relationship between any message entering the mix and any message leaving the mix. How this is achieve is what most of the features here are all about.            ‚ÄúDiffusion‚Äù is achieved by batching or delaying (danger: low-volume traffic defeats simple, fixed delays)For example, in some time period, 20 messages enter a node. Then 20 or so (could be less, could be more‚Ä¶there is no reason not to add messages, or throw away some) messages leave.Encryption should be supported, else the decorrelation is easily defeated by simple inspection of packets.            public key encryption, clearly, is preferred (else the keys are available outside)forward encryption, using D-H approaches, is a useful idea to explore, with keys discarded after transmission‚Ä¶.thus making subpoenas problematic (this has been used with secure phones, for example).Quanitzed packet sizes. Obviously the size of a packet (e.g., 3137 bytes) is a strong cue as to message identity. Quantizing to a fixed size destroys this cue.            But since some messages may be small, and some large, a practical compromise is perhaps to quantize to one of several standards:                small messages, e.g., 5Kmedium messages, e.g., 20Klarge messages‚Ä¶.handled somehow (perhaps split up, etc.)More analysis is needed.Reputation and Service            How long in business?Logging policy? Are messages logged?the expectation of operating as statedThe Basic Goals of Remailer Use    decorrelation of ingoing and outgoing messages        indistinguishability‚Äúremailed messages have no hair‚Äù (apologies to the black hole fans out there)            no distinguishing charateristics that can be used to make correlationsno ‚Äúmemory‚Äù of previous appearancethis means message size padding to quantized sizes, typically        how many distinct sizes depends on a lot fo things, like traffic, the sizes of other messages, etc.Encryption, of course    PGPotherwise, messages are trivially distinguishableQuantization or Padding: Messages    padded  to standard sizes, or dithered in size to obscure oringinal size. For example, 2K for typical short messages, 5K for typical Usenet articles, and 20K for long articles. (Messages much longer are hard to hide in a sea of much shorter messages, but other possibilities exist: delaying the long messages until N other long messages have been accumulated, splitting the messages into smaller chunks, etc.)‚ÄúWhat are the quanta for remailers? That is, what are the preferred packet sizes for remailed messages?‚Äù        In the short term, now, the remailed packet sizes are pretty much what they started out to be, e.g, 3-6KB or so. Some remailers can pad to quantized levels, e.g., to 5K or 10K or more. The levels have not been settled on.In the long term, I suspect much smaller packets will be selected. Perhaps at the granularity of ATM packets. ‚ÄúATM Remailers‚Äù are likely to be coming. (This changes the nature of traffic analyis a bit, as the number of remailed packets increases.A dissenting argument: ATM networks don‚Äôt give sender the control over packets‚Ä¶Whatever, I think packets will get smaller, not larger. Interesting issues.‚ÄúBased on Hal‚Äôs numbers, I would suggest a reasonable quantization for message sizes be a short set of geometrically increasing values, namely, 1K, 4K, 16K, 64K.  In retrospect, this seems like the obvious quantization, and not arithmetic progressions.‚Äù [Eric Hughes, 1994-08-29](Eudora chokes at 32K, and so splits messages at about 25K, to leave room for comments without further splitting. Such practical considerations may be important to consider.)Return Mail    A complicated issue. May have no simple solution.Approaches:        Post encrypted message to a pool. Sender (who provided the key to use) is able to retrieve anonymously by the nature of pools and/or public posting.Return envelopes, using some kind of procedure to ensure anonymity. Since software is by nature never secure (can always be taken apart), the issues are complicated. The security may be gotten by arranging with the remailers in the return path to do certain things to certain messages.            sender sends instructions to remailers on how to treat messages of certain typesthe recipient who is replying cannot deduce the identity, because he has no access to the instructions the remailers have.Think of this as Alice sending to Bob sending to Charles‚Ä¶.sending to Zeke. Zeke sends a reply back to Yancy, who has instructions to send this back to Xavier, and so on back up the chain. Only if Bob, Charles, ‚Ä¶, Yancy collude, can the mapping in the reverse direction be deduced.Are these schemes complicated? Yes. But so are lot of other protocols, such as getting fonts from a screen to a laser printerReordering of Messages is Crucial    latency or fanout in remailers        much more important than ‚Äúdelay‚Äù            do some calculations!the canard about ‚Äúlatency‚Äù or delay keeps coming up                a ‚Äúdelay‚Äù of X is neither necessary nor sufficient to achieve reordering (think about it)essential for removing time correlation information, for removing a ‚Äúdistinguishing mark‚Äù (‚Äúideal remailed messages have no hair‚Äù)The importance of pay as you go, digital postage    standard market issues        markets are how scarece resources are allocatedreduces spamming, overloading, bombingcongestion pricingincentives for improvementfeedback mechanisms        in the same way the restaurants see impacts quicklyapplies to other crypto uses besides remailersMiscellaneous    by having one‚Äôs own nodes, further ensures security (true, the conspiring of all other nodes can cause traceability, but such a conspiracy is costly and would be revealed)the ‚Äúpublic posting‚Äù idea is very attractive: at no point does the last node know who the next node will be‚Ä¶all he knows is a public key for that node        so how does the next node in line get the message, short of reading all messages?            first, security is not much compromised by sorting the public postings by some kind of order set by the header (e.g., ‚ÄúFred‚Äù is shorthand for some long P-K, and hence the recipient knows to look in the Fs‚Ä¶obviously he reads more than just the Fs)outgoing messages can be ‚Äúbroadcast‚Äù (sent to many nodes, either by a literal broadcast or public posting, or by randomly picking many nodes)        this ‚Äúblackboard‚Äù system means no point to point communication is neededTimed-release strategies        encrypt and then release the key later            ‚Äúinnocuously‚Äù (how?)through a remailing serviceDC-Netvia an escrow service or a lawyer (but can the lawyer get into hot water for releasing the key to controversial data?)with a series of such releases, the key can be ‚Äúdiffused‚Äùsome companies may specialize in timed-release, such as by offering a P-K with the private key to be released some time laterin an ecology of cryptoid entities, this will increase the degrees of freedomthis reduces the legal liability of retransmitters‚Ä¶they can accurately claim that they were only passing data, that there was no way they could know the content of the packets            of course they can already claim this, due to the encrypted natureOne-Shot Remailers        ‚ÄúYou can get an anonymous address from mg5n+getid@andrew.cmu.edu.

Miscellaneous Aspects of Remailers‚ÄúHow many remailer nodes are actually needed?‚Äù    We strive to get as many as possible, to distribute the process to many jurisdictions and with many opeators.Curiously, as much theoretical diffusivity can occur with a single remailer (taking in a hundred messages and sending out a hundred, for example) as with many remailers. Our intuition is, I think, that many remailers offer better diffusivity and better hiding. Why this is so (if it is) needs more careful thinking than I‚Äôve seen done so far.At a meta-level, we think multiple remailers lessens the chance of them being compromised (this, however, is not directly related to the diffusivity of a remailer network- -important, but not directly related).(By the way, a kind of sneaky idea is to try to always declare one‚Äôs self to be a remailer. If messages were somehow traced back to one‚Äôs own machine, one could claim: ‚ÄòYes, I‚Äôm a remailer.‚Äù In principle, one could be the only remailer in the universe and still have high enough diffusion and confusion. In practice, being the only remailer would be pretty dangerous.)Diffusion and confusion in remailer networks        Consider a single node, with a message entering, and two messages leaving; this is essentially the smallest ‚Äúremailer op‚Äù            From a proof point of view, either outgoing message could be the oneand yet neither one can be proved to beNow imagine those two messages being sent through 10 remailers‚Ä¶no additional confusion is added‚Ä¶why?So, with 10 messages gong into a chain of 10 remailers, if 10 leave‚Ä¶The practical effect of N remailers is to ensure that compromise of some fraction of them doesn‚Äôt destroy overall security‚ÄúWhat do remailers do with misaddressed mail?‚Äù    Depends on the site. Some operators send notes back (which itself causes concern), some just discard defective mail. This is a fluid area. At least one remailer (wimsey) can post error messages to a message pool‚Äìthis idea can be generalized to provide ‚Äúdelivery receipts‚Äù and other feedback.Ideal mixes, a la Chaum, would presumably discard improperly-formed mail, although agents might exist to prescreen mail (not mandatory agents, of course, but voluntarily-selected agents)As in so many areas, legislation is not needed, just announcement of policies, choice by customers, and the reputation of the remailer.A good reason to have robust generation of mail on one‚Äôs own machine, so as to minimize such problems.‚ÄúCan the NSA monitor remailers? Have they?‚Äù    Certainly they can in various ways, either by directly monitoring Net traffic or indirectly. Whether they do is unknown.        There have been several rumors or forgeries claiming that NSA is routinely linking anonymous IDs to real IDs at the penet remailer.Cypherpunks remailers are, if used properly, more secure in key ways:            many of themnot used for persistent, assigned IDssupport for encryption: incoming and outgoing messages look completely unlikebatching, padding, etc. supportedAnd properly run remailers will obscure/diffuse the connection between incoming and outgoing messages‚Äìthe main point of a remailer!The use of message pools to report remailer errors    A good example of how message pools can be used to anonymously report things.‚ÄúThe wimsey remailer has an ingenious method of returning error messages anonymously.  Specify a subject in the message sent to wimsey that will be meaningful to you, but won‚Äôt identify you (like a set of random letters). This subject does not appear in the remailed message. Then subscribe to the mailing listerrors-request@extropia.wimsey.comby sending a message with Subject: subscribe.  You will receive a msg for ALL errors detected in incoming messages and ALL bounced messages.‚Äù [anonymous, 93-08-23]This is of course like reading a classified ad with some cryptic message meaningful to you alone. And more importantly, untraceable to you.there may be role for different types of remailers    those that support encryption, those that don‚Äôtas many in non-U.S. countries as possible        especially for the last hop, to avoid subpoena issuesfirst-class remailers which remail to any addressremailers which only remail to other remailersuseful for the timid, for those with limited support, etc.-‚ÄúShould mail faking be used as part of the remailer strategy?‚Äù    ‚Äú1. If you fake mail by talking SMTP directly, the IP address or domain name of the site making the outgoing connection will appear in a Received field in the header somewhere.‚Äù‚Äú2. Fake mail by devious means is generally frowned upon. There‚Äôs no need to take a back-door approach here‚Äìit‚Äôs bad politically, as in Internet politics.‚Äù [Eric Hughes, 94-01-31]And if mail can really be consistently and robustly faked, there would be less need for remailers, right? (Actually, still a need, as traffic analysis would likely break any ‚ÄúPort 25‚Äù faking scheme.)Furthermore, such a strategy would not likely to be robust over time, as it relies on exploiting transitory flaws and vendor specifics. A bad idea all around.Difficulties in getting anonymous remailer networks widely deployed    ‚ÄúThe tricky part is finding a way to preserve anonymity where the majority of sites on the Internet continue to log traffic carefully, refuse to install new software (especially anon-positive software), and are administrated by people with simplistic and outdated ideas about identity and punishment. ‚Äú [Greg Broiles, 1994-08-08]Remailer challenge: insulating the last leg on a chain from prosecution    Strategy 1: Get them declared to be common carriers, like the phone company or a mail delivery service        e.g., we don‚Äôt prosecute an actual package deliveryperson, or even the company they work for, for delivery of an illegal package            contents assumed to be unknown to the carrier(I‚Äôve heard claims that only carriers who make other agreements to cooperate with law enforcement can be treated as common carriers.)Strategy 2: Message pools        ftp sites            with plans for users to ‚Äúsubscribe to‚Äù all new messages (thus, monitoring agencies cannot know which, if any, messages are being sought)this gets around the complaint about too much volume on the Usenet (text messages are a tiny fraction of other traffic, especially images, so the complaint is only one of potentiality)Strategy 3: Offshore remailers as last leg        probably set by sender, who presumably knows the destinationA large number of ‚Äúsecondary remailers‚Äù who agree to remail a limited number‚Ä¶‚ÄúAre we just playing around with remailers and such?‚Äù    It pains me to say this, but, yes, we are just basically playing around here!Remailer traffic is so low, padding is so haphazard, that making correlations between inputs and outputs is not cryptographically hard to do.

Early uses were, predictably, by people who stumbled across the group and imputed to it whatever they wished.8.9. Legal Issues with Remailers 8.9.1. What‚Äôs the legal status of remailers?There are no laws against it at this time.No laws saying people have to put return addresses on messages, on phone calls (pay phones are still legal), etc.And the laws pertaining to not having to produce identity (the ‚Äúflier‚Äù case, where leaflet distributors did not have to produce ID) would seem to apply to this form of communication.However, remailers may come under fire:    Sysops, MIT case        potentially serious for remailers if the case is decided such that the sysop‚Äôs creation of group that was conducive to criminal pirating was itself a crime‚Ä¶that could make all  involved in remailers culpable 8.9.2. ‚ÄúCan remailer logs be subpoenaed?‚ÄùCount on it happening, perhaps very soon. The FBI has been subpoenaing e-mail archives for a Netcom customer (Lewis De Payne), probably because they think the e-mail will lead them to the location of uber-hacker Kevin Mitnick. Had the parties used remailers, I‚Äôm fairly sure we‚Äôd be seeing similar subpoenas for the remailer logs.There‚Äôs no exemption for remailers that I know of!The solutions are obvious, though:    use many remailers, to make subpoenaing back through the chain very laborious, very expensive, and likely to fail (if even one party won‚Äôt cooperate, or is outside the court‚Äôs jurisdiction, etc.)offshore, multi-jurisdictional remailers (seleted by the user)no remailer logs kept‚Ä¶destroy them (no law currently says anybody has to keep e-mail records!

This is why we want several things in remailers:    no logs of messagesmany remailersmultiple legal jurisdictions, e.g., offshore remailers (the more the better)hardware implementations which execute instructions flawlessly (Chaum‚Äôs digital mix) 8.9.5. Calls for limits on anonymityKids and the net will cause many to call for limits on nets, on anonymity, etc.    ‚ÄúBut there‚Äôs a dark side to this exciting phenomenon, one that‚Äôs too rarely understood by computer novices. Because they offer instant access to others, and considerable anonymity to participants, the services make it possible for people - especially computer-literate kids - to find themselves in unpleasant, sexually explicit social situations‚Ä¶.  And I‚Äôve gradually come to adopt the view, which will be controversial among many online users, that the use of nicknames and other forms of anonymity must be eliminated or severly curbed to force people online into at least as much accountability for their words and actions as exists in real social encounters.‚Äù [Walter S. Mossberg, Wall Street Journal, 6/30/94, provided by Brad Dolan]Eli Brandt came up with a good response to this: ‚ÄúThe sound-bite response to this: do you want your child‚Äôs name, home address, and phone number available to all those lurking pedophiles worldwide?  Responsible parents encourage their children to use remailers.‚ÄùSupreme Court said that identity of handbill distributors need not be disclosed, and pseudonyms in general has a long and noble traditionBBS operators have First Amendment protections (e.g.. registration requirements would be tossed out, exactly as if registration of newspapers were to be attempted) 8.9.6. Remailers and Choice of JurisdictionsThe intended target of a remailed message, and the subject material, may well influence the set of remailers used, especially for the very important ‚Äúlast remailer‚Äô (Note: it should never be necessary to tell remailers if they are first, last, or others, but the last remailer may in fact be able to tell he‚Äôs the last‚Ä¶if the message is in plaintext to the recipient, with no additional remailer commands embedded, for example.)A message involving child pornography might have a remailer site located in a state like Denmark, where child porn laws are less restrictive. And a message critical of Islam might not be best sent through a final remailer in Teheran. Eric Hughes has dubbed this ‚Äúregulatory arbitrage,‚Äù and to various extents it is already common practice.Of course, the sender picks the remailer chain, so these common sense notions may not be followed. Nothing is perfect, and customs will evolve. I can imagine schemes developing for choosing customers‚Äìa remailer might not accept as a customer certain abusers, based on digital pseudonyms < hairy). 8.9.7.

Could anonymous remailers be used to entrap people, or to   gather information for investigations?First, there are so few current remailers that this is unlikely. Julf seems a non-narc type, and he is located in Finland. The Cypherpunks remailers are mostly run by folks like us, for now.However, such stings and set-ups have been used in the past by narcs and ‚Äúred squads.‚Äù Expect the worse from Mr. Policeman. Now that evil hackers are identified as hazards, expect moves in this direction. ‚ÄúCryps‚Äù are obviously ‚Äúcrack‚Äù dealers.But use of encryption, which CP remailers support (Julf‚Äôs does not), makes this essentially moot.8.10. Cryptanalysis of Remailer Networks8.10.1. The Need for More Detailed Analysis of Mixes and Remailers‚ÄúHave remailer systems been adequately cryptanalyzed?‚Äù    Not in my opinion, no. Few calculations have been done, just mostly some estimates about how much ‚Äúconfusion‚Äù has been created by the remailer nodes.But thinking that a lot of complication and messiness makes a strong crypto system is a basic mistake‚Ä¶sort of like thinking an Enigma rotor machine makes a good cipher system, by today‚Äôs standards, just because millions of combinations of pathways through the rotor system are possible. Not so.Deducing Patterns in Traffic and Deducing Nyms    The main lesson of mathematical cryptology has been that seemingly random things can actually be shown to have structure. This is what cryptanalysis is all about.The same situation applies to ‚Äúseemingly random‚Äù message traffic, in digital mixes, telephone networks, etc. ‚ÄúCryptanalysis of remailers‚Äù is of course possible, depending on the underlying model. (Actually, it‚Äôs always possible, it just may not yield anything, as with cryptanalysis of ciphers.)on the time correlation in remailer cryptanalysis        imagine Alice and Bob communicating through remailers‚Ä¶an observer, unable to follow specific messages through the remailers, could still notice pairwise correlations between messages sent and received by these twolike time correlations between events, even if the intervening path or events are jumbled            e.g., if within a few hours of every submarine‚Äôs departure from Holy Loch a call is placed to Moscow, one may make draw certain conclusions about who is a Russian spy, regardless of not knowing the intermediate pathsor, closer to home, correlating withdrawals from one bank to deposits in another, even if the intervening transfers are jumbledjust because it seems ‚Äúrandom‚Äù does not mean it is            Scott Collins speculates that a ‚Äúdynamic Markov compressor‚Äù could discern or uncover the non- randomness in remailer usesCryptanalysis of remailers has been woefully lacking. A huge fraction of posts about remailer improvements make hand-waving arguments about the need for more traffic, longer delays, etc. (I‚Äôm not pointing fingers, as I make the same informal, qualitative comments, too. What is needed is a rigorous analysis of remailer security.)We really don‚Äôt have any good estimates of overall security as a function of number of messages circulating, the latency ( number of stored messages before resending), the number of remailer hops, etc. This is not cryptographically ‚Äúexciting‚Äù work, but it‚Äôs still needed. There has not been much focus in the academic community on digital mixes or remailers, probably because David Chaum‚Äôs 1981 paper on ‚ÄúUntraceable E-Mail‚Äù covered most of the theoretically interesting material. That, and the lack of commercial products or wide usage.Time correlations may reveal patterns that individual messages lack. That is, repeated communicatin between Alice and Bob, even if done through remailers and even if time delays/dwell times are built-in, may reveal nonrandom correlations in sent/received messages.    Scott Collins speculates that a dynamic Markov compressor applied to the traffic would have reveal such correlations. (The application of such tests to digital cash and other such systems would be useful to look at.)Another often overlooked weakness is that many people send test messages to themselves, a point noted by Phil Karn: ‚ÄúAnother way that people often let themselves be caught is that they inevitably send a test message to themselves right before the forged message in question. This shows up clearly in the sending system‚Äôs sendmail logs. It‚Äôs a point to consider with remailer chains too, if you don‚Äôt trust the last machine on the chain.‚Äù [P.K., 1994-09-06]What‚Äôs needed:    aggreement on some terminology (this doesn‚Äôt require consensus, just a clearly written paper to de facto establish the terminology)a formula relating degree of untraceability to the major factors that go into remailers: packet size and quantization, latency (# of messages), remailer policies, timing, etc.Also, analysis of how deliberate probes or attacks might be mounted to deduce remailer patterns (e.g., Fred always remails to Josh and Suzy and rarely to Zeke).I think this combinatorial analysis would be a nice little monograph for someone to write.8.10.2. A much-needed thing. Hal Finney has posted some calculations   (circa 1994-08-08), but more work is sorely needed.8.10.3. In particular, we should be skeptical of hand-waving analyses   of the ‚Äúit sure looks complicated to follow the traffic‚Äù   sort. People think that by adding ‚Äúmessy‚Äù tricks, such as   MIRVing messages, that security is increased. Maybe it is,   maybe it isn‚Äôt. But it needs formal analysis before claims   can be confidantly believed.8.10.4. Remailers and entropyWhat‚Äôs the measure of ‚Äúmixing‚Äù that goes on in a mix, or remailer?Hand=waving about entropy and reordering may not be too useful.Going back to Shannon‚Äôs concept of entropy as measuring the degree of uncertainty‚Ä¶    trying to ‚Äúguess‚Äù or ‚Äúpredict‚Äô where a message leaving one node will exit the system        not having clear entrance and exit points adds to the difficulty, somewhat analogously to having a password of unknown length (an attacker can‚Äôt just try all 10- character passwords, as he has no idea of the length)the advantages of every node being a remailer, of having no clearly identified sources and sinksThis predictability may depend on a series of messages sent between Alice and Bob‚Ä¶how?    it seems there may be links to Persi Diaconis‚Äô work on ‚Äúperfect shuffles‚Äù (a problem which seemed easy, but which eluded solving until recently‚Ä¶should give us comfort that our inability to tackle the real meat of this issue is not too surprising8.10.5. Scott Collins believes that remailer networks can be cryptanalyzed roughly the same way as pseudorandom number generators are analyzed, e.g., with dynamic Markov compressors (DNCs). (I‚Äôm more skeptical: if each remailer is using an information-theoretically secure RNG to reorder the messages, and if all messages are the same size and (of course) are encypted with information-theoretically secure (OTP) ciphers, then it seems to me that the remailing would itself be information-theoretically secure.)8.11. Dining Cryptographers8.11.1. This is effectively the ‚Äúideal digital mix,‚Äù updated from   Chaum‚Äôs original hardware mix form to a purely software-based   form.8.11.2. David Chaum‚Äôs 1988 paper in Journal of Crypology (Vol 1, No   1) outlines a way for completely untraceable communication   using only software (no tamper-resistant modules needed)participants in a ring (hence ‚Äúdining cryptographers‚Äù)Chaum imagines that 3 cryptographers are having dinner and are informed by their waiter that their dinner has already been paid for, perhaps by the NSA, or perhaps by one of themselves‚Ä¶they wish to determine which of these is true, without revealing which of them paid!everyone flips a coin (H or T) and shows it to his neighbor on the lefteveryone reports whether he sees ‚Äúsame‚Äù or ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù    note that with 2 participants, they both already knowthe other‚Äôs coin (both are to the left!)however, someone wishing to send a message, such as Chaum‚Äôs example of  ‚ÄúI paid for dinner,‚Äù instead says the opposite of what he seessome analysis of this (analyze it from the point of view of one of the cryptographers) shows that the 3 cryptographers will know that one of them paid (if this protocol is executed faithfully), but that the identity can‚Äôt be ‚Äúlocalized‚Äù    a diagram is needed‚Ä¶this can be generalized‚Ä¶    longer messages        use multiple rounds of the protocolfaster than coin-flipping        each participant and his left partner share a list of ‚Äúpre-flipped‚Äù coins, such as truly random bits (radioactive decay, noise, etc.) stored on a CD-ROM or whateverthey can thus ‚Äúflip coins‚Äù as fast as they can read the disksimultaneous messages (collision)        use back-off and retry protocols (like Ethernet uses)collusion of participants        an interesting issue‚Ä¶remember that participants are not restricted to the simple ring topologyvarious subgraphs can be formeda participant who fears collusion can pick a subgraph that includes those he doubts will collude (a tricky issue)anonymity of receiver        can use P-K to encrypt message to some P-K and then ‚Äúbroadcast‚Äù it and force every participant to try to decrypt it (only the anonymous recipient will actually succeed)Chaum‚Äôs complete 1988 ‚ÄúJournal of Cryptology‚Äù article is available at the Cypherpunks archive site, ftp.soda.csua.edu, in /pub/cypherpunks8.11.3.

The commercial providers, like  Netcom, Portal, and Panix, cannot be counted on to stand  and fight should pressures mount (this is just my guess,  not an aspersion against their backbones, whether organic  or Internet).    - Locating remailers in many non-U.S. countries is a Good  Idea. As with money-laundering, lots of countries means  lots of jurisdictions, and the near impossibility of  control by one country.Digital Postage, or Pay-as-you-Go Services:    Some fee for the service. Just like phone service, modem time, real postage, etc. (But unlike highway driving, whose usage is largely subsidized.)This will reduce spamming, will incentivize remailer services to better maintain their systems, and willRates would be set by market process, in the usual way. ‚ÄúWhat the traffic will bear.‚Äù Discounts, favored customers, rebates, coupons, etc. Those that don‚Äôt wish to charge, don‚Äôt have to (they‚Äôll have to deal with the problems).Generations    1st Gen‚ÄìToday‚Äôs Remailer:2nd Gen‚ÄìNear Future (c. 1995)3rd Gen-4th Gen‚Äì8.12.2.

Miscellaneous CommentsAs with a couple of other sections, I won‚Äôt try to be as complete as some might desire. Just too many thousands of pages of stuff to consider.9.3. Introduction 9.3.1. What is Clipper?government holds the skeleton keysanalogies to other systems 9.3.2. Why do most Cypherpunks oppose Clipper?fear of restrictions on crypto, derailing so many wonderful possibilities 9.3.3. Why does Clipper rate its own section?The announcement of the ‚ÄúEscrowed Encryption Standard,‚Äù EES, on April 16, 1993, was a galvanizing event for Cypherpunks and for a large segment of the U. S. population. The EES was announced originally as ‚ÄúClipper,‚Äù despite the use of the name Clipper by two major products (the Intergraph CPU and a dBase software tool), and the government backed off on the name. Too late, though, as the name ‚ÄúClipper‚Äù had become indelibly linked to this whole proposal. 9.3.4. ‚ÄúIs stopping Clipper the main goal of Cypherpunks?‚ÄùIt certainly seems so at times, as Clipper has dominated the topics since the Clipper announcement in April, 1993.it has become so, with monkeywrenching efforts in several areas    lobbying and education against it (though informal, such lobbying has been successful‚Ä¶look at NYT article)‚ÄúBig Brother Inside‚Äù and t-shirtstechnical monkeywrenching (Matt Blaze‚Ä¶hesitate to claim any credit, but he has been on our list, attended a meeting, etc.)Although it may seem so, Clipper is just one aspect‚Ä¶step‚Ä¶initiative.Developing new software tools, writing code, deploying remailers and digital cash are long-range projects of great importance.The Clipper key escrow proposal came along (4-93) at an opportune time for Cypherpunks and became a major focus. Emergency meetings, analyses, etc.9.4. Crypto Policy Issues 9.4.1. Peter Denning on crypto policy:provided by Pat Farrell, 1994-08-20; Denning comments are 1992-01-22, presented at Computers, Freedom, and Privacy 2. Peter D. uses the metaphor of a ‚Äúclearing,‚Äùas in a forest, for the place where people meet to trade, interact, etc. What others call markets, agoras, or just ‚Äúcyberspace.‚Äù    ‚ÄúInformation technology in producing a clearing in which individuals and corporations are key players besides government. Any attempt by government to control the flow of information over networks will be ignored or met with outright hostility.  There is no practical way that government can control information except information directly involved in the business of governing.  It should not try.‚Äù [Peter Denning, PUBLIC POLICY FOR THE 21ST CENTURY, DRAFT 1/22/92]No word on how this view squares with his wife‚Äôs control freak views. 9.4.2. Will government and NSA in particular attempt to acquire some   kind of control over crypto companies?speculations, apparently unfounded, that RSA Data Security is influenced by NSA wishes    weaknesses in the DES keys picked?and companies may be dramatically influenced by contracts (and the witholding of them) 9.4.3. NIST and DSS 9.4.4. Export restrictions, Munitions List, ITAR 9.4.5. old crypto machines sold to Third World governments, cheaplyperhaps they think they can make some changes and outsmart the NSA (which probably has rigged it so any changes are detectable and can be factored in)and just knowing the type of machine is a huge advantage 9.4.6. 4/28/97   The first of several P-K and RSA patents expiresU.S. Patent Number: 4200770    Title: Cryptographic Apparatus and MethodInventors: Hellman, Diffie, MerkleAssignee: Stanford UniversityFiled: September 6, 1977Granted: April 29, 1980[Expires: April 28, 1997]remember that any one of these several patents held by Public Key Partners (Stanford and M.I.T., with RSA Data Security the chief dispenser of licenses) can block an effort to bypass the others    though this may get fought out in court 9.4.7. encryption will be needed inside computer systemsfor operating system protectionfor autonomous agents (active agents)for electronic money9.5. Motivations for Crypto Laws 9.5.1. ‚ÄúWhat are the law enforcement and FBI worries?‚Äù‚ÄúFBI Director Louis Freeh is worried. The bad guys are beginning to see the light, and it is digital. ‚Ä¶ Freeh fears some pretty nasty folks have discovered they can commit highway robbery and more, without even leaving home. Worse, to Freeh and other top cops, by using some pretty basic technologies, savvy criminals can do their crimes without worrying about doing time.‚ÄúSome crooks, spies, drug traffickers, terrorists and frauds already use the tools of the information age to outfox law enforcement officers. Hackers use PBXs to hide their tracks as they rip off phone companies and poke around in other people‚Äôs files. Reprogrammed cellular phones give cops fits.‚Äù [LAN Magazine,‚ÄùIs it 1984?,‚Äù by Ted Bunker, August 1994]Their fears have some validity‚Ä¶in the same way that the rulers in Gutenberg‚Äôs time could have some concerns about the implications of books (breaking of guilds, spread of national secrets, pornography, atheism, etc.). 9.5.2. ‚ÄúWhat motivated Clipper? What did the Feds hope to gain?‚Äùostensibly to stop terrorists (only the unsophisticated ones, if alternatives are allowed)to force a standard on average Americanspossibly to limit crypto developmentPhil Karn provides an interesting motivation for Clipper: ‚ÄúKey escrow exists only because the NSA doesn‚Äôt want to risk blame if some terrorist or drug dealer were to use an unescrowed NSA-produced ‚Ä¶..The fact that a terrorist or drug dealer can easily go elsewhere and obtain other strong or stronger algorithms without key escrow is irrelevant. The NSA simply doesn‚Äôt care as long as they can‚Äôt be blamed for whatever happens. Classic CYA, nothing more‚Ä¶..A similar analysis applies to the export control regulations regarding cryptography.‚Äù [Phil Karn, 1994-08- 31]    Bill Sommerfeld notes: ‚ÄúIf this is indeed the case, Matt Blaze‚Äôs results should be particularly devastating to them.‚Äù [B.S., 1994-09-01] 9.5.3. Steve Witham has an interesting take on why folks like Dorothy Denning and Donn Parker support key escrow so ardently:‚ÄúMaybe people like Dot and Don think of government as a systems-administration sort of job.  So here they are, security experts advising the sys admins on things like‚Ä¶setting permissions allocating quotas registering users and giving them passwords‚Ä¶.. deciding what utilities are and aren‚Äôt available deciding what software the users need, and installing it          (grudgingly, based on who‚Äôs yelling the loudest) setting up connections to other machines deciding who‚Äôs allowed to log in from ‚Äúforeign hosts‚Äù getting mail set up and running buying new hardware from vendors specifying the hardware to the vendors ‚Ä¶‚ÄúThese are the things computer security experts advise on. Maybe hammer experts see things as nails.‚ÄúOnly a country is not a host system owned and administered by the government, and citizens are not guests or users.‚Äù [Steve Witham, Government by Sysadmin, 1994-03-23]9.5.4. Who would want to use key escrow? 9.5.5. ‚ÄúWill strong crypto really thwart government plans?‚ÄùYes, it will give citizens the basic capabilities that foreign governments have had for many yearsDespite talk about codebreakes and the expertise of the NSA, the plain fact is that no major Soviet ciphers have been broken for many years    recall the comment that NSA has not really broken any Soviet systems in many years        except for the cases, a la the Walker case, where plaintext versions are gotten, i.e., where human screwups occurredthe image in so many novels of massive computers breaking codes is absurd: modern ciphers will not be broken (but the primitive ciphers used by so many Third World nations and their embassies will continue to be child‚Äôs play, even for high school science fair projects‚Ä¶could be a good idea for a small scene, about a BCC student who has his project pulled) 9.5.6. ‚ÄúWhy does the government want short keys?‚ÄùCommercial products have often been broken by hackers. The NSA actually has a charter to help businesses protect their secrets; just not so strongly that the crypto is unbreakable by them. (This of course has been part of the tension between the two sides of the NSA for the past couple of decades.)So why does the government want crippled key lengths?    ‚ÄúThe question is: how do you thwart hackers while permitting NSA access? The obvious answer is strong algorithm(s) and relatively truncated keys.‚Äù [Grady Ward, sci.crypt, 1994-08-15]9.6. Current Crypto Laws 9.6.1. ‚ÄúHas crypto been restricted in countries other than the   U.S.?‚ÄùMany countries have restrictions on civilian/private use of crypto. Some even insist that corporations either send all transmissions in the clear, or that keys be provided to the government. The Phillipines, for example. And certainly regimes in the Communists Bloc, or what‚Äôs left of it, will likely have various laws restricting crypto. Possibly draconian laws‚Ä¶.in many cultures, use of crypto is tantamount to espionage.9.7. Crypto Laws Outside the U.S. 9.7.1. ‚ÄúInternational Escrow, and Other Nation‚Äôs Crypto Policies?‚ÄùThe focus throughout this document on U.S. policy should not lull non-Americans into complacency. Many nations already have more Draconian policies on the private use of encryption than the U.S. is even contemplating (publically). France outlaws private crypto, though enforcement is said to be problematic (but I would not want the DGSE to be on my tail, that‚Äôs for sure). Third World countries often have bans on crypto, and mere possession of random-looking bits may mean a spying conviction and a trip to the gallows.There are also several reports that European nations are preparing to fall in line behind the U.S. on key escrow    NorwayNetherlandsBritainA conference in D.C. in 6/94, attended by Whit Diffie (and reported on to us at the 6/94 CP meeting) had internation escrow arrangements as a topic, with the crypto policy makers of NIST and NSA describing various options    bad news, because it could allow bilateral treaties to supercede basic rightscould be plan for getting key escrow made mandatorythere are also practical issues        who can decode international communications?            do we really want the French reading Intel‚Äôs communications?

Lots of evidence of compliance. 9.7.3. ‚ÄúIs Europe Considering Key Escrow?‚ÄùYes, in spades. Lots of signs of this, with reports coming in from residents of Europe and elsewhere. The Europeans tend to be a bit more quiet in matters of public policy (at least in some areas).‚ÄúThe current issue of `Communications Week International‚Äô informs us that the European Union‚Äôs Senior Officials Group for Security of Information Systems has been considering plans for standardising key escrow in Europe.‚ÄúAgreement had been held up by arguments over who should hold the keys.

France planning Big Brother smart card?‚ÄúPARIS, FRANCE, 1994 MAR 4 (NB) ‚Äì The French government has confirmed its plans to replace citizen‚Äôs paper-based ID cards with credit card-sized ‚Äúsmart card‚Äù ID cards. ‚Ä¶.. ‚ÄúThe cards contain details of recent transactions, as well as act  as an ‚Äúelectronic purse‚Äù for smaller value transactions using a personal identification number (PIN) as authorization. ‚ÄúPurse transactions‚Äù are usually separate from the card credit/debit system, and, when the purse is empty, it can be reloaded from the card at a suitable ATM or retailer terminal.‚Äù  (Steve Gold/19940304)‚Äù [this was forwarded to me for posting] 9.7.6. PTTs, local rules about modem use 9.7.7. ‚ÄúWhat are the European laws on ‚ÄúData Privacy‚Äù and why are   they such a terrible idea?‚ÄùVarious European countries have passed laws about the compiling of computerized records on people without their explicit permission. This applies to nearly all computerized records‚Äìmailing lists, dossiers, credit records, employee files, etc.‚Äìthough some exceptions exist and, in general, companies can find ways to compile records and remain within the law.The rules are open to debate, and the casual individual who cannot afford lawyers and advisors, is likely to be breaking the laws repeatedly. For example, storing the posts of people on the Cypherpunks list in any system retrievable by name would violate Britain‚Äôs Data Privacy laws. That almost no such case would ever result in a prosecution (for practical reasons) does not mean the laws are acceptable.To many, these laws are a ‚Äúgood idea.‚Äù But the laws miss the main point, give a false sense of security (as the real dossier-compilers are easily able to obtain exemptions, or are government agencies themselves), and interfere in what people do with information that properly and legally comes there way. (Be on the alert for ‚Äúcivil rights‚Äù groups like the ACLU and EFF to push for such data privacy laws. The irony of Kapor‚Äôs connection to Lotus and the failed ‚ÄúMarketplace‚Äù CD-ROM product cannot be ignored.)Creating a law which bans the keeping of certain kinds of records is an invitation to having ‚Äúdata inspectors‚Äù rummaging through one‚Äôs files. Or some kind of spot checks, or even software key escrow.(Strong crypto makes these laws tough to enforce. Either the laws go, or the counties with such laws will then have to limit strong crypto‚Ä¶.not that that will help in the long run.)The same points apply to well-meaning proposals to make employer monitoring of employees illegal. It sounds like a privacy-enhancing idea, but it tramples upon the rights of the employer to ensure that work is being done, to basically run his business as he sees fit, etc. If I hire a programmer and he‚Äôs using my resources, my network connections, to run an illegal operation, he exposes my company to damages, and of course he isn‚Äôt doing the job I paid him to do. If the law forbids me to monitor this situation, or at least to randomly check, then he can exploit this law to his advantage and to my disadvantage. (Again, the dangers of rigid laws, nonmarket solutions,(lied game theory.) 9.7.8. on the situation in AustraliaMatthew Gream [M.Gream@uts.edu.au] informed us that the export situation in Oz is just as best as in the U.S. [1994- 09-06] (as if we didn‚Äôt know‚Ä¶much as we all like to dump on Amerika for its fascist laws, it‚Äôs clear that nearly all countries are taking their New World Order Marching Orders from the U.S., and that many of them have even more repressive crypto laws alredy in place‚Ä¶they just don‚Äôt get the discussion the U.S. gets, for apparent reasons)    ‚ÄúWell, fuck that for thinking I was living under a less restrictive regime ‚Äì and I can say goodbye to an international market for my software.](I left his blunt language as is, for impact.) 9.7.9. ‚ÄúFor those interested, NIST have a short document for FTP, ‚ÄòIdentification & Analysis of Foreign Laws & Regulations Pertaining to the Use of Commercial Encryption Products for Voice & Data Communications‚Äô.

Digital Telephony 9.8.1. ‚ÄúWhat is Digital Telephony?‚ÄùThe Digital Telephony Bill, first proposed under Bush and again by Clinton, is in many ways much worse than Clipper. It has gotten less attention, for various reasons.For one thing,  it is seen as an extension by some of existing wiretap capabilities. And, it is fairly abstract, happening behind the doors of telephone company switches.The implications are severe: mandatory wiretap and pen register (who is calling whom) capaibilities, civil penalties of up to $10,000 a day for insufficient compliance, mandatory assistance must be provided, etc.If it is passed, it could dictate future technology. Telcos who install it will make sure that upstart technologies (e.g., Cypherpunks who find ways to ship voice over computer lines) are also forced to ‚Äúplay by the same rules.‚Äù Being required to install government-accessible tap points even in small systems would of course effectively destroy them.On the other hand, it is getting harder and harder to make Digital Telephony workable, even by mandate.

In principle, it could thus be used for data encryption in general.In practice, the name Clipper is generally associated with telephone use, while ‚ÄúCapstone‚Äù is the data standard (some differences, too). The ‚ÄúSkipjack‚Äù algorithm is used in several of these proposed systems (Tessera, also).9.16.12. ‚ÄúWhy is Clipper worse than what we have now?‚ÄùJohn Gilmore answered this question in a nice essay. I‚Äôm including the whole thing, including a digression into cellular telephones, because it gives some insight‚Äìand names some names of NSA liars‚Äìinto how NSA and NIST have used their powers to thwart true security.    ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs worse because the market keeps moving toward providing real encryption.‚ÄúIf Clipper succeeds, it will be by displacing real secure encryption. If real secure encryption makes it into mass market communications products, Clipper will have failed.  The whole point is not to get a few Clippers used by cops; the point is to make it a worldwide standard, rather than having 3-key triple-DES with RSA and Diffie-Hellman become the worldwide standard.‚ÄúWe‚Äôd have decent encryption in digital cellular phones now, except for the active intervention of Jerry Rainville of NSA, who `hosted‚Äô a meeting of the standards committee inside Ft. Meade, lied to them about export control to keep committee documents limited to a small group, and got a willing dupe from Motorola, Louis Finkelstein, to propose an encryption scheme a child could break.  The IS-54 standard for digital cellular doesn‚Äôt describe the encryption scheme ‚Äì it‚Äôs described in a separate document, which ordinary people can‚Äôt get, even though it‚Äôs part of the official accredited standard.  (Guess who accredits standards bodies though -that‚Äôs right, the once pure NIST.)‚ÄúThe reason it‚Äôs secret is because it‚Äôs so obviously weak.  The system generates a 160-bit ‚Äúkey‚Äù and then simply XORs it against each block of the compressed speech.  Take any ten or twenty blocks and recover the key by XORing frequent speech patterns (like silence, or the letter ‚ÄúA‚Äù) against pieces of the blocks to produce guesses at the key.  You try each guess on a few blocks, and the likelihood of producing something that decodes like speech in all the blocks is small enough that you‚Äôll know when your guess is the real key.‚ÄúNSA is continuing to muck around in the Digital Cellular standards committee (TR 45.3) this year too.  I encourage anyone who‚Äôs interested to join the committee, perhaps as an observer.  Contact the Telecommunications Industry Association in DC and sign up.  Like any standards committee, it‚Äôs open to the public and meets in various places around the country.  I‚Äôll lend you a lawyer if you‚Äôre a foreign national, since the committee may still believe that they must exclude foreign nationals from public discussions of cryptography.  Somehow the crypto conferences have no trouble with this; I think it‚Äôs called the First Amendment.  NSA knows the law here ‚Äì indeed it enforces it via the State Dept ‚Äì but lied to the committee.‚Äù [John Gilmore, ‚ÄúWhy is clipper worse than ‚Äúno encryption like we have,‚Äù comp.org.eff.talk, 1994-04- 27]9.16.13. on trusting the government‚ÄúWHAT AM THE MORAL OF THE STORY, UNCLE REMUS?‚Ä¶.When the government makes any announcement (ESPECIALLY a denial), you should figure out what the government is trying to get you to do‚Äìand do the opposite.

In my view, any focus on the details of Clipper instead of the overall concept of key escrow plays into their hands. This is not to say that the work of Blaze and others is misguided‚Ä¶.in fact, it‚Äôs very fine work. But a general focus on the details of Skipjack does nothing to allay my concerns about the principle of government-mandated crypto.If it were ‚Äúhouse key escrow‚Äù and there were missing details   about the number of teeth allowed on the keys, would be then   all breathe a sigh of relief if the details of the teeth were   clarified? Of course not. Me, I will never use a key escrow   system, even if a blue ribbon panel of hackers and   Cypherpunks studies the design and declares it to be   cryptographically sound.9.18.9. Concern about Clipperallows past communications to be readauthorities could‚Äìmaybe‚Äìread a lot of stuff, even illegally, then use this for other investigations (the old ‚Äúwe had an anonymous tip‚Äù ploy)    ‚ÄúThe problem with Clipper is that it provides police agencies with dramatically enhanced target acquistion. There is nothing to prevent NSA, ATF, FBI (or the Special Projects division of the Justice Department) from reviewing all internet traffic, as long as they are willing to forsake using it in a criminal prosecution.‚Äù [dgard@netcom.com, alt.privacy.clipper, 1994-07-05]9.18.10. Some wags have suggested that the new escrow agencies be chosen from groups like Amnesty International and the ACLU. Most of us are opposed to the ‚Äúvery idea‚Äù of key escrow (think of being told to escrow family photos, diaries, or house keys) and hence even these kinds of skeptical groups are unacceptable as escrow agents.9.19. Loose Ends9.19.1. ‚ÄúAre trapdoors‚Äìor some form of escrowed encryption‚Äì   justified in some cases?‚ÄùSure. There are various reasons why individuals, companies, etc. may want to use crypto protocols that allow them to decrypt even if they‚Äôve lost their key, perhaps by going to their lawyer and getting the sealed envelope they left with him, etc.    or using a form of ‚Äúsoftware key escrow‚Äù that allows them accessCorporations that wish to recover encrypted data    several scenarios        employee encrypts important files, then dies or is otherwise unavailableemployee leaves company before decrypting all files            some may be archived and not needed to be opened for many yearsemployee may demand ‚Äúransom‚Äù (closely related to virus extortion cases)files are found but the original encryptor is unknownLikely situation is that encryption algorithms will be mandated by corporation, with a ‚Äúmaster key‚Äù kept available    like a trapdoorthe existence of the master key may not even be publicized within the company (to head off concerns about security, abuses, etc.)The mandatory use of key escrow, a la a mandatory Clipper system, or the system many of us believe is being developed for software key escrow (SKE, also called ‚ÄúGAK,‚Äù for ‚Äúgovernment access to keys, by Carl Ellison) is completely different, and is unacceptable. (Clipper is discussed in many places here.)9.19.2. DSSContinuing confusion over patents, standards, licensing, etc.    ‚ÄúFIPS186 is DSS.

SUMMARY: Legal Issues10.2.1. Main Points10.2.2. Connections to Other SectionsSad to say, but legal considerations impinge on nearly every aspect of crypto10.2.3. Where to Find Additional Information10.2.4. Miscellaneous Comments‚ÄúI‚Äôm a scientist, Jim, not an attorney.‚Äù Hence, take my legal comments here with a grain of salt, representing only hints of the truth as I picked them up from the discussions on the various forums and lists.10.3. Basic Legality of Encryption10.3.1. ‚ÄúIs this stuff legal or illegal?‚ÄùCertainly the talking about it is mostly legal, at least in the U.S. and at the time of this writing. In other countries, you prison term may vary.The actions resulting from crypto, and crypto anarchy, may well be illegal. Such is often the case when technology is applied without any particular regard for what the laws say is permitted. (Pandora‚Äôs Box and all that.)    Cypherpunks really don‚Äôt care much about such ephemera as the ‚Äúlaws‚Äù of some geographic region. Cypherpunks make their own laws.There are two broad ways of getting things done:    First, looking at the law and regulations and finding ways to exploit them. This is the tack favored by lawyers, of whic$are many in this country.Second, ‚Äújust do it.‚Äù In areas where the law hasn‚Äôt caught up, this can mean unconstrained technological developement. Good examples are the computer and chip business, where issues of legality rarely arose (except in the usual areas of contract enforcement, etc.). More recently the chip business has discovered lawyering, with a vengeance.In other areas, where the law is centrally involved, ‚Äújust do it‚Äù can mean many technical violations of the law. Examples: personal service jobs (maids and babysitters), contracting jobs without licenses, permissions, etc., and so on. Often these are ‚Äúillegal markets,‚Äù putatively.And bear in mind that the legal system can be used to hassle people, to pressure them to ‚Äúplead out‚Äù to some charges, to back off, etc. (In the firearms business, the pressures and threats are also used to cause some manufacturers, like Ruger, to back off on a radical pro-gun stance, so as to be granted favors and milder treatment. Pressure on crypto-producing companies are probably very similar. Play ball, or we‚Äôll run you over in the parking lot.)10.3.2. ‚ÄúWhy is the legal status of crypto so murky?‚ÄùFirst, it may be murkier to me than it it to actual lawyers like Mike Godwin and Michael Froomkin, both of whom have been on our list at times. (Though my impression from talking to Godwin is that many or even most of these issues have not been addressed in the courts, let alone resolved definitively.)Second, crypto issues have not generally reached the courts, reflecting the nascent status of most of the things talked about it here. Things as ‚Äútrivial‚Äù as digital signatures and digital timestamping have yet to be challenged in courts, or declared illegal, or anything similar that might produce a precedent-setting ruling. (Stu Haber agrees that such tests are lacking.)Finally, the issues are deep ones, going to the heart of issues of self-incrimination (disclosure of keys, contempt), of intellectual property and export laws (want to jail someone for talking about prime numbers?), and the incredibly byzantine world of money and financial instruments.A legal study of crypto‚Äìwhich I hear Professor Froomkin is doing‚Äìcould be very important.10.3.3. ‚ÄúHas the basic legality of crypto and laws about crypto been   tested?‚ÄùAs usual, a U.S. focus here. I know little of the situation in non-U.S. countries (and in many of them the law is whatever the rulers say it is).And I‚Äôm not a lawyer.Some facts:    no direct Constitutional statement about privacy (though many feel it is implied)crypto was not a major issue (espionage was, and was dealt with harshly, but encrypting things was not a problem per se)only in the recent past has it become important‚Ä¶and it will become much more so        as criminals encrypt, as terrorists encryptas tax is avoided via the techniques described herecollusion of business (‚Äúcrypto interlocking directorates,‚Äù price signalling)black markets, information marketsLawrence Tribe..new amendment    scary, as it may place limits‚Ä¶. (but unlikely to happen)Crypto in Court    mostly untestedcan keys be compelled?Expect some important cases in the next several years10.3.4. ‚ÄúCan authorities force the disclosure of a key?‚ÄùMike Godwin, legal counsel for the EFF, has been asked this queston many times:    ‚ÄúNote that a court could cite you for contempt for not complying with a subpoena duces tecum (a subpoena requiring you to produce objects or documents) if you fail to turn over subpoenaed backups‚Ä¶.To be honest, I don‚Äôt think any security measure is adequate against a government that‚Äôs determined to overreach its authority and its citizens‚Äô rights, but crypto comes close.‚Äù [Mike Godwin, 1993-06-14]Torture is out (in many countries, but not all). Truth serum, etc., ditto.    ‚ÄúRubber hose cryptography‚ÄùConstitutional issues    self-incriminationon the ‚ÄúYes‚Äù side:    is same, some say,  as forcing combination to a safe containing information or stolen goods        but some say-and a court may have ruled on this-that the safe can always be cut open and so the issue is mostly mootwhile forcing key disclosure is compelled testimonyand one can always claim to have forgotten the keyi.e., what happens when a suspect simply clams up?but authorities can routinely demand cooperation in investigations, can seize records, etc.on the ‚ÄúNo‚Äù side:    can‚Äôt force a suspect to talk, whether about where he hid the loot or where his kidnap victim is hiddenpractically speaking, someone under indictment cannot be forced to reveal Swiss bank accounts‚Ä¶.this would seem to be directly analogous to a cryptographic keythus, the key to open an account would seem to be the same thinga memorized key cannot be forced, says someone with EFF or CPSR‚ÄúSafe‚Äù analogy    You have a safe, you won‚Äô tell the combination        you just refuseyou claim to have forgotten ityou really don‚Äôt know itcops can cut the safe open, so compelling a combination is not needed‚Äúinterefering with an investigation‚Äùon balance, it seems clear that the disclosure of cryptographic keys cannot be forced (though the practical penalty for nondisclosure could be severe)Courts    compelled testimony is certainly common        if one is not charged, one cannot take the 5th (may be some wrinkles here)contemptWhat won‚Äôt immunize disclosure:    clever jokes about ‚ÄúI am guilty of money laundering‚Äù        can it be used?does judge declaring immunity apply in this case?Eric Hughes has pointed out that the form of the statement is key: ‚ÄúMy key is: ‚ÄúI am a murderer.‚Äù‚Äù is not a legal admission of anything.(There may be some subtleties where the key does contain important evidence‚Äìperhaps the location of a buried body- -but I think these issues are relatively minor.)but this has not really been tested, so far as I knowand many people say that such cooperation can be demanded‚Ä¶Contempt, claims of forgetting10.3.5. Forgetting passwords, and testimonyThis is another area of intense speculation:    ‚ÄúI forgot. So sue me.‚Äù‚ÄúI forgot. It was just a temporary file I was working on, and I just can‚Äôt remember the password I picked.‚Äù (A less in-your-face approach.)‚ÄúI refuse to give my password on the grounds that it may tend to incriminate me.‚Äù        Canonical example: ‚ÄúMy password is: ‚ÄòI sell illegal drugs.‚Äô‚Äù            Eric Hughes has pointed out this is not a real admission of guilt, just a syntactic form, so it is nonsense to claim that it is incriminating. I agree. I don‚Äôt know if any court tests have confirmed this.Sandy Sandfort theorizes that this example might work, or at least lead to an interesting legal dilemma:    ‚ÄúAs an example, your passphrase could be:     I shot a cop in the back and buried his body  under     the porch at 123 Main St., anywhere USA.  The gun  is     wrapped in an oily cloth in my mother's attic. ‚ÄúI decline to answer on the grounds that my passphrase is a statement which may tend to incriminate me.  I will only give my passphrase if I am given immunity from prosecution for the actions to which it alludes.‚Äù‚ÄúToo cute, I know, but who knows, it might work.‚Äù [S.S., 1994-0727]10.3.6. ‚ÄúWhat about disavowal of keys? Of digital signatures? Of contracts?In the short term, the courts are relatively silent, as few of these issues have reached the courts. Things like signatures and contract breaches would likely be handled as they currently are (that is, the judge would look at the circumstances, etc.)Clearly this is a major concern. There are two main avenues of dealing with this‚Äù    The ‚Äúpurist‚Äù approach. You are your key. Caveat emptor. Guard your keys. If your signature is used, you are responsible. (People can lessen their exposure by using protocols that limit risk, analogous to the way ATM systems only allow, say, $200 a day to be withdrawn.)The legal system can be used (maybe) to deal with these issues. Maybe. Little of this has been tested in courts. Conventional methods of verifying forged signatures will not work. Contract law with digital signatures will be a new area.The problem of repudiation or disavowal was recognized early on in cryptologic circles. Alice is confronted with a digital signature, or whatever. She says; ‚ÄúBut I didn‚Äôt sign that‚Äù or ‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs my old key‚Äìit‚Äôs obsolete‚Äù or ‚ÄúMy sysadmin must have snooped through my files,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI guess those key escrow guys are at it again.‚ÄùI think that only the purist stance will hold water in the long run.(A hint of this: untraceable cash means, for most transactions of interest with digital cash, that once the crypto stuff has been handled, whether the sig was stolen or not is moot, because the money is gone‚Ä¶no court can rule that the sig was invalid and then retrieve the cash!)10.3.7. ‚ÄúWhat are some arguments for the freedom to encrypt?‚Äùbans are hard to enforce, requiring extensive police intrusionsprivate letters, diaries, conversationsin U.S., various provisionsanonymity is often needed10.3.8. Restrictions on anonymity‚Äúidentity escrow‚Äù is what Eric Hughes calls itlinits on mail drops, on anonymous accounts, and‚Äìperhaps ultimately‚Äìon cash purchases of any and all goods10.3.9. ‚ÄúAre bulletin boards and Internet providers ‚Äúcommon carriers‚Äù   or not?‚ÄùNot clear. BBS operators are clearly held more liable for content than the phone company is, for example.10.3.10. Too much cleverness is passing for lawMany schemes to bypass tax laws, regulations, etc., are, as the British like to say, ‚Äútoo cute by half.‚Äù For example, claims that the dollar is defined as 1/35th of an ounce of gold and that the modern dollar is only 1/10th of this. Or that Ohio failed to properly enter the Union, and hence all laws passed afterward are invalid. The same could be said of schemes to deploy digital cash be claiming that ordinary laws do not apply. Well, those who try such schemes often find out otherwise, sometimes in prison. Tread carefully.10.3.11. ‚ÄúIs it legal to advocate the overthrow of governments or the   breaking of laws?‚ÄùAlthough many Cypherpunks are not radicals, many others of us are, and we often advocate ‚Äúcollapse of governments‚Äù and other such things as money laundering schemes, tax evasion, new methods for espionage, information markets, data havens, etc. This rasises obvious concerns about legality.First off, I have to speak mainly of U.S. issues‚Ä¶the laws of Russia or Japan or whatever may be completely different. Sorry for the U.S.-centric focus of this FAQ, but that‚Äôs the way it is. The Net started here, and still is dominantly here, and the laws of the U.S. are being propagated around the world as part of the New World Order and the collapse of the other superpower.Is it legal to advocate the replacement of a government? In the U.S., it‚Äôs the basic political process (though cynics might argue that both parties represent the same governing philosophy). Advocating the violent overthrow of the U.S. government is apparently illegal, though I lack a cite on this.Is it legal to advocate illegal acts in general? Certainly much of free speech is precisely this: arguing for drug use, for boycotts, etc.    The EFF gopher site has this on ‚ÄúAdvocating Lawbreaking, Brandenburg v. Ohio. ‚Äú:        ‚ÄúIn the 1969 case of Brandenburg v. Ohio, the Supreme Court struck down the conviction of a Ku Klux Klan member under a criminal syndicalism law and established a new standard: Speech may not be suppressed or punished unless it is intended to produce ‚Äòimminent lawless action‚Äô and it is ‚Äòlikely to produce such action.‚Äô Otherwise, the First Amendment protects even speech that advocates violence. The Brandenburg test is the law today. ‚Äú10.4. Can Crypto be Banned?10.4.1. ‚ÄúWhy won‚Äôt government simply _ban such encryption methods?‚ÄùThis has always been the Number One Issue!    raised by Stiegler, Drexler, Salin, and several others (and in fact raised by some as an objection to my even discussing these issues, namely, that action may then be taken to head off the world I describe)Types of Bans on Encryption and Secrecy    Ban on Private Use of EncryptionBan on Store-and-Forward NodesBan on Tokens and ZKIPS AuthenticationRequirement for public disclosure of all transactionsRecent news (3-6-92, same day as Michaelangelo and Lawnmower Man) that government is proposing a surcharge on telcos and long distance services to pay for new equipment needed to tap phones!        S.266 and related billsthis was argued in terms of stopping drug dealers and other criminalsbut how does the government intend to deal with the various forms fo end-user encryption or ‚Äúconfusion‚Äù (the confusion that will come from compression, packetizing, simple file encryption, etc.)Types of Arguments Against Such Bans    The ‚ÄúConstitutional Rights‚Äù ArgumentsThe ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Too Late‚Äù Arguments        PCs are already widely scattered, running dozens of compression and encryption programs‚Ä¶it is far too late to insist on ‚Äúin the clear‚Äù broadcasts, whatever those may be (is program code distinguishable from encrypted messages? No.)encrypted faxes, modem scramblers (albeit with some restrictions)wireless LANs, packets, radio, IR, compressed text and images, etc‚Ä¶.all will defeat any efforts short of police state intervention (which may still happen)The ‚ÄúFeud Within the NSA‚Äù Arguments        COMSEC vs. PRODWill affect the privacy rights of corporations        and there is much evidence that corporations are in fact being spied upon, by foreign governments, by the NSA, etc.They Will Try to Ban Such Encryption Techniques    Stings (perhaps using viruses and logic bombs)        or ‚Äúbarium,‚Äù to trace the codeLegal liability for companies that allow employees to use such methods        perhaps even in their own time, via the assumption that employees who use illegal software methods in their own time are perhaps couriers or agents for their corporations (a tenuous point)10.4.2.

Scenario for a ban on encryption‚ÄúParanoia is cryptography‚Äôs occupational hazard.‚Äù [Eric Hughes, 1994-05-14]There are many scenarios. Here is a graphic one from Sandy Sandfort:    ‚ÄúRemember the instructions for cooking a live frog.  The government does not intend to stop until they have effectively eliminated your privacy.STEP 1:  Clipper becomes the de facto encryption standard.STEP 2:  When Cypherpunks and other ‚Äúcriminals‚Äù eschew Clipper in favor of trusted strong crypto, the government is ‚Äúforced‚Äù to ban non-escrowed encryption systems. (Gotta catch those pedophiles, drug dealers and terrorists, after all.)STEP 3:  When Cypherpunks and other criminals use superencryption with Clipper or spoof LEAFs, the government will regretably be forced to engage in random message monitoring to detect these illegal techniques.Each of these steps will be taken because we wouldn‚Äôt passively accept such things as unrestricted wiretaps and reasonable precautions like digital telephony.  It will portrayed as our fault. Count on it.‚Äù [Sandy Sandfort, 6-14-94]10.4.6. Can the flow of bits be stopped?

The MIT 2.6 negotiations seem to have buried all such rancor. At least officially. I hear there‚Äôs still animosity, but it‚Äôs no longer at the surface. (And RSADSI is now facing lawsuits and patent suits.)10.6. Legal Issues with Remailers 8.9.1. What‚Äôs the legal status of remailers?There are no laws against it at this time.No laws saying people have to put return addresses on messages, on phone calls (pay phones are still legal), etc.And the laws pertaining to not having to produce identity (the ‚Äúflier‚Äù case, where leaflet distributors did not have to produce ID) would seem to apply to this form of communication.However, remailers may come under fire:    Sysops, MIT case        potentially serious for remailers if the case is decided such that the sysop‚Äôs creation of group that was conducive to criminal pirating was itself a crime‚Ä¶that could make all  involved in remailers culpable 8.9.2. ‚ÄúCan remailer logs be subpoenaed?‚ÄùCount on it happening, perhaps very soon. The FBI has been subpoenaing e-mail archives for a Netcom customer (Lewis De Payne), probably because they think the e-mail will lead them to the location of uber-hacker Kevin Mitnick. Had the parties used remailers, I‚Äôm fairly sure we‚Äôd be seeing similar subpoenas for the remailer logs.There‚Äôs no exemption for remailers that I know of!The solutions are obvious, though:    use many remailers, to make subpoenaing back through the chain very laborious, very expensive, and likely to fail (if even one party won‚Äôt cooperate, or is outside the court‚Äôs jurisdiction, etc.)offshore, multi-jurisdictional remailers (seleted by the user)no remailer logs kept‚Ä¶destroy them (no law currently says anybody has to keep e-mail records! This may change‚Ä¶.)‚Äúforward secrecy,‚Äù a la Diffie-Hellman forward secrecy 8.9.3. How will remailers be harassed, attacked, and challenged? 8.9.4. ‚ÄúCan pressure be put on remailer operators to reveal traffic logs and thereby allow tracing of messages?‚ÄùFor human-operated systems which have logs, sure. This is why we want several things in remailers:    no logs of messagesmany remailersmultiple legal jurisdictions, e.g., offshore remailers (the more the better)hardware implementations which execute instructions flawlessly (Chaum‚Äôs digital mix) 8.9.5. Calls for limits on anonymityKids and the net will cause many to call for limits on nets, on anonymity, etc.    ‚ÄúBut there‚Äôs a dark side to this exciting phenomenon, one that‚Äôs too rarely understood by computer novices. Because they offer instant access to others, and considerable anonymity to participants, the services make it possible for people - especially computer-literate kids - to find themselves in unpleasant, sexually explicit social situations‚Ä¶.  And I‚Äôve gradually come to adopt the view, which will be controversial among many online users, that the use of nicknames and other forms of anonymity must be eliminated or severly curbed to force people online into at least as much accountability for their words and actions as exists in real social encounters.‚Äù [Walter S. Mossberg, Wall Street Journal, 6/30/94, provided by Brad Dolan]Eli Brandt came up with a good response to this: ‚ÄúThe sound-bite response to this: do you want your child‚Äôs name, home address, and phone number available to all those lurking pedophiles worldwide?  Responsible parents encourage their children to use remailers.‚ÄùSupreme Court said that identity of handbill distributors need not be disclosed, and pseudonyms in general has a long and noble traditionBBS operators have First Amendment protections (e.g.. registration requirements would be tossed out, exactly as if registration of newspapers were to be attempted) 8.9.6. Remailers and Choice of JurisdictionsThe intended target of a remailed message, and the subject material, may well influence the set of remailers used, especially for the very important ‚Äúlast remailer‚Äô (Note: it should never be necessary to tell remailers if they are first, last, or others, but the last remailer may in fact be able to tell he‚Äôs the last‚Ä¶if the message is in plaintext to the recipient, with no additional remailer commands embedded, for example.)A message involving child pornography might have a remailer site located in a state like Denmark, where child porn laws are less restrictive. And a message critical of Islam might not be best sent through a final remailer in Teheran. Eric Hughes has dubbed this ‚Äúregulatory arbitrage,‚Äù and to various extents it is already common practice.Of course, the sender picks the remailer chain, so these common sense notions may not be followed. Nothing is perfect, and customs will evolve. I can imagine schemes developing for choosing customers‚Äìa remailer might not accept as a customer certain abusers, based on digital pseudonyms < hairy). 8.9.7. Possible legal steps to limit the use of remailers and   anonymous systemshold the remailer liable for content, i.e., no common carrier statusinsert provisions into the various ‚Äúanti-hacking‚Äù laws to criminalize anonymous posts 8.9.8.

Could anonymous remailers be used to entrap people, or to   gather information for investigations?First, there are so few current remailers that this is unlikely. Julf seems a non-narc type, and he is located in Finland. The Cypherpunks remailers are mostly run by folks like us, for now.However, such stings and set-ups have been used in the past by narcs and ‚Äúred squads.‚Äù Expect the worse from Mr. Policeman. Now that evil hackers are identified as hazards, expect moves in this direction. ‚ÄúCryps‚Äù are obviously ‚Äúcrack‚Äù dealers.But use of encryption, which CP remailers support (Julf‚Äôs does not), makes this essentially moot.10.7.

Casino chips were once treated as cash, but are now more regulated (inter-casino conversion is no longer allowed).Any attempt to use such coupons as an alternative currency face obstacles.  The coupons may be allowed, but heavily regulated (reporting requirements, etc.).Perry Metzger notes, bearer bonds are now illegal in the U.S. (a bearer bond represented cash, in that no name was attached to the bond‚Äìthe ‚Äúbearer‚Äù could sell it for cash or redeem it‚Ä¶worked great for transporting large amounts of cash in compact form).Note: Duncan Frissell claims that bearer bonds are not illegal.    ‚ÄúUnder the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA), any interest payments made on new issues of domestic bearer bonds are not deductible as an ordinary and necessary business expense so none have been issued since then.  At the same time, the Feds administratively stopped issuing treasury securities in bearer form.  Old issues of government and corporate debt in bearer form still exist and will exist and trade for 30 or more years after 1982.  Additionally, US residents can legally buy foreign bearer securities.‚Äù [Duncan Frissell, 1994-08-10]Someone else has a slightly different view: ‚ÄúThe last US Bearer Bond issues mature in 1997.

The usual advice is to ‚Äúseek competent counsel,‚Äù but in fact most lawyers have no clear ideas about the optimum strategies, and the run-of-the-mill advisor may mislead one dangerously.

The maze of regulations, restrictions, tax laws, and legal rulings is daunting. Eric Hughes spent a lot of time reading up on the laws regarding banks, commercial paper, taxes, etc., and concluded much the same. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs impossible‚Äìindeed, I believe it will someday happen, in some form‚Äìbut the obstacles are formidable.Some issues:    Will such an operation be allowed to be centered or based in the U.S.?        What states? What laws? Bank vs. Savings and Loan vs. Credit Union vs. Securities Broker vs. something else?Will customers be able to access such entities offshore, outside the U.S.?        strong crypto makes communication possible, but it may be difficult, not part of the business fabric, etc. (and hence not so useful‚Äìif one has to send PGP- encrypted instructions to one‚Äôs banker, and can‚Äôt use the clearing infrastructure‚Ä¶.)Tax collection, money-laundering laws, disclosure laws, ‚Äúknow your customer‚Äù laws‚Ä¶.all are areas where a ‚Äúdigital bank‚Äù could be shut down forthwith. Any bank not filling out the proper forms (including mandatory reporting of transactions of certain amounts and types, and the Social Security/Taxpayer Number of customers) faces huge fines, penalties, and regulatory sanctions.        and the existing players in the banking and securities business will not sit idly by while newcomers enter their market; they will seek to force newcomers to jump through the same hoops they had to (studies indicate large corporations actually like red tape, as it helps them relative to smaller companies)Concluson: Digital banks will not be ‚Äúlaunched‚Äù without a lot of work by lawyers, accountants, tax experts, lobbyists, etc. ‚ÄúLemonade stand digital banks‚Äù (TM) will not survive for long. Kids, don‚Äôt try this at home!(Many new industries we are familiar with‚Äìsoftware, microcomputers‚Äìhad very little regulation, rightly so. But the effect is that many of us are unprepared to understand the massive amount of red tape which businesses in other areas, notably banking, face.)10.8.9. Legal obstacles to digital money. If governments don‚Äôt want   anonymous cash, they can make things tough.As both Perry Metzger and Eric Hughes have said many times, regulations can make life very difficult. Compliance with laws is a major cost of doing business.    ~‚ÄùThe cost of compliance in a typical USA bank is 14% of operating costs.‚Äù~ [Eric Hughes, citing an ‚ÄúAmerican Banker‚Äù article, 1994-08-30]The maze of regulations is navigable by larger institutions, with staffs of lawyers, accountants, tax specialists, etc., but is essentially beyond the capabilities of very small institutions, at least in the U.S.    this may or may not remain the case, as computers proliferate. A ‚Äúbank-in-a-box‚Äù program might help. My suspicion is that a certain size of staff is needed just to handle the face-to-face meetings and hoop-jumping.‚ÄúNew World Order‚Äù    U.S. urging other countries to ‚Äúplay ball‚Äù on banking secrecy, on tax evasion extradition, on immigration, etc.this is closing off the former loopholes and escape hatches that allowed people to escape repressive taxation‚Ä¶the implications for digital money banks are unclear, but worrisome.10.9. Legality of Digital Banks and Digital Cash?10.9.1. In terms of banking laws, cash reporting regulations, money   laundering statutes, and the welter of laws connected with   financial transactions of all sorts, the Cypherpunks themes   and ideas are basically illegal. Illegal in the sense that   anyone trying to set up his own bank, or alternative currency   system, or the like would be shut down quickly. As an   informal, unnoticed experiment, such things are reasonably   safe‚Ä¶until they get noticed.10.9.2. The operative word here is ‚Äúlaunch,‚Äù in my opinion. The   ‚Äúlaunch‚Äù of the BankAmericard (now VISA) in the 1960s was not   done lightly or casually‚Ä¶it required armies of lawyers,   accountants, and other bureacrats to make the launch both   legal and successful. The mere ‚Äòidea‚Äù of a credit card was   not enough‚Ä¶that was essentially the easiest part of it all.   (Anyone contemplating the launch of a digital cash system   would do well to study BankAmericard as an example‚Ä¶and   several other examples also.)10.9.3. The same will be true of any digital cash or similar system   which intends to operate more or less openly, to interface   with existing financial institutions, and which is not   explicity intended to be a Cypherpunkish underground   activity.10.10. Export of Crypto, ITAR, and Similar Laws10.10.1. ‚ÄúWhat are the laws and regulations about export of crypto,   and where can I find more information?‚Äù‚ÄúThe short answer is that the Department of State, Office of Defense Trade Controls (DOS/DTC) and the National Security Administration (NSA) won‚Äôt allow unrestricted export (like is being done with WinCrypt) for any encryption program that the NSA can‚Äôt crack with less than a certain amount (that they are loathe to reveal) of effort.

Legal issues regarding access to systemsConcerns:    access by minors to sexually explicit materialaccess from regions where access ‚Äúshould not be permitted‚Äù        export of crypto, for examplethe Memphis access to California BBSCurrent approach: taking the promise of the accessor    ‚ÄúI will not export this outside the U.S. or Canada.‚Äù‚ÄúI am of legal age to access this material.‚ÄùPossible future approaches:    Callbacks, to ensure accessor is from region stated        easy enough to bypass with cut-outs and remailers‚ÄúCredentials‚Äù        a la the US Postal Service‚Äôs proposed ID card (and others)cryptographically authenticated credentials            Chaum‚Äôs credentials system (certainly better than many non-privacy-preserving credentials systems)10.18.2. ‚ÄúWhat is a ‚Äúcommon carrier‚Äù and how does a service become one?‚Äù(This topic has significance for crypto and remailers, vis a vis whether remailers are to be treated as common carriers.)Common carriers are what the phone and package delivery services are. They are not held liable for the contents of phone calls, for the contents of packages (drugs, pornography, etc.), or for illegal acts connected with their services. One of the deals is that common carriers not examine the insides of packages.  Common carriers essentially agree to take all traffic that pays the fee and not to discriminate based on content. Thus, a phone service will not ask what the subject of a call is to be, or listen in, to decide whether to make the connection.Some say that to be a common carrier requires a willingness to work with law enforcement. That is, Federal Express is not responsible for contents of packages, but they have to cooperate in reasonable ways with law enforcement to open or track suspicious packages. Anybody have a cite for this? Is it true?Common carrier status is also cited for bookstores, which are not presumed to have read each and every one of the books they sell‚Ä¶so if somebody blows their hand off in a an experiment, the bookstore is not liable.  (The author/publisher may be, but that‚Äôs aÔøΩnt issue.)How does one become a common carrier? Not clear. One view is that a service should ‚Äúbehave like‚Äù a common carrier and then hope and pray that a court sees it that way.Are computer services common carriers? A topic of great interest.    ‚ÄúAccording to a discussion I had with Dave Lawrence (postmaster at UUNET, as well as moderator of news.admin.newgroups), UUNET is registered with the FCC as an ‚ÄúEnhanced Service Provider,‚Äù which, according to Dave, amounts to similar protection as ‚ÄúCommon Carrier.‚Äù (‚ÄúCommon Carrier‚Äù seems to not be appropriate yet, since Congress is so behind the tech curve).‚Äù [L. Todd Masco, 1994-08-11]As for remailer networks being treated as common carriers, totally unclear at this time. Certainly the fact that packets are fully encrypted and unreadabel goes to part of the issue about agreeing not to screen.More on the common carrier debate:    ‚ÄúAh, the eternal Common Carrier debate.  The answer is the same as the last few times. ‚ÄúCommon Carrier‚Äù status has little to do with exemption from liability.  It has most to do with being unable to reject passengers, goods, or phone calls‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Plenty of non-common carrier entities are immune from prosecution for ideas that they unkowingly communicate ‚Äì bookstores for example (unless they are knowingly porno bookstores in the wrong jurisdiction)‚Ä¶.Compuserve was held not liable for an (alleged) libel by one of its sysops.  Not because of common carrier but because they had no knowledge or control‚Ä¶.Remailers have no knowledge or control hence no scienter (guilty knowledge) hence no liability as a matter of law‚Äînot a jury question BTW.‚Äù [Duncan Frissell, 1994-08-11]10.19. Credentials10.19.1. ‚ÄúAre credentials needed? Will digital methods be used?‚Äù10.19.2. I  take a radical view. Ask yourself why credentials are   ever needed. Maybe for driving a car, and the like, but in   those cases anonymity is not needed, as the person is in the   car, etc.Credentials for drinking age? Why? Let the parents enforce   this, as the argument goes about watching sex and violence on   t.v. (If one accepts the logic of requiring bars to enforce   children‚Äôs behavior, then one is on a slippery slope toward   requiring television set makers to check smartcards of   viewers, or of requiring a license to access the Internet,   etc.)In almost no cases do I see the need to carry ‚Äúpapers‚Äù with   me. Maybe a driver‚Äôs license, like I said. In other areas,   why?10.19.3. So Cypherpunks probably should not spend too much time   worrying about how permission slips and ‚Äúhall passes‚Äù will be   handled. Little need for them.10.19.4. ‚ÄúWhat about credentials for specific job performance, or for   establishing time-based contracts?‚ÄùCredentials that prove one has completed certain classes, or reached certain skill levels, etc.?In transactions where ‚Äúfuture performance‚Äù is needed, as in a contract to have a house built, or to do some similar job, then of course the idea of on-line or immediate clearing is bogus‚Ä¶like paying a stranger a sum of money on his promise that he‚Äôll be back the next day to start building you a house.Parties to such long-term, non-locally-cleared cases may contract with an escrow agent, as I described above. This is like the ‚Äúprivately-produced law‚Äù we‚Äôve discussed so many times. The essence: voluntary arrangements.Maybe proofs of identity will be needed, or asked for, maybe not. But these are not the essence of the deal.10.20. Escrow Agents10.20.1. (the main discussion of this is under Crypto Anarchy)10.20.2. Escrow Agents as a way to deal with contract reneggingOn-line clearing has the possible danger implicit in all trades that Alice will hand over the money, Bob will verify that it has cleared into hisaccount (in older terms, Bob would await word that his Swiss bank account has just been credited), and then Bob will fail to complete his end of the bargain. If the transaction is truly anonymous, over computer lines, then of course Bob just hangs up his modem and the connection is broken. This situation is as old as time, and has always involved protcols in which trust, repeat business, etc., are factors. Or escrow agents.Long before the ‚Äúkey escrow‚Äù of Clipper, true escrow was planned. Escrow as in escrow agents. Or bonding agents.Alice and Bob want to conduct a transaction. Neither trusts the other; indeed, they are unknown to each other. In steps ‚ÄúEsther‚Äôs Escrow Service.‚Äù She is also utraceable, but has established a digitally-signed presence and a good reputation for fairness. Her business is in being an escrow agent, like a bonding agency, not in ‚Äúburning‚Äù either party. (The math of this is interesting: as long as the profits to be gained from any small set of transactions is less than her ‚Äúreputation capital,‚Äù it is in her interest to forego the profits from burning and be honest. It is also possible to arrange that Esther cannot profit from burning either Alice or Bob or both of them, e.g., by suitably encrypting the escrowed stuff.)Alice can put her part of the transaction into escrow with Esther, Bob can do the same, and then Esther can release the items to the parties when conditions are met, when both parties agree, when adjudication of some sort occurs, etc. (There a dozen issues here, of course, about how disputes are settled, about how parties satisfy themselves that Esther has the items she says she has, etc.)10.21. Loose Ends10.21.1. Legality of trying to break crypto systems‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the legality of breaking cyphers?‚Äù    Suppose I find some random-looking bits and find a way to apparently decrease their entropy, perhaps turning them into the HBO or Playboy channel? What crime have I committed?‚ÄúTheft of services‚Äù is what they‚Äôll get me for. Merely listening to broadcasts can now be a crime (cellular, police channels, satellite broadcasts). In my view, a chilling developemt, for practical reasons (enforcement means invasive monitoring) and for basic common sense ethics reasons: how can listening to what lands on your property be illegal?This also opens the door for laws banning listening to certain ‚Äúoutlaw‚Äù or ‚Äúunlicensed‚Äù braodcast stations. Shades of the Iron Curtain. (I‚Äôm not talking about FCC licensing, per se.)‚ÄúCould it ever be illegal to try to break an encryption scheme, even if the actual underlying data is not ‚Äústolen‚Äù?‚Äù    Criminalizing tools rather than actions        The U.S. is moving in the direction of making mere possession of certain tools and methods illegal, rather than criminalizing actual actions. This has been the case‚Äìor so I hear, though I can‚Äôt cite actual laws‚Äì with ‚Äúburglar tools.‚Äù (Some dispute this, pointing to the sale of lockpicks, books on locksmithing, etc. Still, see what happens if you try to publish a detailed book on how to counterfeit currency.)Black‚Äôs law term for this?To some extent, it already is. Video encryption is this way. So is cellular.        attendees returning from a Bahamas conference on pirate video methods (guess why it was in the Bahamas) had their papers and demo materials seized by CustomsCounterfeiting is, I think, in this situation, too. Merely exploring certain aspects is verboten. (I don‚Äôt claim that all aspects are, of course.)Interception of broadcast signals may be illegal‚Äì satellite or cellular phone traffic (and Digital Telephony Act may further make such intercepts illegal and punishable in draconian ways)Outlawing of the breaking of encryption, a la the broadcast/scanner laws    (This came up in a thread with Steve Bellovin)Aspects        PPL side‚Ä¶hard to convince a PPL agent to ‚Äúenforce‚Äù this            but market sanctions against those who publically use the information are of course possible, just as with those who overhear conversations and then gossip widely (whereas the act of overhearing is hardly a crime)statutory enforcement leads to complacency, to below- par securityis an unwelcome expansion of power of state to enforce laws against decryption of numbers            and may lead to overall restrictions on crypto use10.21.2. wais, gopher, WWW, and implicationsborders more transparent‚Ä¶not clear where searches are taking place, files being transferrred, etc. (well, it is deterministic, so some agent or program presumably knows, but it‚Äôs likely that humans don‚Äôt)10.21.3. ‚ÄúWhy are so many prominent Cypherpunks interested in the   law?‚ÄùBeats me. Nothing is more stultfyingly boring to me than the cruft and ‚Äúfound items‚Äù nature of the law.However,, for a certain breed of hacker, law hacking is the ultimate challenge. And it‚Äôs important for some Cypherpunks goals.10.21.4. ‚ÄúHow will crypto be fought?‚ÄùThe usual suspects: porn, pedophilia, terrorists, tax evaders, spiesClaims that ‚Äúnational security‚Äù is at stake    As someone has said, ‚ÄúNational security is the root password to the Constitution‚Äùclaims of discrimination    as but one example, crypto allows offshore bank accounts, a la carte insurance, etc‚Ä¶these are all things that will shake the social welfare systems of many nations10.21.5. Stego may also be useful in providing board operators with ‚Äúplausible deniabillity‚Äù‚Äìthey can claim ignorance of the LSB contents (I‚Äôm not saying this will stand up in court very well, but any port in a storm, especially port 25).10.21.6.

A legal issue about proving encryption existsThe XOR point. Any message can be turned into any other message, with the proper XOR intermediate message. Implications for stego as well as for legal proof (difficulty of). As bits leave no fingerprints, the mere presence of a particular XOR pad on a defendant‚Äôs disk is no proof that he put it there‚Ä¶the cops could have planted the incriminating key, which turns ‚Äúgi6E2lf7DX01jT$‚Äù into ‚ÄúDope is ready.‚Äù (I see issues of ‚Äúchain of evidence‚Äù becoming even more critical, perhaps with use of independent ‚Äútimestamping authorities‚Äù to make hashes of seized evidence‚Äìhashes in the cryptographic sense and not hashes in the usual police sense.)10.21.9. ‚ÄúWhat are the dangers of standardization and official   sanctioning?‚ÄùThe U.S. has had a disturbing tendency to standardize on some technology and then punish deviations from the standard. Examples: telephones, cable (franchises granted, competitors excluded)Franchises, standards‚Ä¶My concern: Digital money will be blessed‚Ä¶home banking, Microsoft, other banks, etc. The Treasury folks will sign on, etc.    Competitors will have a hard time, as government throws roadblocks in front of them, as the U.S. makes international deals with other countries, etc.10.21.10. Restrictions on voice encryption?may arise for an ironic reason: people can use Net connections to talk worldwide for $1 an hour or less, rather than $1 a minute; this may cause telcos to clamor for restrictions    enforcing these restrictions then becomes problematic, unless channel is monitoredand if encrypted‚Ä¶10.21.11. Fuzziness of lawsIt may seem surprising that a nation so enmeshed in complicated legalese as the U.S., with more lawyers per capita than any other large nation and with a legal code that consists of hundreds of thousands of pages of regulations and interpretations, is actually a nation with a legal code that is hard to pin down.Any  system with formal, rigid rules can be ‚Äúgamed against‚Äù be an adversary. The lawmakers know this, and so the laws are kept fuzzy enough to thwart mechanistic gaming; this doesn‚Äôt stop there from being an army of lawyers (in fact, it guarantees it). Some would say that the laws are kept fuzzy to increase the power of lawmakers and regulators.‚ÄúBank regulations in this country are kept deliberately somewhat vague.  The regulator‚Äôs word is the deciding principle, not a detailed interpretation of statute.  The lines are fuzzy, and because they are fuzzy, the banks don‚Äôt press on them nearly as hard as when there‚Äôs clear statutory language available to be interpreted in a court.‚ÄúThe uncertainty in the regulatory environment increases the hold the regulators have over the banks.  And the regulators are known for being decidedly finicky.  Their decisions are largely not subject to appeal (except for the flagrant stuff, which the regulators are smart enough not to do too often), and there‚Äôs no protection against cross- linking issues.  If a bank does something untoward in, say, mortgage banking, they may find, say, their interstate branching possibilities seem suddenly much dimmer.‚ÄúThe Dept. of Treasury doesn‚Äôt want untraceable transactions.‚Äù [Eric Hughes, Cypherpunks list, 1994-8-03]Attempts to sneak around the laws, especially in the context of alternative currencies, Perry Metzger notes: ‚ÄúThey are simply trying to stop you from playing games. The law isn‚Äôt like geometry ‚Äì there aren‚Äôt axioms and rules for deriving one thing from another. The general principle is that they want to track all your transactions, and if you make it difficult they will either use existing law to jail you, or will produce a new law to try to do the same.‚Äù [Perry Metzger, 1994-08-10]This fuzziness and regulatory discretion is closely related to those wacky schemes to avoid taxes by claiming , for example, that the ‚Äúdollar‚Äù is defined as 1/35th of an ounce of gold (and that hence one‚Äôs earnings in ‚Äúreal dollars‚Äù are a tiny fraction of the ostensible earnings), that Ohio did not legally enter the Union and thus the income tax was never properly ratified,, etc. Lots of these theories have been tested‚Äìand rejected. I mention this because some Cypherpunks show signs of thinking ‚Äúdigital cash‚Äù offers similar opportunities. (And I expect to see similar scams.)(A related example. Can one‚Äôs accumulation of money be taken out of the country? Depending on who you ask, ‚Äúit depends.‚Äù Taking it out in your suitcase rasises all kind of possibilies of seizure (violation of currency export laws, money laundering, etc.). Wiring it out may invoke FinCEN triggers. The IRS may claim it is ‚Äúcapital flight‚Äù to avoid taxes‚Äìwhich it may well be. Basically, your own money is no longer yours. There may be ways to do this‚ÄìI hope so‚Äìbut the point remains that the rules are fuzzy, and the discretionary powers to seize assets are great. Seek competent counsel, and then pray.)10.21.12. role of Uniform Commercial Code (UCC)not discussed in crypto circles much, but the ‚Äúrules of the road‚Äùin many  way, an implementation of anarcho-capitalism, in that the UCC is a descendant (modulo some details) of the ‚ÄúLaw Merchant‚Äù that handled relations between sovereign powers, trade at sea, etc.things like electronic funds transfere, checks, liablities for forged sigs, etc.I expect eventual UCC involvement in digital money schemes10.21.13. ‚ÄúWhat about the rush to legislate, to pass laws about   cyberspace, the information superduperhighway, etc.?The U.S. Congress feels it has to ‚Äúdo something‚Äù about things that many of us feel don‚Äôt need regulation or ‚Äúhelp‚Äù from Congress.    crypto legislationset-top boxes, cable access, National Information Infrastructure (Cable Version)information access, parental lock-outs, violence ratings, sexually explicit materials, etc.Related to the ‚Äúdo something!‚Äù mentality on National Health Care, guns, violence, etc.Why not just not do anything?Scary possibilities being talked about:    giving television sets unique IDs (‚ÄúV chips‚Äù) with cable access through these chips        tying national ID cards to these, e.g., Joe Citizen, of Provo, Utah, would be ‚Äúallowed‚Äù to view an NC-17 violence-rated programThis would be disastrous: records, surveillance, dossiers, permission, centralizationThe ‚Äúhow can we fix it?‚Äù mindset is very damaging.

The same is usually true of technologies.10.21.14. on use of offshore escrow agents as protection against   seizurescontempt laws come into play, but the idea is to make yourself powerless to alter the situation, and hence not willfully disobeying the courtCan also tell offshore agents what to do with files, and when to release them    Eric Hughes proposes: ‚ÄúOne solution to this is to give the passphrase (or other access information) to someone who won‚Äôt give it back to you if you are under duress, investigation, court order, etc.  One would desire that this entity be in a jurisdiction other than where an investigation might happen.‚Äù [E.H., 1994-07-26]Sandy Sandfort adds: ‚ÄúPrior to seizure/theft, you would make an  arrangement with an offshore ‚Äúescrow agent.‚Äù After seizure you would send your computer the instruction that says, ‚Äúencrypt my disk with the escrow agents public key.‚Äù  After that, only the escrow agent could decrypt your disk.  Of course, the escrow agent would only do that when conditions you had stipulated were in effect.‚Äù [S. S., 1994-07-27]related to data havens and offshore credit/P.I. havens10.21.15.

What are some of the New Technologies for Espionage and SurveillanceBugs    NSA and CIA have developed new levels of miniaturized bugs        e.g., passive systems that only dribble out intercepted material when interrogated (e.g., when no  bug sweeps are underway)many of these new bugging technologies were used in the John Gotti case in New York‚Ä¶the end of the Cold War meant that many of these technologies became available for use by the non-defense sidethe use of such bugging technology is a frightening development: conversations can be heard inside sealed houses from across streets, and all that will be required is an obligatory warrantDRAM storage of compressed speech‚Ä¶6-bit companded, frequency-limited, so that 1 sec  of speech takes 50Kbits, or 10K when compressed, for a total of 36 Mbits per hour-this will fit on a single chip        readout can be done from a ‚Äúmothership‚Äù module (a larger bug that sits in some more secure location)or via tight-beam lasersBugs are Mobile        can crawl up walls, using the MIT-built technology for microrobotssome can even fly for short distances (a few klicks)Wiretaps    so many approaches herephone switches are almost totally digital (a la ESS IV)again, software hacks to allow wiretapsVans equipped to eavesdrop on PCs and networks    TEMPEST systems        technology is somewhat restricted, companies doing this work are under limitations not to ship to some customers            no laws against shielding, of coursethese vans are justified for the ‚Äúwar on drugs‚Äù and weapons proliferation controle efforts (N.E.S.T., anti- Iraq, etc.)Long-distance listening    parabolic reflectors, noise cancellation (from any off- axis sources), high gain amplification, phoneme analysisneural nets that learn the speech patterns and so can improve claritylip-reading    with electronically stabilized CCD imagers, 3000mm lensesneural net-based lip-reading programs, with learning systems capable of improving performancefor those in sensitive positions, the availability of new bugging methods will accelerate the conversion to secure systems based on encrypted telecommunications and the avoidance of voice-based systems11.6.4. Digital Telephony II is a major step toward easier   surveillance11.6.5. Citizen trackingthe governments of the world would obviously like to trace the movements, or at least the major movements, of their subjects    makes black markets a bit more difficultsurfaces terrorists, illegal immigrants, etc. (not perfectly)allows tracking of ‚Äúsex offenders‚Äù        who often have to register with the local police, announce to their neighbors their previous crimes, and generally wear a scarlet letter at all times‚ÄìI‚Äôm not defending rapists and child molesters, just noting the dangerous precedent this is settingbecause its the nature of bureaucracies to want to know where ‚Äútheir‚Äù subjects are (dossier society = accounting society‚Ä¶records are paramount)Bill Stewart has pointed out that the national health care systems, and the issuance of social security numbers to children, represent a way to track the movements of children, through hospital visits, schools, etc. Maybe even random check points at places where children gather (malls, schools, playgrounds, opium dens, etc.)    children in such places are presumed to have lesser rights, hence‚Ä¶this could all be used to track down kidnapped children, non-custodial parents, etc.this could be a wedge in the door: as the children age, the system is already in place to continue the tracking (about the right timetable, too‚Ä¶start the systme this decade and by 2010 or 2020, nearly everybody will be in it)(A true paranoid would link these ideas to the child photos many schools are requring, many local police departments are officially assisting with, etc. A dossier society needs mug shots on all the perps.)These are all reasons why governments will continue to push for identity systems and will seek to derail efforts at providing anonymitySurveillance and Personnel Identification    cameras that can recognize faces are placed in many public places, e.g., airports, ports of entry, government buildings        and even in some private places, e.g., casinos, stores that have had problems with certain customers, banks that face robberies, etc.‚Äúsuspicious movements detectors‚Äù        cameras that track movements, loitering, eye contact with other patrons            neural nets used to classify behvaiors                legal standing not needed, as these systems are used only to trigger further surveillance, not to prove guilt in a court of lawexample: banks have cameras, by 1998, that can identify potential bank robberscamera images are sent to a central monitoring facility, so the usual ploy of stopping the silent alarm won‚Äôt workairports and train stations (fears of terrorists), other public places11.6.6.

These are to detect licence evaders (you need to pay an annual licence for the BBC channels). They are provided by the Department of Trade and Industry. They use something like a small minibus and use Van Eck principles. They have two steerable detectors on the van roof so they can triangulate. But TV shops have to notify the Government of buyers - so that is the basic way in which licence evaders are detected. ‚Ä¶ I read of a case on a bulletin board where someone did not have a TV but used a PC. He got a knock on the door. They said he appeared to have a TV but they could not make out what channel he was watching! [Martin Spellman, mspellman@cix.compulink.co.uk, 1994- 0703]This kind of surveillance is likely to become more and more common, and raises serious questions about what other information they‚Äôll look for.

Economic Intelligence (Spying on Corporations, Foreign and   Domestic)‚ÄúDoes the NSA use economic intelligence data obtained in intercepts?‚Äù    Some of us speculate that this is so, that this has been going on since the 1960s at least. For example, Bamford noted in 1982 that the NSA had foreknowledge of the plans by the British to devalue the pound in the late 1970s, and knowledge of various corporate plans.The NSA clears codes used by the CIA, so it seem impossible for the NSA not to have known about CIA drug smuggling activities. The NSA is very circumspect, however, and rarely (or never) comments.there have been calls for the government to somehow help American business and overall competitiveness by ‚Äúlevelling the playing field‚Äù via espionage    especially as the perceived threat of the Soviet bloc diminishes and as the perceived threat of Japan and Germany increasesleaders of the NSA and CIA have even talked openly about turning to economic surveillanceProblems with this proposal:    illegalunethicalwho gets the intelligence information?

Are you interested?‚Äù        the U.S. situation differs from Japan and MITI (which is often portrayed as the model for how this ought to work) in that we have many companies with little or no history of obeying government recommendationsand foreign countries will likely learn of this espionage and take appropriate measures        e.g., by increasing encryption11.7.3.

Dossiers and Data Bases11.9.1. ‚ÄúThe dossier never forgets‚Äùany transgressions of any law in any country can be stored indefinitely, exposing the transgressor to arrest and detention anytime he enters a country with such a record on him    (This came up with regard to the British having quaint ideas about computer security, hacking, and data privacy; it is quite possible that an American passing through London could be detained for some obscure violation years in the past.)this is especially worrisome in a society in which legal codes fill entire rooms and in which nearly every day produces some violation of some law11.9.2. ‚ÄúWhat about the privacy issues with home shopping, set-top   boxes, advertisers, and the NII?‚ÄùDo we want our preferences in toothpaste fed into databases so that advertisers can target us? Or that our food purchases be correlated and analyzed by the government to spot violations of the Dietary Health Act?First, laws which tell people what records they are ‚Äúallowed‚Äù to keep are wrong-headed, and lead to police state inspections of disk drives, etc. The so-called ‚ÄúData Privacy‚Äù laws of several European nations are a nightmare. Strong crypto makes them moot.Second, it is mostly up to people to protect what they want protected, not to pass laws demanding that others protect it for them.In practice, this means either use cash or make arrangements with banks and credit card companies that will protect privacy. Determining if they have or not is another issue, but various ideas suggest themselves (John Gilmore says he often joins groups under variants of his name, to see who is selling his name to mailing lists.)Absent any laws which forbid them, privacy-preserving credit card companies will likely spring up if there‚Äôs a market demand. Digital cash is an example. Other variants abound. Cypherpunks should not allow such alternatives to be banned, and should of course work on their own such systems.11.9.3. credit agenciesTRW Credit, Transunion, Equifaxlinks to WitSec11.9.4. selling of data bases, linking of records‚Ä¶several states have admitted to selling their driver‚Äôs license data bases11.10. Police States and Informants11.10.1. Police states need a sense of terror to help magnify the   power or the state, a kind of ‚Äúshrechlichkeit,‚Äù as the Nazis   used to call it. And lots of informants. Police states need   willing accomplices to turn in their neighbors, or even their   parents, just as little Pavel Morozov became a Hero of the   Soviet People by sending his parents to their deaths in   Stalin‚Äôs labor camps for the crime of expressing negative   opinions about the glorious State.(The canonization of Pavel Morozov was recently repudiated by current Russian leaders‚Äìmaybe even by the late-Soviet era leades, like Gorbachev‚Äìwho pointed out the corrosive effects of encouraging families to narc on each other‚Ä¶something the U.S. has forgotten‚Ä¶will it be 50 years before our leaders admit that having children turn in Daddy for using ‚Äúillegal crypto‚Äù was not such a good idea?)11.10.2. Children are encouraged in federally-mandated D.A.R.E.   programs to become Junior Narcs, narcing their parents out to   the cops and counselors who come into their schools.11.10.3. The BATF has a toll-free line (800-ATF-GUNS) for snitching on   neighbors who one thinks are violating the federal gun laws.   (Reports are this is backfiring, as gun owners call the   number to report on local liberal politicians and gun-   grabbers.)11.10.4. Some country we live in, eh?

Privacy Laws11.11.1. Will proposed privacy laws have an effect?I suspect just the opposite: the tangled web of laws-part of the totalitarian freezeout-will ‚Äúmarginalize‚Äù more people and cause them to seek ways to protect their own privacy and protect themselves from sanctions over their actions    free speech vs. torts, SLAPP suits, sedition charges, illegal research, etc.        free speech is vanishing under a torrent of laws, licensing requirements, and even zoning rulesoutlawing of work on drugs, medical procedures, etc.        against the law to disseminate information on drug use (MDMA case at Stanford), on certain kinds of birth control‚ÄúIf encrytion is outlawed, only outlaws will have encryption.‚Äùprivacy laws are already causing encryption (‚Äúfile protection‚Äù) to be mandatory in many cases, as with medical records, transmission of sensitive files, etc.    by itself this is not in conflict with the government requirement for tappable access, but the practical implementation of a two-tier system-secure against civilian tappers but readable by national security tappers-is a nightmare and is likely impossible to achieve11.11.2. ‚ÄúWhy are things like the ‚ÄúData Privacy Laws‚Äù so bad?‚ÄùMost European countries have laws that limit the collection of computerized records, dossiers, etc., except for approved uses (and the governments themselves and their agents).Americans have no such laws. I‚Äôve heard calls for this, which I think is too bad.While we may not like the idea of others compiling dossiers on us, stopping them is an even worse situation. It gives the state the power to enter businesses, homes, and examine computers (else it is completely unenforceable). It creates ludicrous situations in which, say, someone making up a computerized list of their phone contacts is compiling an illegal database! It makes e-mail a crime (those records that are kept).they are themselves major invasions of privacyare you going to put me in jail because I have data bases of e-mail, Usenet posts, etc.?In my opinion, advocates of ‚Äúprivacy‚Äù are often confused about this issue, and fail to realize that laws about privacy often take away the privacy rights of others. (Rights are rarely in conflict‚Äìcontract plus self-privacy take care of 99% of situations where rights are purported to be in conflict.)11.11.3. on the various ‚Äúdata privacy laws‚Äùmany countries have adopted these data privacy laws, involving restrictions on the records that can be kept, the registration of things like mailing lists, and heavy penalties for those found keeping computer files deemed impermissablethis leads to invasions of privacy‚Ä¶.this very Cypherpunks list would have to be ‚Äúapproved‚Äù by a bureaucrat in many countries‚Ä¶the oportunites (and inevitabilities) of abuse are obvious‚ÄúThere is a central contradiction running through the dabase regulations proposed by many so-called ‚Äúprivacy advocates‚Äù.  To be enforceable they require massive government snooping into database activities on our workstatins and PCs,  especially the activities of many small at-home businesses (such as mailing list entrepreneurs who often work out of the home).‚ÄúThus, the upshot of these so-called ‚Äúprivacy‚Äù regulations is to destroy our last shreds of privacy against government, and calm us into blindly letting even more of the details of our personal lives into the mainframes of the major government agencies and credit reporting agenices, who if they aren‚Äôt explicitly excepted from the privacy laws (as is common) can simply evade them by using offshore havesn, mutual agreements with foreign investigators, police and intelligence agencies.‚Äù  [Jim Hart, 1994-09-08]11.11.4. ‚ÄúWhat do Cypherpunks think about this?‚Äùdivided minds‚Ä¶while no one likes being monitored, the question is how far one can go to stop others from being monitored    ‚ÄúData Privacy Laws‚Äù as a bad example: tramples on freedom to write, to keep one‚Äôs computer private11.11.5.

Scenario for introduction of national ID cardsImagine that vehicle registrations require presentation of this card (gotta get those illegals out of their cars, or, more benignly, the bureaucracy simply makes the ID cars part of their process).Instantly this makes those who refuse to get an ID card unable to get valid license tags. (Enforcement is already pretty good‚Ä¶.I was pulled over a couple of times for either forgetting to put my new stickers on, or for driving with Oregon expired tags.)The ‚ÄúNational Benefits Card,‚Äù for example, is then required to get license plate tags.and maybe other things, like car and home insurance, etc. It would be very difficult to fight such a card, as one could not drive, could not pay taxes (‚ÄúAwhh!‚Äù I hear you say, but consider the penalties, the tie-ins with employers, etc. You can run but you can‚Äôt hide.)    the national ID card would presumably be tied in to income tax filings, in various ways I won‚Äôt go into here. The Postal Service, aiming to get into this area I guess, has floated the idea of electronic filing, ID systems, etc.11.12.8. Comments on national ID cardsThat some people will be able to skirt the system, or that the system will ultimately be unenforceable, does not lessen the concern. Things can get real tough in the meantime.I see great dangers here, in tying a national ID card to transactions we are essentially unable to avoid in this society: driving, insurance (and let‚Äôs not argue insurance‚Ä¶I mean it is unavoidable in the sense of legal issues, torts, etc.), border crossings, etc. Now how will one file taxes without such a card if one is made mandatory for interactions with the government? Saying ‚Äútaxes are not collectable‚Äù is not an adequate answer. They may not be collectible for street punks and others who inhabit the underground economy, but they sure are for most of us.11.13.

Credentials11.14.1. This is one of the most overlooked and ignored aspects of   cryptology, especially of Chaum‚Äôs work. And no one in   Cypherpunks or anywhere else is currently working on ‚Äúblinded   credentials‚Äù for everyday use.11.14.2. ‚ÄúIs proof of identity needed?‚ÄùThis question is debated a lot, and is important. Talk of a national ID card (what wags call an ‚Äúinternal passport‚Äù) is in the air, as part of health care, welfare, and immigration legislation. Electronic markets make this also an issue for the ATM/smart card community. This is also closely tied in with the nature of anonymous reamailers (where physical identity is of course generally lacking).First, ‚Äúidentity‚Äù can mean different things:    Conventional View of Identity: Physical person, with birthdate, physical characteristics, fingerprints, social security numbers, passports, etc.‚Äìthe whole cloud of ‚Äúidentity‚Äù items. (Biometric.)Pseudonym View of Identity:  Persistent personnas, mediated with cryptography. ‚ÄúYou are your key.‚ÄùMost of us deal with identity as a mix of these views: we rarely check biometric credentials, but we also count on physical clues (voice, appearance, etc.). I assume that when I am speaking to ‚ÄúDuncan Frissell,‚Äù whom I‚Äôve never met in person, that he is indeed Duncan Frissell. (Some make the jump from this expectation to wanting the government enforce this claim, that is, provided I.D.)It is often claimed that physical identity is important in order to:    track down cheaters, welchers, contract breakes, etc.permit some people to engage in some transactions, and forbid others to (age credentials, for drinking, for example, or‚Äîless benignly‚Äìwork permits in some field)taxation, voting, other schemes tied to physical existenceBut most of us conduct business with people without ever verifying their identity credentials‚Ä¶mostly we take their word that they are ‚ÄúBill Stewart‚Äù or ‚ÄúScott Collins,‚Äù and we never go beyond that.    this could change as digital credentials proliferate and as interactions cause automatic checks to be made (a reason many of us have to support Chaum‚Äôs ‚Äúblinded credentials‚Äù idea‚Äìwithout some crypto protections, we‚Äôll be constantly tracked in all interactions).A guiding principle: Leave this question of whether to demand physical ID  credentials up to the parties involved. If Alice wants to see Bob‚Äôs ‚Äúis-a-person‚Äù credential, and take his palmprint, or whatever, that‚Äôs an issue for them to work out. I see no moral reason, and certainly no communal reason, for outsiders to interfere and insist that ID be produced (or that ID be forbidden, perhaps as some kind of ‚Äúcivil rights violation‚Äù). After all, we interact in cyberspace, on the Cypherpunks list, without any such external controls on identity.    and business contracts are best negotiated locally, with external enforcement contracted by the parties (privately- produced law, already seen with insurance companies, bonding agents, arbitration arrangements, etc.)Practically speaking, i.e., not normatively speaking, people will find ways around identity systems. Cash is one way, remailers are another. Enforcement of a rigid identity- based system is difficult.11.14.3. ‚ÄúDo we need ‚Äúis-a-person‚Äù credentials for things like votes   on the Net?‚ÄùThat is, any sysadmin can easily create as many user accounts as he wishes. And end users can sign up with various services under various names. The concern is that this Chicago-style voting (fictitious persons) may be used to skew votes on Usenet.Similar concerns arise elsewhere.In my view, this is a mighty trivial reason to support ‚Äúis- a-person‚Äù credentials.11.14.4. Locality, credentials, validationsConsider the privacy implications of something so simple as a parking lot system. Two main approaches:    First Approach. Cash payment. Car enters lot, driver pays cash, a ‚Äúvalidation‚Äù is given. No traceability exists. (There‚Äôs a small chance that one driver can give his sticker to a new driver, and thus defraud the parking lot. This tends not to happen, due to the inconveniences of making a market in such stickers (coordinating with other car, etc.) and because the sticker is relatively inexpensive.)Second Approach. Billing of driver, recording of license plates. Traceability is present, especially if the local parking lot is tied in to credit card companies, DMV, police, etc. (these link-ups are on the wish list of police agencies, to further ‚Äúfreeze out‚Äù fugitives, child support delinquents, and other criminals).These are the concerns of a society with a lot of electronic payments but with no mechanisms for preserving privacy. (And there is currently no great demand for this kind of privacy, for a variety of reasons, and this undercuts the push for anonymous credential methods.)An important property of true cash (gold, bank notes that are well-trusted) is that it settles immediately, requiring no time-binding of contracts (ability to track down the payer and collect on a bad transaction)11.15. Records of all UseNet postings11.15.1. (ditto for CompuServe, GEnie, etc.) will exist11.15.2. ‚ÄúWhat kinds of monitoring of the Net is possible?‚ÄùArchives of all Usenet traffic. This is already done by commercial CD-ROm suppliers, and others, so this would be trivial for various agencies.Mail archives. More problematic, as mail is ostensibly not public. But mail passes through many sites, usually in unencrypted form.Traffic analysis. Connections monitored. Telnet, ftp, e- mail, Mosaid, and other connections.Filtered scans of traffic, with keyword-matched text stored in archives.11.15.3. Records: note that private companies can do the same thing,   except that various ‚Äúright to privacy‚Äù laws may try to   interfere with thiswhich causes its own constitutional privacy problems, of course11.15.4. ‚ÄúHow can you expect that something you sent on the UseNet to   several thousand sites will not be potentially held against   you? You gave up any pretense of privacy when you broadcast   your opinions-and even detailed declarations of your   activities-to an audience of millions. Did you really think   that these public messages weren‚Äôt being filed away? Any   private citizen would find it almost straightforward to sort   a measly several megabytes a day by keywords, names of   posters, etc.‚Äù [I‚Äôm not sure if I wrote this, or if someone   else who I forgot to make a note of did]11.15.5. this issue is already coming up: a gay programmer who was   laid-off discussed his rage on one of the gay boards and said   he was thinking of turning in his former employer for   widespread copying of Autocad software‚Ä¶an Autodesk employee   answered him with ‚ÄúYou just did!‚Äù11.15.6. corporations may use GREP and On Location-like tools to   search public nets for any discussion of themselves or their   productsby big mouth employees, by disgruntled customers, by known critics, etc.even positive remarks that may be used in advertising (subject to various laws)11.15.7. the 100% traceability of public postings to UseNet and other   bulletin boards is very stifling to free expression and   becomes one of the main justifications for the use of   anonymous (or pseudononymous) boards and netsthere may be calls for laws against such compilation, as with the British data laws, but basically there is little that can be done when postings go to tens of thousands of machines and are archived in perpetuity by many of these nodes and by thousands of readersreaders who may incorporate the material into their own postings, etc. (hence the absurdity of the British law)11.16. Effects of Surveillance on the Spread of Crypto11.16.1. Surveillance and monitoring will serve to increase the use of   encryption, at first by people with something to hide, and   then by othersa snowballing effectand various government agencies will themselves use encryption to protect their files and their privacy11.16.2. for those in sensitive positions, the availability of new   bugging methods will accelerate the conversion to secure   systems based on encrypted telecommunications and the   avoidance of voice-based systems11.16.3. Surveillance TrendsTechnology is making citizen-unit surveillance more and more trivial    video cameras on every street corners are technologically easy to implement, for example        or cameras in stores, in airports, in other public placestraffic camerastracking of purchases with credit cards, driver‚Äôs licenses, etc.monitoring of computer emissions (TEMPEST issues, often a matter of paranoid speculation)interception of the Net‚Ä¶wiretapping, interception of unencrypted communications, etc.        and compilation of dossier entries based on public postingsThis all makes the efforts to head-off a person-tracking, credentials-based society all the more urgent. Monkeywrenching, sabotage, public education, and development of alternatives are all needed.    If the surveillance state grows as rapidly as it now appears to be doing, more desperate measures may be needed. Personally, I wouldn‚Äôt shed any tears if Washington, D.C. and environs got zapped with a terrorist nuke; the innocents would be replaced quickly enough, and the death of so many political ghouls would surely be worth it. The destruction of Babylon.We need to get the message about ‚Äúblinded credentials‚Äù (which can show some field, like age, without showing all fields, including name and such) out there. More radically, we need to cause people to question why credentials are as important as many people seem to think.        I argue that credentials are rarely needed for mutually agreed-upon transactions11.17. Loose Ends11.17.1. USPS involvement in electronic mail, signatures,   authentication (proposed in July-August, 1994)Advantages:    many locationsa mission already oriented toward deliveryDisadvantages:    has performed terribly, compared to allowed compettion (Federal Express, UPS, Airborne, etc.)it‚Äôs linked to the goverment (now quasi-independent, but not really)could become mandatory, or competition restricted to certain niches (as with the package services, which cannot have ‚Äúroutes‚Äù and are not allowed to compete in the cheap letter regime)a large and stultified bureaucracy, with union laborLinks to other programs (software key escrow, Digital Telephony) not clear, but it seems likely that a quasi- governemt agency like the USPS would be cooperative with government, and would place limits on the crypto systems allowed.11.17.2. the death threatsAn NSA official threatened to have Jim Bidzos killed if he did not change his position on some negotiation underway. This was reported in the newspaper and I sought confirmation:    ‚ÄúEverything reported in the Merc News is true.

Main Pointsstrong crypto makes certain forms of digital cash possibleDavid Chaum is, once again, centrally involvedno real systems deployed, only small experimentsthe legal and regulatory tangle will likely affect deployment in major ways (making a ‚Äúlaunch‚Äù of digital cash a notrivial matter)12.2.2.

Miscellaneous Commentsa huge area, filled with special termsmany financial instrumentsthe theory of digital cash is not complete, and confusion aboundsthis section is also more jumbled and confusing than I‚Äôd like; I‚Äôll clean it up in fufure releases.12.3. The Nature of Money12.3.1. The nature of money, of banking and finance, is a topic that   suffuses most discussions of digital cash. Hardly surprising.   But also an area that is even more detailed than is crypto.   And endless confusion of terms, semantic quibblings on the   list, and so on. I won‚Äôt be devoting much space to trying to   explain economics, banking, and the deep nature or money.12.3.2. There are of course many forms of cash or money today (these   terms are not equivalent‚Ä¶)coins, bills (presumed to be difficult to forge)    ‚Äúontological conservation laws‚Äù‚Äìthe money can‚Äôt be in two places at once, can‚Äôt be double spentthis is only partly true, and forgery technology is making it all mootbearer bonds and other ‚Äúimmediately cashable‚Äù instrumentsdiamonds, gold, works of art, etc. (‚Äúportable wealth‚Äù)12.3.3. Many forms of digital money. Just as there are dozens of   major forms of instruments, so too will there be many forms   of digital money. Niches will be filled.12.3.4. The deep nature of money is unclear to me. There are days   when I think it‚Äôs just a giant con game, with value in money   only because others will accept it. Other days when I think   it‚Äôs somewhat tied to ‚Äúreal things‚Äù like gold and silver. And   other days when I‚Äôm just unconcerned (so long as I have it,   and it works).12.3.5. The digital cash discussions get similarly confused by the   various ideas about money. Digital cash is not necessarily a   form of currency, but is instead a transfer mechanism. More   like a ‚Äúdigital check,‚Äù in fact (though it may give rise to   new currencies, or to wider use of some existing   currency‚Ä¶at some point, it may become indistinguishable   from a currency).12.3.6. I advise that people not worry overly much about the true and   deep nature of money, and instead think about digital cash as   a transfer protocol for some underlyng form of money, which   might be gold coins, or Swiss francs, or chickens, or even   giant stone wheels.12.3.7. Principle vs. Properties of MoneyPhysical coins, as money, have certain basic properties: difficult to counterfeit, pointless to counterfeit if made of gold or silver, fungibility, immediate settling (no need to clear with a distant bank, no delays, etc.), untraceability, etc.Digital cash, in various flavors, has dramatically different properties, e.g., it may require clearing, any single digtital note is infinitely copyable, it may allow traceability, etc. A complicated mix of properties.But why is physical money (specie) the way it is? What properties account for this? What are the core principles that imply these properties?    hardware (specie like gold) vs. software (bits, readily copyable)immediale, local clearing, because of rational faith that the money will clearlimits on rate of transfer of physical money set by size, weight of money, whereas ‚Äúwire fraud‚Äù and variants can drain an account in secondsMy notion is that we spend too much time thinking about the principles (such as locality, transitivity, etc.) and expect to then derive the properties. Maybe we need to instead focus on the objects, the sets of protocol- derived things, and examine their emergent properties. (I have my own thinking along these lines, involving ‚Äúprotocol ecologies‚Äù in which agents bang against each other, a la Doug Lenat‚Äôs old ‚ÄúEurisko‚Äù system, and thus discover weaknesses, points of strength, and even are genetically programmed to add new methods which increase security. This, as you can guess, is a longterm, speculative project.)12.3.8. ‚ÄúCan a ‚Äúdigital coin‚Äù be made?‚ÄùThe answer appears to be ‚Äúno‚ÄùSoftware is infinitely copyable, which means a software representation of digital money could be replicated many times    this is not to say it could be spent many times, depending on the clearing process‚Ä¶but then this is not a ‚Äúcoin‚Äù in the sense we meanSoftware is trivially replicable, unlike gold or silver coins, or even paper currency. If and when paper currency becomes trivially replicable (and color copiers have almost gotten there), expect changes in the nature of cash. (Speculation: cash will be replaced by smart cards, probably not of the anonymous sort we favor.)bits can always be duplicated (unless tied to hardware, as with TRMs), so must look elsewhere    could tie the bits to a specific location, so that duplication would be obvious or useless        the idea is vaguely that an agent could be placed in some location‚Ä¶duplications would be both detectable and irrelevant (same bits, same behavior, unmodifiable because of digital signature)(this is formally similar to the idea of an active agent that is unforgeable, in the sense that the agent or coin is ‚Äústandalone‚Äù)12.3.9. ‚ÄúWhat is the ‚Äògranularity‚Äô of digital cash?‚Äùfine granularity, e.g., sub-cent amounts    useful for many online transactionsinside computersadd-on fees by interemediariesvery small purchasesmedium granularity    a few cents, up to a dollar (for example)also useful for many small purchasesclose equivalent to ‚Äúloose change‚Äù or small bills, and probably useful for the same purposestolls, fees, etc.This is roughly the level many DigiCash protocols are aimed atlarge granularity    multiple dollarsmore like a ‚Äúconventional‚Äù online transactionthe transaction costs are crucial; online vs. offline clearingDigital Silk Road is a proposal by Dean Tribble and Norm Hardy to reduce transaction costs12.3.10. Debate about money and finance gets complicatedlegal terms, specific accounting jargon, etc.I won‚Äôt venture into this thicket here. It‚Äôs a specialty unto itself, with several dozen major types of instruments and derivatives. And of course with big doses of the law.12.4. Smart Cards12.4.1. ‚ÄúWhat are smart cards and how are they used?‚ÄùMost smart cards as they now exist are very far from being the anonymous digital cash of primary interest to us. In fact, most of them are just glorified credit cards.    with no gain to consumers, since consumes typically don‚Äôt pay for losses by fraud(so to entice consumes, will they offer inducements?)Can be either small computers, typically credit-card-sized, or  just cards that control access via local computers.Tamper-resistant modules, e.g., if tampered with, they destroy the important data or at the least give evidence of having been tampered with.

Visa Electronic Purse12.4.3. Mondex12.5. David Chaum‚Äôs ‚ÄúDigiCash‚Äù12.5.1. ‚ÄúWhy is Chaum so important to digital cash?‚ÄùChaum‚Äôs name appears frequently in this document, and in other Cypherpunk writings. He is without a doubt the seminal thinker in this area, having been very nearly the first to write about several areas: untraceable e-mail, digital cash, blinding, unlinkable credentials, DC-nets, etc.I spoke to him at the 1988 ‚ÄúCrypto‚Äù conference, telling him about my interests, my ‚Äòlabyrinth‚Äô idea for mail-forwarding (which he had anticipated in 1981, unbeknownst to me at the time), and a few hints about ‚Äúcrypto anarchy.‚Äù It was clear to me that Chaum had thought long and deeply about these issues.Chaum‚Äôs articles should be read by all interested in this area. (No, his papers are not ‚Äúon-line.‚Äù Please see the ‚ÄúCrypto‚Äù Proceedings and related materials.)[DIGICASH PRESS RELEASE, ‚ÄúWorld‚Äôs first electronic cash payment over computer networks,‚Äù 1994-05-27]12.5.2. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs his motivation?‚ÄùChaum appears to be a libertarian, at least on social issues, and is very worried about ‚ÄúBig Brother‚Äù sorts of concerns (recall the title of his 1985 CACM article).His work in Europe has mostly concentrated on unlinkable credentials for toll road payments, electronic voting, etc. His company, DigiCash, is working on various aspects of digital cash.12.5.3. ‚ÄúHow does his system work?‚ÄùThere have been many summaries on the Cypherpunks list. Hal Finney has written at least half a dozen, and others have been contributed by Eric Hughes, Karl Barrus, etc. I won‚Äôt be including any of them here‚Ä¶.it just takes too many pages to explain how digital cash works in detail.(The biggest problem people have with digital cash is in not taking the time to understand the basics of the math, of blinding, etc. They wrongly assume that ‚Äúdigital cash‚Äù can be understood by common-sense reasoning about existing cash, etc. This mistake has been repeated in several of the half-assed proposals for ‚Äúnet cash‚Äù and ‚Äúdigi dollars.‚Äù)Here‚Äôs the opening few paragraphs from one of Hal‚Äôs explanations, to provide a glimpse:    ‚ÄúMike Ingle asks about digicash.  The simplest system I know of that is anonymous is the one by Chaum, Fiat, and Naor, which we have discussed here a few times.  The idea is that the bank chooses an RSA modulus, and a set of exponents e1, e2, e3, ‚Ä¶, where each exponent ei represents a denomination and possibly a date.  The exponents must be relatively prime to (p-1)(q-1).  PGP has a GCD routine which can be used to check for valid exponents..‚ÄúAs with RSA, to each public exponent ei corresponds a secret exponent di, calculated as the multiplicative inverse of ei mod (p-1)(q-1).  Again, PGP has a routine to calculate multiplicative inverses.‚ÄúIn this system, a piece of cash is a pair (x, f(x)^di), where f() is a one-way function.  MD5 would be a reasonable choice for f(), but notice that it produces a 128-bit result.  f() should take this 128-bit output of MD5 and ‚Äúreblock‚Äù it to be an multi-precision number by padding it; PGP has a ‚Äúpreblock‚Äù routine which does this, following the PKCS standard.‚ÄúThe way the process works, with the blinding, is like this.  The user chooses a random x.  This should probably be at least 64 or 128 bits, enough to preclude exhaustive search.  He calculates f(x), which is what he wants the bank to sign by raising to the power di.  But rather than sending f(x) to the bank directly, the user first blinds it by choosing a random number r, and calculating D=f(x)r^ei.  (I should make it clear that ^ is the power operator, not xor.)  D is what he sends to the bank, along with some information about what ei is, which tells the denomination of the cash, and also information about his account number.‚Äù  [Hal Finney, 1993-12-04]12.5.4. ‚ÄúWhat is happening with DigiCash?‚Äù‚ÄúPayment from any personal computer to any other workstation, over email or Internet, has been demonstrated for the first time, using electronic cash technology. ‚ÄúYou can pay for access to a database, buy software or a newsletter by email, play a computer game over the net, receive $5 owed you by a friend, or just order a pizza. The possibilities are truly unlimited‚Äù according to David Chaum, Managing Director of DigiCash TM, who announced and demonstrated the product during his keynote address at the first conference on the World Wide Web, in Geneva this week.‚Äù [DIGICASH PRESS RELEASE, ‚ÄúWorld‚Äôs first electronic cash payment over computer networks,‚Äù 1994-05-27]DigiCash is David Chaum‚Äôs company, set up to commercialize this work. Located near Amsterdam.Chaum is also centrally invovled in ‚ÄúCAFE,‚Äù a European committee investigating ways to deploy digital cash in Europe    mostly standards, issues of privacy, etc.toll roads, ferries, parking meters, etc.http://digicash.support.nl/info@digicash.nlPeople have been reporting that their inquiries are not being answered; could be for several reasons.12.5.5. The Complexities of Digital CashThere is no doubt as to the complexity: many protocols, semantic confusion, many parties, chances for collusion, spoofing, repudiation, and the like. And many derivative entities: agents, escrow services, banks.There‚Äôs no substitute for thinking hard about various scenarios. Thinking about how to arrange off-line clearing, how to handle claims of people who claim their digital money was stolen, people who want various special kinds of services, such as receipts, and so on. It‚Äôs an ecology here, not just a set of simple equations.12.6. Online and Offline Clearing, Double Spending12.6.1. (this section still under construction)12.6.2. This is one of the main points of division between systems.12.6.3. Online Clearing(insert explanation)12.6.4. Offline Clearing(insert explanation)12.6.5. Double spendingSome approaches involve constantly-growing-in-size coins at each transfer, so who spent the money first can be deduced (or variants of this). And N. Ferguson developed a system allowing up to N expenditures of the same coin, where N is a parameter. [Howard Gayle reminded me of this, 1994-08-29]‚ÄúWhy does everyone think that the law must immediately be invoked when double spending is detected?‚Ä¶.Double spending is an informational property of digital cash systems. Need we find malicious intent in a formal property?  The obvious moralism about the law and double spenders is inappropriate.  It evokes images of revenge and retribution, which are stupid, not to mention of negative economic value.‚Äù [Eric Hughes, 1994-08-27]  (This also relates to Eric‚Äôs good point that we too often frame crypto issue in terms of loaded terms like ‚Äúcheating,‚Äù ‚Äúspoofing,‚Äù and ‚Äúenemies,‚Äù when more neutral terms would carry less meaning-obscuring baggage and would not give our ‚Äúenemies‚Äù (:-}) the ammunition to pass laws based on such terms.)12.6.6. IssuesChaum‚Äôs double-spending detection systems    Chaum went to great lengths to develop system which preserve anonymity for single-spending instances, but which break anonymity and thus reveal identity for double- spending instances. I‚Äôm not sure what market forces caused him to think about this as being so important, but it creates many headaches. Besides being clumsy, it require physical ID, it invokes a legal system to try to collect from ‚Äúdouble spenders,‚Äù and it admits the extremely serious breach of privacy by enabling stings. For example, Alice pays Bob a unit of money, then quickly Alice spends that money before Bob can‚Ä¶Bob is then revealed as a ‚Äúdouble spender,‚Äù and his identity revealed to whomver wanted it‚Ä¶Alice, IRS, Gestapo, etc. A very broken idea. Acceptable mainly for small transactions.Multi-spending vs. on-line clearing    - I favor on-line clearing. Simply put: the first spending  is the only spending. The guy who gets to the train  locker where the cash is stored is the guy who gets it.  This ensure that the burden of maintaining the secret is  on the secret holder.    - When Alice and Bob transfer money, Alice makes the  transfer, Bob confirms it as valid (or verifies that his  bank has received the deposit), and the transaction is  complete.    - With network speeds increasing dramatically, on-line  clearing should be feasible for most transactions. Off-  line systems may of course be useful, especially for  small transactions, the ones now handled with coins and  small bills.  -12.6.7. ‚ÄúHow does on-line clearing of anonymous digital cash work?‚ÄùThere‚Äôs a lot of math connected with blinding, exponentions, etc. See Schneier‚Äôs book for an introduction, or the various papers of Chaum, Brands, Bos, etc.On-line clearing is similar to two parties in a transaction exchanging goods and money. The transaction is clearled locally, and immediately. Or they could arrange transfer of funds at a bank, and the banker could tell them over the phone that the transaction has cleared‚Äìtrue ‚Äúon-line clearing.‚Äù Debit cards work this way, with money transferred effectively immediately out of one account and into another. Credit cards have some additional wrinkles, such as the credit aspect, but are basically still on-line clearing.Conceptually, the guiding principle idea is simple: he who gets to the train locker where the cash is stored first gets the cash. There can never be ‚Äúdouble spending,‚Äù only people who get to the locker and find no cash inside. Chaumian blinding allows the ‚Äútrain locker‚Äù (e.g., Credit Suisse) to give the money to the entity making the claim without knowing how the number correlates to previous numbers they ‚Äúsold‚Äù to other entities. Anonymity is preserved, absolutely. (Ignoring for this discussion issues of cameras watching the cash pickup, if it ever actually gets picked up.)Once the ‚Äúhandshaking‚Äù of on-line clearing is accepted, based on the ‚Äúfirst to the money gets it‚Äù principle, then networks of such clearinghouses can thrive, as each is confident about clearing. (There are some important things needed to provide what I‚Äôll dub ‚Äúclosure‚Äù to the circuit. People need to ping the system, depositing and withdrawing, to establish both confidence and cover. A lot like remailer networks. In fact, very much like them.)In on-line clearing, only a number is needed to make a transfer. Conceptually, that is. Just a number. It is up to the holder of the number to protect it carefully, which is as it should be (for reasons of locality, or self- responsibility, and because any other option introduces repudiation, disavowal, and the ‚ÄúTwinkies made me do it‚Äù sorts of nonsense). Once the number is transferred and reblinded, the old number no longer has a claim on the money stored at Credit Suisse, for example. That money is now out of the train locker and into a new one. (People always ask, ‚ÄúBut where is the money, really?‚Äù I see digital cash as claims on accounts in existing money-holding places, typically banks. There are all kinds of ‚Äúclaims‚Äù‚Äì Eric Hughes has regaled us with tales of his explorations of the world of commericial paper. My use of the term ‚Äúclaim‚Äù here is of the ‚ÄúYou present the right number, you get access‚Äù kind. Like the combination to a safe. The train locker idea makes this clearer, and gets around the confusion about ‚Äúdigimarks‚Äù of ‚Äúe$‚Äù actually being any kind of money it and of itself.)12.7. Uses for Digital Cash12.7.1. Uses for digital cash?Privacy protectionPreventing tracking of movements, contacts, preferencesIllegal markets    gamblingbribes, payoffsassassinations and other contract crimesfencing, purchases of goodsTax avoidance    income hidingoffshore funds transfersillegal marketsOnline services, games, etc.Agoric markets, such as for allocation of computer resources    where programs, agents ‚Äúpay‚Äù for services used, make ‚Äúbids‚Äù for future services, collect ‚Äúrent,‚Äù etc.Road tolls, parking fees, where unlinkablity is desired. This press release excerpt should give the flavor of intended uses for road tolls:    ‚ÄúThe product was developed by DigiCash TM Corporation‚Äôs wholly owned Dutch subsidiary, DigiCash TM BV. It is related to the firm‚Äôs earlier released product for road pricing, which has been licensed to Amtech TM Corporation, of Dallas, Texas, worldwide leader in automatic road toll collection. This system allows privacy protected payments for road use at full highway speed from a smart card reader affixed to the inside of a vehicle. Also related is the approach of the EU supported CAFE project, of which Dr. Chaum is Chairman, which uses tamper-resistant chips inserted into electronic wallets.‚Äù [DIGICASH PRESS RELEASE, ‚ÄúWorld‚Äôs first electronic cash payment over computer networks,‚Äù 1994-05-27]12.7.2. ‚ÄúWhat are some motivations for anonymous digital cash?‚ÄùPayments that are unlinkable to identity, especially for things like highway tolls, bridge tolls, etc.    where linkablity would imply position tracking(Why not use coins? This idea is for ‚Äúsmart card‚Äù-type payment systems, involving wireless communication. Singapore planned (and perhaps has implemented) such a system, except there were no privacy considerations.)Pay for things while using pseudonyms    no point in having a pseudonym if the payment system reveals one‚Äôs identityTax avoidance    this is the one the digicash proponents don‚Äôt like to talk about too loudly, but it‚Äôs obviously a time-honored concern of all taxpayersBecause there is no compelling reason why money should be linked to personal identity    a general point, subsuming others12.8. Other Digital Money Systems12.8.1. ‚ÄúThere seem to be many variants‚Ä¶.what‚Äôs the story?‚ÄùLots of confusion. Lots of systems that are not at all anonymous, that are just extensions of existing systems. The cachet of digital cash is such that many people are claiming their systems are ‚Äúdigital cash,‚Äù when of course they are not (at least not in the Chaum/Cypherpunk sense).So, be careful. Caveat emptor.12.8.2. Crypto and Credit Cards (and on-line clearing)Cryptographically secure digital cash may find a major use in effectively extending the modality of credit cards to low-level, person-to-person transactions.    That is, the convenience of credit cards is one of their main uses (others being the advancing of actual credit, ignored here). In fact, secured credit cards and debit cards don‚Äôt offer this advancement of credit, but are mainly used to accrue the ‚Äúorder by phone‚Äù and ‚Äúavoid carrying cash‚Äù advantages.Checks offer the ‚Äúdon‚Äôt carry cash‚Äù advantage, but take time to clear. Traveller‚Äôs checks are a more pure form of this.But individuals (like Alice and Bob) cannot presently use the credit card system for mutual transactions. I‚Äôm not sure of all the reasons. How might this change?Crypto can allow unforgeable systems, via some variant of digital signatures. That is, Alice can accept a phoned payment from Bob without ever being able to sign Bob‚Äôs electronic signature herself.‚ÄúCrypto Credit Cards‚Äù could allow end users (customers, in today‚Äôs system) to handle transactions like this, without having merchants as intermediaries.I‚Äôm sure the existing credit card outfits would have something to say about this, and there may be various roadblocks in the way. It might be best to buy off the VISA and MasterCard folks by working through them. (And they probably have studied this issue; what may change their positions is strong crypto, locally available to users.)(On-line clearing‚Äìto prevent double-spending and copying of cash‚Äìis an important aspect of many digital cash protocols, and of VISA-type protocols. Fortunately, networks are becoming ubiquitous and fast. Home use is still a can of worms, though, with competing standards based on video cable, fiber optics, ISDN, ATM, etc.)12.8.3. Many systems being floated. Here‚Äôs a sampling:Mondex    ‚ÄúUnlike most other electronic purse systems, Mondex, like cash, is anonymous.  The banks that issue Mondex cards will not be able to keep track of who gets the payments. Indeed, it is the only system in which two card holders can transfer money to each other.\"‚ÄùIf you want to have a product that replaces cash, you have to do everything that cash does, only better,‚Äù Mondex‚Äôs senior executive, Michael Keegan said.  ‚ÄúYou can give money to your brother who gives it to the chap that sells newspapers, who gives it to charity, who puts it in the bank, which has no idea where it‚Äôs been.  That‚Äôs what money is.‚Äù‚Äù [New York Times, 1994-09-06, provided by John Young]CommerceNet    allows Internet users to buy and sell goods.‚ÄúI read in yesterday‚Äôs L.A. Times about something called CommerceNet, where sellers and buyers of workstation level equipment can meet and conduct busniess‚Ä¶.Near the end of the article, they talked about a proposed method for  exchanging ‚Äúdigital signatures‚Äù via Moasic (so that buyers and sellers could know that they were who they said they were) and that they were going to ‚Äúsubmit it to the Internet Standards body‚Äù‚Äù [Cypher1@aol.com, 1994-06- 23]NetCash    paper published at 1st ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, Nov. 93, available via anonymous ftp from PROSPERO.ISI.EDU as /pub/papers/security/netcash- cccs93.ps.Z‚ÄúNetCash: A design for practical electronic currency on the Internet  ‚Ä¶ Gennady Medvinsky and Clifford Neuman‚ÄúNetCash is a framework that supports realtime electronic payments with provision of anonymity over an unsecure network.  It is designed to enable new types of services on the Internet which have not been practical to date because of the absence of a secure, scalable, potentially anonymous payment method.‚ÄúNetCash strikes a balance between unconditionally anonymous electronic currency, and signed instruments analogous to checks that are more scalable but identify the principals in a transaction.  It does this by providing the framework within which proposed electronic currency protocols can be integrated with the scalable, but non-anonymous, electronic banking infrastructure that has been proposed for routine transactions.‚ÄùHal Finney had a negative reaction to their system:        ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think it was any good.  They have an incredibly simplistic model, and their ‚Äúprotocols‚Äù are of the order, A sends the bank some paper money, and B sends A some electronic cash in return‚Ä¶..They don‚Äôt even do blinding of the cash.  Each piece of cash has a unique serial number which is known to the currency provider.  This would of course allow matching of withdrawn and deposited coins‚Ä¶.These guys seem to have read the work in the field (they reference it) but they don‚Äôt appear to have understood it.‚Äù [Hal Finney, 1993-08-17]VISA Electronic Purse    (A lot of stuff appeared on this, including listings of the alliance partners (like Verifone), the technology, the plans for deployment, etc. I regret that I can‚Äôt include more here.

Crenshaw, Washington Post ‚Ä¶‚ÄúNow that credit cards are in the hands of virtually every living, breathing adult  in  the  country-not to mention a lot of children and the occasional family  pet- and  now  that  almost  as  many people  have  ATM cards, card companies are wondering where future growth will come from.‚ÄúAt Visa International, the answer is: Replace cash with plastic.‚ÄúLast month,  the  giant  association  of  card issuers announced it had formed a coalition of banking and technology companies to develop technical standards  for a  product it dubbed the ‚ÄúElectronic Purse,‚Äù a plastic card meant to replace coins and bills in small transactions.‚Äù  [provided by Duncan Frissell, 1994-04-05]The talk of ‚Äúclearinghouses‚Äù and the involvement of VISA International and the Usual Suspects suggest identity-blinding protocols are not in use. I also see no mention of DigiCash, or even RSA (but maybe I missed that- -and the presence of RSA would not necessairly mean identity-blinding protocols were being planned).Likely Scenario: This is not digital cash as we think of it. Rather, this is a future evolution of the cash ATM card and credit card, optimized for faster and cheaper clearing.Scary Scenario: This could be the vehicle for the long- rumored ‚Äúbanning of cash.‚Äù (Just because conspiracy theorists and Number of the Beast Xtian fundamentalists belive it doesn‚Äôt render it implausible.)Almost nothing of interest for us. No methods for anonymity. Make no mistake, this is not the digital cash that Cypherpunks espouse. This gives the credit agencies and the government (the two work hand in hand) complete traceability of all purchases, automatic reporting of spending patterns, target lists for those who frequent about-to-be-outlawed businesses, and invasive surveillance of all inter-personal economic transactions. This is the AntiCash. Beware the Number of the AntiCash.12.8.4. Nick Szabo:‚ÄúInternet commercialization in itself is a huge issue full of pitfall and  opportunity: Mom & Pop BBS‚Äôs, commercial MUDs, data banks, for-profit pirate and porn boards, etc. are springing  up everywhere like weeds, opening a vast array of both needs of privacy and ways to abuse privacy.

Crypto- anarchy in the real world will be messy, ‚Äúnature red in tooth and claw‚Äù, not all nice and clean like it says in the math books.

Additionally, US residents can legally buy foreign bearer securities.‚Äù [Duncan Frissell, 1994-08-10]Someone else has a slightly different view: ‚ÄúThe last US Bearer Bond issues mature in 1997. I also believe that to collect interest, and to redeem the bond at maturity, you must give your name and tax-id number to the paying agent. (I can check with the department here that handles it if anyone is interested in the pertinent OCC regs that apply)‚Äù  [prig0011@gold.tc.umn.edu, 1994-08-10]I cite this gory detail to give readers some idea about how much confusion there is about these subjects. The usual advice is to ‚Äúseek competent counsel,‚Äù but in fact most lawyers have no clear ideas about the optimum strategies, and the run-of-the-mill advisor may mislead one dangerously. Tread carefully.This has implications for digital cash, of course.10.8.5. ‚ÄúWhy might digital cash and related techologies take hold   early in illegal markets? That is, will the Mob be an early   adopter?‚Äùuntraceability neededand reputations matter to themthey‚Äôve shown in the past that they will try new approaches, a la the money movements of the drug cartels, novel methods for security, etc.10.8.6. ‚ÄúElectronic cash‚Ä¶will it have to comply with laws, and   how?‚ÄùConcerns will be raised about the anonymity aspects, the usefulness for evading taxes and reporting requirements, etc.a messy issue, sure to be debated and legislated about for many yearssplit the cash into many pieces‚Ä¶is this ‚Äústructuring‚Äù? is it legal?    some rules indicate the structuring per se is not illegal, only tax evasion or currency control evasionwhat then of systems which automatically, as a basic feature, split the cash up into multiple pieces and move them?10.8.7. Currency controls, flight capital regulations, boycotts, asset seizures, etc.all are pressures to find alternate ways for capital to flowall add to the lack of confidence, which, paradoxically to lawmakers, makes capital flight all the more likely10.8.8. ‚ÄúWill banking regulators allow digital cash?‚ÄùNot easily, that‚Äôs for sure. The maze of regulations, restrictions, tax laws, and legal rulings is daunting. Eric Hughes spent a lot of time reading up on the laws regarding banks, commercial paper, taxes, etc., and concluded much the same. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs impossible‚Äìindeed, I believe it will someday happen, in some form‚Äìbut the obstacles are formidable.Some issues:    Will such an operation be allowed to be centered or based in the U.S.?        What states? What laws? Bank vs. Savings and Loan vs. Credit Union vs. Securities Broker vs. something else?Will customers be able to access such entities offshore, outside the U.S.?        strong crypto makes communication possible, but it may be difficult, not part of the business fabric, etc. (and hence not so useful‚Äìif one has to send PGP- encrypted instructions to one‚Äôs banker, and can‚Äôt use the clearing infrastructure‚Ä¶.)Tax collection, money-laundering laws, disclosure laws, ‚Äúknow your customer‚Äù laws‚Ä¶.all are areas where a ‚Äúdigital bank‚Äù could be shut down forthwith. Any bank not filling out the proper forms (including mandatory reporting of transactions of certain amounts and types, and the Social Security/Taxpayer Number of customers) faces huge fines, penalties, and regulatory sanctions.        and the existing players in the banking and securities business will not sit idly by while newcomers enter their market; they will seek to force newcomers to jump through the same hoops they had to (studies indicate large corporations actually like red tape, as it helps them relative to smaller companies)Concluson: Digital banks will not be ‚Äúlaunched‚Äù without a lot of work by lawyers, accountants, tax experts, lobbyists, etc. ‚ÄúLemonade stand digital banks‚Äù (TM) will not survive for long. Kids, don‚Äôt try this at home!(Many new industries we are familiar with‚Äìsoftware, microcomputers‚Äìhad very little regulation, rightly so. But the effect is that many of us are unprepared to understand the massive amount of red tape which businesses in other areas, notably banking, face.)10.8.9. Legal obstacles to digital money. If governments don‚Äôt want   anonymous cash, they can make things tough.As both Perry Metzger and Eric Hughes have said many times, regulations can make life very difficult. Compliance with laws is a major cost of doing business.    ~‚ÄùThe cost of compliance in a typical USA bank is 14% of operating costs.‚Äù~ [Eric Hughes, citing an ‚ÄúAmerican Banker‚Äù article, 1994-08-30]The maze of regulations is navigable by larger institutions, with staffs of lawyers, accountants, tax specialists, etc., but is essentially beyond the capabilities of very small institutions, at least in the U.S.    this may or may not remain the case, as computers proliferate. A ‚Äúbank-in-a-box‚Äù program might help. My suspicion is that a certain size of staff is needed just to handle the face-to-face meetings and hoop-jumping.‚ÄúNew World Order‚Äù    U.S. urging other countries to ‚Äúplay ball‚Äù on banking secrecy, on tax evasion extradition, on immigration, etc.this is closing off the former loopholes and escape hatches that allowed people to escape repressive taxation‚Ä¶the implications for digital money banks are unclear, but worrisome.12.10. Prospects for Digital Cash Use12.10.1. ‚ÄúIf digital money is so great, why isn‚Äôt it being used?‚ÄùHasn‚Äôt been finished. Protocols are still being researched, papers are still being published. In any single area, such as toll road payments, it may  be possible to deploy an application-specific system, but there is no ‚Äúgeneral‚Äù solution (yet). There is no ‚Äúdigital coin‚Äù or unforgeable object representing value, so the digital money area is more similar to the similarly nonsimple markets in financial instruments, commercial papers, bonds, warrants, checks, etc. (Areas that are not inherently simple and that have required lots of computerization and communications to make manageable.)Flakiness of Nets. Systems crash, mail gets delayed inexplicably, subscriptions to lists get lunched, and all sorts of other breakages occur. Most interaction on the Nets involves a fair amount of human adaptation to changing conditions, screwups, workarounds, etc. These are not conditions that inspire confidence in automated money systems!Hard to Use. Few people will use systems that require generating code, clients, etc. Semantic gap (generating stuff on a Unix workstation is not at all like taking one‚Äôs checkbook out). Protocols in crypto are generally hard to use and confusing.Lack of compelling need. Although people have tried various experiments with digital money tokens or coupons (Magic Money/Tacky Tokens, the HeX market, etc.), there is little real world incentive to experiment with them. And most of the denominated tokens are for truly trivial amounts of money, not for anything worth spending time learning. No marketplace for buyers to ‚Äúwander around in.‚Äù (You don‚Äôt buy what you don‚Äôt see.)Legal issues. The IRS does not look favorably on alternative currencies, especially if used in attempts to bypass ordinary tax collection schemes. This and related legal issues (redemptions into dollars) put a roadblock in front of serious plans to use digital money.Research Issues. Not all problems resolved. Still being developed, papers being published. Chaum‚Äôs system does not seem to be fully ready for deployment, certainly not outside of well-defined vertical markets.12.10.2. ‚ÄúWhy isn‚Äôt digital money in use?‚ÄùThe Meta Issue: what digital money? Various attempts at digital cash or digital money exist, but most are flawed, experimental, crufty, etc. Chaum‚Äôs DigiCash was announced (Web page, etc.), but is apparently not even remotely usable.Practical Reasons:    nothing to buyno standard systems that are straightforward to useadvantages of anonymity and untraceability are seldom exploitedThe Magic Money/Tacky Tokens experiment on the Cypherpunks list is instrucive. Lots of detailed work, lots of posts‚Äì and yet not used for anything (granted, there‚Äôs not much being bought and sold on the List, so‚Ä¶).Scenario for Use in the Near Future: A vertical application, such as a bridge toll system that offers anonymity. In a vertical app, the issues of compatibility, interfaces, and training can be managed.12.10.3. ‚Äúwhy isn‚Äôt digital cash being used?‚Äùmany reasons, too many reasons!    hard issues, murky issues        technical developments not final, Chaum, Brands, etc.selling the users        who don‚Äôt have computers, PDAs, the means to do the local computationswho want portable versions of the sameThe infrastructure for digital money (Chaum anonymous- style, and variants, such as Brands) does not now exist, and may not exist for several more years. (Of course, I thought it would take ‚Äúseveral more years‚Äù back in 1988, so what do I know?)        The issues are familiar: lack of standards, lack of protocols, lack of customer experience, and likely regulatory hurdles. A daunting prospect.Any ‚Äúlaunches‚Äù will either have to be well-funded, well- planned, or done sub rosa, in some quasi-legal or even illegal market (such as gambling).‚ÄúThe american people keep claiming in polls that they want better privacy protection, but the fact is that most aren‚Äôt willing to do anything about it: it‚Äôs just a preference, not a solid imperative.  Until something Really Bad happens to many people as a result of privacy loss, I really don‚Äôt think much will be done that requires real work and inconvenience from people, like moving to something other than credit cards for long-distance transactions‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs a tragedy.‚Äù[L. Todd Masco , 1994-08-20]12.10.4. ‚ÄúIs strong crypto needed for digital cash?‚ÄùYes, for the most bulletproof form, the form of greatest interest to us and especially for agents, autonomous systemsNo, for certain weak versions (non-cryptographic methods of security, access control, biometric security, etc. methods)    for example, Internet billing is not usually done with cryptoand numbered Swiss accounts can be seen as a weak form of digital cash (with some missing features)‚Äúwarehouse receipts,‚Äù as in gold or currency shipments12.10.5. on why we may not have it for a while, from a non-Cypherpunk commenter:‚ÄúGovernment requires information on money flows, taxable items, and large financial transactions‚Ä¶..As a result, it would be nearly impossible to set up a modern anonymous digital cash system, despite the fact that we have the technology‚Ä¶..I think we have more of a right to privacy with digicash transactions, and I also think there is a market for anonymous digicash systems. ‚Äú [Thomas Grant Edwards. talk.politics.crypto, 1994-09-06]12.10.6. ‚ÄúWhy do a lot of schemes for things like digital money have   problems on the Net?Many reasons    lack of commercial infrastructure in general on the Net‚Ä¶people are not used to buying things, advertising is discouraged (or worse), and almost everything is ‚Äúfree.‚Äùlack of robustness and completeness in the various protocols: they are ‚Äúnot ready for prime time‚Äù in most cases (PGP is solid, and some good shells exist for PGP, but the many other crypto protocols are mostly not implemented at all, at least not widely).The Net runs ‚Äúopen-loop,‚Äù as a store-and-forward delivery system        The Net is mostly a store-and-forward netword, at least at the granularity seen by the user in sending messages, and hence is ‚Äúopen loop.‚Äù Messages may or may not be received in a timely way, and there is little opportunity for negotiaton on a real-time basis.This open-loop nature usually works‚Ä¶messages get through most of the time. And the ‚Äúmessage in a bottle‚Äù nature fits in with anonymous remailers (with latency/delay), with message pools, and with other schemes to make traffic analysis harder. A ‚Äúclosed- loop,‚Äù responsive system is likelier to be traffic- analyzed by correlation of packets, etc.but the sender does not know if it gets through (return receipts not commonly implemented‚Ä¶might be a nice feature to incorporate; agent-based systems (Telescript?) will certainly do this)this open-loop nature makes protocols, negotiation, digital cash very tough to use‚Äìtoo much human intervention neededNote: These comments apply mainly to mail systems, which is where most of us have experimented with these ideas. Non-mail systems, such as Mosaic or telnet or the like, have better or faster feedback mechanisms and may be preferable for implementation of Cypherpunks goals. It may be that the natural focus on mailing lists, e-mail, etc., has distracted us. Perhaps a focus on MUDs, or even on ftp, would have been more fruitful‚Ä¶but we‚Äôre a mailing list, and most people are much more familiar with e-mail than with archie or gopher or WAIS, etc.The legal and regulatory obstacles to a real system, used for real transactions, are formidable. (The obstacles to a ‚Äúplay‚Äù system are not so severe, but then play systems tend not to get much developer attention.)12.10.7. Scenario for deployment of digital cashEric Hughes has spent time looking into this. Too many issues to go into here, but he had this interesting scenario, repeated almost in toto here:‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very unlikely that a USA bank will be the one to deploy anonymous digital dollars first.  It‚Äôs much more likely that the first dollar digital cash will be issued overseas, possibly London.  By the same token, the non- dollar regulation on banks in this country is not the same as the dollar regulation, so it‚Äôs quite possible that the New York banks may be the first issuers of digital cash, in pounds sterling, say.‚ÄúThere will be two stages in actually deploying digital cash.  By digital cash, here, I mean a retail phenomenon, available anybody. The first will be to digitize money, and the second will be to anonymize it.  Efforts are already well underway to make more-or-less secure digital funds transfers with reasonably low transaction fees (not transaction costs, which are much more than just fees). These efforts, as long as they retain some traceability, will almost certainly succeed first in the marketplace, because (and this is vital) the regulatory environment against anonymity is not compromised.‚ÄúOnce, however, money has been digitized, one of the services available for purchase can be the anonymous transfer of funds.  I expect that the first digitization of money won‚Äôt be fully fungible.  For example, if you allow me to take money out of your checking account by automatic debit, there is risk that the money won‚Äôt be there when I ask for it.  Therefore that kind of money won‚Äôt be completely fungible, because money authorized from one person won‚Äôt be completely identical with money from another.  It may be a risk issue, it may be a timeliness issue, it may be a fee issue; I don‚Äôt know, but it‚Äôs unlikely to be perfect.‚ÄúNow, as the characteristic size of a business decreases, the relative costs of dealing with whatever imperfection there is will be greater. To wit, the small player will still have some problem getting paid, although certainly less than now.  Digital cash solves many of these problems. The clearing is immediate and final (no transaction reversals).  The number of entities to deal with is greatly reduced, hopefully to one.  The need and risk and cost of accounts receivables is eliminated.  It‚Äôs anonymous.  There will be services which will desire these advantages, enough to support a digital cash infrastructure.

Cypherpunks Experiments (‚ÄúMagic Money‚Äù)12.12.1. What is Magic Money?‚ÄúMagic Money is a digital cash system designed for use over electronic mail. The system is online and untraceable. Online means that each transaction involves an exchange with a server, to prevent double-spending. Untraceable means that it is impossible for anyone to trace transactions, or to match a withdrawal with a deposit, or to match two coins in any way.‚Äù‚ÄúThe system consists of two modules, the server and the client. Magic Money uses the PGP ascii-armored message format for all communication between the server and client. All traffic is encrypted, and messages from the server to the client are signed. Untraceability is provided by a Chaum-style blind signature. Note that the blind signature is patented, as is RSA. Using it for experimental purposes only shouldn‚Äôt get you in trouble.‚ÄúDigicash is represented by discrete coins, the denominations of which are chosen by the server operator. Coins are RSA-signed, with a different e/d pair for each denomination. The server does not store any money. All coins are stored by the client module. The server accepts old coins and blind- signs new coins, and checks off the old ones on a spent list.‚Äù [‚Ä¶rest of excellent summary elided‚Ä¶highly recommended that you dig it up (archives, Web site?) and read it] [Pr0duct Cypher, Magic Money Digicash System, 1992-02-04]Magic Money    ftp://csn.org/pub/mpj/crypto_XXXXXX (or something like that) <Derek Atkins, 4-7-94>ftp:csn.org//mpj/I_will_not_export/crypto_???????/pgp_too ls  <Michael Paul Johnson, 4-7-94>12.12.2.

Practical Issues and Concerns with Digital Cash12.13.1. ‚ÄúIs physical identity proof needed for on-line clearing?‚ÄùNo, not if the cash outlook is taken. Cash is cash. Caveat emptor.The ‚Äúfirst to the locker‚Äù approach causes the bank not to particularly care about this, just as a Swiss bank will allow access to a numbered account by presentation of the number, and perhaps a key. Identity proof may be needed, depending on the ‚Äúprotocol‚Äù they and the customer established, but it need not be. And the last thing the bank is worried about is being able to ‚Äúfind and prosecute‚Äù anyone, as there is no way they can be liable for a double spending incident. The beauties of local clearing! (Which is what gold coins do, and paper money if we really think we can pass it on to others.)12.13.2. ‚ÄúIs digital cash traceable?‚ÄùThere are several flavors of ‚Äúdigital cash,‚Äù ranging from versions of VISA cards to fully untraceable (Chaumian) digital cash.This comes up a lot, with people in Net newsgroups even warning others not to use digital cash because of the ease of traceability. Not so.‚ÄúNot the kind proposed by David Chaum and his colleagues in the Netherlands. The whole thrust of their research over the last decade has been the use of cryptographic techniques to make electronic transactions secure from fraud while at the same time protecting personal privacy. They, and others, have developed a number of schemes for UNTRACEABLE digital cash.‚Äù [Kevin Van Horn, talk.politics.crypto, 1994-07-03]12.13.3. ‚ÄúIs there a danger that people will lose the numbers that   they need to redeem money? That someone could steal the   number and thus steal their money?‚ÄùSure. There‚Äôs the danger that I‚Äôll lose my bearer bonds, or forget my Swiss bank account number, or lose my treasure map to where I buried my money (as Alan Turing supposedly did in WW II).People can take steps to limit risk. More secure computers. Dongles worn around their necks. Protocols that involve biometric authentication to their local computer or key storage PDA, etc. Limits on withdrawals per day, etc. People can store key numbers with people they trust, perhaps encrypted with other keys, can leave them with their lawyers, etc. All sorts of arrangements can be made. Personal identification is but one of these arrangements. Often used, but not essential to the underlyng protocol. Again, the Swiss banks (maybe now the Liechtenstein anstalts are a better example) don‚Äôt require physical ID for all accounts. (More generally, if Charles wants to create a bank in which deposits are made and then given out to the first person who sings the right tune, why should we care? This extreme example is useful in pointing out that contractual arrangements need not involve governmental or societal norms about what constitutes proof of identity.)12.14. Cyberspace and Digital Money12.14.1. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt eat cyberspace, so what good is digital money?‚ÄùThis comes up a lot. People assume there is no practical way to transfer assets, when in fact it is done all the time. That is, money flows from the realm of the purely ‚Äúinformational‚Äù realm to the physcial realm Consultants, writers, traders, etc., all use their heads and thereby earn real money.Same will apply to cyberspace.12.14.2. ‚ÄúHow can I remain anonymous when buying physical items using   anonymous digital cash?‚ÄôVery difficult. Once you are seen, and your picture can be taken( perhaps unknown to you), databases will have you. Not much can be done about this.People have proposed schemes for anonymous shipment and pickup, but the plain fact is that physical delivery of any sort compromises anonymity, just as in the world today.The purpose of anonymous digital cash is partly to at least make it more difficult, to not give Big Brother your detailed itinerary from toll road movements, movie theater payments, etc. To the extent that physical cameras can still track cars, people, shipments, etc., anonymous digital cash doesn‚Äôt solve this surveillance problem.12.15. Outlawing of Cash12.15.1. ‚ÄúWhat are the motivations for outlawing cash?‚Äù(Note: This has not happened. Many of us see signs of it happening. Others are skeptical.)Reasons for the Elimination of Cash:    War on Drugs‚Ä¶.need I say more?surface the underground economy, by withdrawing papercurrency and forcing all monetary transaction into formsthat can be easily monitored, regulated, and taxed.tax avoidance, under the table economy (could also be motive for tamper-resistant cash registers, with spot checks to ensure compliance)welfare, disability, pension, social security auto- deposits        fraud, double-dippingreduce theft of welfare checks, disability payments, etc‚Ä¶.a problem in some locales, and automatic deposit/cash card approaches are being evaluated.general reduction in theft, pickpocketsreduction of paperwork: all transfers electronic (could be part of a ‚Äúreinventing government‚Äù initiative)illegal immigrants, welfare cheats, etc. Give everyone aNational Identity Card (they‚Äôll call it somethingdifferent. to make it more palatable, such as ‚ÄúSocialServices Portable Inventory Unit‚Äù or ‚ÄúHealth RightsDocument‚Äù).(Links to National Health Care Card, to Welfare Card, to other I.D. schemes designed to reduce fraud, track citizen-units, etc.)rationing systems that depend on non-cash transactions (as explained elsewhere, market distortions from rationing systems generally require identification, correlation to person or group, etc.)        this rationing can included subsidized prices, denial of access (e.g., certain foods denied to certain people)12.15.2. Lest this be considered paranoid ranting, let me point out that many actions have already been taken that limit the form of money (banking laws, money laundering, currency restrictions‚Ä¶even the outlawing of competing currencies itself)12.15.3. Dangers of outlawing cashWould freeze out all transactions, giving Big Brother unprecedented power (unless the non-cash forms were anonymous, a la Chaum and the systems we support)Would allow complete traceability‚Ä¶.like the cellular phones that got Simpson666, Heinlein, Shockwave Rider, etc.12.15.4. Given that there is no requirement for identity to be   associated with money, we should fight any system which   proposed to link the two.12.15.5. The value of paying cashmakes a transaction purely local, resolved on the spotthe alternative, a complicated accounting system involving other parties, etc., is much less attractivetoo many transactions these days are no longer handled in cash, which increases costs and gets other parties involved where they shouldn‚Äôt be involved.12.15.6. ‚ÄúWill people accept the banning of cash?‚ÄùThere was a time when I would‚Äôve said Americans, at least, would‚Äôve rejected such a thing. Too many memories of ‚ÄúPapieren, bitte. Macht schnell!‚Äù But I now think most Americans (and Europeans) are so used to producing documents for every transaction, and so used to using VISA cards and ATM cards at gas stations, supermarkets, and even at flea markets, that they‚Äôll willingly‚Äìeven eagerly‚Äì adopt such a system.12.16. Novel Opportunities12.16.1. Encrypted open books, or anonymous auditingEric Hughes has worked on a scheme using a kind of blinding to do ‚Äúencrypted open books,‚Äù whereby observers can verify that a bank is balancing its books without more detailed looks at individual accounts. (I have my doubts about spoofs, attacks, etc., but such are always to be considered in any new protocol.)‚ÄúKent Hastings wondered how an offshore bank could provide assurances to depositors.  I wondered the same thing a few months ago, and started working on what Perry calls the anonymous auditing problem.  I have what I consider to be the core of a solution. ‚Ä¶The following is long‚Ä¶. [TCM Note: Too long to include here. I am including just enough to convince readers that some new sorts of banking ideas may come out of cryptography.]‚ÄúIf we use the contents of the encrypted books at the organizational boundary points to create suitable legal opbligations, we can mostly ignore what goes on inside of the mess of random numbers.  That is, even if double books were being kept, the legal obligations created should suffice to ensure that everything can be unwound if needed. This doesn‚Äôt prevent networks of corrupt businesses from going down all at once, but it does allow networks of honest businesses to operate with more assurance of honesty.‚Äù [Eric Hughes,  PROTOCOL: Encrypted Open Books, 1993-08-16]12.16.2. ‚ÄúHow can software components be sold, and how does crypto   figure in?‚ÄùReusable Software, Brad Cox, Sprague, etc.    good article in ‚ÄúWired‚Äù (repeated in ‚ÄúOut of Control‚Äù)First, certainly software is sold. The issues is why the ‚Äúsoftware components‚Äù market has not yet developed, and why such specific instances of software as music, art, text, etc., have not been sold in smaller chunks.Internet commerce is a huge area of interest, and future development.    currently developing very slowlylots of conflicting information‚Ä¶several mailing lists‚Ä¶lots of hypeDigital cash is often cited as a needed enabling tool, but I think the answer is more complicated than that.    issues of convenienceissues of there being no recurring market (as there is in, say, the chip business‚Ä¶software doesn‚Äôt get bought over and over again, in increasing unit volumes)12.17. Loose Ends12.17.1. Reasons to have no government involvement in commerceEven a small involvement, through special regulations, granted frachises, etc., produces vested interests. For example, those in a community who had to wait to get building permits want others to wait just as long, or longer. Or, businesses that had to meet certain standard, even if unreasonable, will demand that new businesses do so also. The effect is an ever-widening tar pit of rules, restrictions, and delays. Distortions of the market result.Look at how hard it is for the former U.S.S.R. to disentangle itself from 75 years of central planning. They are now an almost totally Mafia-controlled state (by this I mean that ‚Äúprivatization‚Äù of formerly non-private enterprises benefitted those who had amassed money and influence, and that these were mainly the Russian Mafia and former or current politicians‚Ä¶the repercussions of this ‚Äúcorrupt giveaway‚Äù will be felt for decades to come).    An encouraging sign: The thriving black market in Russia- -which all Cypherpunks of course cheer‚Äìwill gradually displace the old business systems with new ones, as in all economies. Eventually the corruptly-bought businesses will sink or swim based on merit, and newly-created enterprises will compete with them.12.17.2. ‚ÄúPurist‚Äù Approach to Keys, Cash, ResponsibilityThere are two main approaches to the issue:    Key owner is responsible for uses of his keyor, Others are responsibleThere may be mixed situations, such as when a key is stolen‚Ä¶but this needs also to be planned-for by the key owner, by use of protocols that limit exposure. For example, few people will use a single key that accesses immediately their net worth‚Ä¶most people will partition their holding and their keyed access in such a way as to naturally limit exposure if any particular key is lost or compromised. Or forgotten.    could involve their bank holding keys, or escrow agentsor n-out-of-m voting systemsContracts are the essence‚Ä¶what contracts do people voluntarily enter into?And locality‚Äìwho better to keep keys secure than the owner? Anything that transfers blame to ‚Äúthe banks‚Äù or to ‚Äúsociety‚Äù breaks the feedback loop of responsibility, provides an ‚Äúout‚Äù for the lazy, and encourages fraud (people who disavow contracts by claiming their key was stolen).Activism and Projects13.1. copyright   THE  CYPHERNOMICON: Cypherpunks FAQ and More, Version 0.666,   1994-09-10, Copyright Timothy C.

Too often, though, the situation was that someone‚Äôs   vague plans for a product were declared by them to be the   standards that others should follow. Various schemes for   digital money, in many forms and modes, has always been the   prime example of this.)13.3.3. This is related also to what Kevin Kelley calls ‚Äúthe fax   effect.‚Äù When few people own fax machines, they‚Äôre not of   much use. Trying to get others to use the same tools one has   is like trying to convince people to buy fax machines so that   you can communicate by fax with them‚Ä¶it may happen, but   probably for other reasons. (Happily, the interoperability of   PGP provided a common communications medium that had been   lacking with previous platform-specific cipher programs.)13.3.4. Utopian schemes are also a tough sell. Schemes about using   digital money to make inflation impossible, schemes to   collect taxes with anonymous systems, etc.13.3.5.

Someday they‚Äôll have have a major impact.

Coincidence?Informal Explanation        Note: I‚Äôve posted this explanation, and variants, several times since I first wrote it in mid-1992. In fact, I first posted it on the ‚ÄúExtropians‚Äù mailing list, as ‚ÄúCypherpunks‚Äù did not then exist.Three Cypherpunks are having dinner, perhaps in Palo Alto. Their waiter tells them that their bill has already been paid, either by the NSA or by one of them. The waiter won‚Äôt say more. The Cypherpunks wish to know whether one of them paid, or the NSA paid. But they don‚Äôt want to be impolite and force the Cypherpunk payer to ‚Äòfess up, so they carry out this protocol (or procedure):Each Cypherpunk flips a fair coin behind a menu placed upright between himself and the Cypherpunk on his right. The coin is visible to himself AND to the Cypherpunk on his left. Each Cypherpunk can see his own coin and the coin to his right. (STOP RIGHT HERE! Please take the time to make a sketch of the situation I‚Äôve described. If you lost it here, all that follows will be a blur. It‚Äôs too bad the state of the Net today cannot support figures and diagrams easily.)Each Cypherpunk then states out loud whether the two coins he can see are the SAME or are DIFFERENT, e.g., ‚ÄúHeads-Tails‚Äù means DIFFERENT, and so forth. For now, assume the Cypherpunks are truthful. A little bit of thinking shows that the total number of ‚ÄúDIFFERENCES‚Äù must be either 0 (the coins all came up the same), orOdd parity is impossible.Now the Cypherpunks agree that if one of them paid, he or she will SAY THE OPPOSITE of what they actually see. Remember, they don‚Äôt announce what their coin turned up as, only whether it was the same or different as their neighbor.Suppose none of them paid, i.e., the NSA paid. Then they all report the truth and the parity is even (either 0 or 2 differences). They then know the NSA paid.Suppose one of them paid the bill. He reports the opposite of what he actually sees, and the parity is suddenly odd. That is, there is 1 difference reported. The Cypherpunks now know that one of them paid. But can they determine which one?Suppose you are one of the Cypherpunks and you know you didn‚Äôt pay. One of the other two did. You either reported SAME or DIFFERENT, based on what your neighbor to the right (whose coin you can see) had. But you can‚Äôt tell which of the other two is lying! (You can see you right-hand neighbor‚Äôs coin, but you can‚Äôt see the coin he sees to his right!)This all generalizes to any number of people. If none of them paid, the parity is even. If one of them paid, the parity is odd. But which one of them paid cannot be deduced. And it should be clear that each round can transmit a bit, e.g., ‚ÄúI paid‚Äù is a ‚Äú1‚Äù. The message ‚ÄúAttack at dawn‚Äù could thus be ‚Äúsent‚Äù untraceably with multiple rounds of the protocol.The ‚ÄúCrypto Ouija Board‚Äù: I explain this to people as a kind of ouija board. A message, like ‚ÄúI paid‚Äù or a more interesting ‚ÄúTransfer funds from‚Ä¶..,‚Äù just ‚Äúemerges‚Äù out of the group, with no means of knowing where it came from. Truly astounding.Problems and Pitfalls        In Chaum‚Äôs paper, the explanation above is given quickly, in a few pages. The rest of the paper is then devoted to dealing with the many ‚Äúgotchas‚Äù and attacks that come up and that must be dealt with before the DC protocol is even remotely possible. I think all those interested in protocol design should read this paper, and the follow-on papers by Bos, Pfitzmann, etc., as object lessons for dealing with complex crypto protocols.The Problems:            Collusion. Obviously the Cypherpunks can collude to deduce the payer. This is best dealt with by creating multiple subcircuits (groups doing the protocol amongst themselves). Lots more stuff here. Chaum devotes most of the paper to these kind of issues and their solutions.With each round of this protocol, a single bit is transmitted. Sending a long message means many coin flips. Instead of coins and menus, the neighbors would exchange lists of random numbers (with the right partners, as per the protocol above, of course. Details are easy to figure out.)Since the lists are essentially one-time pads, the protocol is unconditionally secure, i.e., no assumptions are made about the difficulty of factoring large numbers or any other crypto assumptions.Participants in such a ‚ÄúDC-Net‚Äù (and here we are coming to the heart of the ‚Äúcrypto anarchy‚Äù idea) could exchange CD-ROMs or DATs, giving them enough ‚Äúcoin flips‚Äù for zillions of messages, all untraceable! The logistics are not simple, but one can imagine personal devices, like smart card or Apple ‚ÄúNewtons,‚Äù that can handle these protocols (early applications may be for untraceable brainstorming comments, secure voting in corportate settings, etc.)The lists of random numbers (coin flips) can be generated with standard cryptographic methods, requiring only a key to be exchanged between the appropriate participants. This eliminates the need for the one-time pad, but means the method is now only cryptographically secure, which is often sufficient. (Don‚Äôt think ‚Äúonly cryptographically secure‚Äù means insecure‚Ä¶.the messages may remain encrypted for the next billion years)Collisions occur when multiple messages are sent at the same time. Various schemes can be devised to handle this, like backing off when you detect another sender (when even parity is seen instead of odd parity). In large systems this is likely to be a problem. Deliberate disruption, or spamming, is a major problem‚Äìa disruptor can shut down the DC-net by sending bits out. As with remailes, anonymity means freedom from detection. (Anonymous payments to send a message may help, but the details are murky to me.)Uses        Untraceable mail. Useful for avoiding censorship, for avoiding lawsuits, and for all kinds of crypto anarchy things.Fully anonymous bulletin boards, with no traceability of postings or responses. Illegal materials can be offered for sale (my 1987 canonical example, which freaked out a few people: ‚ÄúStealth bomber blueprints for sale. Post highest offer and include public key.‚Äù). Think for a few minutes about this and you‚Äôll see the profound implications.Decentralized nexus of activity. Since messages ‚Äúemerge‚Äù (a la the ouija board metaphor), there is no central posting area. Nothing for the government to shut down, complete deniability by the participants.Only you know who your a partners are‚Ä¶.in any given circuit. And you can be in as many circuits as you wish. (Payments can be made to others, to create a profit motive. I won‚Äôt deal with this issue, or with the issue of how reputations are handled, here.)It should be clear that DC-nets offer some amazing opportunities. They have not been implemented at all, and have received almost no attention compared to ordinary Cypherpunks remailers. Why is this? The programming complexity (and the underlying cryptographic primitives that are needed) seems to be the key. Several groups have announced plans to imlement some form of DC-net, but nothing has appeared.software vs. hardware,Yanek Martinson, Strick, Austin group, RishabIMO, this is an ideal project for testing the efficacy of software toolkits. The primitives needed, including bit commitment, synchronization, and collusion handling, are severe tests of crypto systems.

Responses to Our Projects (Attacks, Challenges)13.5.1. ‚ÄúWhat are the likely attitudes toward mainstream Cypherpunks   projects, such as remailers, encryption, etc.?‚ÄùReaction has already been largely favorable. Journalists such as Steven Levy, Kevin Kelly, John Markoff, and Julian Dibbell have written favorably. Reaction of people I have talked to has also been mostly favorable.13.5.2. ‚ÄúWhat are the likely attitudes toward the more outre   projects, such as digital money, crypto anarchy, data havens,   and the like?‚ÄùConsternation is often met. People are frightened.The journalists who have written about these things (those mentioned above) have gotten beyond the initial reaction and seem genuinely intrigued  by the changes that are coming.13.5.3. ‚ÄúWhat kinds of attacks can we expect?‚ÄùDepends on the projects, but some general sorts of attacks are likely. Some have already occurred. Examples:    flooding of remailers, denial of service attacks‚Äìto swamp systems and force remailers to reconsider operations        this is fixed (mostly) with ‚Äúdigital postage‚Äù (if postage covers costs, and generates a profit, then the more the better)deliberately illegal or malicicious messages, such as death threats        designed to put legal and sysop pressures on the remailer operatorseveral remailers have been attacked this way, or at least have had these messagessource-blocking sometimes works, though not of course if another remailer is first used (many issues here)prosecution for content of posts        copyright violations            e.g., forwarding ClariNet articles through Hal Finney‚Äôs remailer got Brad Templeton to write warning letters to HalpornographyITAR violations, Trading with the Enemy Actespionage, sedition, treasoncorporate secrets,These attacks will test the commitment and courage of remailer or anonymizing service operators13.6. Deploying Crypto13.6.1. ‚ÄúHow can Cypherpunks publicize crypto and PGP?‚Äùarticles, editorials, radio shows, talking with friendsThe Net itself is probably the best place to publicize the problems with Clipper and key escrow. The Net played a major role‚Äìperhaps the dominant role‚Äìin generating scorn for Clipper. In many way the themes debated here on the Net have tremendous influence on media reaction, on editorials, on organizational reactions, and of course on the opinion of technical folks. News spreads quickly, zillions of theories are aired and debated, and consensus tends to emerge quickly.raves, DraperLibertarian Party, anarchists‚Ä¶conferences and trade shows    Arsen Ray Arachelian passed out diskettes at PC Expo13.6.2. ‚ÄúWhat are the Stumbling Blocks to Greater Use of Encryption (Cultural, Legal, Ethical)?‚Äù‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too hard to use‚Äù    multiple protocols (just consider how hard it is to actually send encrypted messages between people today)the need to remember a password or passphrase‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too much trouble‚Äù    the argument being that people will not bother to use passwordspartly because they don‚Äôt think anything will happen to them‚ÄúWhat have you got to hide?‚Äù    e.g.,, imagine some comments I‚Äôd have gotten at Intel had I encrypted everythingand governments tend to view encryption as ipso facto proof that illegalities are being committed: drugs, money laundering, tax evasionrecall the ‚Äúforfeiture‚Äù controversyBTW, anonymous systems are essentially the ultimate merit system (in the obvious sense) and so fly in the face of the ‚Äúhiring by the numbers‚Äù de facto quota systems now creeeping in to so many areas of life‚Ä¶.there may be rules requiring all business dealings to keep track of the sex, race, and ‚Äúability group‚Äù (I‚Äôm kidding, I hope) of their employees and their consultantsCourts Are Falling Behind, Are Overcrowded, and Can‚Äôt Deal Adequately with New Issues-Such as Encryption and Cryonics    which raises the issue of the ‚ÄúScience Court‚Äù againand migration to private adjudicationscenario: any trials that are being decided in 1998-9 will have to have been started in 1996 and based on technology and decisions of around 1994Government is taking various steps to limit the use of encryption and secure communication    some attempts have failed (S.266), some have been shelved, and almost none have yet been tested in the courtssee the other sections‚Ä¶13.6.3. Practical IssuesEducationProliferationBypassing Laws13.6.4. ‚ÄúHow should projects and progress best be achieved?‚ÄùThis is a tough one, one we‚Äôve been grappling with for a couple of years now. Lots of approaches.Writing codeOrganizationalLobbyingI have to say that there‚Äôs one syndrome we can probably do w,the Frustrated Cyperpunks Syndrome. Manifested by someone flaming the list for not jumping in to join them on their (usually) half-baked scheme to build a digital bank, or write a book, or whatever. ‚ÄúYou guys just don‚Äôt care!‚Äù is the usual cry. Often these flamers end up leaving the list.Geography may play a role, as folks in otherwise-isolated areas seem to get more attached to their ideas and then get angry when the list as a whole does not adopt them (this is my impression, at least).13.6.5. Crypto faces the complexity barrier that all technologies   faceLife has gotten more complicated in some ways, simpler in other ways (we don‚Äôt have to think about cooking, about shoeing the horses, about the weather, etc.). Crypto is currently fairly complicated, especially if multiple paradigms are used (encryption, signing, money, etc.).As a personal note, I‚Äôm practically drowning in a.c. adaptors and power cords for computers, laser printers, VCRs, camcorders, portable stereos, laptop computers, guitars, etc. Everything with a rechargeable battery has to be charged, but not overcharged, and not allowed to run- down‚Ä¶I forgot to plug in my old Powerbook 100 for a couple of months, and the lead-acid batteries went out on me. Personally, I‚Äôm drowning in this crap.I mention this only because I sense a backlash coming‚Ä¶people will say ‚Äúscrew it‚Äù to new technology that actually complicates their lives more than it simplifies their lives. ‚ÄúCrypto tweaks‚Äù who like to fool around with ‚Äúcreating a client‚Äù in order to play with digital cash will continue to do so, but 99% of the sought-after users won‚Äôt. (A nation that can‚Äôt‚Äìor won‚Äôt‚Äìset its VCR clock will hardly embrace the complexities of digital cash. Unless things change, and use becomes as easy as using an ATM.)13.6.6. ‚ÄúHow can we get more people to worry about security in   general and encryption in particular?‚ÄùFact is, most people never think about real security. Safe manufacturers have said that improvements in safes were driven by insurance rates. A direct incentive to spend more money to improve security (cost of better safe < cost of higher insurance rate).Right now there is almost no economic incentive for people to worry about PIN security, about protecting their files, etc. (Banks eat the costs and pass them on‚Ä¶any bank which tried to save a few bucks in losses by requiring 10-digit PINs‚Äìwhich people would write down anyway!‚Äìwould lose customers. Holograms and pictures on bank cards are happening because the costs have dropped enough.)Personally, my main interests is in ensuring the Feds don‚Äôt tell me I can‚Äôt have as much security as I want to buy. I don‚Äôt share the concern quoted above that we have to find ways to give other people security.Others disagree with my nonchalance, pointing out that getting lots of other people to use crypto makes it easier for those who already protect themselves. I agree, I just don‚Äôt focus on missionary work.For those so inclined, point out to people how vulnerable their files are, how the NSA can monitor the Net, and so on. All the usual scare stories.13.7. Political Action and Opposition13.7.1. Strong political action is emerging on the Netright-wing conspiracy theorists, like Linda ThompsonNet has rapid response to news events (Waco, Tienenmen, Russia)    with stories often used by media (lots of reporters on Net, easy to cull for references, Net has recently become tres trendy)Aryan Nation in Cyberspace(These developments bother many people I mention them to. Nothing can be done about who uses strong crypto. And most fasicst/racist situations are made worse by state sponsorship‚Äìapartheid laws, Hitler‚Äôs Germany, Pol Pot‚Äôs killing fields, all were examples of the state enforcing racist or genocidal laws. The unbreakable crypto that the Aryan Nation gets is more than offset by the gains elsewhere, and the undermining of central authority.)shows the need for strong crypto‚Ä¶else governments will infiltrate and monitor these political groups13.7.2.

Cypherpunks once volunteered (April, 1993) to make this their special focus, but not much has been heard since. (To be fair to them, political lobbying is pretty far-removed from most Cypherpunks interests.)no budget, no staff, no office‚Äúherding cats‚Äù +  no financial stakes = why we don‚Äôt do more    it‚Äôs very hard to coordinate dozens of free-thinking, opinionated, smart people, especially when there‚Äôs no whip hand, no financial incentive, no way to force them into line        I‚Äôm obviously not advocating such force, just noting a truism of systems‚ÄúShould Cypherpunks advocate breaking laws to achieve goals?‚Äù    ‚ÄúMy game is to get cryptography available to all, without violating the law.

(support by them for public access programs, subsidies, restrictions on businesses, etc.)We‚Äôre also a more radical group in nearly every way, with various flavors of political extremism strongly represented. Mostly anarcho-capitalists and strong libertarians, and many ‚Äúno compromises‚Äù privacy advocates. (As usual, my apologies to any Maoists or the like who don‚Äôt feel comfortable being lumped in with the libertarians‚Ä¶.if you‚Äôre out there, you‚Äôre not speaking up.) In any case, the house of Cypherpunks has many rooms.We were called ‚ÄúCrypto Rebels‚Äù in Steven Levy‚Äôs ‚ÄúWired‚Äù article (issue 1.2, early 1993). We can represent a radical alternative to the Beltway lawyers that dominate EFF, EPIC, etc. No need to compromise on things like Clipper, Software Key Escrow, Digital Telephony, and the NII. But, of course, no input to the legislative process.But there‚Äôs often an advantage to having a much more radical, purist body out in the wings, making the ‚Äúrejectionist‚Äù case and holding the inner circle folks to a tougher standard of behavior.And of course there‚Äôs the omnipresent difference that we tend to favor direct action through technology over politicking.13.7.6.

(Though at   this writing, the Health Bill is looking mighty amateurish   and seems ulikely to pass.)13.10.2. We are not hearing about these ‚Äúdeals‚Äù in a timely way. I   first heard that a brand new, and ‚Äúin the bag,‚Äù deal was   cooking when I was talking to a noted journalist. He told me   that a new deal, cut between Congress, the telecom industry,   and the EFF-type lobbying groups, was already a done deal and   would be unveiled so. Sure enough, the New and Improved   Digital Telephony II Bill appears a few weeks later and is   said by EFF representatives to be unstoppable. [comments by   S. McLandisht and others, comp.org.eff.talk, 1994-08]13.10.3. Well, excuse me for reminding everyone that this country is   allegedly still a democracy.

The flakiness of current systems‚Ä¶The current crypto infrastructure is fairly flaky, though the distributed web-of-trust model is better than some centralized system, of coure. What I mean is that many aspects are slow, creaky, and conducive to errors.In the area of digital cash, what we have now is not even as advanced as was seen with real money in Sumerian times! (And I wouldn‚Äôt trust the e-mail ‚Äúmessage in a bottle‚Äù approach for any nontrivial financial transactions.)Something‚Äôs got to change. The NII/Superhighway/Infobahn people have plans, but their plans are not likely to mesh well with ours. A challenge for us to consider.13.11.5. ‚ÄúAre there dangers in being too paranoid?‚ÄùAs Eric Hughes put it,  ‚Äúparanoia is cryptography‚Äôs occupational hazard.‚Äù    ‚ÄúThe effect of paranoia is self-delusion of the following form‚Äìthat one‚Äôs possible explanations are skewed toward malicious attacks, by individuals, that one has the technical knowledge to anticipate.  This skewing creates an inefficient allocation of mental energy, it tends toward the personal, downplaying the possibility of technical error, and it begins to close off examination of technicalities not fully understood.‚ÄúThose who resist paranoia will become better at cryptography than those who do not, all other things being equal.  Cryptography is about epistemology, that is, assurances of truth, and only secondarily about ontology, that is, what actually is true.  The goal of cryptography is to create an accurate confidence that a system is private and secure. In order to create that confidence, the system must actually be secure, but security is not sufficient.  There must be confidence thatthe way by which this security becomes to be believed is robust and immune to delusion.‚ÄúParanoia creates delusion.  As a direct and fundamental result, it makes one worse at cryptography.  At the outside best, it makes one slower, as the misallocation of attention leads one down false trails. Who has the excess brainpower for that waste?  Certainly not I.  At the worst, paranoia makes one completely ineffective, not only in technical means but even more so in the social context in which cryptography is necessarily relevant.‚Äù [Eric Hughes, 1994-05-14]King Alfred Plan, blacks    plans to round up 20 million blacksRFK, links to LAPD, Western Goals, Birch, KKKRFA #9, 23, 38organized crime situation, perhaps intelligencecommunitydamaging to blacks, psychological13.11.6.

The ‚Äúreasonableness‚Äù trapmaking a reasonable thing into a mandatory thingthis applies to what Cypherpunks should ever be prepared to supportAn example: A restaurant offers to replace dropped items (dropped on the floor, literally) for free‚Ä¶a reasonable thing to offer customers (something I see frequently). So why not make it the law? Because then the reasonable discretion of the restaurant owner would be lost, and some customers could ‚Äúgame against‚Äù (exploit the letter of the law) the system. Even threaten lawsuits.    (And libertarians know that ‚Äúmy house, my rules‚Äù applies to restaurants and other businesses, absent a contract spelling exceptions out.)A more serious example is when restaurants (again) find it ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù to hire various sorts of qualified people. What may be ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù is one thing, but too often the government decides to formalize this and takes away the right to choose. (In my opinion, no person or group has any ‚Äúright‚Äù to a job unless the employer freely offers it. Yes, this could included discrimination against various groups. Yes, we may dislike this. But the freedom to choose is a much more basic right than achieving some ideal of equality is.)And when ‚Äúreasonableness‚Äù is enforced by law, the game- playing increases. In effect, some discretion is needed to reject claims that are based on gaming. Markets naturally work this way, as no ‚Äúbasic rights‚Äù or contracts are being violated.Fortunately, strong crypto makes this nonsense impossible. Perforce, people will engage in contracts only voluntarily.13.11.8. ‚ÄúHow do we get agreement on protocols?‚ÄùGive this idea up immediately! Agreement to behave in certain ways is almost never possible.Is this an indictment of anarchy?No, because the way agreement is sort of reached is through standards or examplars that people can get behind.

Digital Timestamping14.3.1. digital timestampingThe canonical reference for digital timestamping is the work of Stu Haber and Scott Stornetta, of Bellcore. Papers presented at various Crypto conferences. Their work involves having the user compute a hash of the document he wishes to be stamped and sending the hash to them, where they merge this hash with other hashes (and all previous hashes, via a tree system) and then they publish the resultant hash in a very public and hard-to-alter forum, such as in an ad in the Sunday ‚ÄúNew York Times.‚ÄùIn their parlance, such an ad is a ‚Äúwidely witnessed event,‚Äù and attempts to alter all or even many copies of the newspaper would be very difficult and expensive. (In a sense, this WWE is similar to the ‚Äúbeacon‚Äù term Eric Hughes used.)Haber and Stornetta plan some sort of commercial operation to do this.This service has not yet been tested in court, so far as I know. The MIT server is an experiment, and is probably useful for experimenting. But it is undoubtedly even less legally significant, of course.14.3.2. my summary14.4.

Timed-Release Crypto14.5.1. ‚ÄúCan anything like a ‚Äúcryptographic time capsule‚Äù be built?‚ÄùThis would be useful for sealing diaries and records in such a way that no legal bodies could gain access, that even the creator/encryptor would be unable to decrypt the records. Call it ‚Äútime escrow.‚Äù Ironically, a much more correct use of the term ‚Äúescrow‚Äù than we saw with the government‚Äôs various ‚Äúkey escrow‚Äù schemes.Making records undecryptable is easy: just use a one-way function and the records are unreachable forever. The trick is to have a way to get them back at some future time.Approaches:    Legal Repository. A lawyer or set of lawyers has the key or keys and is instructed to release them at some future time. (The key-holding agents need not be lawyers, of course, though that is the way things are now done.        The legal system is a time-honored way of protecting secrets of various kinds, and any system based on cryptography needs to compete strongly with this simple to use, well-established system.If the lawyer‚Äôs identity is known, he can be subpoenaed. Depends on jurisdictional issues, future political climate, etc.But identity-hiding protocols can be used, so that the lawyer cannot be reached. All that is know, for example, is that ‚Äúsomewhere out there‚Äù is an agent who is holding the key(s). Reputation-based systems should work well here: the agent gains little and loses a lot by releasing a key early, hence has no economic motivation to do so. (Picture also a lot of ‚Äúpinging‚Äù going to ‚Äúrate‚Äù the various ti<w agents.)Cryptography with Beacons. A ‚Äúbeacon agent‚Äù makes very public a series of messages, somehow. Details fuzzy. [I have a hunch that using digital time-stamping services could be useful here.]Difficulty of factoring, etc.        The idea here is to-use a function which is presently hard to invert, but which may be easier in the future. This is fraught with problems, including unpredictability of the difficulty, imprecision in the timing of release, and general clumsiness. As Hal Finney notes:            ‚ÄúThere was an talk on this topic at either the Crypto 92 or 93 conference, I forget which.  It is available in the proceedings‚Ä¶.The method used was similar to the idea here of encrypting with a public key and requiring factoring of the modulus to decrypt.  But the author had more techniques he used, iterating functions forward which would take longer to iterate backwards.  The purpose was to give a more predictable time to decrypt‚Ä¶..One problem with this is that it does not so much put a time floor on the decryption, but rather a cost floor.  Someone who is willing to spend enough can decrypt faster than someone who spends less.  Another problem is the difficulty of forecasting the growth of computational power per dollar in the future.‚Äù [Hal Finney, sci.crypt, 1994-8-04]Tamper-resistant modules.

The issue of recognizing whether a message has or mighthave a hidden message has two sides.  One is for the desired recipient to be clued that he should try desteganizing and decrypting the message, and the other is for a possible attacker to discover illegal uses of cryptography.‚ÄúSteganography should be used with a ‚Äústealthy‚Äù cryptosystem (secret key or public key), one in which the cyphertext is indistinguishable from a random bit string. You would not want it to have any headers which could be used to confirm that a desteganized message was other than random noise.‚Äù [Hal Finney, 1993-05-25]14.7.3. Peter Wayner‚Äôs ‚ÄúMimic‚Äù‚ÄúThey encode a secret message inside a harmless looking ASCII text file.  This is one of the very few times the UNIX tools ‚Äúlex‚Äù and ‚Äúyacc‚Äù have been used in cryptography, as far as I know.   Peter Wayner, ‚ÄúMimic Functions‚Äù, CRYPTOLOGIA Volume 16, Number 3, pp. 193-214, July 1992.[Michael Johnson, sci.crypt, 1994-09-05]14.7.4. I described it in 1988 or 89 and many times sinceSeveral years ago I posted to sci.crypt my ‚Äúnovel‚Äù idea for packing bits into the essentially inaudible ‚Äúleast significant bits‚Äù (LSBs) of digital recordings, such as DATs and CDs. Ditto for the LSBs in an 8-bit image or 24- bit color image. I‚Äôve since seen this idea reinvented several times on sci.crypt and elsewhere‚Ä¶and I‚Äôm willing to bet I wasn‚Äôt the first, either (so I don‚Äôt claim any credit).A 2-hour DAT contains about 10 Gbits (2 hours x 3600 sec/hr x 2 channels x 16 bits/sample x 44K samples/sec), or about 1.2 Gbytes. A CD contains about half this, i.e., about 700 Mbytes. The LSB of a DAT is 1/16th of the 1.2 Gbytes, or 80 Mbytes. This is a lot of storage!A home-recorded DAT‚Äìand I use a Sony D-3 DAT Walkman to make tapes‚Äìhas so much noise down at the LSB level‚Äìnoise from the A/D and D/A converters, noise from the microphones (if any), etc.‚Äìthat the bits are essentially random at this level. (This is a subtle, but important, point: a factory recorded DAT or CD will have predetermined bits at all levels, i.e., the authorities could in principle spot any modifications. But home-recorded, or dubbed, DATs will of course not be subject to this kind of analysis.) Some care might be taken to ensure that the statistical properties of the signal bits resemble what would be expected with ‚Äúnoise‚Äù bits, but this will be a minor hurdle.Adobe Photoshop can be used to easily place message bits in the ‚Äúnoise‚Äù that dominates things down at the LSB level. The resulting GIF can then be posted to UseNet or e-mailed. Ditto for sound samples, using the ideas I just described (but typically requiring sound sampling boards, etc.). I‚Äôve done some experiments along these lines.This doesn‚Äôt mean our problems are solved, of course. Exchanging tapes is cumbersome and vulnerable to stings. But it does help to point out the utter futility of trying to stop the flow of bits.14.7.5.

Though its effect is visually undetectable, do not expect cryptographic security from Stego.  Be aware that anyone with a copy of Stego can retrieve your data from your PICT file.  Stego  can  be used as an ‚Äúenvelope‚Äù to hide a previously encrypted data file in a PICT file, making it much less likely to be detected.‚Äù [Romana Machado, 1993-11- 23]14.7.6.

Miscellaneous Commentsthis is another ‚Äútransition‚Äù chapter, laying the groundwork for Crypto Anarchy15.3. The Nature of Reputations15.3.1. The claim by many of us that ‚Äúreputations‚Äù will take care of   many problems in crypto anarchic markets is disputed by some   (notably Eric Hughes). To be sure, it will not be a trivial   issue. Institutions take years or decades to evolve.15.3.2. However, think of how often we use reputations: friends,   books, movies, restaurants, etc15.3.3. Reputations and other institutions will take time to evolve.   Saying ‚Äúthe market will talke care of things‚Äù may be true,   but this may take time. The ‚Äúinvisible hand‚Äù doesn‚Äôt   necessarily move swiftly.15.3.4. ‚ÄúWhat are ‚Äòreputations‚Äô and why are they so important?‚Äùa vague concept related to degree of believability, of trust, etc.‚Äúwe know it when we see it‚Äù    (sorry for the cop out, but I don‚Äôt have a good definition handy‚Ä¶.James Donald says studying reputatons is ‚Äúnominalist hot air‚Äù [1994-09-02], but I think it‚Äôs quite important)obvious, in ordinary life, but in the cyberspatial context    reputation-based systemsescrow, expectations‚Äúreputation capital‚Äùlike book or music recommendationsweb of trust (is different than just ‚Äútrust‚Äù‚Äîtensor, rather than scalar)Actually very common: how most of us deal with our friends, our enemies, the books we read, the restaurants we frequent, etc.    we mentally downcheck and upcheck on the basis of experience; we learnAre there examples?Eric‚Äôs objections15.3.5. ‚ÄúHow are reputations acquired, ruined, transferred, etc.?‚ÄùFirst, reputations are not ‚Äúowned‚Äù by the person to whom they are attached by others    the algebra is tricky‚Ä¶maybe Eric Hughes or one of the other pure math types can help straighten out the ‚Äúcalculus of reputations‚Äù        reputations are not symmetric: just because Alice esteems Bob does mean the reverse is soreputations are not transitive, though they are partially transitive: if Alice esteems Bob and Bob esteems Charles, this may cause Alice to be somewhat more esteemful of Charles.a tensor matrix?a graph?Any holder of a reputation can ‚Äúspend‚Äù some of his reputation capital    in praise or criticism of another agentin reviews (think of Siskel and Ebert ‚Äúspending‚Äù some of their reputation capital in the praise of a movie, and how their own reptutations will go up and down as a function of many things, including especially how much the viewing audience agrees with them)15.3.6. ‚ÄúAre they foolproof? Are all the questions answered?‚ÄùOf course not.And Eric Hughes has in the past said that too much importance is being invested in this idea of reputations, though many or even most of us (who comment on the matter) clearly think otherwise.In any case, much more study is needed. Hal Finney and I have debated this a couple of times (first on the Extropians list, then a couple or more times on the Cypherpunks list), and we are mostly in agreement that this area is very promising and is deserving of much more thought‚Äìand even experimentation. (One of my interests in crypto simulations, in ‚Äúprotocol ecologies,‚Äù is to simulate agents which play games involving reputations, spoofing, transfers of reputations, etc.)15.3.7. Reputations have many aspectsthe trading firm which runs others people‚Äôs money is probably less ‚Äúreputable‚Äù in an important sense than the trading firm in which partners have their own personal fortunes riding‚Ä¶.or at least I know which one I‚Äôd trust!    (But how to guarantee one isn‚Äôt being fooled, by a spoof, a sham? Hard to say. Perhaps the ‚Äúencrypted open books‚Äù protocol Eric Hughes is working on will be of use here.)15.4.

Reputation-based systems and repeat businessreputations matter‚Ä¶this is the main basis of our economic system    repeat business‚Ä¶.people stop doing business with those they don‚Äôt trust, or who mistreat them, or those who just don‚Äôt seem to be reputableand even in centrally-controlled systems, reputations matter (can‚Äôt force people to undertake some relations)credit ratings (even for pseudonyms) matterescrow agents, bonding, etc.criminal systems still rely on reputations and even on honorironically, it is often in cases where there are restrictions on choice that the advantages of reputations are lost, as when the government bans discrimination, limits choice, or insists on determining who can do business with whoRepeat business is the most important aspect    granularity of transactions, cash flow, game-theoretic analysis of advantages of ‚Äúdefecting‚Äùanytime a transaction has a value that is very large (compared to expected future profits from transactions, or on absolute basis), watch outideally, a series of smaller transactions are more conducive to fair trading‚Ä¶for example, if one gets a bad meal at a restaurant, one avoids that restaurant in the future, rather than suing (even though one can claim to have been ‚Äúdamaged‚Äù)issues of contract as well15.6. Reputations and Evolutionary Game Theory15.6.1. game of ‚Äúchicken,‚Äù where gaining a rep as tough guy, or king   of the hill, can head off many future challenges (and hence   aid in survival, differential reproduction)15.7. Positive Reputations15.7.1. better than negative reputations, because neg reps can be   discarded by pseudonym holdes (neg reps are like allowing a   credit card to be used then abandoned with a debt on it)15.7.2. ‚Äúreputation capital‚Äù15.8. Practical Examples15.8.1. ‚ÄúAre there any actual examples of software-mediated   reputation systems?‚Äùcredit databases‚Ä¶positive and negative reputations15.8.2. Absent laws which ban strong crypto (and such laws are   themselves nearly unenforceable), it will be essentially   impossible to stop anonymous transactions and purely   reputation-based systems.For example, Pr0duct Cypher and Sue D. Nym will be able to use private channels of their own choosing (possibly using anonymous pools, etc.) to communicate and arrange deals. If some form of digital cash exists, they will even be able to transfer this cash. (If not, barter of informations, whatever.)So, the issues raised by Hal Finney and others, expressing doubts about the adequacy of reputation capital as a building block (and good concerns they are, by the way), become moot. Society cannot stop willing participants from using reputation and anonymity. This is a major theme of crypto anarchy: the bypassing of convention by willing participants.If Alice and Bob don‚Äôt care that their physical identies are unknown to each other, why should we care? That is, why should society step in and try to ban this arrangement?    they won‚Äôt be using ‚Äúour‚Äù court systems, so that‚Äôs not an issue (and longer term, PPLs will take the place of courts, many of us feel)only if Alice and Bob are counting on society, on third parties to the transaction, to do certain things, can society make a claim to be involved(A main reason to try to ban anonymity will be to stop ‚Äúbad‚Äù activities, which is a separate issue; banning of ‚Äúbad‚Äù activity is usually pointless, and leads to repressive states. But I digress.)15.8.3. Part of the ‚Äúphase change‚Äù: people opt out of the permission- slip society via strong crypto, making their own decisions on who to trust, who to deal with, who to make financial arrangements withexample: credit rating agencies that are not traceable, not prosecutable in any court‚Ä¶people deal with them only if they think they are getting value for their money    no silly rules that credit rating data can ‚Äúonly‚Äù go back some arbitrary number of years (7, in U.S.)‚Ä¶no silly rules about how certain bankruptcies ‚Äúcan‚Äôt‚Äù be considered, how one‚Äôs record is to be ‚Äúcleared‚Äù if conditions are met, etc.rather, all data are considered‚Ä¶.customer decides how to weight the data‚Ä¶(if a customer is too persnickety about past lapsed bills, or a bad debt many years in the past, he‚Äôll find himself never lending any money, so the ‚Äúinvisible hand‚Äù of the free market will tend to correct such overzealousnesses)data havens, credit havens, etc. (often called ‚Äúoffshore data havens,‚Äù as the current way to do this would be to locate in Caymans, Isle of Man, etc.)    but clearly they can be ‚Äúoffshore in cyberspace‚Äù (anonymous links, etc.)15.9. Credentials and Reputations15.9.1. debate about credentials vs. reputationsJames Donald, Hal Finney, etc.(insert details of debate here)15.9.2. Credentials are not as important as many people seem to think‚ÄúPermisssion slips‚Äù for various behaviors: drinking age, admission to movie theaters, business licenses, licenses to drive taxicabs, to read palms (yes, here in Santa Cruz one must have a palm-reading license, separate from the normal ‚Äúbusiness license‚Äù)Such credentials often are inappropriate extensions of state power into matters which only parents should handle    underage drinking? Not my problem! Don‚Äôt force bars to be babysitters.underage viewing of movies? Ditto, even more so.15.9.3. Proving possession of some credential15.10. Fraud and False Accusations15.10.1. ‚ÄúWhat if someone makes a false accusation?‚Äùone‚Äôs belief in an assertion is an emergent phenomenonassertion does not equal proof    (even ‚Äúproof‚Äù is variable, too)false claims eventually reflect on false claimant15.10.2.

People were encouraged to send in donations. Apparently the scheme/scam collapsed:    ‚ÄúIt  turned out to all be a scam, actually.  The key people involved, Eric Kline and Chuck Geshlieder, allegedly had a scheme set up where they repeatedly paid themselves out of all of the proceeds.‚Äù [anonymous post, altp.privacy, (reprint of Scott A. Kjar post on Compuserve), 1994-07-28]        or was it Eric Klein?15.11. Loose Ends15.11.1. Selective disclosure of truthMore euphemestic than ‚Äúlying.‚ÄùConsider how we react when someone asks us about something we consider overly personal, while a friend or loved one may routinely ask such questions.Is ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù the real issue? Or is that we understand truth is a commodity with value, to be given out for something in return?At one extreme, the person who casually and consistently lies earns a poor reputation‚Äìanyone encountering them is never certain if the truth is being told. At the other extreme, the ‚Äúalways honest‚Äù person essentially gives too much away, revealing preferences, plans, and ideas without consideration.I‚Äôm all for secrets‚Äìand lies, when needed. I believe in selective disclosure of the truth, because the truth carries value and need not be ‚Äúgiven away‚Äù to anyone who asks.15.11.2.

Connections to Other Sectionsthis section ties all the other sections together16.2.3. Where to Find Additional Informationagain, almost nothing written on thisVinge, Friedman, Rand, etc.16.2.4. Miscellaneous Commentsa very long section, possibly confusing to many16.3. Introduction16.3.1. ‚ÄúThe revolution will not be televised. The revolution will,   however, be digitized.‚Äù Welcome to the New Underworld Order!   (a term I have borrowed from writer Claire Sterling.)16.3.2. ‚ÄúDo the views here express the views of the Cypherpunks as a   whole?‚ÄùThis section is controversial. Hence, even more warnings than usual about being careful not to confuse these comments with the beliefs of all or even most Cypherpunks.In fairness, libertarianism is undeniably the most represented ideology on the list, as it is in so much of the Net. The reasons for this have been extensively debated over the years, but it‚Äôs a fact. If other major ideologies exists, they are fairly hidden on the Cypherpunks list.Yes, some quasi-socialist views are occasionally presented. My friend Dave Mandl, for example, has at times argued for a less-anarchocapitalist view (but I think our views are actually fairly similar‚Ä¶he just has a different language and thinks there‚Äôs more of a difference than their actually is‚Äìinsert smiley here).And several Cypherpunks who‚Äôve thought about the issues of crypto anarchy have been disturbed by the conclusions that seem inevitable (markets for corporate information, assassianation made more liquid, data havens, espionage made much easier, and other such implications to be explored later in this section).So, take this section with these caveats.And some of the things I thing are inevitable, and in many cases positive, will be repugnant to some. The end of welfare, the end of subsidies of inner city breeders, for example. The smashing of the national security state through digital espionage, information markets, and selective assassinations are not things that everyone will take comfort in. Some may even call it illegal, seditious, and dangerous. So be it.16.3.3. ‚ÄúWhat are the Ideologies of Cyperpunks?‚ÄùI mentioned this in an earlier section, but now that I‚Äôm discussing ‚Äúcrypto anarchy‚Äù in detail it‚Äôs good to recap some points about the ideology of Cypherpunks.    an area fraught with dangers, as many Cypherpunks have differing views of what‚Äôs importantTwo main foci for Cypherpunks:    Personal privacy in an increasingly watchful societyUndermining of states and governmentsOf those who speak up, most seem to lean toward the libertarian position, often explicitly so (libertarians often are to be found on the Internet, so this correlation is not surprising)Socialists and Communitarians    Should speak up more than they have. Dave Mandl is the only one I can recall who‚Äôs given a coherent summary of his views.My Personal Outlook on Laws and Ideology:    (Obviously also scattered thoughout this document.)Non-coercion Principle        avoid initiation of physical aggression‚Äúto each his own‚Äù (a ‚Äúneo-Calvinist‚Äù perspective of letting each person pick his path, and not interfering)I support no law which can easily be circumvented. (Traffic laws are a counterexample‚Ä¶I generally agree with basic traffic laws‚Ä¶.)And I support no law I would not personally be willing to enforce and punish. Murder, rape, theft, etc, but not ‚Äúvictimless crimes, ‚Äú not drug laws, and not 99.9998% of the laws on the books.Crypto anarchy is in a sense a throwback to the pre-state days of individual choice about which laws to follow. The community exerted  a strong force.With strong crypto (‚Äúfortress crypto,‚Äù in law enforcement terms), only an intrusive police state can stop people from accessing ‚Äúillegal‚Äù sites, from communicating with others, from using ‚Äúunapproved‚Äù services, and so on. To pick one example, the ‚Äúcredit data haven‚Äù that keeps any and all financial records‚Äìrent problems from 1975, bankruptcy proceedings from 1983, divorce settlements, results from private investigators, etc. In the U.S., many such records are ‚Äúunusable‚Äù: can‚Äôt use credit data older than 7 years (under the ‚ÄúFair Credit Reporting Act‚Äù), PI data, etc. But if I am thinking about lending Joe Blow some money, how the hell can I be told I can‚Äôt ‚Äúconsider‚Äù the fact that he declared bankruptcy in 1980, ran out on his debts in Haiti in 1989, and is being sued for all his assets by two ex-wives? The answer is simple: any law which says I am not allowed to take into account information which comes my way is flawed and should be bypassed. Dialing in to a credit haven in Belize is one approach‚Äìexcept wiretaps might still get me caught. Cyberspace allows much more convenient and secure bypasses of these laws.(For those of you who think such bypasses of laws are immoral, tough. Strong crypto allows this. Get used to it.)16.3.4. Early history of crypto anarchy1987-8, AMIX, Salin, Manifesto    discussed crypto implications with Phil Salin and Gayle Pergamit, in December of 1987with a larger group, including Marc Stiegler, Dave Ross, Jim Bennett, Phil Salin, etc., in June 1988.released ‚ÄúThe Crypto Anarchist Manifesto‚Äù in August 1988.Fen LaBalme had ‚ÄúGuerillan Information Net‚Äù (GIN), which he and I discussed in 1988 at the Hackers Conference‚ÄúFrom Crossbows to Cryptography,‚Äù 1987?    made similar points, but some important differencesTAZ also being written at this time16.4.

Unchanged since it‚Äôs writing in mid-1988, except for my e-   mail address.There are some changes I‚Äôd make, but‚Ä¶It was written quickly, and in a style to deliberately mimic what I remembered of the ‚ÄúCommunist Manifesto.‚Äù (for ironic reasons)Still., I‚Äôm proud that more than six years ago I correctly saw some major points which Cypherpunks have helped to make happen: remailers, anonymous communictation, reputation- based systems, etc.For history‚Äôs sake, here it is:16.4.2.The Crypto Anarchist ManifestoTimothy  C.  May   tcmay@netcom.comA specter is haunting the modern world, the specter of crypto   anarchy.Computer technology is on the verge of providing the ability   for individuals and groups to communicate and interact with   each other in a totally anonymous manner. Two persons may   exchange messages, conduct business, and negotiate electronic   contracts without ever knowing the True Name, or legal   identity, of the other. Interactions over networks will be   untraceable, via extensive re-routing of encrypted packets   and tamper-proof boxes which implement cryptographic   protocols with nearly perfect assurance against any   tampering. Reputations will be of central importance, far   more important in dealings than even the credit ratings of   today. These developments will alter completely the nature of   government regulation, the ability to tax and control   economic interactions, the ability to keep information   secret, and will even alter the nature of trust and   reputation.The technology for this revolution‚Äìand it surely will be   both a social and economic revolution‚Äìhas existed in theory   for the past decade. The methods are based upon public-key   encryption, zero-knowledge interactive proof systems, and   various software protocols for interaction, authentication,   and verification. The focus has until now been on academic   conferences in Europe and the U.S., conferences monitored   closely by the National Security Agency. But only recently   have computer networks and  personal computers attained   sufficient speed to make the ideas practically realizable.   And the next ten years will bring enough additional speed to   make the ideas economically feasible and essentially   unstoppable. High-speed networks, ISDN, tamper-proof boxes,   smart cards, satellites,  Ku-band transmitters, multi-MIPS   personal computers, and encryption chips now under   development will be some of the enabling technologies.The State will of course try to slow or halt the spread of   this technology, citing national security concerns, use of   the technology by drug dealers and tax evaders, and fears of   societal disintegration. Many of these concerns will be   valid; crypto anarchy will allow national secrets to be trade   freely and will allow illicit and stolen materials to be   traded. An anonymous computerized market will even make   possible abhorrent markets for assassinations and extortion.   Various criminal and foreign elements will be active users of   CryptoNet. But this will not halt the spread of crypto   anarchy.Just as the technology of printing altered and reduced the   power of medieval guilds and the social power structure, so   too will cryptologic methods fundamentally alter the nature   of corporations   and of government interference in economic transactions.   Combined with emerging information markets, crypto anarchy   will create a liquid market for any and all material which   can be put into words and pictures. And just as a seemingly   minor invention like barbed wire made possible the fencing-   off of vast ranches and farms, thus altering forever the   concepts of land and property rights in the frontier West, so   too will the seemingly minor discovery out of an   arcane branch of mathematics come to be the wire clippers   which dismantle the barbed wire around intellectual property.Arise, you have nothing to lose but your barbed wire fences!16.5. Changes are Coming16.5.1. Technology is dramatically altering the nature of   governments.It may sound like newage trendiness, but strong crypto is ‚Äútechnological empowerment.‚Äù It literally gives power to individuals. Like Sam Colt, it makes them equal.‚ÄúPolitics has never given anyone lasting freedom, and it never will. Anything gained through politics will be lost again as soon as the society feels threatened. If most Americans have never been oppressed by the government (aside from an annual mugging) it is because most of them have never done anything to threaten the government‚Äôs interests.‚Äù [Mike Ingle, 1994-01-01]Thesis: Strong crypto is a good thing    tool against governments of all flavors, left and rightreligious freedompersonal choice16.5.2.

They put together a peace agreement that in part proclaimed limits to government,  in part acknowledged inherent limits to what was proper for governments to do  and in part guaranteed that the government would not go beyond what it was proper for government to do, that the majority could not do as it pleased with the minority, that not any act of power was a law, that law was not merely whatever the government willed.They did not agree on a constitution but agreed to respect an unwritten constitution that already existed in some sense.A similar arrangement underlies the American constitution (now defunct) and the English declaration of right (also defunct)The problem with such formal peace agreements is that they can only be put together after government has substantially collapsed.  Some of us wish to try other possibilities in the event of collapse.The American constitution collapsed because of the rise of nominalist theories ‚ÄúThe constitution says whatever the courts say that it says.‚Äù [James Donald, 1994-08-31]War on Drugs, conspiracy charges, random searches, emergency preparedness orders (Operation Vampire Killer, Operation Night Train, REX-84).

Thus, advertisers can‚Äôt make false or misleading claims, and can‚Äôt advertise dangerous or otherwise unapproved items. And I can‚Äôt make medical diagnoses, or give structural and geological advice, and so on‚Ä¶a dozen good examples. But these restrictions emasculate free speech, leaving only banal expression of appropriately-hedged ‚Äúpersonal opinions‚Äù as the free speech that is allowed‚Ä¶and even that is ofen subject to crazy lawsuits and threats of legal action.16.7. The Nature of Anarchies16.7.1. Anarchy doesn‚Äôt mean chaos and killingAs J. Bruce Dawson put it in a review of Linux in the September, 1994 ‚ÄúByte,‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs anarchy at its best.‚ÄùIronically, crypto anarchy does admit the possibility (and hence probablility) of more contract killings as an ultimate enforcement mechanism for contracts otherwise unenforceable.    which is what is occurring in drug and other crime situaions: the parties cannot go to the police or courts for righting of wrongs, so they need to have the ultimate threat of death to enforce deals. It makes good sense from a reputation/game theory point of view.16.7.2. Leftists can be anarchists, tooIn fact, this tends to be the popular interpretation of anarchy. (Besides the bomb-throwing, anti-Tsar anarchists of the 19th century, and the bomb-throwing anarchists of the U.S. early this century.)‚ÄúTemporary Autonomous Zones‚Äù (TAZ)    Hakim Bey (pseudonym for    )Mondo 2000, books, (check with Dave Mandl, who helps to publish them)16.7.3. Anarchic developmentMarkets and emergent behaviors vs. planned development    principles of locality come into play (the local players know what they want and how much they‚Äôll pay for it)central planners have ‚Äútop-down‚Äù outlooksKevin Kelley‚Äôs ‚ÄúOut of Control‚Äù (1994). Also, David Friedman‚Äôs ‚ÄúTechnologies of Freedom.‚ÄùAn example I heard about recently was Carroll College, in Wisconsin. Instead of building pathways and sidewalks across the newly-constructed grounds, the ground was left bare. After some time, the ‚Äúemergent pathways‚Äù chosen by students and faculty were then turned into paved pathways, neatly solving the problem of people not using the ‚Äúplanned‚Äù pathways. I submit that much of life works this way. So does the Net (the ‚Äúinformation footpaths‚Äù?).anarchies are much more common than most people think‚Ä¶personal relationships, choices in life, etc.16.7.4. The world financial system is a good example: beyond the   reach of any single government, even the U.S. New World   Order, money moves and flows as doubts and concerns appear.   Statist governments are powerless to stop the devaluation of   their currencies as investors move their assets (even slight   moves can have large marginal effects).‚Äúanarchy‚Äù is not a term most would apply, but it‚Äôs an anarchy in the sense of there being no rulers (‚Äúan  arch‚Äù), no central command structure.16.8. The Nature of Crypto Anarchy16.8.1. ‚ÄúWhat is Crypto Anarchy?‚Äù‚ÄúWhy the name?‚Äù    a partial pun on several things‚Äù        ‚Äúcrypto,‚Äù meaning ‚Äúhidden,‚Äù as used in the term ‚Äúcrypto fascist‚Äù (Gore Vidal called William F. Buckley this)‚Äúcrypto anarchy‚Äù meaning the anarchy will be hidden, not necessarily visibleand of course cryptology is centrally invovledMotivation    Vernor Vinge‚Äôs ‚ÄúTrue Names‚ÄùAyn Rand was one of the prime motivators of crypto anarchy. What she wanted to do with material technology (mirrors over Galt‚Äôs Gulch) is much more easily done with mathematical technology.16.8.2. ‚ÄúAnarchy turns people off‚Ä¶why not a more palatable name?‚Äùpeople don‚Äôt understand the term; if people understood the term, it might be more acceptablesome have suggested I call it ‚Äúdigital liberty‚Äù or somesuch, but I prefer to stick with the historical term16.8.3. Voluntary interactions involve Schelling points, mutually-   agreed upon points of agreement16.8.4. Crypto anarchy as an ideology rather than as a plan.Without false modesty, I think crypto anarchy is one of the few real contributions to ideology in recent memory. The notion of individuals becoming independent of states by bypassing ordinary channels of control is a new one. While there have been hints of this in the cyberpunk genre of writing, and related areas (the works of Vinge especially), the traditional libertarian and anarchist movements have mostly been oblivious to the ramifications of strong crypto.Interestingly, David Friedman, son of Milton and author of ‚ÄúThe Machinery of Freedom,‚Äù became a convert to the ideas. At least enough so as to give a talk in Los Angeles entitles ‚ÄúCrypto Anarchy and the State.‚ÄùConventional political ideology has failed to realize the huge changes coming over the next several decades. Focussing on unwinnable battles at the ballot box, they fritter away their energies; they join the political process, but they have nothing to ‚Äúdeal‚Äù with, so they lose. The average American actually wants to pick the pockets of his neighbors (to pay for ‚Äúfree‚Äù health care, to stop companies from laying-off unneeded workers, to bring more pork back to the local enonomy), so the average voter is highly unlikely to ever vote for a prinicpled Libertarian candidate.Fortunately, how people vote has little effect on certain ‚Äúground truths‚Äù that emerge out of new technologies and new economic developments.16.9. Uses of Crypto Anarchy16.9.1. Markets unfettered by local laws (digital black markets, at   least for items that can be moved through cyberspace)16.9.2. Espionage16.10. The Implications-Negative and Positive-of Crypto Anarchy16.10.1. ‚ÄúWhat are some implications of crypto anarchy?‚ÄùA return to contracts    whiners can‚Äôt go outside contracts and complainrelates to: workers, terms of employment, actions, hurt feelingswith untraceable communication, virtual networks‚Ä¶.Espionage    Spying is already changing dramatically.

Nothing short of a totalitarian police state (and probably not even that, given the spread of strong crypto) can stop these trends.-Bypassing sanctions and boycotts    Just because Bill Clinton doesn‚Äôt like the rulers of Haiti is no reason for me to honor his ‚Äúsanctions‚ÄùIndividual choice, made possible by strong crypto (untraceable transactions, pseudonyms, black markets)Information Markets and Data Havens    medicalscientificcorporate knowledgedossierscredit reports        without the absurd rules limiting what people can store on their computers (e.g., if Alice keeps records going back more than 7 years, blah blah, can be thrown in jail for violating the ‚ÄúFair Credit Reporting Act‚Äù)bypassing such lawstrue, governments can attempt to force disclosure of ‚Äúreasons‚Äù for all decisions (a popular trend, where even one‚Äôs maid cannot be dismissed without the ‚Äúreasons‚Äù being called into question!); this means that anyone accessing such offshore (or in cyberspace‚Ä¶same difference) data bases must find some acceptable reason for the actions they take‚Ä¶shouldn‚Äôt be too hard(as with so many of these ideas, the beauty is that the using of such services is voluntary‚Ä¶.)Consulting    increased liquidity of informationillegal transactions        untraceability and digital money means many ‚Äúdark‚Äù possibilities            markets for assassinationsstolen propertycopyright infringementEspionage    information markets (a la AMIX)‚Äúdigital dead drops‚ÄùOffshore accountsMoney-launderingMarkets for Assassinations    This is one of the more disturbing implications of crypto anarchy.

Positive and negative implications, of course.The fact is, some people simply need killing. Shocking as that may sound to many, surely everyone would agree that Hitler deserved killing. The ‚Äúrule of law‚Äù sounds noble, but when despicable people control the law, other measures are called for.Personally, I hold that anyone who threatens what I think of as basic rights may need killing. I am held back by the repercussions, the dangers. With liquid markets for liquidations, things may change dramatically.16.10.2. The Negative Side of Crypto AnarchyComment:    There are some very real negative implications; outweighed on the whole by the benefits. After all, free speech has negatives. Poronography has negatives.

Will I be sad if anonymous methods allow untraceable markets for assassinations? It depends. In many cases, people deserve death‚Äìthose who have escaped justice, those who have broken solemn commitments, etc. Gun grabbing politicians, for example should be killed out of hand. Anonymous rodent removal services will be a tool of liberty. The BATF agents who murdered Randy Weaver‚Äôs wife and son should be shot. If the courts won‚Äôt do it, a market for hits will do it.(Imagine for a moment an ‚Äúanonymous fund‚Äù to collect the money for such a hit. Interesting possibilities.)‚ÄúCrypto Star Chambers,‚Äù or what might be called ‚Äúdigilantes,‚Äù may be formed on-line, and untraceably, to mete out justice to those let off on technicalities. Not altogether a bad thing.16.10.5. on interference in business as justified by ‚Äúsociety supports   you‚Äù arguments (and ‚Äúopting out)It has been traditionally argued that society/government has a right to regulate businesses, impose rules of behavior, etc., for a couple of reasons:    ‚Äúto promote the general welfare‚Äù (a nebulous reason)because government builds the infrastructure that makes business possible        the roads, transportation systems, etc. (actually, most are privately built‚Ä¶only the roads and canal are publically built, and they certainly don‚Äôt have to be)the police forces, courts, enforcement of contracts, disputes, etc.protection from foreign countries, tariff negotiations, etc., even to the physical protection against invading countriesBut with crypto anarchy, all of these reasons vanish!    society isn‚Äôt ‚Äúenabling‚Äù the business being transacted (after all, the parties don‚Äôt even necessarily know what countries the other is in!)no national or local courts are being used, so this set of reasons goes out the windowno threat of invasion‚Ä¶or if there is, it isn‚Äôt something governments can addressSo, in addition to the basic unenforceability of outlawing crypto anarchy‚Äìshort of outlawing encryption‚Äìthere is also no viable argument for having governments interfere on these traditional grounds.    (The reasons for them to interfere based on fears for their own future and fears about unsavory and abominable markets being developed (body parts, assassinations, trade secrets, tax evasion, etc.) are of course still ‚Äúvalid,‚Äù viewed from their perspective, but the other reasons just aren‚Äôt.)16.11. Ethics and Morality of Crypto Anarchy16.11.1. ‚ÄúHow do you square these ideas with democracy?‚ÄùI don‚Äôt; democracy has run amok, fulfilling de Tocqueville‚Äôs prediction that American democracy would last only until Americans discovered they could pick the pockets of their neighbors at the ballot boxlittle chance of changing public opinion, of educating themcrypto anarchy is a movement of individual opting out, not of mass change and political action16.11.2. ‚ÄúIs there a moral responsibility to ensure that the overall   effects of crypto anarchy are more favorable than unfavorable   before promoting it?‚ÄùI don‚Äôt think so, any more than Thomas Jefferson should have analyzed the future implications of freedom before pushing it so strongly.All decisions have implications. Some even cost lives. By not becoming a doctor working in Sub-Saharan Africa, have I ‚Äúkilled thousands‚Äù? Certainly I might have saved the lives of thousands of villagers. But I did not kill them just because I chose not to be a doctor. Likewise, by giving money to starving peasants in Bangladesh, lives could undeniably be ‚Äúsaved.‚Äù But not giving the money does not murder them.But such actions of omission are not the same, in my mind, as acts of comission. My freedom, via crypto anarchy, is not an act of force in and of itself.Developing an idea is not the same as aggression.Crypto anarchy is about personal withdrawal from the system, the ‚Äútechnologies of disconnection,‚Äù in Kevin Kelly‚Äôs words.16.11.3. ‚ÄúShould individuals have the power to decide what they will   reveal to others, and to authorities?‚ÄùFor many or even most of us, this has an easy answer, and is axiomatically true. But others have doubts, and more people may have doubts as some easily anticipated develpoments occur.(For example, pedophiles using the much-feared ‚Äúfortress crypto,‚Äù terrorists communicating in unbreakable codes, tza evaders, etc. Lots of examples.)But because some people use crypto to do putatively evil things, should basic rights be given up? Closed doors can hide criminal acts, but we don‚Äôt ban closed doors.16.11.4. ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt there some dangers and risks to letting people pick   and choose their moralities?‚Äù(Related to questions about group consensus, actions of the state vs. actions of the individual, and the ‚Äúherd.)Indeed, there are dangers and risks. In the privacy of his home, my neighbor might be operating a torture dungeon for young children he captures. But absent real evidence of this, most nations have not sanctioned the random searches of private dwellings (not even in the U.S.S.R., so far as I know).16.11.5. ‚ÄúAs a member of a hated minority (crypto anarchists) I‚Äôd   rather take my chances on an open market than risk official   discrimination by the state‚Ä¶..Mercifully, the technology we   are developing will allow everyone who cares to to decline to   participate in this coercive allocation of power.‚Äù [Duncan   Frissell, 1994-09-08]16.11.6. ‚ÄúAre there technologies which should be ‚Äústopped‚Äù even before   they are deployed?‚ÄùPandora‚Äôs Box, ‚Äúthings Man was not meant to know,‚Äù etc.It used to be that my answer was mostly a clear ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù with nuclear and biological weapons as the only clear exception. But recent events involving key escrow have caused me to rethink things.Imagine a company that‚Äôs developing home surveillance cameras‚Ä¶perhaps for burglar prevention, child safety, etc. Parents can monitor Junior on ceiling-mounted cameras that can‚Äôt easily be tampered with or disconnected, without sending out alarms. All well and good.Now imagine that hooks are put into these camera systems to send the captured images to a central office. Again, not necessarily a bad idea‚Äìvacationers may want their security company to monitor their houses, etc.The danger is that a repressive government could make the process mandatory‚Ä¶.how else to catch sexual deviates, child molestors, marijuana growers, counterfeiters, and the like?Sound implausible, unacceptable, right? Well, key escrow is a form of this.The Danger. That OS vendors will put these SKE systems in place without adequate protections against key escrow being made mandatory at some future date.16.11.7. ‚ÄúWon‚Äôt crypto anarchy allow some people to do bad things?‚ÄùSure, so what else is new? Private rooms allows plotters to plot their plots. Etc.Not to sound too glib, but most of the things we think of as basic rights allow various illegal, distasteful, or crummy things to go on. Part of the bargain we make.‚ÄúOf course you could prevent contract killings by requiring everyone to carry government ‚Äúescrowed‚Äù tape recordings to record all their conversations and requiring them to keep a diary at all times alibing their all their activities. This would also make it much easier to stamp out child pornography, plutonium smuggling, and social discrimination against the politically correct.‚Äù [James Donald, 1994-09- 09]16.12. Practical Problems with Crypto Anarchy16.12.1. ‚ÄúWhat if ‚Äúbad guys‚Äù use unbreakable crypto?‚ÄùWhat if potential criminals are allowed to have locks on their doors? What if potential rapists can buy pornography? What if‚Ä¶.These are all straw men used in varous forms throughout history by tyrants to control their populations. The ‚Äúsheepocracies‚Äù of the modern so-called democratic era are voting away their former freedoms in favor of cradle to grave safety and security.The latest tack is to propose limits on privacy to help catch criminals, pedophile, terrorists, and father rapers. God help us if this comes to pass. But Cypherpunks don‚Äôt wait for God, they write code!16.12.2. Dealing with the ‚ÄúAbhorrent Markets‚Äùsuch as markets for assassinations and extortionPossibilities:    physical protection, physical capure        make it risky(on the other hand, sniping is easy)‚Äúflooding‚Äù of offers        ‚Äútake a number‚Äù (meaning: get in line)attacking reputationsI agree that more thought is needed, more thorough analysisSome people have even pointed out the benefits of killing off tens of thousands of the corrupt politicians, narcs, and cops which have implemented fascist, collectivist policies for so long. Assassination markets may make this much more practical.16.12.3. ‚ÄúHow is fraud dealt with in crypto anarchy?‚ÄùWhen the perpetrators can‚Äôt even be identified.One of the most interesting problems.First, reputations matter. Repeat business is not assured. It is always best to not have too much at stake in any single transaction.16.12.4. ‚ÄúHow do we know that crypto anarchy will work? How do we know   that it won‚Äôt plunge the world into barbarism, nuclear war,   and terror?‚ÄùWe don‚Äôt know, of course. We never can.However, things are already pretty bad. Look at Bosnia, Ruanda, and a hundred other hellholes and flashpoints around the world. Look at the nuclear arsenals of the superpowers, and look at who starts the wars. In nearly all cases, statism is to blame. States have killed a hundred million or more people in this century alone‚Äìthink of Hitler, Stalin, Mao, and Pol Pot‚Äìthrough forced starvation of entire provinces, liquidation of the peasantry, killing of intellectuals, and mass exterminations of religious and ethnic groups. It‚Äôs hard to imagine crypto anarchy causing anything that bad!Crypto anarchy is a cyberspatially-mediated personal course of action; by itself it involves no actions such as terrorism or nuclear blackmail. One could just as easily ask, ‚ÄúWill freedom lead to nuclear blackmail, weapons trading, and pedophilia?‚Äù The answer is the same: maybe, but so what?16.12.5. It is true that crypto anarchy is not for everyone. Some will   be too incompetent to prepare to protect themselves, and will   want a protector. Others will have poor business sense.16.12.6. ‚ÄúBut what will happen to the poor people and those on welfare   if crypto anarchy really succeeds?‚Äù‚ÄúSo?‚ÄùMany of us would see this as a good thing. Not just for Calvinist-Randite reasons, but also because it would break the cycle of dependency which has actually made things worse for the underclass in America (at least). See Charles Murray‚Äôs ‚ÄúLosing Ground‚Äù for more on this.And remember that a collapse of the tax system will mean more money left in the hands of former taxpayers, and hence more left over for true charity (for those who truly cannot help themselves).16.13. Black Markets16.13.1. ‚ÄúWhy would anyone use black markets?‚Äùwhen the advantages of doing so outweigh the disadvantages    including the chance of getting caught and the consequences(As the chances decline, this suggests a rise in punishment severity)businesses will tend to shy away from illegal markets, unless‚Ä¶Anonymous markets for medical products    to reduce liability, local ethical and religious lawsExample: Live AIDS vaccine‚Ä¶considered too risky for any company to introduce, due to inability to get binding waivers of liability (even for ‚Äúfully informed‚Äù patients who face likely death)markets in body parts‚Ä¶16.13.2. Crypto anarchy opens up some exciting possibilities for collusion in financial deals, for insider trading, etc.I‚Äôm not claiming that this will mean instant riches, as markets are fairly efficient () and ‚Äúinsiders‚Äù often don‚Äôt do well in the market. ( Some argue that relaxing laws against insider trading will make for an even fairer market‚Ä¶I agree with this.)What I am claiming is the SEC and FinCEN computers will be working overtime to try to keep up with the new possibilities crypto anarchy opens up. Untraceable cash, as in offshore bank accounts that one can send anonymous trading instructions to (or for), means insider trading simply can‚Äôt be stopped‚Ä¶all that happens is that insiders see their bank accounts increase (to the extent they win because of the insider trading‚Ä¶like I said, a debatable point).Price signalling, a la the airline case of a few years back (which, you won‚Äôt be surprised to hear, I have no problems with), will be easier. Untraceable communications, virtual meetings, etc.16.13.3.

Money Laundering and Tax Avoidance16.14.1. Hopelessness of controlling money launderingI see all this rise in moneylaundering as an incredibly hopeful trend, one that will mesh nicely with the use of cryptography    why should export of currency be limited?what‚Äôs wrong with tax evasion, anyway?corrupting, affects all transactionsvast amounts of money flowing2000 banks in Russia, mostly money-launderingpeople and countries are so starved for hard currency that most banks outside the U.S. will happily take this money    no natural resources in many of these countrieshopeless to controlbeing presented as ‚Äúprofits vs. principals,‚Äù but I think this is grossly misguidedJeffery Robinson, ‚ÄúThe Landrymen,‚Äù interviewed on CNN, 6-24- 94    ‚Äúcloser to anarchy‚Äù (yeah!)hopeless to controldozens of new countries, starved for hard currency, have autonomy to set banking policies (and most European countries turn a blind eye toward most of the anti- laundering provisions)16.14.2. Taxes and Cryptobesides avoidance, there are also issues of tax records, sales tax, receipts, etc.this is another reason government may demand access to cyberspace:    to ensure compliance, a la a tamper-resistant cash registerto avoid under-the-table transactionsbribery, side payments, etc.Note: It is unlikely that such access to records would stop all fraud or tax evasion. I‚Äôm just citing reasons for them to try to have access.I have never claimed the tax system will collapse totally, or overnight, or without a fight.

Capital Flight‚ÄúThe important issue for Cypherpunks is how we should respond to this seemingly inevitable increased mobility of capital.  Does it pose a threat to privacy?  If so, let‚Äôs write code to thwart the threat.  Does it offer us any tools we can use to fight the efforts of nation-states to take away our privacy?  If so, let‚Äôs write code to take advantage of those tools.‚Äù [ Sandy Sandfort, Decline and Fall, 1994‚Äì06-19]16.14.4.

Tax Evasion Schemesunreported income, e.g., banks like the BCCI obviously did not report what they or their customers were doing to the various tax authorities (or anyone else)deferred income, via the kind of trust funds discussed here (wherein payment is deferred and some kind of trust is used to pay smaller amounts per year)Asset-Hiding, Illegal Payments, Bribes, and Tax Evasion Funds Can Be Protected in a ‚ÄúRetirement Fund‚Äù    e.g., a politician or information thief-perhaps an Intel employee who sells something for $1M-can buy shares in a crypto-fund that then ensures he is hired by a succession of consulting firms for yearly consulting‚Ä¶or even just placed on a ‚Äúretainer‚Äù of, say, $100K a year        IRS may come to have doubts about such services, but unless the government steps in and demands detailed inspection of actual work done-and even then I think this would be impossible and/or illegal-such arrangements would seem to be foolproof            why can‚Äôt government demand proof of work done?                who judges the value of an employee?of advice given, of reports generated, or of the value of having a consultant ‚Äúon retainer‚Äù?such interference would devastate many vested intereststax and other advantages of these ‚Äúcrypto annuities‚Äù            tax only paid on the yearly income, not on the lump sumauthorities are not alerted to the sudden receipt of a lump sum (an ex-intelligence official who receives a payement of $1 M will come under suspicion, exactly as would a politician)and a lump sum payment might well arouse suspicions and be considered evidence of some criminal activitythe original lump sum is protected from confiscation by governments, by consideration in alimony or bankruptcy cases, etc.                such ‚Äúconsulting annuities‚Äù may be purchased just so as to insulate earnings from alimony, bankruptcy, etc.as usual, I‚Äôm not defending these steps as moral or as good for the business climate of the world, just as inevitable consequences of many current trends and technical developmentsthe ‚Äúshell game‚Äù is used to protect the funds        with periodic withdrawals or transfersnote that this whole scheme can pretty much be done by attorneys and agents today, though they may be subpoenaed or otherwise encouraged to blabit may not even be illegal for a consultant to take his fee over a period of many years        the IRS may claim the ‚Äúdiscounted present value‚Äù as a lump sum, but other folks already do things like this            royalty streams (and nobody claims an author must agree with the IRS to some estimated value of this stream)percentages of the gross (and the like)engineers and other professionals are often kept on payrolls not so much for their instantaneous achievements as for their past and projected achievements-are we to treat future accomplishments in a lump sum way?IRS and others may try to inspect the terms of the employment or consulting agreement, but these seems too invasive and cumbersome            it makes the government a third party in all negotiations, requiring agents to be present in all talks or at least to read and understand all paperwork                and even then, there could be claims that the government didn‚Äôt follow the dealsnot enough time or manpower to handle all these thingsand the invasion of privacy is extreme!Scenario: the Fincen-type agencies may deal with the growing threat of CA-type systems (and encryption in general) by involving the government in ostensibly private deals                analogous to the sales tax and bookkeeping arrangements (where gov‚Äôt. is a third party to all transactions)or EEOC, race and sex discimination cases                    will transcripts and recordings of all job interviews come to be required?‚Äúlaying track‚ÄùOSHA, pollution, etc.software copying laws (more to the point): government seems to have the power to enter a business to see if illegal copies are in use; this may first require a warrant                    how long before various kinds of software are banned?                        with the argument being that some kinds of software are analogous to lockpicks and other banned burglar tools‚Äúused to facillitate the illegal copying of protected software‚Äùthe threat of encryption for national security as well as for the money-laundering and illegal payments possibilities may cause the government to place restrictions on the use of crypto software for anything except approved uses (external e-mail, etc.)                        and even these uses can of course be subvertedand crypto techniques are not actually necessary: lawyers and other discreet agents will sufficefurthermore, corporations have a fair amount of lattitude in setting retirement policies and benefits, and so the methods I‚Äôve described to shelter current income may become more widespread        though there may be some proviso that if benefits exceeed some percentage of yearly income, factoring in years on the job, that these benefits are taxed in some punative way            e.g.., a corporation that pays $100K a year to a critical technical person for a year of work and then pays him $60K a year for the next ten years could reasonably be believed to have set up a system to help him avoid taxes on a large lump sum paymentAsset-hiding, to avoid seizure in bankruptcies, lawsuits        e.g., funds placed in accounts which are secret, or in systems/schemes over which the asset-hider has control of some kind (voting, consulting, etc.)            this is obscure: what I‚Äôm thinking of is some kind of deal in which Albert is hired by Bob as an ‚Äúadvisor‚Äù on financial matters: but Bob‚Äôs money comes from Albert and so the quid pro quo is that Bob will take Albert‚Äôs advice‚Ä¶.hence the effective laundering and protectionMay also be used to create ‚Äúmulti-tier‚Äù currency systems, e.g., where reported transactions are some fraction of actuals        suppose we agree to deal at some artificially low value: electricians and plumbers may barter with each other at a reported $5 an hour, while using underground accounts to actually trade at more realistic levelsgovernment (IRS) has laws about ‚Äúfair value‚Äù-but how could these laws be enforced for such intangibles as software?            if I sell a software program for $5000, can the government declare this to be over or underpriced?likewise, if a plumber charges $5 an hour, can the government, suspecting tax evasion, force him to charge more?once again, the nature of taxation in our increasingly many-dimensioned economy seems to necessitate major invasions of privacy16.14.7. ‚ÄúDenationalization of Money‚Äùas with the old SF standby of ‚Äúcredits‚Äùcf. the books on denationalization of money, and the idea of competing currencies    digital cash can be denominated in these various currencies, so it makes the idea of competing currencies more practicalto some extent, it already existsthe hard money advocates (gold bugs) are losing their faith, as they see money moving around and never really landing in any ‚Äúhard‚Äù form    of course, it is essential that governments and groups not have the ability to print more moneyinternational networks will probably denominate transactions in whatever currencies are the most stable and least inflationary (or least unpredictably inflationary)16.15.

There‚Äôs material on this scattered around   this document, material I‚Äôll collect together when I get a   chance.16.16.2. This topic came up several times on then Extropians mailing   list, where David Friedman (author of ‚ÄúThe Machinery of   Freedom‚Äù and son of Nobel Prize winner Milton Friedman) and   Robin Hanson debated this with me.16.16.3. Doug Cutrell summarized the concerns of many when he wrote:‚Äú‚Ä¶the availability of truly secure anonymity, strong encryption, and untraceable digital cash could allow contract killing to be an openly conducted business.  For example, an anonymous news post announces a public key which is to be used to encode a contract kill order, along with a digital cash payment.  The person placing the contract need only anonymously place the encrypted message in alt.test.  Perhaps it is even possible to make it impossible to tell that the message was encrypted with the contract killer‚Äôs public key (the killer would have to attempt decryption of all similarly encoded messages on alt.test, but that might be quite feasible).  Thus it could be completely risk free for anyone to place a contract on anyone else.‚Äù [Doug Cutrell, 1994-09-09]16.16.4. Abhorrent marketscontract killingscan collect money anonymously to have someone whacked‚Ä¶nearly anyone who is controversial can generate enough ‚Äúcontributions‚Äùkidnapping, extortion16.16.5.

Persistent Institutions16.17.1. Strong crypto makes possible the creation of institutions   which can persist for very long periods of time, perhaps for   centuries.such institutions already exist: churches (Catholics of several orders), universities, etc.16.17.2. all of these ‚Äúpersistent‚Äù services (digital banks, escrow   services, reputation servers, etc.) require much better   protections against service outages, seizures by governments,   natural disasters, and even financial collapse than do most   existing computer services-an opportunity for offshore escrow-   like servicesto maintain a distributed database, with unconditional privacy, etc.again, it is imperative that escrow companies require all material placed in it to be encrypted    to protect them against lawsuits and claims by authorities (that they stole information, that they censored material, that they are an espionage conduit, etc.)16.17.3. Escrow Services‚ÄúDigital Escrow‚Äù accounts for mutually suspicious parties, especially in illegal transactions    drug deals, information brokering, inside information, etc.But why will the escrow entity be trusted?        reputations            their business is being a reliable escrow holder, not it destroying their reputation for a bribe or a threatanonymity means the escrow company won‚Äôt know who it‚Äôs ‚Äúburning,‚Äù should it try to do so            they never know when they themselves are being tested by some serviceand potential bribers will not know who to contact, although mail could be addressed to the escrow company easily enoughlike bonding agencieskey is that these entities stand to gain very little by stealing from their customers, and much to lose (hinges on ratio of any single transaction to size of total market)useful for black markets and illegal transactions (a reliable third party that both sides can trust, albeit not completely)16.17.4. Reputation-Based SystemsCredit Rating Services that are Immune from Meddling and Lawsuits    with digital pseudonyms, true credit rating data bases can be developed        with none of the ‚Äú5 year expirations‚Äù (I mean, who are you to tell me I must not hold it against a person that records show he‚Äôs declares Chapter 7 every 5 years or so?‚Ä¶such information is information, and cannot be declared illegal, despite the policy issues that are involved)this could probably be done today, using offshore data banks, but then there might develop injunctions against use by Stateside companies            how could this be enforced? stings? entrapment?it may be that credit-granting entities will be forced to use rigid formulas for their decisions, with a complete audit trail available to the applicant                if any ‚Äúdiscretion‚Äù or judgment is allowed, then these extralegal or offshore inputs can be usedrelated to ‚Äúredlining‚Äù and other informal signalling mechanismsremember that Prop. 103 attempted to bypass normal laws of economicsAMIX-like services will offer multiple approaches here        ranging from conventional credit data bases, albeit with lower costs of entry (e.g., a private citizen could launch a ‚Äúbankruptcy filings‚Äù data base, using public records, with no expiration-they‚Äôre just reporting the truth, e.g., that Joe Blow filed for personal bankruptcy in 1987            this gets into some of the strange ideas involving mandatory rewriting of the truth, as when ‚Äúcredit records are expunged‚Äù (expunged from what? from my personal data bases? from records that were public and that I am now selling access to?)there may be arguments that the ‚Äúpublic records‚Äù are copyrighted or otherwise owned by someone and hence cannot be sold                telephone book case (however, the Supremes held that the ‚Äúcreative act‚Äù was the specific arrangement)one ploy may be a Habitat-like system, where some of the records are ‚Äúhistorical‚Äùto offshore data basesBook Reviews, Music Reviews    sometimes with pseudonyms to protect the authors from retaliation or even lawsuits‚ÄúWhat should I buy?‚Äù services, a la Consumer Reports    again, protection from lawsuits16.17.5. Crypto Banks and the ‚ÄúShell Game‚Äù as a Central MetaphorCentral metaphor: the Shell Game    description of conventional shell game (and some allusions to con artists on a street corner-the hand is quicker than the eye)like entering a room filled with safe deposit boxes, with no surveillance and no way to monitor activity in the boxes‚Ä¶.and user can buy new boxes anonymously, transferring contents amongst the boxes        only shutting down the entire system and forcing all the boxes open would do anything-and this would ‚Äúpool‚Äù all of the contents (unless a law was passed saying people could ‚Äúdeclare‚Äù the contents before some day‚Ä¶.)the shell game system can be ‚Äútested‚Äù-by testing services, by suspicious individuals, whatever-at very low cost by dividing some sum amongst many accounts and verifying that the money is still there (by retrieving or cashing them in)        and remember that the accounts are anonymous and are indistinguishable, so that the money cannot be seized without repercussionsthis is of course the way banks and similar reputation- based institutions have always (or mostly) worked        people trusted the banks not to steal their money by verifying over some period of time that their money was not vanishingand by relying upon some common sense ideas of what the bank‚Äôs basic business was (the notion that a bank exists to continue in business and will make more money over some long run period by being trustworthy than it would make in a one-shot ripoff)Numbered accounts    recall that Switzerland has bowed to international pressure and is now limiting (or eliminating) numbered accounts (though other countries are still allowing some form of such accounts, especially Lichtenstein and Luxembourg)with crypto numbers, even more security        ‚Äúyou lose your number, tough‚Äùbut the money must exist in some form at some time?options for the physical form of the money        accounts are shares in a fund that is publicly invested            shares act as ‚Äúvotes‚Äù for the distribution of proceedsdividends are paid to the account (and sent wherever)an abstract, unformed idea: multiple tiers of money, like unequal voting rights of stock‚Ä¶could even be physical deposits            perhaps even manipulated by automatic handling systems (though this is very insecure)the Bennett-Ross proposal for Global Data Services is essentially the early form of this16.17.6. cryonicists will seek ‚Äúcrypto-trusts‚Äù to protect their assetsagain, the ‚Äúcrypto‚Äù part is not really necessary, given trustworthy lawyers and similar systems    but the crypto part-digital money-further automates the system, allowing smaller and more secure transactions (overhead is lower, allowing more dispersions and diffusion)and eliminates the human linkthus protecting better against subpoenas, threats, etc.and to help fund ‚Äúpersistent institutions‚Äù that will fund research and protect them in suspension    they may also place their funds in ‚Äúpolitically correct‚Äù longterm funds-which may or may not exert a postive ifluence in the direction they wish, what with the law of unintended consequences and all oplmany avenues for laundering money for persistent institutions    dummy corporations (or even real corporations)        with longterm consulting arrangements‚Äúshell game‚Äù votingas people begin to believe that they may just possibly be revived at some future time, they will begin to worry about protecting their current assets    recollections of ‚ÄúWhy Call Them Back from Heaven?‚Äù        worries about financial stability, about confiscation of wealth, etc.no longer will ersatz forms of immortality-endowments fo museums, universities, etc.-be as acceptable‚Ä¶people will want the real thingInvestments that may outlive current institutions    purchases of art works (a la Bill Gates, who is in fact a possibel model for this kind of behavior)rights to famous works, with provision for the copyright expirations, etc. (which is why physical possession is preferable)shell games, of course (networks of reputation-based accounts)Jim Bennett reports that Saul Kent is setting up such things in Lichtenstein for Alcor (which is what I suggested to Keith Henson several years ago)16.18.

Technology. Remailers, encryption16.19.6. Contracts and Cryptography‚ÄúHow can contracts be enforced in crypto anarchy situations?‚Äù    A key question, and one which causes many people to question whether crypto anarchy can work at all.First, think of how many situations are already essentially outside the scope of the law‚Ä¶and yet in which something akin to ‚Äúcontracts‚Äù are enforceable, albeit not via the legal process.        friends, relationshipspersonal preferences in food, books, movies, etc.            what ‚Äúrecourse‚Äù does one have in cases where a meal is unsatisfactory? Not going back to the restaurant is usually the best recourse (this is also a hint about the importance of ‚Äúfuture expectation of business‚Äù as a means of dealing with such things).In these cases, the law is not directly involved. In fact, the law is not involved in most human (and nonhuman!) interactions.The Main Approaches:        Reputations.            reputations are important, are not lightly to be regardedRepeat Business.Escrow Services.The ‚Äúright of contract‚Äù (and the duty to adhere to them, to not try to change the contract after the facts) is a crucial building block.    Imagine a society in which contracts are valid. This allows those willing to sign contracts setting limits on malpractice to get cheaper health care, while those who won‚Äôt sign such contracts are free to sue‚Äìbut will of course have to pay more for health care. Nothing is free, and frivolous malpractice lawsuits have increased operating costs. (Recall the ‚Äúpsychic‚Äù who alleged that her psychic powers were lost after a CAT scan. A jury awarded her millions of dollars. Cf. Peter Huber‚Äôs books on liability laws.)Now imagine a society in which it is never clear if a contract is valid, or whether courts will overturn or amend a contract. This distorts the above analysis, and so hospitals, for example, have to build in safety margins and cushions.Crypto can help by creating escrow or bonding accounts held by third parties‚Äìuntraceable to the other parties‚Äìwhich act as bonding agents for completion of contracts.    Such arrangements may not be allowed. For example, a hospital which attempted to deal with such a bonding agency, and which asked customers to also deal with them, could face sanctions.‚ÄúSecured credit cards‚Äù are a current example: a person pays a reserve amount greater than the card limits (maybe 110%). The reason for doing this is not to obtain ‚Äúcredit,‚Äù obviously, but to be able to order items over the phone, or to avoid carrying cash. (The benefit is thus in the channel of commerce).16.19.7. Ostracism, Banishment in Privately Produced LawVoluntary and discretionary electronic communities also admit the easy possibility of banishment or ostracism (group-selected kill files). Of course, enforcement is generally difficult, e.g., there is nothing to stop individuals from continuing to communicate with the ostracized individual using secure methods.    I can imagine schemes in which software key escrow is used, but these seem overly complicated and intrusive.The ability of individuals, and even subgroups, to thwart the ostracism is not at all a bad thing.-‚ÄúIn an on-line world it would be much easier to enforce banishment or selective ostracism than in real life. Filtering agents could look for certificates from accepted enforcement agencies before letting messages through. Each user could have a set of agencies which were compatible with his principles, and another set of ‚Äúoutlaws‚Äù.  You could even end up with the effect of multiple ‚Äúlogical subnets‚Äù of people who communicate with each other but not outside their subnet.  Some nets might respect intellectual property, others not, and so on.‚Äù [Hal Finney, 1994-08-21]16.19.8.

I argue, however, that abstract worlds have always been with us, in the forms of commerce, reputations, friends, etc. And this will continue.Some people have objected to the sometimes over- enthusiastic claims that economies and socities will flourish in computer-mediated cyberspaces. The short form of the objection is: ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt eat cyberspace.‚Äù Meaning, that profits and gains made in cyberspace must be converted to real world profits and gains.In ‚ÄúSnow Crash,‚Äù this was made out to be difficult‚Ä¶Hiro Protagonist was vastly wealthy in the Multiverse, but lived in a cargo container at LAX in the ‚Äúreal world.‚Äù A fine novel, but this idea is screwy.There are many ways to transfer wealth into the ‚Äúreal‚Äù world:    all the various money-laundering schemes        money in offshore accounts, accessible for vacations, visits, etc.phony purchase ordersmy favorite: Cyberspace, Inc. hires one as a ‚Äúconsultant‚Äù (IRS cannot and does not demand proof of work being done, the nature of the work, one‚Äôs qualifications to perform the work, etc‚Ä¶.In fact, many consultants are hired ‚Äúon retainer,‚Äù merely to be available should a need arise.)information-sellinginvestments16.21.7.

I prefer the emphasis on ‚Äúcypherspace.‚Äù‚ÄúIt is worth noting that private ‚Äúdata havens‚Äù of all sorts abound, especially for financial matters, and most are not subject to governmental regulation‚Ä¶.Some banks have research departments that are older and morecomprehensive than credit reporting agencies.  Favored customers can use them for evaluation of private deals‚Ä¶.Large law firms maintain data banks that approach those of banks, and they grow with each case, through additions of private investigators paid for by successive clients‚Ä¶.Security professionals, like Wackenhut and Kroll, also market the fruits of substantial data collections‚Ä¶.To these add those of insurance, bonding, investment, financial firms and the like which help make or break business deals.‚Äù [John Young, 1994-09-07]16.22.2. ‚ÄúCan there be laws about what can be done with data?‚ÄùNormative laws (‚Äúthey shouldn‚Äôt keep such records and hence we‚Äôll outlaw them‚Äù) won‚Äôt work in an era of strong crypto and privacy.

(Same idea as in using offshore or cryptospatial data havens to bypass the nonsense in the ‚ÄúFair Credit Reporting Act‚Äù that outlaws the keeping of certain kinds of facts about credit applicants, such as that they declared bankruptcy 10 years ago or that they left a string of bad debts in Germany in the 1970s, etc.)16.22.3.

Undermining Governments‚ÄìCollapse of the State16.23.1. ‚ÄúIs it legal to advocate the overthrow of governments or the   breaking of laws?‚ÄùAlthough many Cypherpunks are not radicals, many others of us are, and we often advocate ‚Äúcollapse of governments‚Äù and other such things as money laundering schemes, tax evasion, new methods for espionage, information markets, data havens, etc. This rasises obvious concerns about legality.First off, I have to speak mainly of U.S. issues‚Ä¶the laws of Russia or Japan or whatever may be completely different. Sorry for the U.S.-centric focus of this FAQ, but that‚Äôs the way it is. The Net started here, and still is dominantly here, and the laws of the U.S. are being propagated around the world as part of the New World Order and the collapse of the other superpower.Is it legal to advocate the replacement of a government? In the U.S., it‚Äôs the basic political process (though cynics might argue that both parties represent the same governing philosophy). Advocating the violent overthrow of the U.S. government is apparently illegal, though I lack a cite on this.Is it legal to advocate illegal acts in general? Certainly much of free speech is precisely this: arguing for drug use, for boycotts, etc.    The EFF gopher site has this on ‚ÄúAdvocating Lawbreaking, Brandenburg v. Ohio. ‚Äú:        ‚ÄúIn the 1969 case of Brandenburg v. Ohio, the Supreme Court struck down the conviction of a Ku Klux Klan member under a criminal syndicalism law and established a new standard: Speech may not be suppressed or punished unless it is intended to produce ‚Äòimminent lawless action‚Äô and it is ‚Äòlikely to produce such action.‚Äô Otherwise, the First Amendment protects even speech that advocates violence. The Brandenburg test is the law today. ‚Äú16.23.2. Espionage and Subversion of Governments Will be Revolutionized by Strong Crypto(I think they see what we see, too, and this is a motivation for the attempts to limit the use of strong crypto. Besides some of the more conventional reasons.)Digital dead drops will revolutionize espionage    spies and their controllers can communicate securely, relatively quickly, without fear of being watched, their drops compromised, etc.        no more nooks of trees, no more chalk marks on mailboxes to signal a drop to be madethis must be freaking out the intelligence community!        more insights into why the opposition to crypto is so strongCell-Based Systems and Conventional Protection Systems    Cells are a standard way to limit the damage of exposure        the standard is the 3-person cell so common in the early days of Soviet espionage in the U.S.but computer systems may allow new kinds of cells, with more complicated protocols and more securityKeeping files for protection is another standard protection method        and with strong crypto, these files can be kept encrypted and in locations not apparent (e.g., posted on bulletin boards or other such places, with only the key needed at a later time to open them)            a la the ‚Äúbinary files‚Äù idea, wherein encrypted files are widely available for some time before the key is distributed (thus making it very hard for governments to halt the distribution of the raw files)16.23.3. ‚ÄúXth Column‚Äù (X = encrypted)The possible need to use strong cryptography as a tool to fight the state.helping to undermine the state by using whistleblowers and anonymous information markets to leak information    the 63,451 people given false identities in the WitSec program‚Ä¶leak their names, watch them be zapped by vengeful enemies, and watch the government squirmauction off the details of the 1967 Inspector General‚Äôs report on CIA assassinations16.23.4. use of clandestine, cell-based systems may allow a small group to use ‚Äútermite‚Äù methods to undermine a society, to destroy a state that has become too repressive (sounds like the U.S. to me)encrypted systems, anonymous pools, etc., allow truly secure cell-based systems (this is, by the way, one of the concerns many countries have about ‚Äúallowing‚Äù cryptography to be used‚Ä¶and they‚Äôre right abou the danger!)subversion of fascist or socialist governments, undermining the so-called democratic governments16.23.5. ‚ÄúWhy won‚Äôt government simply ban  such encryption methods?‚ÄùThis has always been the Number One Issue!    raised by Stiegler, Drexler, Salin, and several others (and in fact raised by some as an objection to my even discussing these issues, namely, that action may then be taken to head off the world I describe)Types of Bans on Encryption and Secrecy    Ban on Private Use of EncryptionBan on Store-and-Forward NodesBan on Tokens and ZKIPS AuthenticationRequirement for public disclosure of all transactionsRecent news (3-6-92, same day as Michaelangelo and Lawnmower Man) that government is proposing a surcharge on telcos and long distance services to pay for new equipment needed to tap phones!

Things will just happen, just as the masses were not converted on issues of world financial markets, derivative instruments, and a lot of similar things.Crypto anarchy is largely a personal approach of withdrawal, of avoidance. Mass consensus is not needed (unless the police state option is tried).Don‚Äôt think in terms of selling crypto anarchy to Joe Average. Just use it.16.23.7. As things seem to be getting worse, vis-a-vis the creation of   a police state in the U.S.‚Äìit may be a good thing that   anonymous assassination markets will be  possible. It may   help to level the playing field, as the Feds have had their   hit teams for many years (along with their safe houses,   forged credentials, accommodation addresses, cut-outs, and   other accouterments of the intelligence state).(I won‚Äôt get into conspiracies here, but the following terms may trigger some memories: Gehlen Org, Wackenhut, McKee Team, Danny Casolaro, Cabazon Indians, Gander crash, Iraq arms deals, Pan Am 103, Bridegrooms of Death, French Connection, Fascist Third Position, Phoenix Program, Bebe Rebozo, Marex, Otto Skorzeny, Nixon, P-2, Klaus Barbie, etc.)Plenty of evidence of misbehavior on a massive scales by the intelligence agencies, the police forces, and states in general. Absolute power has corrupted absolutely.I‚Äôm certainly not advocating the killing of Congressrodents and other bureaucrats, just noting that this cloud may have a silver lining.16.24. Escrow Agents and Reputations16.24.1. Escrow Agents as a way to deal with contract reneggingOn-line clearing has the possible danger implicit in all trades that Alice will hand over the money, Bob will verify that it has cleared into hisaccount (in older terms, Bob would await word that his Swiss bank account has just been credited), and then Bob will fail to complete his end of the bargain. If the transaction is truly anonymous, over computer lines, then of course Bob just hangs up his modem and the connection is broken. This situation is as old as time, and has always involved protcols in which trust, repeat business, etc., are factors. Or escrow agents.Long before the ‚Äúkey escrow‚Äù of Clipper, true escrow was planned. Escrow as in escrow agents. Or bonding agents.Alice and Bob want to conduct a transaction. Neither trusts the other; indeed, they are unknown to each other. In steps ‚ÄúEsther‚Äôs Escrow Service.‚Äù She is also utraceable, but has established a digitally-signed presence and a good reputation for fairness. Her business is in being an escrow agent, like a bonding agency, not in ‚Äúburning‚Äù either party. (The math of this is interesting: as long as the profits to be gained from any small set of transactions is less than her ‚Äúreputation capital,‚Äù it is in her interest to forego the profits from burning and be honest. It is also possible to arrange that Esther cannot profit from burning either Alice or Bob or both of them, e.g., by suitably encrypting the escrowed stuff.)Alice can put her part of the transaction into escrow with Esther, Bob can do the same, and then Esther can release the items to the parties when conditions are met, when both parties agree, when adjudication of some sort occurs, etc. (There a dozen issues here, of course, about how disputes are settled, about how parties satisfy themselves that Esther has the items she says she has, etc.)16.24.2. Use of escrow services as a substute for governmentas in underworld deals, international deals, etc.    ‚ÄúMachinery of Freedom‚Äù (Friedman), ‚ÄúThe Enterprise of Law‚Äù (Benson)‚ÄúIt is important to note in any case that the use of third- party escrow as a substitute for Government regulation was a feature of the Northern European semi-anarchies of Iceland and Ireland that have informed modern libertarian thought.‚Äù [Duncan Frissell, 1994-08-30]16.24.3. Several people have raised the issue of someone in an   anonymous transaction simply taking the money and not   performing the service (or the flip side). This is where   intermediaries come into the picture, just as in the real   worl (bonds, escrow agents, etc.).16.24.4. Alice and Bob wish to conduct an anonymous transaction; each   is unknown to the other (no physical knowledge, no pseudonym   reputation knowledge). These ‚Äúmutually suspicious agents,‚Äù in   1960s- and 70s-era computer science lingo, must arrange   methods to conduct business while not trusting the other.16.24.5. Various cryptographic protocols have been developed for such   things as ‚Äúbit commitment‚Äù (useful in playing poker over the   phone, for example). I don‚Äôt know of progress made at the   granularity of anonymous transactions, though. (Though the   cryptographic protocol building blocks at lower levels‚Äìsuch   as bit commitment and blobs‚Äìwill presumably be used   eventually at higher levels, in markets.)16.24.6. I believe there is evidence we can shorten the cycle by   borrowing noncryptographic protocols (heresy to purists!) and   adapting them. Reputations, for example. And escrow agents (a   form of reputation, in that the ‚Äúvalue‚Äù of a bonding entity   or escrow agent lies in reputation capital).16.24.7. if a single escrow agent is suspected of being untrustworthy   (in a reputation capital sense), then can use multiple   escrowswith various protocols, caveat emptorn-out-of-m voting schemes, where n escrow agents out of m are required to complete a transactionhard to compromise them all, especially if they have no idea whether they are being ‚Äúlegitimately bribed‚Äù or merely pinged by a reputation-rating serviceHunch: the work of Chaum, Bos, and the Pfaltzmanns on DC- nets may be direcly applicable here‚Ä¶issues of collusion, sets of colluders, detection of collusion, etc.16.25. Predictions vs. Implications16.25.1. ‚ÄúHow do we know that crypto anarchy will ‚Äòwork,‚Äô that the   right institutions will emerge, that wrongs will be righted,   etc.?‚ÄùWe don‚Äôt know. Few things are certain. Only time will tell. These are emergent situations, where evolution will determine the outcome. As in other areas, the forms of solutions will take time to evolve.(The Founders could not have predicted the form corporate law would take, as but one example.)16.25.2. My thinking on crypto anarchy is not so much prediction as   examination of trends and the implications of certain things.   Just as steel girders mean certain things for the design of   buildings, so too does unbreakable crypto mean certain things   for the design of social and economic systems.16.25.3. Several technologies are involved:Unbreakable cryptoUntraceable communicationUnforgeable signatures16.25.4. (Note: Yes, it‚Äôs sometimes dangerous to say ‚Äúunbreakable,‚Äù   ‚Äúuntraceable,‚Äù and ‚Äúunforgeable.‚Äù Purists eschew such terms.   All crypto is economics, even information-theoretically   secure crypto (e.g., bribe someone to give you the key, break   in and steal it, etc.). And computationally-secure crypto‚Äì   such as RSA, IDEA, etc.‚Äìcan in principle be brute-forced.   In reality,  the costs may well be exhorbitantly   high‚Ä¶perhaps more energy than is available in the entire   universe would be needed. Essentially, these things are about   as unbreakable, untraceable, and unforgeable as one can   imagine.)16.25.5. ‚ÄúStrong building materials‚Äù implies certain things. Highways,   bridges, jet engines, etc. Likewise for strong crypto, though   the exact form of the things that get built is still unknown.   But pretty clearly some amazing new structures will be built   this way.16.25.6. Cyberspace, walls, bricks and mortar‚Ä¶16.25.7. ‚ÄúWill strong crypto have the main effect of securing current   freedoms, or will it create new freedoms and new situations?‚ÄùThere‚Äôs a camp that believe mainly that strong crypto will ensure that current freedoms are preserved, but that this will not change things materially, Communications can be private, diaries can be secured, computer security will be enhanced, etc.Another camp‚Äìof which I am a vocal spokesman‚Äìbelieves that qualitatively different types of transactions will be made possible. In addition, of course, to the securing of liberties that the first camp things is the main effect.These effects are specultative, but probably include:    increased hiding of assets through untraceable banking systemsmarkets in illegal servicesincreased espionagedata havens16.25.8. ‚ÄúWill all crypto-anarchic transactions be anonymous?‚ÄùNo, various parties will negotiate different arrangements. All a matter of economics, of enforcement of terms, etc. Some will, some won‚Äôt. The key thing is that the decision to reveal identity will be just another mutually negotiated matter. (Think of spending cash in a store. The store owner may want to know who his customers are, but he‚Äôll still take cash and remain ignorant in most cases. Unless a government steps in and distorts the market by requiring approvals for purchases and records of identities‚Äìthink of guns here.)For example, the local Mob may not lend me money if I am anonymous to them, but they have a ‚Äúhook‚Äù in me if they know who I am. (Aspects of anonymity may still be used, such as systems that leave no paper or computer trail pointing to them or to me, to avoid stings.)‚ÄúEnforcement‚Äù in underground markets, for which the conventional legal remedies are impossible, is often by means of physical force: breaking legs and even killing welshers.(Personally, I have no problems with this. The Mob cannot turn to the local police, so it has to enforce deals its own way. If you can‚Äôt pay, don‚Äôt play.)16.26. How Crypto Anarchy Will Be Fought16.26.1. The Direct Attack: Restrictions on Encryption‚ÄúWhy won‚Äôt government simply ban  such encryption methods?‚Äù    This has always been the Number One Issue!        raised by Stiegler, Drexler, Salin, and several others (and in fact raised by some as an objection to my even discussing these issues, namely, that action may then be taken to head off the world I describe)Types of Bans on Encryption and Secrecy        Ban on Private Use of EncryptionBan on Store-and-Forward NodesBan on Tokens and ZKIPS AuthenticationRequirement for public disclosure of all transactionsRecent news (3-6-92, same day as Michaelangelo and Lawnmower Man) that government is proposing a surcharge on telcos and long distance services to pay for new equipment needed to tap phones!

Another Direct Attack: Elimination of Cashthe idea being that elimination of cash, with credit cards replacing cash, will reduce black markets    ‚Äúone person, one ID‚Äù (goal of many international standards organizations)this elimination of cash may ultimately be tied in to the key registration ideas‚Ä¶government becomes a third party in all transactionsa favorite of conspiracy theorists    in extreme form: the number of the Beast tattooed on us (credit numbers, etc.)currency exchanges (rumors on the Nets about the imminent recall of banknotes, ostensibly to flush out ill-gotten gains and make counterfeiting easier)but also something governments like to do at times, sort of to remind us who‚Äôs really in charge        Germany, a couple of timesFrance, in the late 1950svarious other devaluations and currency reformsPartial steps have already been made    cash transactions greater than some value-$10,000 at this time, though ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù sub-$10K transactions must be reported-are bannedlarge denomination bills have been withdrawn from circulation        used in drug deals, the argument goesMassachussetts has demanded that banks turn over all account records, SS numbers, balances, etc.‚ÄúIf what you‚Äôre doing is legal, why do you need cash for it?‚Äù    part of the old American dichotomy: privacy versus ‚ÄúWhat have you got to hide?‚ÄùBut why the outlawing of cash won‚Äôt work    if a need exists, black markets will arise        i.e., the normal tradeoff between risk and reward: there may be some ‚Äúdiscounts‚Äù on the value, but cah will still circulatetoo many other channels exist: securities, secrets, goods        from trading in gold or silver, neither of which are outlawed any longer, to trading in secrets, how can the government stop this?            art being used to transfer money across international borders (avoids Customs)‚Äúconsideration‚Äù given, a la the scam to hide incometotal surveillance?            it doesn‚Äôt even work in Russiaon the other hand, Russia lacks the ‚Äúpoint of sale‚Äù infrastructure to enforce a cashless system16.26.3. Another Direct Attack: Government Control of Encryption, Networks,  and Net Accessa la the old Bell System monopoly, which limited what could be hooked up to a phone linethe government may take control of the networks in several ways:    FCC-type restrictions, though it is hard to see how a private network, on private property, could be restricted        as it is not using part of the ‚Äúpublic spectrum‚Äùbut it is hard to build a very interesting network that stays on private property‚Ä¶.and as soon as it crosses public property, BINGO!‚ÄúNational Data Highway‚Äù could be so heavily subsidized that alternatives will languish (for a while)        the Al Gore proposals for a federally funded system (and his wife, Tipper, is of course a leader of the censorship wing)and then the government can claim the right and duty to set the ‚Äútraffic‚Äù laws: protocols, types of encryption allowed, etc.key patents, a la RSA (if in fact gov‚Äôt.  is a silent partner in RSA Data Security)16.26.4. An Indirect Attack: Insisting that all  economic transactions be ‚Äúdisclosed‚Äù (the ‚ÄúFull Disclosure Society‚Äù scenario)this sounds Orwellian, but the obvious precedent is that businesses must keep records of all financial transactions (and even some other records, to see if they‚Äôre colluding or manipulating something)    for income and sales tax reasonsand OSHA inspections, INS raids, etc.there is currently no requirement that all transactions be fully documented with the identies of all parties, except in some cases like firearms purchases, but this could change        especially as electronic transactions become more common: the IRS may someday insist on such records, perhaps even insisting on escrowing of such records, or time-stampingthis will hurt small businesses, due to the entry cost and overhead of such systems, but big businesses will probably support it (after some grumbling)            big business always sees bureaucracy as one of their competitive advantagesand individuals have not been hassled by the IRS on minor personal transactions, though the web is tightening: 1099s are often required (when payments exceed some amount, such as $500)        small scale barter transactionsbut the nature of CA is that many transactions can be financial while appearing to be something else (like the transfer of music or images, or even the writing of letters)    which is why a cusp is coming: full disclosure is one route, protection of privacy is anotherthe government may cite the dangers of a ‚Äúgood old boy network‚Äù (literally) that promulgates racist, sexist, and ableist discrimination via computer networks    i.e., that the new networks are ‚Äúunder-representing people of color‚Äùand how can quotas be enforced in an anonymous system?proposals in California (7-92) that consultants file monthly tax statements, have tax witheld, etc.a strategy for the IRS: require all computer network users to have a ‚Äútaxpayer ID number‚Äù for all transactions, so that tax evasion can be checked16.26.5. Attempts to discredit reputation-based systems by deceit,   fraud, nonpayment, etc.deliberate attacks on the reputation of services the government doesn‚Äôt want to seethere may be government operations to sabotage  businesses, to undermine such efforts before they get startedanalogous to ‚Äúmail-bombing‚Äù an anonymous remailer16.26.6. Licensing of software developers may be one method used to   try to control the spread of anonymous systems and   information marketsby requiring a ‚Äúbusiness license‚Äù attached to any and all chunks of codeimplemented via digital signatures, a la the code signing protocols mentioned by Bob Baldwin as a means of reducing trapdoors, sabotage, and other modifications by spies, hackers, etc.    proposals to require all chunks of code to be signed, after the Sililcon Valley case in mid-80s, where spy/saboteur went to several s/w companies and meddled with code‚Äúseals‚Äù from some group such as ‚ÄúSoftware Writers Laboratories,‚Äù with formal specs required, source code provided to a trusted keeper, etc.such licensing and inspection will also serve to lock-in the current players (Microsoft will love it) and make foreign competition in software more difficult    unless the foreign competition is ‚Äúsanctioned,‚Äù e.g., Microsoft opens a code facility in India16.26.7. RICO-like seizures of computers and bulletin board systemssting operations and setupsSteve Jackson Games is obvious examplefor illegal material (porno, drug advocacy, electronic money, etc.) flowing through their systemseven when sysop can prove he did not know illegal acts were being committed on his system (precedents are the yachts seized because a roach was found)these seizures can occur even when a trial is never held    e.g., the ‚Äúadministrative seizure‚Äù of cars in Portland in prostitution casesand the seizures are on civil penalties, where the standards of proof are much lowerin some cases a mere FBI investigation is enough to get employees fired, renters kicked out, IRS audits started    reports that a woman in Georgia who posted some ‚ÄúULs‚Äù (unlisted numbers?) was fired by her company after the FBI got involved, told by her landlord that her lease was not being extended, and so forth        ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt truck with no spies‚Äùthe IRS audit would not ostensibly be for harassment, but for ‚Äúprobable cause‚Äù (or whatever term they use) that tax avoidance, under-reporting, even money-laundering might be involved16.26.8. Outlawing of Digital Pseudonyms and Credentiallingmay echoe the misguided controversy over Caller ID    misguided because the free market solution is clear: let those who wish to hide their numbers-rape and battering support numbers, police, detectives, or even just citizens requesting services or whatever-do soand let those who refuse to deal with these anonymous callers also do so (a simple enough programming of answering machines and telephones)for example, to prevent minors and felons from using the systems, ‚Äútrue names‚Äù may be required, with heavy fines and forfeitures of equipment and assets for anybody that fails to comply (or is caught in stings and setups)minors may get screened out of parts of cyberspace by mandatory ‚Äúage credentialing‚Äù (‚Äúcarding‚Äù)    this could be a major threat to such free and open systems, as with the various flaps over minors logging on to the Internet and seeing X-rated images (however poorly rendered) or reading salacious material in alt.sexthere may be some government mood to insist that only ‚Äútrue names‚Äù be used, to facillitate such age screening (Fiat-Shamir passports, papers, number of the Beast?)the government may argue that digital pseudonyms are presumptively considered to be part of a conspiracy, a criminal enterprise, tax evasion, etc.    the old ‚Äúwhat have you got to hide‚Äù theoryclosely related to the issue of whether false IDs can be used even when no crimes are being committed (that is, can Joe Average represent himself by other than his True Name?)civil libertarians may fight this ban, arguing that Americans are not required to present ‚Äúpapers‚Äù to authorities unless under direct suspicion for a crime (never mind the loitering laws, which take the other view)16.26.9. Anonymous systems may be restricted on the grounds that they   constitute a public nuisanceor that they promote crime, espionage, etc.especially after a few well-publicized abuses    possibly instigated by the government?operators may have to post bonds that effectively drive them out of business16.26.10. Corporations may be effectively forbidden to hire consultants   or subcontractors as individualsthe practical issue: the welter of tax and benefit laws make individuals unable to cope with the mountains of forms that have to be filed    thus effectively pricing individuals out of this marketthe tax law side: recall the change in status of consultants a few years back‚Ä¶this may be extended further    a strategy for the IRS: require all computer network users to have a ‚Äútaxpayer ID number‚Äù for all transactions, so that tax evasion can be checkednot clear how this differs from the point above, but I feel certain more such pressures will be applied (after all, most corporations tend to see independent contractors as more of a negative than a positive)this may be an agenda of the already established companies: they see consultants and free lancers as thieves and knaves, stealing their secrets and disseminating the crown jewels (to punningly mix some metaphors)and since the networks discussed here facilitate the use of consultants, more grounds to limit them16.26.11. There may be calls for U.N. control of the world banking   system in the wake of the BCCI and similar scandalsto ‚Äúpeirce the veil‚Äù on transnationalscalls for an end to banking secrecytalk about denying access to the money centers of New York (but will this push the business offshore, in parallel to the Eurodollar market?)motivations and methods    recall the UNESCO attempt a few years back to credential reporters, ostensibly to prevent chaos and ‚Äúunfair‚Äù reporting‚Ä¶well, the BCCI and nuclear arms deals surfacing may reinvigorate the efforts of ‚Äúcredentiallers‚Äùthe USSR and other countries entering the world community may sense an opportunity to get in on the formation of ‚Äúboards of directors‚Äù of these kinds of banks and corporations and so may push the idea in the U.N.        sort of like a World Bank or IMF with even more power to step in and take control of other banks, and with the East Bloc and USSR having seats!16.26.12. ‚ÄúNational security‚Äùif the situation gets serious enough, a la a full-blown crypto anarchy system, mightn‚Äôt the government take the step of declaring a kind of national emergency?provisions exist: ‚Äú401 Emergency‚Äù and FEMA plansof course, the USSR tried to intitiate emergency measures and failedrecall that a major goal of crypto anarchy is that the systems described here will be so widely deployed as to be essential or critical to the overall economy‚Ä¶any attempt to ‚Äúpull the plug‚Äù will also kill the economy16.26.13. Can authorities force the disclosure of a key?on the ‚ÄúYes‚Äù side:    is same, some say,  as forcing combination to a safe containing information or stolen goods        but some say-and a court may have ruled on this-that the safe can always be cut open and so the issue is mostly mootwhile forcing key disclosure is compelled testimonyand one can always claim to have forgotten the keyi.e., what happens when a suspect simply clams up?but authorities can routinely demand cooperation in investigations, can seize records, etc.on the ‚ÄúNo‚Äù side:    can‚Äôt force a suspect to talk, whether about where he hid the loot or where his kidnap victim is hiddenpractically speaking, someone under indictment cannot be forced to reveal Swiss bank accounts‚Ä¶.this would seem to be directly analogous to a cryptographic keythus, the key to open an account would seem to be the same thinga memorized key cannot be forced, says someone with EFF or CPSRon balance, it seems clear that the disclosure of cryptographic keys cannot be forced (though the practical penalty for nondisclosure could be severe)but this has not really been tested, so far as I knowand many people say that such cooperation can be demanded‚Ä¶16.27. How Crypto Anarchy Advocates Will Fight Back16.27.1. Bypassing restrictions on commercial encryption packages by   not making them ‚Äúcommercial‚Äùpublic domainfreely distributedafter all, the basic algorithms are simple and don‚Äôt really deserve patent protection: money will not be made by the originators of the code, but by the actual providers of services (for transmission and storage of packets)16.27.2. Noise and signals are often indistinguishableas with the LSB audio signal approach‚Ä¶unless the government outlaws live recordings or dubs on digital systems‚Ä¶16.27.3. Timed-release files (using encryption) will be used to hide   files, to ensure that governments cannot remove material they   don‚Äôt likeeasier said than done16.27.4. Legal approaches will also be taken: fundamental   constitutional issuesprivacy, free speech, free association16.27.5. The Master Plan to Fight Restrictions on Encryption‚ÄúGenie out of the bottle‚Äù strategy: deploy crypto widely    intertwined with religions, games, whistleblower groups, and other uses that cannot easily just be shut downscattered in amongst many other activitiesMedia attention: get media to report on value of encryption, privacy, etc.Diffusion, confusion, and refusion    Diffuse the use by scattering it aroundConfuse the issue by fake religions, games, other usesRefuse to cooperate with the governmentFree speech arguments: calling the discussions free speech and forcing the government to prove that the free speech is actually an economic transactionlinks with religions, corporations, etc.    private meetings protectedvoting systems16.28. Things that May Hide the Existence of Crypto Anarchy16.28.1. first and foremost, the incredible bandwidth, the bits   sloshing around the world‚Äôs networks‚Ä¶tapes being exchanged,   PCs calling other PCs, a variety of data and compression   formats, ISDN, wireless transmission, etc.16.28.2. in the coming years, network traffic will jump a thousand-   fold, what with digital fax, cellular phones and computers,   ISDN, fiber optics, and higher-speed modemsand these links will be of all kinds: local, private, corporate, business, commercial, bootleg (unrecorded), cellular radio, etc.16.28.3. corporations and small groups will have their own private   LANs and networks, with massive bandwidth, and with little   prospects that the government can police them-there can be no   law requiring that internal communications be readable by the   government!and the revelations that Ultra Black has been used to read messages and use the information will be further proof to corporations that they need to adopt very strong security measuresand ‚Äúpartnerships‚Äù can be scattered across the country, and even internationally, and have great lattitude in setting up their own communication and encryption systems    recall Cargill caseand also remember that the government may crack down on these systems16.28.4. AMIX-like services, new services, virtual reality (for games, entertainment, or just as a place of doing business) etc.many users will encrypt their links to VR servers, with a decryption agent at the other end, so that their activities (characters, fantasies, purchases, etc.) cannot be monitored and logged    this will further increase the bandwidth of encrypted data and will complicate further the work of the NSA and similar agencies        attempts to force ‚Äúin the clear‚Äù links will be doomed by the welter of PC standards, compression utilities, cellular modems, and the like‚Ä¶there will be no ‚Äúcleartext‚Äù that can be mandated16.28.5. steganographyin general, impossible to know that a message contains other encypted messages    except in stings and setups, which may be ruled illegalthe LSB method, and variants    LSB of DAT, DCC, MD, etc., or even sound bites (chunks of sampled sounds traded on bulletin boards)        especially of live or analog-dubbed copies (the noise floor of a typical consumer-grade mike is much higher than the LSB of DAT)of images, Adobe Photoshop images, artwork, etc.        imagine an ‚ÄúOnline Art Gallery‚Äù that is used to store messages, or a ‚ÄúPhoto Gallery‚Äù that participants post their best photos to, offering them for sale            Sturges caseLSB methodgets into some theoretical nitpicking about the true nature of noise, especially if the entire LSB channel is uncharacteristic of ‚Äúreal noise‚Äù        but by reducing the bandwidth somewhat, the noise profile can be made essentially undistinguishable from real noiseand a 2 GB DAT produces 130 MB of LSB, which is a lot of margin!what could the government do?        stings and setups to catch and scare off potential usersan attempt to limit the wide use of digital data-hopeless!a requirement for government-approved ‚Äúdithering‚Äù?            this would be an enforcement nightmareand would only cause the system to be moved into higher bits                and with enough error correction, even audible dithering of the signal would not wipe out the encrypted signalvariants: text justification, word selection        bandwidth tends to be lowbut used in Three Days of the Condorvirtual reality art may further enable private communications    think of what can be encrypted into such digital images!and user has total privacy and is able to manipulate the images and databases locally16.28.6. in the sense that these other things, such as the governments own networks of safe houses, false identities, and bootleg payoffs, will tend to hide any other such systems that emergebecause investigators may think they‚Äôve stumbled onto yet another intelligence operation, or sting, or whatever    this routinely cripples undercover investigationsscenario: criminals even float rumors that another agency is doing an operation‚Ä¶.?16.28.7.

Encrypted Traffic Will Increase Dramaticallyof all kindsmail, images, proposals, faxes, etc.acceptance of a P-K mail system will make wide use of encryption nearly automatic (though some fraction, perhaps the majority, will not even bother)there may even be legal reasons for encryption to increase:    requirements that employee records be protected, that medical records be protected, etc.‚Äúprudent man‚Äù rules about the theft of information (could mean that files are to be encrypted except when being worked on)digital signaturesechoes of the COMSEC vs. SIGINT (or PROD) debate, where COMSEC wants to see more encryption (to protect American industry against Soviet and commercial espionage)Selling of ‚ÄúAnonymous Mailers‚Äù?    using RSAavoiding RSA and the P-K patent morass        could sell packets of one-time padsno effective guarantee of security, but adequate for many simple purposes            especially if buyers swap them with others                but how to ensure that copies are not kept?idea is to enable a kind of ‚ÄúDemocracy Wall‚Äùprepaid ‚Äúcoins,‚Äù purchased anonymously        as with the Japanese phone cardsor the various toll booth electronic tokens being developed16.28.9.

She writes up a typical ad, ‚ÄúSWF seeks SWM for fun and walks on the beach‚Ä¶‚ÄùAlice encloses her specially-selected public key, which is effectively her only name. This is probably a one- time deal, unlinkable to her in any way.She encrypts the entire package and sends it through a remailing chain (or DC-Net) for eventual posting in a public place.Everyone can download the relevant area (messages can be sorted by type, or organized in interest groups), with nobody else knowing which messages they‚Äôre reading.Bob reads her message and decides to repond. He digitizes a photo of himself and includes some other info, but not his real name. He also picks a public key for Alice to communicate with him.Bob encrypts all of this with the public key of Alice (though remember that he has no way of knowing who she really is).Bob sends this message through a remailing chain and it gets posted as an encrypted message addressed to the public key of Alice. Again, some organization can reduce the total bandwidth (e.g., an area for ‚ÄúReplies‚Äù).Alice scans the replies and downloads a group of messages that includes the one she can see-and only she can see!-is addressed to her.This has established a two-way communication path between Alice and Bob without either of them knowing who the other one is or where they live. (The business about the photos is of course not conducive to anonymity, but is consistent with the ‚ÄúPersonals‚Äù mode.)If Alice and Bob wish to meet in person it is then easy for them to communicate real phone numbers and the like.Why is this interesting?        it establishes a role for anonymous systemsit could increase the bandwidth of such messagesLegal Services (Legitimate, i.e., not even the bootleg stuff)    protected by attorney-client privileges, but various Bar Associations may place limits on the use of networks        but if viewed the way phones are, seems unlikely that Bars could do much to limit the use of computer networksand suppose a Nolo Press-type publishing venture started up on the Nets? (publishing self-help info under pseudonyms)or the scam to avoid taxes by incorporating as a corporation or nonprofit?Voting Systems    with and without anonymityBoard of Directors-type voting        with credentials, passwords, and (maybe) anonymity (under certain conditions)Blackballing and Memberships        generally anonymousblackballing may be illegal these days (concerns about racism, sexism, etc.)cf. Salomaa for discussion of indistinguishability of blackballing from majority votingConsumer Ratings and Evaluations        e.g., there may be ‚Äúguaranteed anonymous‚Äù evalution systems for software and other high-tech items (Joe Bluecollar won‚Äôt mess with computers and complicated voting systems)Politically Active Groups May Have Anonymous Voting        to vote on group policies, procedures, leadershipor on boycott lists (recall the idea of the PC-Card that doesn‚Äôt allow politically incorrect purchases)this may be to protect themselves from lawsuits (SLAPP) and government harassment            they fear government infiltrators will get the names of voters and how they votedOfficial Elections        though this is unlikely for the barely-literate majoritythe inevitable fraud cases will get wide exposure and scare people and politicians off even moreunlikely in next decadeJournal Refereeing        some journals, such as Journal of Cryptology, appropriately enough, are already using paper-based versions of thisXanadu-like systems may be early adopters            there are of course reasons for just the opposite: enhanced used of reputationsbut in some cases anonymity may be preferredGroupware    anonymous comment systems (picture a digital blackboard with anonymous remarks showing up)these systems are promoted to encourage the quiet to have an equal voicebut they also provide another path to anonymous and/or reputation-based systemsPsychological Consultations    will require the licensing of counselors, of course (under U.S. laws)what if people call offshore counselors?and various limitations on privacy of records exist        Tarisoff [spelling?]subpoenasrecord-keeping requiredmay be used by various ‚Äúpolitically correct‚Äù groups        battered womenabused childrenperhaps in conjunction with the RU-486-type issues, some common ground can be established (a new kind of Underground Railroad)Advice on Medicine (a la AIDS, RU 486)    anonymity needed to protect against lawsuits and seizureNOW and other feminist groups could use crypto anarchy methods to reduce the risks to their organizationsAnonymous Tip Lines, Whistleblower Services    for example, a newspaper might set up a reward system, using the crypto equivalent of the ‚Äútorn paper‚Äù key        where informant holds onto the torn off ‚Äúkey‚Äùeven something like the James Randi/Yuri Geller case reveals that ‚Äúanonymous critics‚Äù may become more commoncorporate and defense contractor whistleblowers may seek protection through crypto methods        a ‚ÄúDeep Throat‚Äù who uses bulletin boards to communicate with DS?this presumes much wider use of computers and modems by ‚Äúaverage‚Äù people‚Ä¶and I doubt ‚ÄúProdigy‚Äù-type systems will support these activities!        but there may be cheap systems based on video game machines, a la the proposed Nintendo computersenvironmentalists set up these whistleblower lines, for people to report illegal logging, spraying, etc.Online, ‚ÄúInstant‚Äù Corporations    shell companies, duly incorporated in Delaware or wherever (perhaps even foreign sites) are ‚Äúsold‚Äù to participants who wish to create a corporate cover for their activities        so that AMIX-like fees are part of the ‚Äúinternal accounting‚ÄùAnonymous collaborative writing and criticism    similar to anonymous voting16.28.10. Compressed traffic will similarly increaseand many compression algortithms will offer some form of encryption as a freebieand will be difficult to decypher, based just on sheer volumefiles will have to at least be decompressed before key word searches can be done (though there may be shortcuts)16.29. The Coming Phase Change16.29.1. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd better hope that strong cypto, cheap telecoms and free   markets can provide the organizing basis for a workable   society because it is clear that coercion as an organizing   principle ain‚Äôt what it used to be.‚Äù    [Duncan Frissell, in   his sig, 4-13-94]16.29.2. ‚ÄúWhat is the ‚Äúinevitability‚Äù argument?‚ÄùOften made by me (Tim May), Duncan Frissell, Sandy Sandfort, and Perry Metzger (with some twists). And Hal Finney takes issue with certain aspects and contributes incisive critiques.Reasons:    borders becoming more transparent to data flowencryption is not detectable/stoppablederivative financial instruments, money sloshing across borderstransnationalismcash machines, wire transfers‚Äúpermanent tourists‚ÄùBorders are becoming utterly transparent to massive data flows. The rapid export of crypto is but an ironic example of this. Mosaid, ftp, gopher, lynx‚Ä¶all cross borders fluidly and nearly untraceably. It is probably too late to stop these systems, short of ‚Äúpulling the plug‚Äù on the Net, and this pulling the plug is simply too expensive to consider. (If the Feds ever really figure out the long- range implications of this stuff, they may try it‚Ä¶but probably not.)16.29.3. ‚ÄúWhat is the ‚Äúcrypto phase change‚Äù?‚ÄùI‚Äôm normally skeptical of claims that a ‚Äúsingularity‚Äù is coming (nanotechnology being the usual place this is claimed, a la Vinge), but ‚Äúphase changes‚Äù are more plausible. The effect of cheap printing was one such phase change, altering the connectivity of society and the dispersion of knowledge in a way that can best be described as a phase change. The effects of strong crypto, and the related ideas of digital cash, anonymous markets, etc., are likely to be similar.transitiontipping factors, disgust by populace, runaway taxation‚Äúleverage effect‚Äù    what Kelly called ‚Äúthe fax effect‚Äùcrypto use spreads, made more popular by common usecan nucleate in a small group‚Ä¶doesn‚Äôt need mass acceptance16.29.4. ‚ÄúCan crypto anarchy be stopped?‚ÄùA goal is to get crypto widely enough deployed that it cannot then be stopped    to the point of no return, where the cost of withdrawing or banning a technology is simply too high (not always a guaranteee)The only recourse is a police state in which homes and businesses are randomly entered and searched, in which cryptography is outlawed and vigorously prosecuted, in which wiretaps, video surveillance, and other forms of surveillance are used aggressively, and in which perhaps the very possession of computers and modems is restricted.Anything short of these police state tactics will allow the development of the ideas discussed here. To some extent. But enough to trigger the transition to a mostly crypto anarchic situation.(This doesn‚Äôt mean everyone, or even most, will use crypto anarchy.)16.29.5. Need not be a universal or even popular trendeven if restricted to a minority, can be very influentialGeorge Soros, Quantum fund, central banks, Spain, Britain, Germanyand a minority trend can affect others16.29.6. ‚ÄúNational borders are just speedbumps on the digital   superhighway.‚Äù16.29.7. ‚ÄúDoes crypto anarchy have to be a mass movement to succeed?‚ÄùGiven that only a tiny fraction is now aware of the implications‚Ä¶.Precedents for ‚Äúvanguard‚Äù movements    high finance in general is an elite thing        Eurodollars, interest rate swaps, etc‚Ä¶.not exactly Joe Average‚Ä¶and yet of incredible importance (George Soros has affected European central bank policy)smuggling is in general not a mass thingetc.Thus, the users of crypto anarchic tools and instruments can have an effect out of proportion to their numbers    others will start to useresentment by the ‚Äúsuckers‚Äù will buildthe services themselves‚Äìthe data havens, the credit registries, the espionage markets‚Äìwill of course have a real effect16.29.8. Strong crypto does not mean the end to law enforcement‚Äú‚Ä¶cryptography is not by any means a magic shield for criminals.  It eliminates, perhaps, one avenue by which crimes might be discovered.  However, it is most certainly not the case that someone who places an open anonymous contract for a murder in an open forum is doing so ‚Äúrisk free‚Äù.  There are plenty of ways she might be found out. Likewise, big secret societies that nefariously undermine the free world via cryptography are as vulnerable as ever to the motivations of their own members to expose the groups in a double-cross.‚Äù [Mike McNally, 1994-09-09]16.30. Loose Ends16.30.1. governments may try to ban the use of encryption in any   broadcast system, no matter how low the power, because of a   realization that all of them can be used for crypto anarchy   and espionagea losing battle, of course, what with wireless LANs of several flavors, cellular modems, the ability to hide information, and just the huge increase in bandwidth16.30.2. ‚Äútontines‚ÄùEric Hughes wrote up some stuff on this in 1992 [try to get it]Italian pseudo-insurance arrangements‚Äúdigital tontines‚Äù?16.30.3. Even in market anarchies, there are times when a top-down,   enforced set of behaviors is desirable. However, instead of   being enforced by threat of violence, the market itself   enforces a standard.For example, the Macintosh OS, with standardized commands that program developers are ‚Äúencouraged‚Äù to use. Deviations are obviously allowed, but the market tends to punish such deviations. (This has been useful in avoiding modal software, where the same keystroke sequence might save a file in one program and erase it in another. Sadly, the complexity of modern software has outpaced the Mac OS system, so that Command-Option Y often does different things in different programs.)Market standards are a noncoercive counter to total chaos.16.30.4. Of course, nothing stops people from hiring financial   advisors, lawyers, and even ‚ÄúProtectors‚Äù to shield them from   the predations of others. Widows and orphans could choose   conservative conservators, while young turks could choose to   go it alone.16.30.5. on who can tolerate crypto anarchyNot much different here from how things have been in the past. Caveat emptor. Look out for Number One. Beware of snake oil.16.30.6. Local enforcement of rules rather than global rulese.g., flooding of Usenet with advertising and chain letters    two main approaches        ban such things, or set quotas, global acceptable use policies, etc. (or use tort law to prosecute & collect damages)local carrriers decide what they will and will not carry, and how much they‚Äôll chargeit‚Äôs the old rationing vs. market pricing argument16.30.7. Locality is a powerful conceptself-responsibilitywho better to make decisions than those affected?tighter feedback loopsavoids large-scale governmentsNonlocally-arranged systems often result in calls to stop ‚Äúhogging‚Äù of resources, and general rancor and envy    water consumption is the best example: anybody seen ‚Äúwasting‚Äù water, regardless of their conservations elsewhere or there priorities, is chastised and rebuked. Sometimes the water police are called.        the costs involved (perhaps a few pennies worth of water, to wash a car or water some roses) are often trivial‚Ä¶meanwhile, billions of acre-feet of water are sold far below cost to farmers who grow monsoon crops like rice in the California desertthis hypocrisy is high on my list of reasons why free markets are morally preferable to rationing-based systemsThe Future17.1. copyright   THE  CYPHERNOMICON: Cypherpunks FAQ and More, Version 0.666,   1994-09-10, Copyright Timothy C.

SUMMARY: The Future17.2.1. Main Pointswhere things are probably going17.2.2. Connections to Other Sections17.2.3. Where to Find Additional Information17.2.4. Miscellaneous Comments17.3. Progress Needed17.3.1. ‚ÄúWhy have most of the things Cypherpunks talk about not   happened?‚ÄùExcept for remailers and basic crypto, few of the main ideas talked about for so long have actually seen any kind of realization. There are many reasons:   A. Difficult to achieve. Both Karl Kleinpaste and Eric   Hughes implemented simple first-generation remailers in a   matter of days, but ‚Äúdigital cash‚Äù and ‚Äúaptical   foddering,‚Äù for example, are not quite so   straightforward. (I am of course not taking anything away   from Kleinpaste, Hughes, Helsingius, Finney, etc., just   noting that redirecting mail messages‚Äìand even   implementing PGP and things like delay, batching, etc.,   into remailers‚Äìis a lot easier conceptually than DC-Nets   and the like.   B. Protocols are confusing, tough to implement. Only a tiny   fraction of the ‚Äúcrypto primitives‚Äù discussed at Crypto   Conferences, or in the various crypto books, have been   realized as runnable code. Building blocks like ‚Äúbit   commitment‚Äù have not even‚Äìto my knowledge‚Äìbeen   adequately realized as reusable code. (Certainly various   groups, such as Chaum‚Äôs, have cobbled-together things   like bit commitment‚Ä¶.I just don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a   consensus as to the form, and this has limited the   ability of nonspecialists to use these ‚Äúobjects.‚Äù)   C. Semantic confusion as well. While it‚Äôs fairly clear what   ‚Äúencrypting‚Äù or ‚Äúremailing‚Äù means, just what is a   ‚Äúdigital bank‚Äù? Or a ‚Äúreputation server‚Äù?   D. Interoperablity is problematic. Many platforms, many   operating systems, many languages. Again, remailers and   encryption work because there is a de facto lowest common   denominator for them: the simple text block, used in e-   mail, editors, input and output from programs, etc. That   is, we all mostly know exactly what an ASCII text block   is, and crypto programs are expected to know how to   access and manipulate such blocks. This largely explains   the success of PGP across many platforms‚Äìtext blocks are   the basic element. Ditto for Cypherpunks remialers, which   operate on the text blocks found in most mail systems.   The situation becomes much murkier for things like   digital money, which are not standalone objects and are   often multi-party protocols involving time delays,   offline processing, etc.   E. Lack of an economic motive. We on this list are not being   paid to develop anything, are not assisted by anyone, and   don‚Äôt have the financial backing of corporations to   assist us.

They perform a valuable service, of course.But that is not our model, nor can it plausibly be. We were formed as an ad hoc group to explore crypto, were dubbed ‚ÄúCypherpunks,‚Äù and have since acted as a techno-grasssroots anarchy. No staff, no dues, no elections, no official rules and regulations, and no leadership beyond what is provided by the power of speech (and a slight amount of ‚Äúfinal say‚Äù provided by the list maintainer Eric Hughes and the machine owner, John Gilmore, with support from Hugh Daniel).If folks want a lobbying group, with lawyers in Washington, they should join the EFF and/or CPSR.And we fill a niche they don‚Äôt try to fill.17.4.5.

New Software Tools and Programming Frameworks17.7.1. Needed softwareDrop-in crypto modules are a needed development. As V. Bontchev says, ‚Äúit would be nice if disk encryption software allowed the user to plug in their own modules.

All very flaky and non-robust.Look at how flaky mail delivery is!A challenge is to create systems which are:        robustnot too complicated and labor-intensive to usewhere redundancy does not compromise securityCrypto workbench    An overused term, perhaps, but one that captures the metaphor of a large set of tools, templates, programming aids, etc.QKS and ‚ÄúAgents Construction Kit‚Äù (under development)        along with Dylan, DylanAgents, Telescript, and probably several other attempts to develop agent toolkitsHenry Strickland is using ‚Äútcl‚Äù (sort of a scripting language, like ‚Äúperl‚Äù) as a basis.Software crisis    tools, languages, frameworks, environments, objects, class libraries, methods, agents, correctness, robustness, evolution, prototypingConnections between the software crisis and cryptography        complex systems, complicated protocolsprice of being ‚Äúwrong‚Äù can be very high, whether it‚Äôs an airport that can‚Äôt open on time (Denver) or a digital bank that has its assets drained in secondsagents, objects are hoped to be the ‚Äúsilver bullets‚ÄùThe need for better software methodologies        ‚Äúsilver bullets‚Äùfailures, errors, flaws, methodsprovably correct designs?

You‚Äôll hear them rant and rave about ‚Äúcriminals‚Äù and ‚Äúterrorists‚Äù, as if they even had a good clue about the laws of the thousands  of jurisdictions criss-crossed by the Internet, and as if their own attempts to enable coercion bear no resemblance to the practice of terrorism.

Too many pieces are missing. Several more advances are needed. A few more failures are also needed (gulp!) to show better how not to proceed.17.13.5. ‚ÄúBut will crypto anarchy actually happen?‚ÄùTo a growing extent, it already is happening.

Miscellaneous CommentsI hate to have a section like this, but there are just some things that don‚Äôt seem to fit neatly elsewherehopefully you found this topics with your editor search tools18.3. Quantum Cryptography18.3.1. ‚ÄúWhat is quantum cryptography?‚ÄùTwo main flavors:    secure channels exploiting the Uncertainty Principle        Brassard, Bennett, fiber optic lines, short distances, detects tapping            Quantum cryptography                bits can be exchanged-albeit at fairly low efficiencies-over a channelwith detection of taps, via the change of polarizationsStephen Wiesner wrote a 1970 paper, half a decade before the P-K work, which outlined this-not published until much later                    speculate that the NSA knew about this and quashed the publicationfactoring of numbers using a strange Many World interpretation        Shorhearkens to my spoof about Russians            I never knew I hit so close to the mark!18.3.2. ‚ÄúWhat about quantum cryptography?‚ÄùExploiting Uncertainty Principle to make untappable communication lines. (More precisely, tapped lines give indication of having been tapped.)    Bennett and Brassardfaint flashes of light in a fiber optic cable used; polarized photonsAlice and  Bob go through a protocol that involves them picking Linear or Circular Polarization (LP or CP); can‚Äôt be simultaneously measured‚Ä¶-Not likely to be important for a long time.An additional tool, or crypto primitive building block.18.4. Chaotic Cryptography18.4.1. the oscillator scheme was broken at Crypto ‚Äò9418.5. Neural Nets and AI in Crypto18.5.1. ‚ÄúWhat about neural nets and AI in crypto?‚ÄùOf limited use, at least in breaking modern ciphers. Marvin Minsky once said that if you don‚Äôt understand how to solve a problem, adding randomness usually doesn‚Äôt help.The shape of  the solution space is very spiky, very poorly- suited to hill-climbing or divide-and-conquer methodsNeural nets are not likely to do well with modern ciphers (e.g., RSA, IDEA, DES, etc.), mainly because of the shape of the solution space.  Instead of the ‚Äúrolling hills and valleys‚Äù that neural nets (and related methods, such as genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, etc.) do well in, the solution space for modern ciphers offers very little in the way of ‚Äúlearning‚Äù opportunities: you either have the solution (the key), or you don‚Äôt.Think of a needle standing up from a flat plain‚Ä¶a NN or any other hill-climber could wander for years and never find it. Well-designed modern ciphers like RSA and IDEA appear to admit no analysis based on ‚Äúnonrandom‚Äù properties. If anybody has found shortcuts to factoring the modulus in RSA, for example, they haven‚Äôt let on.I suspect there are uses in peripheral aspects, such as guessing passwords (when people have not picked high- entropy passwords, but have instead used familiar names). Or in traffic analysis. Those who munch on lots of traffic may well be using neural nets, custom signal processing, etc. to ‚Äúprepare‚Äù the captured traffic for further analysis. A safe bet, in fact.But the move in modern cryptology is definitely away from using anything with ‚Äústructure‚Äù that can be learned. Put another way, neural nets and such work well in structured environments, where there‚Äôs something to _learn), but not in the high-entropy, seemingly random world of encrypted data.AI may be useful in other areas        protocol generationSIGINT18.5.2. Evolutionary or Genetic Programminga la Holland, KozaRNGs18.6. Miscellaneous Advanced Crypto Ideas18.6.1. ‚ÄúWhy have provably ‚ÄúNP-complete‚Äù problems not found uses in   crypto?‚ÄùOne of the great Unresolved Mysteries! Or the Holy Grail, if you will.The issue is why have provably hard (or NP-complete, to be more accurate) problems not been used? (Factoring is not known to NP-complete‚Ä¶experts can correct my phrasing here if I‚Äôm misstating things.)It would be nice if a provably hard problem, such as the domino tiling problem, or 3SAT, or other such things out of Garey and Johnson‚Äôs book on NP-Completeness could be used. This would increase confidence in ciphers still further.18.6.2. ‚ÄúCan cellular automata, like Conway‚Äôs ‚ÄúGame of Life,‚Äù be used   for cryptography?‚ÄùStephen Wolfram proposed use of cellular automata for crytography some years back; his collection of essays on cellular automata contains at least one such mention. Many people suspected that 1D CAs were no stronger than linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs), and I recally hearing a couple of years ago that someone proved 1D CAs (and maybe all CAs?) are equivalent to LFSRs, which have been used in crypto for many years.Wolfram‚Äôs book is ‚ÄúTheory and Applications of Cellular Automata,‚Äù 1986, World Scientific. Several papers on using CAs for random sequence generation. P. Bardell showed in1990 that CAs produce the outputs of LFSRs.) Wolfram also has a paper, ‚ÄúCryptography with cellular automata,‚Äù in Proc. CRYPTO 85.Intuitively, the idea of a CA looks attractive for ‚Äúone-way functions,‚Äù for the reasons mentioned. But what‚Äôs the ‚Äútrapdoor‚Äù that gives the key holder a shortcut to reverse the process? (Public key crypto needs a trapdoor 1-way funtion that is easy to reverse if one has the right information).18.7. Viruses and Crypto18.7.1. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the connection between Cypherpunks and viruses?‚ÄùLike, dewd, it‚Äôs so kool.Beavis ‚Äòn Butthead use PGP (actually, Eric Hughes proposed at one point that we suggest a crypto tie-in to the writers)There‚Äôs only peripheral connection.Viruses can be spread with anonymous remailers, but digital signatures can be used to safeguard software. Signed software, no mods allowed.18.7.2. ‚ÄúWhat about the ‚Äúencryption viruses,‚Äù like KOH?‚Äù(A little far afield, but the issue does come up.)Somebody asked about this on sci.crypt and Vesselin Bontchev said:  ‚ÄúThis topic has been debated to death in alt.security.pgp, when somebody posted KOH, without even a warning that it is a virus‚Ä¶..Both viruses indeed use the IDEA cipher - the same that is used both by SecureDevice and SecureDrive. However, the viruses pose some significant threats to the integrity of your data, exactly because of their viral replication means‚Ä¶..Also, if you aquire it by viral means, you do not get the doumentation and one utility, both of which are essential for the proper usage of the product - thus proving one more time that its viral capabilities are unnecessary and harmful. Also, the virus does not come in source, which means that it could have some hidden backdoors or simply security flaws, and you have no way to check this or to fix them. At last, in some cases the virus could destroy valuable information during its replication process.‚Äù‚ÄúIn short - don‚Äôt use them. You will gain nothing over using stand-alone encryption programs, and you‚Äôll expose your data‚Äôs integrity to significant risks. Those viruses are completely useless and even harmful; they have been created with the only reason to condone the illicit activities of the virus writers, by claiming that computer viruses can be ‚Äúuseful‚Äù.‚Äù [Vesselin Bontchev, sci.crypt, 1994-08-31]18.7.3. ‚ÄúWhat about viruses? Are there any ties to crypto and   Cypherpunks themes?‚ÄùNo direct link that any of us see clearly. Occasionally a virus fan sees the ‚Äúpunks‚Äù name and thinks we‚Äôre involved in writing viruses. (Actually, a few folks on the list have virus expertise.)Crypto may protect against viruses, by having code signed. And the reliance on self-responsibility and self-protection is in contrast to the legal approach, which tends not to work too well for virus protection (by the covert nature of many viruses).18.7.4. ‚ÄúWhat interests do Cypherpunks have in viruses?‚ÄùNot much, though the topic comes up periodically.Some overlap in the communities involved.And there are some virus methods which use forms of encryption.Also, digital signatures on code can be used to ensure that code has not been modified since being released by the original author.18.8. Making Money in Crypto18.8.1. ‚ÄúHow can I make money in crypto?‚Äùcrypto experts are hired by software companiesstart up companies    a tough roadnot clear that even Phil Zimmermann has made moneyand even RSADSI is facing a challenge (hasn‚Äôt gone public, not a cash cow, etc.)There may be an explosive growth‚Äìthe phase change I often talk about‚Äìand many opportunities will emerge. But, having said this, I still don‚Äôt see obvious opportunities right now. And starting a company based on hope and ideology, rather than supplying a real market or pushing real technology (market pull vs. technology push argument) seem misguided.18.9. The Net18.9.1. Limitations of the current netinteroperabilitysubsidized, not pay as you go    makes spamming inevitable, doesn‚Äôt allocate resources to those who want them the mostthis will require digicash in a better form than most users now have access tosysadmins get worriedencryption sometimes bannedcommon carrier status not cleargeneral cruftiness of Net (‚Äúimminent death of Usenet predicted‚Äù)18.10. Duress Switches, Dead Man Switches18.10.1. ‚ÄúWhat about ‚Äúduress‚Äù codes for additional security?‚ÄùWhere a harmless decrytion can be done, or an alarm sent.Examples    sending alarm, like an under the counter alarm buttondecrypting a bank card number for a lesser-value accounttwo sets of books (not strictly a ‚Äúduress‚Äù code, unless you view the IRS as causing duress)alarms to associates, as in cells‚Äù Having a separate authentication mechanism that is used under duress is a very good idea that some existing systems already employ‚Ä¶.  From a systems point of view, it is hard to figure out exactly how the system should respond when it recognizes a duress authentication‚Ä¶.The safe inside the ATM machines used by BayBanks (Boston Mass) can be opened with two combinations.  One combination sends an alarm to the bank via a separate phone line (not the one used to perform the ATM transaction).  The alarm phone line is also connected to a conventional panic switch.‚Äù [Bob Baldwin, Duress Passwords/PINs/Combinations, 1993-11-18]18.10.2. Duress switches, dead man switches, etc.‚ÄúDigital flash paper,‚Äù can be triggered to erase files, etc.    (BATF and DEA raiders may have sophisticated means of disabling computers)Duress codes‚Ä¶‚Äúerase my files,‚Äù ways of not giving esrowed information unless proper code is given, etc.    ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt release if I am under indictment‚Äù        interesting issues about secret indictments, about publicity of such cases, access to court records by offshore computers, etc.18.10.3. Personal security for disks, dead man switchesI have heard that some BBS operators install dead man switches near the doors to rooms containing their systems‚Ä¶entering the room without flipping the switch causes some action to be taken    erasing a disk, dumping a RAM disk (a dangerous way to store data, given power failures, soft errors, restarts, etc.)18.11. Can Encryption be Detected?18.11.1. ‚ÄúCan messages be scanned and checked for encryption?‚ÄùIf the encryption produces markers or other indications, then of course. ‚ÄúBEGIN PGP‚Äù is a pretty clear beacon. (Such markers assists in decryption by the recipient, but are not essential. ‚ÄúStealth‚Äù versions of PGP and other encryption programs‚Äìsuch as S-Tools for DOS‚Äìdon‚Äôt have such markers.)If the encryption produces ‚Äúrandom-looking‚Äù stuff, then entropy measures and other statistical tests may or may not be able detect such messages reliably. Depends on what non- encrypted messages look like, and how the algorithm  works.Steganography:    making messages look like normal onestucking th ebits in with other random-like bits, such as in the low-order bits of images or sound filesThe practical concern depends on one‚Äôs local political environment. In many countries, mere suspicion of using crypto could put one in real danger.18.12. Personal Digital Assistants, Newtons, etc.18.12.1. ‚ÄúAre there cryptographic uses for things like Newtons?‚ÄùProbably. Eventually. Digital wallets, portable key holders, local agents for access, etc.Meanwhile, a few encryption programs exist. Here‚Äôs one:    -> nCrypt, the strong cryptography application for Newton: -> ftp.sumex-aim.stanford.edu/info-mac/nwt/utils/n-crypt- lite.hqx18.13. Physical Security18.13.1. ‚ÄúCan fiber optical cables be tapped?‚ÄùYes. Light can escape from the fiber in bends, and ‚Äúnear- field‚Äù tapping is theoretically possible, at least under lab conditions. Active measures for puncturing cable shields and tapping fibers are also possible.    ‚ÄúThe Fed‚Äôs want a cost effective F/O tap. My company was approached to develop such a system, can be done but not cheap like copper wire tapping.‚Äù [ domonkos@access.digex.net (andy domonkos), comp.org.eff.talk, 1994-06-29]Los Alamos technology? 1990?18.14.

WASTE (War Against Strong, Tamper-resistant Encryption).18.15. Cypherpunks List Issues18.15.1. too much noise on the list?‚ÄúOf all the lists I‚Äôm subscribed to, this is the only one that I read every article in.  Even the ‚Äúnoise‚Äù articles.  Humans being what they are, the noise is needed to help decide the direction of the group.  Besides, for those of us who are just starting on our journey through crypto-underworld need the noise to help familiarize ourselves with how crypto works.  I‚Äôve learned more from the informal ramblings than I‚Äôve gathered out of all the formal and/or mathematical postings to date.‚Äù [Patrick E. Hykkonen, 5-25-93]18.16. Tamper-Resistant Modules18.16.1. TRMs‚Äìclaims that ‚ÄúPicbuster‚Äù processor can be locally   overwritten with focussed or directed UV (OTP)18.16.2. tamper-resistant modules have some downsides as wellcash registers for ensuring compliance with all relevant sales tax, value-added tax (VAT), and rationing rules; a tamper-resistant module cash register could be the enforcement mechanism for a national security state.‚Äúobservers‚Äù18.17. Deeper Connections18.17.1. In several places I‚Äôve referred to ‚Äúdeep connections‚Äù between   things like crypto, money, game theory, evolutionary   ecologies, human motivations, and the nature of law. By this   I mean that there are deeper, unifying principles. Principles   involving locality, identity, and disclosure of knowledge. A   good example: the deep fairness of ‚Äúcut-and-choose‚Äù protocols-   -I‚Äôve seen mention of this in game theory tesxts, but not   much discussion of other, similar protocols.18.17.2. For example, below the level of number theory and algorithms   in cryptology lies a level dealing with ‚Äúidentity,‚Äù ‚Äúproof,‚Äù   ‚Äúcollusion,‚Äù and other such core concepts, concepts that can   almost be dealt with independent of the acual algorithms   (though the concrete realization of public key methods took   this out of the abstract realm of philosophy and made it   important to analyze). And these abstract concepts are linked   to other fields, such as economics, human psychology, law,   and evolutionary game theory (the study of evolved strategies   in multi-agent systems, e.g., human beings interacting and   trading with each other).18.17.3. I believe there are important questions about why things work   the way they do at this level. To be concrete, why do threats   of physical coercion create market distortions and what   effects does this have? Or, what is the nature of emergent   behavior in reputation-based systems? (The combinatiion of   crypto and economics is a fertile area, barely touched upon   by the academic cryptology community.) Why is locality is   important, and what does this mean for digital cash? Why does   regulation often produce more crime?18.17.4. Crypto and the related ideas of reputation, identity, and   webs of trust has introduced a new angle into economic   matters. I suspect there are a couple of Nobel Prizes in   Economics for those who integrate these important concepts.18.18. Loose End Loose Ends18.18.1. What the core issues are‚Ä¶a tough thing to analyzeuntraceablility as a basic construct has major implicationscan often ask what the implications would be if, say:    invisibility existeduntraceability existedBy ‚Äútough to analyze‚Äù I mean that things are often coflated, mixed together. Is it the ‚Äúreputations‚Äù that matter, or the ‚Äúanonymity‚Äù? The ‚Äúuntraceability‚Äù or the ‚Äúdigital money‚Äù?18.18.2. Price signalling in posts‚Ä¶for further informationWhen an article is posted, and there is more complete information available elsewhere by ftp, gopher, mosaic, etc., then how is this to to be signalled without actually advertising prominently?    why not a code, like the ‚ÄúGeek code‚Äù so many people put in their sigs? The code could be parsed by a reader and used to automatically fetch the information, pay for it, etc. (Agents that can be built in to newsreaders.)18.18.3. ‚ÄúWhat should Cypherpunks support for ‚Äúcable‚Äù or ‚Äúset-top box‚Äù standards?Caveats: My opinions, offered only to help frame the debate. And many of us reject the idea of government- mandated ‚Äústandards,‚Äù so my phrasing here is not meant to imply support of such standards.Major alternatives:    Set-top box, with t.v. as core of access to ‚Äúinformation superhighway.‚Äù        Problems:            limited number of channels, even if ‚Äú500 channels‚Äùmakes t.v. the focus, loses some other capabilitiesfew consumers will have television sets with the resolution capabilities that even current computer monitors have (there are reasons for this: size of monitors (related to viewing distance), NTSC constraints, age of televisions, etc.)Switched-packet cable, as in ATM or even SONET (Synchronous Optical Network) access        Advantages:            Television is just one more switched-packet transmission, not using up the bandwidthRadical Proposal: Complete deregulation        let cable suppliers‚Äìespecially of optical fibers, which are small and unobtrusive‚Äìlay fibers to any home they can negotiate access to            e.g., by piggybacking on telephone lines, electrical cables, etc. (to remove the objection about unsightly new poles or cables being strung‚Ä¶should not be an issue with fiber optics)let the market decide‚Ä¶let customers decideIn my view, government standards are a terrible idea here. Sure, NTSC was an effective standard, but it likely would have emerged without government involvement. Ditto for Ethernet and a zillion other standards. No need for government involvement.    Of course, when industry groups meet to discuss standards, one hopes that antitrust laws will not be invoked.18.18.4. minor point: the importance of ‚ÄúBut does it scale?‚Äù is often exaggeratedin many cases, it‚Äôs much more important to simply get something deployed than it is to worry in advance about how it will break if too many people use it (e.g., MacDonald‚Äôs worrying in 1955 about scalabilty of their business).Remailer networks, for example, may not scale especially well in their current form‚Ä¶but who cares? Getting them used will allow further refinement.Appendices19.1. copyright   THE  CYPHERNOMICON: Cypherpunks FAQ and More, Version 0.666,   1994-09-10, Copyright Timothy C. May. All rights reserved.

CommentsRelease Note: I regret that I haven‚Äôt had time to add many new entries here. There are a lot of specialized terms, and I probably could have doubled the number of entries here.Much more work is needed here. In fact, I debated at one point making the FAQ instead into a kind of ‚ÄúEncycopedia Cypherpunkia,‚Äù with a mix of short and long articles on each of hundreds of topics. Such an organization would suffer the disadvantages found in nearly all lexicographically-organized works: confusion of the concepts.Many of the these entries were compiled for a long handout at the first Cypherpunks meeting, September, 1992. Errors are obviously present. I‚Äôll try to keep correcting them when I can.Schneier‚Äôs ‚ÄúApplied Cryptography‚Äù is of course an excellent place to browse for terms, special uses, etc.19.4.2. agoric systems ‚Äì open, free market systems in which   voluntary transactions are central.19.4.3. Alice and Bob ‚Äì crypographic protocols are often made   clearer by considering parties A and B, or Alice and Bob,   performing some protocol. Eve the eavesdropper, Paul the   prover, and Vic the verifier are other common stand-in names.19.4.4. ANDOS ‚Äì all or nothing disclosure of secrets.19.4.5. anonymous credential ‚Äì a credential which asserts some right   or privelege or fact without revealing the identity of the   holder.  This is unlike CA driver‚Äôs licenses.19.4.6. assymmetric cipher ‚Äì same as public key cryptosystem.19.4.7. authentication ‚Äì the process of verifying an identity or   credential, to ensure you are who you said you were.19.4.8. biometric security ‚Äì a type of authentication using   fingerprints, retinal scans, palm prints, or other   physical/biological signatures of an individual.19.4.9. bit commitment ‚Äì e.g., tossing a coin and then committing to   the value without being able to change the outcome. The blob   is a cryptographic primitive for this.19.4.10. BlackNet ‚Äì an experimental scheme devised by T. May to   underscore the nature of anonymous information markets. ‚ÄúAny   and all‚Äù secrets can be offered for sale via anonymous   mailers and message pools. The experiment was leaked via   remailer to the Cypherpunks list (not by May) and thence to   several dozen Usenet groups by Detweiler. The authorities are   said to be investigating it.19.4.11. blinding, blinded signatures ‚Äì A signature that the signer   does not remember having made.  A blind signature is always a   cooperative protocol and the receiver of the signature   provides the signer with the blinding information.19.4.12. blob ‚Äì the crypto equivalent of a locked box. A   cryptographic primitive for bit commitment, with the   properties that a blobs can represent a 0 or a 1, that others   cannot tell be looking whether it‚Äôs a 0 or a 1, that the   creator of the blob can ‚Äúopen‚Äù the blob to reveal the   contents, and that no blob can be both a 1 and a 0. An   example of this is a flipped coin covered by a hand.19.4.13. BnD ‚Äì19.4.14. Capstone ‚Äì19.4.15. channel ‚Äì the path over which messages are transmitted.   Channels may be secure or insecure, and may have   eavesdroppers (or enemies, or disrupters, etc.) who alter   messages, insert and delete messages, etc. Cryptography is   the means by which communications over insecure channels are   protected.19.4.16. chosen plaintext attack ‚Äì an attack where the cryptanalyst   gets to choose the plaintext to be enciphered, e.g., when   possession of an enciphering machine or algorithm is in the   possession of the cryptanalyst.19.4.17. cipher ‚Äì a secret form of writing, using substitution or   transposition of characters or symbols. (From Arabic ‚Äúsifr,‚Äù   meaning ‚Äúnothing.‚Äù)19.4.18. ciphertext ‚Äì the plaintext after it has been encrypted.19.4.19. Clipper ‚Äì the infamous Clipper chip19.4.20. code ‚Äì a restricted cryptosystem where words or letters of a   message are replaced by other words chosen from a codebook.   Not part of modern cryptology, but still useful.19.4.21. coin flippping ‚Äì an important crypto primitive, or protocol,   in which the equivalent of flipping a fair coin is possible.   Implemented with blobs.19.4.22. collusion ‚Äì wherein several participants cooperate to deduce   the identity of a sender or receiver, or to break a cipher.   Most cryptosystems are sensitive to some forms of collusion.   Much of the work on implementing DC Nets, for example,   involves ensuring that colluders cannot isolate message   senders and thereby trace origins and destinations of mail.19.4.23. COMINT ‚Äì19.4.24. computationally secure ‚Äì where a cipher cannot be broken   with available computer resources, but in theory can be   broken with enough computer resources. Contrast with   unconditionally  secure.19.4.25. countermeasure ‚Äì something you do to thwart an attacker19.4.26. credential ‚Äì facts or assertions about some entity. For   example, credit ratings, passports, reputations, tax status,   insurance records, etc.  Under the current system, these   credentials are increasingly being cross-linked. Blind   signatures may be used to create anonymous credentials.19.4.27. credential clearinghouse  ‚Äì banks, credit agencies,   insurance companies, police departments, etc., that correlate   records and decide the status of records.19.4.28. cryptanalysis ‚Äì methods for attacking and breaking ciphers   and related cryptographic systems. Ciphers may be broken,   traffic may be analyzed, and passwords may be cracked.   Computers are of course essential.19.4.29. crypto anarchy ‚Äì the economic and political system after the   deployment of encryption, untraceable e-mail, digital   pseudonyms, cryptographic voting, and digital cash. A pun on   ‚Äúcrypto,‚Äù meaning ‚Äúhidden,‚Äù and as when Gore Vidal called   William F. Buckley a ‚Äúcrypto fascist.‚Äù19.4.30. cryptography ‚Äì another name for cryptology.19.4.31. cryptology ‚Äì the science and study of writing, sending,   receiving, and deciphering secret messages. Includes   authentication, digital signatures, the hiding of messages   (steganography), cryptanalysis, and several other fields.19.4.32. cyberspace  ‚Äì the electronic domain, the Nets, and computer-   generated spaces. Some say it is the ‚Äúconsensual reality‚Äù   described in ‚ÄúNeuromancer.‚Äù Others say it is the phone   system. Others have work to do.19.4.33. DC protocol, or DC-Net ‚Äì the dining cryptographers protocol.   DC-Nets use multiple participants communicating with the DC   protocol.19.4.34. DES ‚Äì the Data Encryption Standard, proposed in 1977 by the   National Bureau of Standards (now NIST), with assistance from   the National Security Agency. Based on the ‚ÄúLucifer‚Äù cipher   developed by Horst Feistel at IBM, DES is a secret key   cryptosystem that cycles 64-bit blocks of data through   multiple permutations with a 56-bit key controlling the   routing. ‚ÄúDiffusion‚Äù and ‚Äúconfusion‚Äù are combined to form a   cipher that has not yet been cryptanalyzed (see ‚ÄúDES,   Security of‚Äù). DES is in use for interbank transfers, as a   cipher inside of several RSA-based systems, and is available   for PCs.19.4.35. DES, Security of  ‚Äì many have speculated that the NSA placed   a trapdoor (or backdoor) in DES to allow it to read DES-   encrypted messages. This has not been proved. It is known   that the original Lucifer algorithm used a 128-bit key and   that this key length was shortened to 64 bits (56 bits plus 8   parity bits), ths making exhaustive search much easier (so   far as is known, brute-force search has not been done, though   it should be feasible today). Shamir and Bihan have used a   technique called ‚Äúdifferential cryptanalysis‚Äù to reduce the   exhaustive search needed for chosen plaintext attacks (but   with no import for ordinary DES).19.4.36. differential cryptanalysis ‚Äì the Shamir-Biham technique for   cryptanalyzing DES. With a chosen plaintext attack, they‚Äôve   reduced the number of DES keys that must be tried from about   2^56 to about 2^47 or less. Note, however, that rarely can an   attacker mount a chosen plaintext attack on DES systems.19.4.37. digital cash, digital money ‚Äì Protocols for transferring   value, monetary or otherwise, electronically.  Digital cash   usually refers to systems that are anonymous. Digital money   systems can be used to implement any quantity that is   conserved, such as points, mass, dollars, etc.  There are   many variations of  digital money systems, ranging from VISA   numbers to blinded signed digital coins.  A topic too large   for a single glossary entry.19.4.38. digital pseudonym ‚Äì basically, a ‚Äúcrypto identity.‚Äù A way   for individuals to set up accounts with various organizations   without revealing more information than they wish. Users may   have several digital pseudonyms, some used only once, some   used over the course of many years. Ideally, the pseudonyms   can be linked only at the will of the holder. In the simplest   form, a public key can serve as a digital pseudonym and need   not be linked to a physical identity.19.4.39. digital signature ‚Äì  Analogous to a written signature on a   document. A modification to a message that only the signer   can make but that everyone can recognize.  Can  be used   legally to contract at a distance.19.4.40. digital timestamping ‚Äì one function of a digital notary   public, in which some message (a song, screenplay, lab   notebook, contract, etc.) is stamped with a time that cannot   (easily) be forged.19.4.41. dining cryptographers protocol (aka DC protocol, DC nets) ‚Äì   the untraceable message sending system invented by David   Chaum. Named after the ‚Äúdining philosophers‚Äù problem in   computer science, participants form circuits and pass   messages in such a way that the origin cannot be deduced,   barring collusion. At the simplest level, two participants   share a key between them. One of them sends some actual   message by bitwise exclusive-ORing the message with the key,   while the other one just sends the key itself. The actual   message from this pair of participants is obtained by XORing   the two outputs. However, since nobody but the pair knows the   original key, the actual message cannot be traced to either   one of the participants.19.4.42. discrete logarithm problem ‚Äì given integers a, n, and x,   find some integer m such that a^m mod n = x, if m exists.   Modular exponentiation, the a^m mod n part, is   straightforward (and special purpose chips are available),   but the inverse problem is believed to be very hard, in   general.  Thus it is conjectured that modular exponentiation   is a one-way function.19.4.43. DSS, Digital Signature Standard ‚Äì the latest NIST (National   Institute of Standards and Technology, successor to NBS)   standard for digital signatures. Based on the El Gamal   cipher, some consider it weak and poor substitute for RSA-   based signature schemes.19.4.44. eavesdropping, or passive wiretapping ‚Äì intercepting   messages without detection. Radio waves may be intercepted,   phone lines may be tapped, and computers may have RF   emissions detected. Even fiber optic lines can be tapped.19.4.45. Escrowed Encryption Standard (EES) ‚Äì current name for the   key escrow system known variously as Clipper, Capstone,   Skipjack, etc.19.4.46. factoring ‚Äì Some large numbers are difficult to factor. It   is conjectured that there are no feasible‚Äìi.e.‚Äùeasy,‚Äù less   than exponential in size of number‚Äì factoring methods. It is   also an open problem whether RSA may be broken more easily   than by factoring the modulus (e.g., the public key might   reveal information which simplifies the problem).   Interestingly, though factoring is believed to be ‚Äúhard‚Äù, it   is not known to be in the class of NP-hard problems.   Professor Janek invented a factoring device, but he is   believed to be fictional.19.4.47. HUMINT ‚Äì19.4.48. information-theoretic security ‚Äì ‚Äúunbreakable‚Äù security, in   which no amount of cryptanalysis can break a cipher or   system. One time pads are an example (providing the pads are   not lost nor stolen nor used more than once, of course). Same   as unconditionally secure.19.4.49. key ‚Äì a piece of information needed to encipher or decipher   a message. Keys may be stolen, bought, lost, etc., just as   with physical keys.19.4.50. key exchange, or key distribution ‚Äì the process of sharing a   key with some other party, in the case of symmetric ciphers,   or of distributing a  public key in an asymmetric cipher. A   major issue is that the keys be exchanged reliably and   without compromise. Diffie and Hellman devised one such   scheme, based on the discrete logarithm problem.19.4.51. known-plaintext attack ‚Äì a cryptanalysis of a cipher where   plaintext-ciphertext pairs are known. This attack searches   for an unknown key. Contrast with the chosen plaintext   attack, where the cryptanalyst can also choose the plaintext   to be enciphered.19.4.52. listening posts ‚Äì the NSA and other intelligence agencies   maintain sites for the interception of radio, telephone, and   satellite communications. And so on. Many sites have been   identified (cf.  Bamford), and many more sites are suspected.19.4.53. mail, untraceable  ‚Äì a system for sending and receiving mail   without traceability or observability. Receiving mail   anonymously can be done with broadcast of the mail in   encrypted form.  Only the intended recipient (whose identity,   or true name, may be unknown to the sender) may able to   decipher the message. Sending mail anonymously apparently   requires mixes or use of the dining cryptographers (DC)   protocol.19.4.54. Message Pool19.4.55. minimum disclosure proofs  ‚Äì another name for zero knowledge   proofs, favored by Chaum.19.4.56. mixes ‚Äì David Chaum‚Äôs term for a box which performs the   function of mixing, or decorrelating, incoming and outgoing   electronic mail messages. The box also strips off the outer   envelope (i.e., decrypts with its private key) and remails   the message to the address on the inner envelope. Tamper-   resistant modules may be used to prevent cheating and forced   disclosure of the mapping between incoming and outgoing mail.   A sequence of many remailings effectively makes tracing   sending and receiving impossible. Contrast this with the   software version, the DC protocol. The ‚Äúremailers‚Äù developed   by Cypherpunks are an approximation of a Chaumian mix.19.4.57. modular exponentiation  ‚Äì raising an integer to the power of   another integer, modulo some integer. For integers a, n, and   m, a^m mod n. For example, 5^3 mod 100 = 25. Modular   exponentiation can be done fairly quickly with a sequence of   bit shifts and adds, and special purpose chips have been   designed. See also discrete logarithm.19.4.58. National Security Agency (NSA)  ‚Äì the largest intelligence   agency, responsible for making and breaking ciphers, for   intercepting communications, and for ensuring the security of   U.S. computers. Headquartered in Fort Meade, Maryland, with   many listening posts around the world.  The NSA funds   cryptographic research and advises other agencies about   cryptographic matters. The NSA once obviously had the world‚Äôs   leading cryptologists, but this may no longer be the case.19.4.59. negative credential ‚Äì a credential that you possess that you   don‚Äôt want any one else to know, for example, a bankruptcy   filing.  A formal version of a negative reputation.19.4.60. NP-complete ‚Äì a large class of difficult problems.  ‚ÄúNP‚Äù   stands for nondeterministic polynomial time, a class of   problems thought in general not to have feasible algorithms   for their solution.  A problem is ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù  if  any other   NP problem may be reduced to that problem.   Many important   combinatorial and algebraic problems are NP-complete: the   travelling salesman problem, the Hamiltonian cycle problem,   the graph isomorphism problem, the word problem, and on and   on.19.4.61. oblivious transfer ‚Äì a cryptographic primitive that involves   the probablistic transmission of bits. The sender does not   know if the bits were received.19.4.62. one-time pad ‚Äì a string of randomly-selected bits or symbols   which is combined with a plaintext message to produce the   ciphertext. This combination may be shifting letters some   amount, bitwise exclusive-ORed, etc.). The recipient, who   also has a copy of the one time pad, can easily recover the   plaintext. Provided the pad is only used once and then   destroyed, and is not available to an eavesdropper, the   system is perfectly secure, i.e., it is information-   theoretically secure. Key distribution (the pad)  is   obviously a practical concern, but consider CD-ROM‚Äôs.19.4.63. one-way function ‚Äì a function which is easy to compute in   one direction but hard to find any inverse for, e.g. modular   exponentiation, where the inverse problem is known as the   discrete logarithm problem. Compare the special case of trap   door one-way functions.  An example of  a one-way operation   is multiplication: it is  easy to multiply two prime numbers   of 100 digits to produce a 200-digit number, but  hard to   factor that 200-digit number.19.4.64. P ?=? NP  ‚Äì Certainly the most  important unsolved problem   in complexity theory. If P = NP, then cryptography as we know   it today does not exist.  If P = NP,  all NP problems are   ‚Äúeasy.‚Äù19.4.65. padding ‚Äì sending extra messages to confuse eavesdroppers   and to defeat traffic analysis.   Also adding random bits to   a message to be enciphered.19.4.66. PGP19.4.67. plaintext ‚Äì also called cleartext, the text that is to be   enciphered.19.4.68. Pool19.4.69. Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)  ‚Äì Phillip Zimmerman‚Äôs   implementation of RSA, recently upgraded to version 2.0, with   more robust components and several new features. RSA Data   Security has threatened PZ so he no longer works on it.   Version 2.0 was written by a consortium of non-U.S. hackers.19.4.70. prime numbers ‚Äì integers with no factors other than   themselves and 1. The number of primes is unbounded.  About   1% of the 100 decimal digit numbers are prime.  Since there   are about 10^70 particles in the universe, there are about   10^23  100 digit primes for each and every particle in the   universe!19.4.71. probabalistic encryption  ‚Äì a scheme by Goldwasser, Micali,   and Blum that allows multiple ciphertexts for the same   plaintext, i.e., any given plaintext may have many   ciphertexts if the ciphering is repeated. This protects   against certain types of known ciphertext attacks on RSA.19.4.72. proofs of identity ‚Äì proving who you are, either your true   name, or your digital identity. Generally, possession of the   right key is sufficient proof (guard your key!). Some work   has been done on ‚Äúis-a-person‚Äù credentialling agencies, using   the so-called Fiat-Shamir protocol‚Ä¶think of this as a way   to issue unforgeable digital passports. Physical proof of   identity may be done with biometric security methods. Zero   knowledge proofs of identity reveal nothing beyond the fact   that the identity is as claimed. This has obvious uses for   computer access, passwords, etc.19.4.73. protocol ‚Äì a formal procedure for solving some problem.   Modern cryptology is mostly about the study of protocols for   many problems, such as coin-flipping, bit commitment (blobs),   zero knowledge proofs, dining cryptographers, and so on.19.4.74. public key ‚Äì the key distributed publicly to potential   message-senders. It may be published in a phonebook-like   directory or otherwise sent. A major concern is the validity   of this public key to guard against spoofing or   impersonation.19.4.75. public key cryptosystem ‚Äì the modern breakthrough in   cryptology, designed by Diffie and Hellman, with   contributions from several others. Uses trap door one-way   functions so that encryption may be done by anyone with   access to the ‚Äúpublic key‚Äù but decryption may be done only by   the holder of the ‚Äúprivate key.‚Äù Encompasses public key   encryption, digital signatures, digital cash, and many other   protocols and applications.19.4.76. public key encryption ‚Äì the use of modern cryptologic   methods to provided message security and authentication. The   RSA algorithm is the most widely used form of public key   encryption, although other systems exist. A public key may be   freely published, e.g., in phonebook-like directories, while   the corresponding private key is closely guarded.19.4.77. public key patents  ‚Äì M.I.T. and Stanford, due to the work   of Rivest, Shamir, Adleman, Diffie, Hellman, and Merkle,   formed Public Key Partners to license the various public key,   digital signature, and RSA patents. These patents, granted in   the early 1980s, expire in the between 1998 and 2002. PKP has   licensed RSA Data Security Inc., of Redwood City, CA, which   handles the sales, etc.19.4.78. quantum cryptography ‚Äì a system based on quantum-mechanical   principles. Eavesdroppers alter the quantum state of the   system and so are detected. Developed by Brassard and   Bennett, only small laboratory demonstrations have been made.19.4.79. remailers ‚Äì software versions of Chaum‚Äôs ‚Äúmixes,‚Äù for the   sending of untraceable mail. Various features are needed to   do this: randomized order of resending, encryption at each   stage (picked in advance by the sender, knowing the chain of   remailers), padding of message sizes. The first remailer was   written by E. Hughes in perl, and about a dozen or so are   active now, with varying feature sets.19.4.80. reputations ‚Äì the trail of positive and negative   associations and judgments that some entity accrues. Credit   ratings, academic credentials, and trustworthiness are all   examples. A digital pseudonym will accrue these reputation   credentials based on actions, opinions of others, etc. In   crypto anarchy, reputations and agoric systems will be of   paramount importance. There are many fascinating issues of   how reputation-based systems work, how credentials can be   bought and sold, and so forth.19.4.81. RSA ‚Äì the main public key encryption algorithm, developed by   Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Kenneth Adleman. It exploits the   difficulty of factoring large numbers to create a private key   and public key. First invented in 1978, it remains the core   of modern public key systems. It is usually much slower than   DES, but special-purpose modular exponentiation chips will   likely speed it up. A popular scheme for speed is to use RSA   to transmit session keys and then a high-speed cipher like   DES for the actual message text.Description ‚Äì Let p and q be large primes, typically with more than 100 digits. Let n = pq and find some e such that e is relatively prime to (p - 1)(q - 1). The set of numbers p, q, and e is the private key for RSA. The set of numbers n and e forms the public key (recall that knowing n is not sufficient to easily find p and q‚Ä¶the factoring problem). A message M is encrypted by computing M^e mod n. The owner of the private key can decrypt the encrypted message by exploiting number theory results, as follows. An integer d is computed such that ed =1 (mod (p - 1)(q - 1)). Euler proved a theorem that M^(ed) = M mod n and so M^(ed) mod n = M. This means that in some sense the integers e and d are ‚Äúinverses‚Äù of each other. [If this is unclear, please see one of the many texts and articles on public key encryption.]19.4.82. secret key cryptosystem ‚Äì A system which uses the same key   to encrypt and decrypt traffic at each end of a communication   link.  Also called a symmetric or one-key system.  Contrast   with public key cryptosystem.19.4.83. SIGINT ‚Äì19.4.84. smart cards ‚Äì a computer chip embedded in credit card.  They   can hold cash, credentials, cryptographic keys, etc. Usually   these are built with some degree of tamper-resistance. Smart   cards may perform part of a crypto transaction, or all of it.   Performing part of it may mean checking the computations of a   more powerful computer, e.g., one in an ATM.19.4.85. spoofing, or masquerading ‚Äì posing as another user. Used for   stealing passwords, modifying files, and  stealing cash.   Digital signatures and other authentication methods are   useful to prevent this. Public keys must be validated and   protected to ensure that others don‚Äôt subsititute their own   public keys which users may then unwittingly use.19.4.86. steganography ‚Äì a part of cryptology dealing with hiding   messages and obscuring who is sending and receiving messages.   Message traffic is often padded to reduce the signals that   would otherwise come from a sudden beginning of messages.   ‚ÄúCovered writing.‚Äù19.4.87. symmetric cipher ‚Äì same as private key cryptosystem.19.4.88. tamper-responding modules, tamper-resistant modules (TRMs) ‚Äì   sealed boxes or modules which are hard to open, requiring   extensive probing and usually leaving ample evidence that the   tampering has occurred. Various protective techniques are   used, such as special metal or oxide layers on chips, armored   coatings, embedded optical fibers, and other measures to   thwart analysis. Popularly called ‚Äútamper-proof boxes.‚Äù Uses   include: smart cards, nuclear weapon initiators,   cryptographic key holders, ATMs, etc.19.4.89. tampering, or active wiretapping ‚Äì intefering with messages   and possibly modifying them. This may compromise data   security, help to break ciphers, etc.  See also spoofing.19.4.90. Tessera19.4.91. token ‚Äì some representation, such as ID cards, subway   tokens, money, etc., that indicates possession of some   property or value.19.4.92. traffic analysis ‚Äì determining who is sending or receiving   messages by analyzing packets, frequency of packets, etc. A   part of steganography. Usually handled with traffic padding.19.4.93. traffic analysis ‚Äì identifying characteristics of a message   (such as sender, or destination) by watching traffic.   Remailers and encryption help to foil traffic analysys.19.4.94. transmission rules ‚Äì the protocols for determining who can   send messages in a DC protocol, and when. These rules are   needed to prevent collision and deliberate jamming of the   channels.19.4.95. trap messages ‚Äì dummy messages in DC Nets which are used to   catch jammers and disrupters. The messages contain no private   information and are published in a blob beforehand so that   the trap message can later be opened to reveal the disrupter.   (There are many strategies to explore here.)19.4.96. trap-door ‚Äì In cryptography, a piece of secret information   that allows the holder of a private key to invert a normally   hard to invert function.19.4.97. trap-door one way functions ‚Äì functions which are easy to   compute in both the forward and reverse direction but for   which the disclosure of an algorithm to compute the function   in the forward direction does not provide information on how   to compute the function in the reverse direction. More simply   put, trap-door one way functions are one way for all but the   holder of the secret information. The RSA algorithm is the   best-known example of such a function.19.4.98. unconditional security ‚Äì same as information-theoretic   security, that is, unbreakable except by loss or theft of the   key.19.4.99. unconditionally  secure ‚Äì where no amount of intercepted   ciphertext is enough to allow the cipher to be broken, as   with the use of a one-time pad cipher. Contrast with   computationally secure.19.4.100. URLs19.4.101. voting, cryptographic ‚Äì Various schemes have been devised   for anonymous, untraceable voting. Voting schemes should have   several properties: privacy of the vote, security of the vote   (no multiple votes), robustness against disruption by jammers   or disrupters, verifiability (voter has confidence in the   results), and efficiency.19.4.102. Whistleblowers19.4.103. zero knowledge proofs ‚Äì proofs in which no knowledge of the   actual proof is conveyed. Peggy the Prover demonstrates to   Sid the Skeptic that she is indeed in possession of some   piece of knowledge without actually revealing any of that   knowledge. This is useful for access to computers, because   eavesdroppers or dishonest sysops cannot steal the knowledge   given. Also called minimum disclosure proofs. Useful for   proving possession of some property, or credential, such as   age or voting status, without revealing personal information.19.5. Appendix ‚Äì Summary of Crypto Versions19.5.1.

It uses the MDC/SHA cipher. ‚Ä¶ It is available from Grabo (garbo.uwasa.fi:/pc/crypt/sfs110.zip, I think), and also from our ftp site: ftp.informatik.uni- hamburg.de:/pub/virus/crypt/disk/sfs110.zip    I would recommend the Garbo site, because ours is a bit slow.‚Äù [Vesselin Bontchev, alt.security.pgp, 1994-09-05]Compared to SecureDrive, users report it to be faster, better-featured, has a Windows interface, is a device driver, and is robust. The disadvantages are that it currently does not ship with source code and uses a more obscure cipher.‚ÄúSFS (Secure FileSystem) is a set of programs which create and manage a number of encrypted disk volumes, and runs under both DOS and Windows.  Each volume appears as a normal DOS drive, but all data stored on it is encryped at the individual-sector level‚Ä¶.SFS 1.1 is a maintenance release which fixes a few minor problems in 1.0, and adds a number of features suggested by users.

README‚ÄìBRIEF VERSION20.2.1. Copyright Timothy C. May. All rights reserved. For what it‚Äôs   worth.20.2.2. Apologies in advance for the mix of styles (outline, bullet,   text, essays), for fragments and incomplete sections. This   FAQ is already much too long and detailed, and writing   suitable connective material, introductions, summaries, etc.   is not in the cards anytime soon. Go with the flow, use your   text searching tools, and deal with it.20.2.3. Substantive corrections welcome, quibbles less welcome, and   ideological debate even less welcome. Corrections to outdated   information, especially on pointers to information, will be   most appreciated.20.3. Copyright Comments20.3.1. It may seem illogical for a Cypherpunk to assert some kind of   copyright. Perhaps. But my main concern is the ease with   which people can relabel documents as their own, sometimes   after only adding a few words here and there.20.3.2. Yes, I used the words of others in places, to make points   better than I felt my own words would, to save time, and to   give readers a different voice speaking on issues. I have   credited quotes with a ‚Äú[Joe Foobar, place, date]   attribution, usually at the end of the quote. If a place is   not listed, it is the Cypherpunks list itself. The author and   date should be sufficient to (someday) retrieve the source   text. By the way, I used quotes as they seemed appropriate,   and make no claims that the quoted points are necessarily   original to the author‚Äìwho may have remembered them from   somewhere else‚Äìor that the date listed is the origination   date for the point. I have something like 80 megabytes of   Cypherpunks posts, so I couldn‚Äôt do an archaeological dig for   the earliest mention of an idea.20.3.3. People can quote this FAQ under the ‚Äúfair use‚Äù provisions,   e.g., a paragraph or two, with credits. Anything more than a   few paragraphs constitutes copyright infringement, as I   understand it.20.3.4. Should I give up the maintaining of this FAQ and/or should   others get involved, then the normal co-authorship and   inheritance arrangements will be possible.20.3.5. The Web. WWW and Mosaic offer amazing new opportunities for   on-line documents. It is in fact likely that this FAQ will be   available as a Web document. My concern, however, is that the   integrity and authorship be maintained. Thus, splitting the   document in a hundred or more little pieces, with no   authorship attached, would not be cool. Also, I intend to   maintain this document with my powerful outlining tools   (Symantec‚Äôs ‚ÄúMORE,‚Äù on a Macintosh) and thus anyone who   ‚Äúfreezes‚Äù the document and uses it as a base for links,   pointers, etc., will be left behind as mods are made.20.4. A Few Words on the Style20.4.1. Some sections are in outline formlike thiswith fragments of ideas and pointswith incomplete sentencesand with lists of points that are obviously only starting points for more complete analyses20.4.2. Other sections are written in more complete essay form, as   reasonably self-contained analyses of some point or topic.   Like this. Some of these essays were taken directly out of   posts I did for the list, or for sci.crypt, and no   attribution H (since I wrote the stuff‚Ä¶quotes from others   are credited).20.4.3. The styles may clash, but I just don‚Äôt have the hundreds of   hours to go through and ‚Äúregularize‚Äù everything to a   consistent style. The outline style allows additional points,   wrinkles, rebuttals, and elaborations to be grafted on easily   (if not always elegantly). I hope most readers can understand   this and learn to deal with it.20.4.4. Of  course, there are places where the points made are just   too fragmentary, too outlinish, for people to make sense of.   I‚Äôve tried to clean these up as much as I can, but there will   always be some places where an idea seemed clear to me at the   time (maybe not) but which is not presented clearly to   others. I‚Äôll keep trying to iron these kinks out in future   versions.20.4.5. Comment on styleIn many cases I merged two or more chunks of ideas into one section, resulting in many cases in mismatching writing styles, tenses, etc. I apologize, but I just don‚Äôt have the many dozens of hours it might take to go through and ‚Äúregularize‚Äù things, to write more graceful transition paragraphs, etc. I felt it was more important to get the ideas and idea fragments out than to polish the writing. (Essays written from scratch, and in order, are generally more graceful than are concatenations of ideas, facts, pointers, and the like.)Readers should also not assume that a ‚Äúfleshed-out‚Äù section, made up of relatively complete paragraphs, is any more important than a section that is still mostly made up of short one-liners.References to Crypto Journals, Books. Nearly every section in this document could have one or more references to articles and papers in the Crypto Proceedings, in Schneier‚Äôs book, or whatever. Sorry, but I can‚Äôt do this. Maybe someday‚Äìwhen true hypertext arrives and is readily usable (don‚Äôt send me e-mail about HTML, or Xanadu, etc.) this kind of cross-referencing will be done. Footnotes would work today, but are distracting in on-line documents. And too much work, given that this is not meant to be a scholarly thesis.I also have resisted the impulse to included quotes or sections from other FAQs, notably the sci.crypt and rsadsi FAQs. No point in copying their stuff, even with appropriate credit. Readers should already have these docs, of course.20.4.6. quibblingAny time you say something to 500-700 people, expect to have a bunch of quibbles. People will take issue with phrasings, with choices of definitions, with facts, etc. Correctness is important, but sometimes the quibbling sets off a chain reaction of corrections, countercorrections, rebuttals, and ‚ÄúI would have put it differently‚Äùs. It‚Äôs all a bit overwhelming at times. My hope for this FAQ is that serious errors are (of course) corrected, but that the List not get bogged down in endless quibbling about such minor issues as style and phrasing.20.5. How to Find Information20.5.1. This FAQ is very long, which makes finding specific questions   problematic. Such is life‚Äìshorter FAQ are of course easier   to navigate, but may not address important issues.20.5.2. A full version of this FAQ is available, as well as chapter-   by-chapter versions (to reduce the downloading efforts for   some people). Search tools within text editors are one way to   find topics. Future versions of this FAQ may be paginated and   then indexed (but maybe not).20.5.3. I advise using search tools in editors and word processors to   find sections of interest. This is likely faster anyway than   consulting an index generated by me (which I haven‚Äôt   generated, and probably never will).20.6. My Views20.6.1. This FAQ, or whatever one calls it, is more than just a   simple listing of frequently asked questions and the lowest-   common-denominator answers. This should be clear just by the   size alone. I make no apologies for writing the document I   wanted to write. Others are free to write the FAQ they would   prefer to read. You‚Äôre getting what you paid for.20.6.2. My views are rather strong in some areas. I‚Äôve tried to   present some dissenting arguments in cases where I think   Cypherpunks are really somewhat divided, such as in remailer   strategies and the like. In cases where I think there‚Äôs no   credible dissent, such as in the wisdom of Clipper, I‚Äôve made   no attempt to be fair. My libertarian, even anarchist, views   surely come through. Either deal with it, or don‚Äôt read the   document. I have to be honest about this.20.7. More detailed disclaimer20.7.1. This detailed disclaimer is probably not good in most courts   in the U.S., contracts having been thrown out if favor of   nominalism, but here it is anyway. At least nobody can claim   they were misled into thinking I was giving them warranteed,   guaranteed advice.20.7.2. Timothy C.
