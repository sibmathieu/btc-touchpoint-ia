  "text": "[Music]what's up everyone I'm Ben with the BTCsessions and I'm here in Calgary Albertacontrary to popular belief Bitcointransactions are not anonymous and canin fact be linked to you in a variety ofways that's why I think it's soimportant that users start takingadvantage of easily accessibleapplications like wasabi wallet to helppreserve their privacy we're gonna takea look at how to use wasabi what a coinjoint transaction is how to do one we'realso gonna take a peek at Bitcointransactions under the hood to help youunderstand how to eliminate some privacycompromising habits that you may havelet's dive in you can download thewasabi wallet from wasabi wallet dot IOif you scroll down the page you can seethey have versions for Windows Linux andMac OS X and once you have downloaded itit will look something like this nowwhat you see on your computer could varydepending on what operating systemyou're on it can also vary if wasabiwallet happens to roll out new featuresand new versions but hopefully thisvideo will hold up for some time withoutneeding an update so I'd like to drawyour attention to the left hand sidethere's a number of menu items here whenyou get started there is generate a newwallet this is where you can create abrand new wallet from scratch there'srecover a wallet so perhaps you deletedan old wallet you have another walletyou'd like to import all you need isyour recovery seed which you'll see tosee in a second and a password if youhad one and then you can give the walleta name third you have load wallet so anyexisting wallet on your computer you cansee I have a temporary wallet that I'vepreviously used we're not going to beutilizing that one we're gonna bestarting from scratchyou can test the password for yourwallet here so this is to make sure thatif you set up a wallet you want to makesure that you have the right passwordyou can test that before sending fundsin and finally hardware wallets do workwith the wasabi wallet so ledgertreasure cult card now there are acouple things to pay attention here acurrently Hardware wallis themselves areincompatible with coin joint the reasonfor this has to do with the way thatcoin joint transactions work and thelimitations of hardware walletscurrently on the market though thiscould change over time as new hardwarecomes out and new technology is utilizedfor the time being it's a no-go andsecondly you can see down below herejust below where it talks about thehardware wallets only bec 32 addressescan be utilized here so what is it Beck32 address without getting too detailedessentially it is a Bitcoin address thatstarts with a B and if you have one ofthese like in wasabi wallet you can onlyreceive funds from another Bitcoinwallet that starts with a B or a Bitcoinwallet address that starts with a 3 ifyou're looking at your wallet and itstarts with a 1 that means that youlikely need to use another wallet beforesending funds into wasabi somerecommendations of wallets that I'vedone videos on that will work with thisour group like stream green the hotterwallet samurai wallet and electrum thefirst three are for mobile and electrumis for desktop as well as mobileso we're gonna go ahead and generate anew wallet by clicking on that menu itemon the left and we need to name thewallet so I'm just gonna go ahead andname itBTC Sessions and then I need to choose apassword and you'll notice as I type inthe password it will mask whatever I'mtyping in with some fun characters therefinally I need to click I agree to termsand conditions and then I click ongenerate now what you're seeing here isa recovery seed phrase don't worry ifyou're looking at this going I can'tbelieve he's showing this to us thiswallet will be cleared out well beforethis video airs and I will not be usingit again in the future so I'm okayshowing these words here essentiallywhat you need to do here is write downall of these words these are a backup ofyour wallet if anything happens to yourwallet or your computer and it getsdeleted for some reason or the files getcorrupted you need this phrase combinedwith your password to access your fundsplease do not forget your password it isvery important and I will write thesedown I'll be back in a moment a fewmoments later once you have written downall of your words you can go ahead andclick the button below and you can seenow that I have an additional walletavailable here all I need to do to loadit up is click on the wallet I'd like toopen and I can either actually first I'mgoing to test my password so this iswhat this test password screen is for ifyou type it in and hit test it will tellyou that you have the correct passwordnow I can either load this wallet byclicking the load wallet down below orclicking in the left hand screenselecting my wallet and hit load it'lltake a moment to boot up and when itdoes we'll be back to check it outonce the wallet has loaded up it willlook like this and if he direct yourattention over to the right-hand side ofthe window you can see all of your majortabs that you need to be able to look atso of course you've got a few optionshere but up top you can see the name ofyour wallet as well as the total balancein bitcoin down below that you have yoursend screen where you can send outBitcoin from the wallet to an externalwallet your receive screen to receiveBitcoin your coin joins screen to mixyour coins and anonymize them and ahistory screen of any previoustransactions you've done furthermore ifyou click on advanced there's a few morethings you can see your walletinformation you can see also buildtransactions and broadcast transactionsand this is for an advanced featurecalled partially signed Bitcointransactions we will not be coveringthis in this video but I will becovering it in an upcoming video of thecold card hardware wallets so be sure tostay tuned to that now one other thingactually when I clicked on advanced andI clicked on these options it actuallyopened up additional tabs up top which Ican switch between now these tabs can beshut down in fact if I went through andI were to close all of them like so nobig deal and don't worry if youaccidentally close a tab because you cansimply reopen them by clicking on thosefunctions again in the right-hand columnso no worries there and finally let'sjust take a look up in the top of thewindow there are the regular menuscreens that you get in a typicaltypical application and this shows yousome of the options you saw in the mainscreen generate recover load wallet andso on and so forthso we're gonna go ahead now and receivesome Bitcoin into this wallet so all weneed to do is we either click on thereceive tab up top or over on the righthand side in that menu now we need toactually label the incoming transactionreason for that being is you want to besure that your coins are sufficientlyanonymized and these labeling schemeshelp you do thatso I'm going to choose a pretty simplelabel for this one so I'm just gonnatype test one and then I'm going toclick on the button that says generatereceive address and so what this does isit generates an address and auto copiesit to my clipboard and it also generatesa QR code for me so I can paste thisaddress into really wherever I want anywallet that I want or I can use anexternal wallet like a mobile wallet toscan this QR code and that is what I'mdoing right now off screen I've got aBitcoin wallet that I'm going to sendsome funds from into wasabi so I'm justscanning it now I'm using the samuraiwallet at the moment and there is a belt0.14 Bitcoin in it and I'm sending it inactually two separate chunks and therewill be a reason for thatwhen we see the transactions comethrough so I'm just gonna put thistogether and I'm gonna hit the sendbutton and in a moment we should seethis QR code disappear when thetransaction is is seen as incoming andnow that we've seen that try that QRcode disappear that will that addresswill never be used again and we willalways generate new addresses for eachincoming transaction so if I go up tothe send screen I can now see the amountcoming in listed there and I do now wantto receive the second part of theremaining Bitcoin in that wallet to thiswallet so I'm going to type test togenerate receive address again that iscopy to the clipboard I could paste itin wherever I wanted but I'll obviouslyjust keep this as test two and if Iclick the arrow I've got my QR codethere I'll scan it and they'll send offthe rest and now that it's disappearedwe can go back up to that send screenactually if I did get a notification Ihave two screens going normally that'llpop up in the right-hand side of yourscreen but now we can see two incomingamounts in our wallet and we can see italso in the history screen as well asthe coin join screen so we're just goingto wait for these transactions toofficially confirm on the blockchain andwhen they do we will be back to divedeeper into the walletnow that our transactions have confirmedlet's take a look around the screen tosee what is in front of usnow first off you can see that these areconfirmed because there is a greencheckmark beside each transaction sothey're confirmed on the blockchainsecondly we have this privacy columnhere and if you hover you can see theanonymity setso what wasabi has done is they've got alevel of privacy rating beside each UTXover each set of Bitcoin that has comein to your wallet and if you aresufficiently anonymized this will have agreen shield with a little checkmark inthem and I believe that is set toanything above an enemy set of 50 so wewill be anonymizing these coins via KOINjoin now I can also see these coins in anumber of different screens as I wassaying before now one other thing I'dlike to point out is the differencebetween typical wallets and wasabiwallets so most wallets will show youyour Bitcoin amount in your wallet as asingle pooled amount but as that is atad misleading the way I like to compareit is that this kind of seems like it'sa bank account like you have a bankaccount with a balance in it there's nohistory of specific amounts coming inper se it's just a cool of funds but abetter way to think of it is thatbitcoin is like holding an actualphysical wallet so if somebody gives youa twenty dollar bill a ten dollar billand a five dollar bill all of thoseamounts remain separate within yourphysical wallet and that is the same asBitcoin those amounts that have come inhave remained separate and discernableand both of these incoming amounts alsogiven that bitcoin is on a public ledgerhave a history to them that is auditableso these amounts if I had gotten themvia an exchange or used them to pay fora specificservice from either one of these amountsand those services were linked to myname in any way then that starts topaint a picture for outside observers ofperhaps how much money I have and what Iam spending my money on which is notideal for an individual that wishes toremain privateso that is why coin joint is soimportant because of bitcoins publiclyauditable nature it is up to theindividual to preserve their own privacynow a few things I wanted to point outhere so as I was saying we can see thosecoins in the coin joint screen we cansee them in the history screen and ofcourse in the sand screen as I mentionedbefore now down below in the bottomthere's some stats that you can see youcan see the current Bitcoin price thenumber of peers I'm connected to makingsure that the back end is connected andthat tor is running and what tor does isit helps encrypt your data and keep yourIP address hidden I like to double downon this myself I like to use a VPN I useNord VPN and again it helps hide your IPaddress and encrypt your browsing datato remain privatecongratulations you are ready for yourfirst coin join so what we're gonna dois we're going to click on the coin jointab or if it's not open for you you canagain click over on the right hand menuthere and there are many different waysto select the coins you'd like to joinyou can click on them individually oryou can use the options below select allhe can select all private you can selectall non private coins so a variety ofways that you can use these menus toselect the coins you like to join heresecondly down in the right hand side youcan see a few things number one you cansee I need a minimum of zero point onezero five blah-blah-blah-blah-blahBitcoin which is required to be queuedup for coin joint you can also see thatthere is a coordinator fee of point zerozero three percent per and anima D setwhich is that number here that measureshow anonymous our coins are rememberwe're aiming for an anonymity set offifty but if you multiply that out it isstill a very negligible fee so whatwe're going to be doing here is we'regoing to be selecting all our nonprivate coins and those are the coinsthat we like to join of course we onlyhave non private coins right now but insome instances you may have a mixsecondly I need to type in my passwordand then last I'm going to click inqueue selected coins as soon as I clickthat I can see that they are queued upand if you hover it says this coin iswaiting for its turn to be coin jointnow down below you can see the progressof the coin join and that is measured bythe number of people waiting in line andyou can also see the number ofsuccessful coin joins previously in thewalletso we're waiting for one of two thingsto happen one could be that one hundredof one hundred possible people join thecoin join or a certain amount of timewill pass and it will just executeautomatically with whoever's areto go with their coin joint I believethat time period is 10 minutes at themoment but that could change as the guysthat was Sauvie figure out what's mostefficient but anyways we will wait forone of those two things to happen andonce it has executed and finished wewill return with our mixed coinsall right it took a little while but ourcoins have now been joined andanonymized now as you're doing a coinjoint you may notice some funny thingshappen with these status in the bottomright and that could be just a matter ofsome people wanted to coin join butperhaps they ran at a time had to shutdown their computer and had to drop outof the queue so the numbers there mayflip back and forth but do not worry itwill execute eventually so we can seenow that I have a different set of coinssitting here in my wallet now if younotice remember the minimum requiredthat amount there is the exact amountthat anybody participating in this case71 people in a coin joint will becontributing to and getting out of thecoin joint the reason for this is if allthe amounts were totally different itwould be very easy to track whocontributed and pulled out what but ifit's all the same and helps obfuscatewho contributed what coins and that'swhat keeps it anonymous so looking atthe screen here we can see that I have acouple different amounts I have point105 blah blah blah Bitcoin and I havesome change point 0 3 6 blah blah blahBitcoin the larger number has beencoined joined and has an anonymity setof 79 so I was one of 79 people in theAlaskan joined whereas the change if Ihover over that only has an anonymityset of 1 because it's actually a chunkof change that was originally in mywallet and I just borrowed a little bitof that amount to contribute to theother larger amount in order to haveenough to join the last coin joint andso this anonymous coin is quite separatefrom the unknown saurian D anonymizecoin versus the anonymous coin I do notwant to spend to these together now whyis that well if I were to say try tospend point 1 1 Bitcoin and I needed touse the anonymous coins and then borrowa little bit fromd anonymize coins somebody looking atthe blockchain would say well hey thesecoin joined coins along with these coinsthat along belong to Ben who purchasedthem on you know whatever onlineexchange I purchased them on they werespent together so it stands to reasonthat he actually controls both thesesets of coins and I am no longeranonymous so you need to be very carefulwith the way you spend your coins now acouple other things about this walletyou can now organize these by privacy byclicking on that column and alsofurthermore down at the bottom here youcan also use these selections and itmakes more sense so if I select nonprivate it will obviously select onlythe non mixed coins and I can in queuethose for a coin join if I do haveenough a lot of people will leave changein their wallet and let it build upuntil they have enough to coin joinfurthermore if I want to cancel my coinjoin I can hit the DQ button and it willpull me out of line for another coinjoinand now that our coin duringtransactions are confirmed we are goingto practice sending out Bitcoin from thewasabi wallet to an external wallet nowthis is where we need to be careful withhow we execute transactions becauseremember we have some anonymous and somenon anonymous coins here these arecalled UT exo's these little chunks ofcoins unspent transaction outputs thereyou learned a new term and so what wewant to do is we do not want to mixthese coins together especially giventhat some are anonymous and some are notif I were to spend these two togetherwell somebody on the outside looking inthat knew I owned the not anonymouscoins would be able to see them spenttogether and then decipher the fact thatI am holding both of these so reallysimple to send out you select the coinsyou put in the address and you send themout after putting in your password butagain we do not want to send thesetogether so rather than selecting all Iwould like to select just the specificcoins that I'm sending out it's alwaysbest to spend out a single you TXO evenif both were anonymous it's not ideal tospend them together because if somethinghappens that DN onna mises you in someway in the future you can mitigate yourrisk by keeping these separate but ifthey are combined well then you just aanonymized all of your coins as opposedto a smaller ut Exocet so just keep thatin mind is some of these practices canbe tricky but you will get the hang ofit over time so what I'm gonna do hereis I'm gonna select only the anonymouscoins which I've clicked off and now Ineed an address now unfortunately wasabiwallet does not have a QR code scannerif you have a desktop wallet you cancopy and paste one in there butgoing to use a tool to scan really quickfrom my phone and once I have copiedthat address I can just paste it in thenI'm going to if I want to label it I canI'm just gonna type in samurai and thisis preference whatever you decide to putin there is fineI'm gonna send the max amount so theentire chunk of coins that I've selectedand then you can slide your fee toadjust for how urgent the transaction isyou can see it estimates it in time howlong it is expected to be spendable Ifind that wasabi tends to overestimatethis which is just fine by me becauseit's a pleasant surprise if it confirmsquicker and finally I just need to putin my password and then click sendtransaction and so it takes a second tosend out as it's signing you notice thatit disappears from the main menu thereand then I get a confirmation messagedown below that it was successfully sentso now we can see that I only have the Danonymized coins here and it's alsoreflected in my balance in the top rightand I can see in the history that I havean outgoing transaction there in thecoin joint screen only the change isleft now I should say here if I wantedto send out less than the total amountin a particular UTX o I could click thatamount paste in my address and thenspecify a Bitcoin amount before enteringmy password and sending it out so justkeep that in mind but more or less thatis it congratulations you've done yourfirst coin joint and mastered the wasabiwallet for the most part of course ifyou do have questions
