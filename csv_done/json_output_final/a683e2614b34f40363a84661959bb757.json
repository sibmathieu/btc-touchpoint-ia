  "text": "Jeff how are you I'm good buddy how areyou well I actually I never thought I'dsee Jeff Booth in Bedford me neither notat 4am well what we did see you befoream it was a late night it was a latenight well welcome to Bedford thank youfor coming all this way uh it's a realhonor to have you here for this fortonight and for the football yeah it'sgonna be gonna be a blast it's alreadyfun you're gonna see us get the trophyyeah um that will be a late nightso listen lookwe've made a bunch of shows before and Ihave an observation about your book andmy observation is is that it of all theBitcoin books it takes people I thinkthe longest to fully understand becauseI think you have to see what's playingout in society to really understand yourthesis and I think it's a bit like theMatrix You observe the world you see theworld you see the markets you see what'shappening and you see it through theJeff Booth lens the price of tomorrowwhereas I think people like me and Dannyare still seeing it for what it is forwhat we're being toldI hope that makes sense yeah I think youeven said last night you spoke to LukeRoman and he clicked for him during aduring a call and and so we want to getback into the thesis want to go back tothe startuh and we want to try and see the worldhow you see it okay so you're sure yeahno no I do because I think I nearly gotit last night and I said to Danny Ithink what it is isyou you are fully pricing everything inBitcoin and seeing everything underBitcoin terms in a way that I think I ambut I'm not rightand I want to get to that point where Ireally understand what you're seeing solet's go back like can you outline yourdeflation thesis the one you talk aboutin the bookso wherever you start here right it'sit's that starting point is really hardbecause we're measuring that's ourexisting system from the system and soit's hard to start in an entirely newparadigm unconnected from that so sowhat I try to do is I say what what arethe kind of the economic rulesin in life right what would what wouldthat look like and and one of thoserules is prices fall to the marginalcost of production rightif you start there and nobody has everchallenged me on that what some peoplesay well not if you regulate an industryright well do explain explain to peopleyou mean by the marginal cost ofproduction because some people might noteven understand that yeah so let's goodlet's dig deeper but start with pricesperiod exclamation mark prices fall tothe marginal cost of production rightover a long enough time Horizonyou can regulate an industry first tostop it right you can and then thattechnology keeps moving and it movesoutside of your area that you'veregulated to a different domain thathasn't regulated and then that attacksthe the incumbent or the regulatedindustry but over a long enough timeHorizon prices fall to the marginal costof productionumwhat does that look like in real lifeand why so now let's take the calculatorapp when it came on the first calculatorapp on on the iPhone you paid for itright or or or they monetized it throughadvertising but they were making moneyfrom it otherwise no no entrepreneurwould have created the calculator appright so they were creating a businessand next entrepreneur next oh I cancreate a better calculator app and theyprice it downto be able to win the market nextentrepreneur more and more and more andbetter and better and better untilthere's no money left in calculator appsright and now if you go to the App Storeyou'll see 50 calculator apps competingfor your attention they're all free andin it's ludicrous if somebody said toyoutwo things if somebody said hey I have acalculator app it's going to cost thirtydollars a month you'd laugh them out ofyour house it would be ludicrous on theother side if somebody came to me as faras as an investor in the ecosystem saidI have this great idea for a calculatorappI wouldn't take the call so we can seeit happening we can see it happening allaround us and it's because what ends uphappening is when there is money in theeconomic incentiveand a market that allows you to rewritethe rules to more value for peoplethe market moves there no matter whatand it attacks those marginsuntil they're freeare there exceptions to the rule forexample luxury products so so so let'sagainI don't think over the long enough timeHorizon there's any exceptions to thatrulethe the nowtoday if you're measuringin a world where where where where themeasurement itself is all unmanipulatedmoneythen people want to matter so much theywant to look good to society so muchthat they'll pay almost anything tostand out from the crowdright but over a long enough timer andthat's in the existing system so so yeswill people with money pay more forcertain things or more for Value whatthey're actually doing no matter whatthat economic calculation is in theirhead they're saying this has value to meI guessI want to phrase that slightlydifferentlythere's there's a luxury car and aluxury car won't go to the marginal costof production because it's you know twothree hundred thousand pound carbut there will be other cars in themarket which will hit that marginal isthat what is that what we're saying soso play this on a long enough timeHorizon even on a car or food so whatare the inputs for that and if when Oncethe all of the inputs are essentiallyrobot Robotics and AI merging to be ableto drive cost way downcan that valuekeep climbingright because if it kept climbingunnaturally because you make is becauseit's climbing today because you'remaking up more monetary units to make itclimb right abundance and money equalsscarcity everywhere else that's theParadigm we live in todayum then it'll keep rising in those termsbut what's actually happening and what'sactually happening on bitcoin becauseit's outside of that systemis it it's pricing it's actually notgoing upit's staying stableum and yes it's going up in Fiat termsbut it's a better better way to look atit that everything in price forever willfall against Bitcointhat's what I said to you this morningokaybut in that environmentyou will still have companies competeand some are going to compete on pricebut also there are scenarios wherepeople compete on service so they canmaintain their own margins and and nowplay that forward yeah so all prices arefalling yep and some people are able tooffer more value for freewhat would happen to the people that arethat are charging more more for theirserverswell I think it depends on how betterthe service is and who the people arebuying from them exactly just like itdoes today yeah so each person is makinga decision that you can't see before theagain we're measuring the world fromthis system and we're carrying ourbaggage from the one we live in into thenew one and it works exactly opposite soso how do you see the world youobviously see the world that we're notliving yeah you can visualize it whatare you seeing that I don't seethat's why I said prices fall to themarginal cost of production right so ifyou know that that's that's going tohappen over long enough time Horizon andif you merge if you said thatproductivity so two things prices followthe marginal cost of production themarginal cost of production everywhereis falling exponentially because of AIRobotics and it's going to fall fasterand faster and fasterand what's happening it's actuallychicken and egg what came first the debtis a response and the manipulation ofmoney is a response to that that massiveproductivity gain that should be flowingto society in the form of lower pricesbeing stolen and concentrated at the topthrough manipulation of money because ithas to stop that deflation because ifthe deflation was allowed to happenall of the banks would fail all of theall of everything would fail your way oflife would fail tomorrow and talk methrough why they would fail because whatme what that deflation would mean andthat's where people conflate to thedifference about deflation that debtdeflation the the debt in the world isalready insolvent so the debt needs toinflate exactly the doubt is so we livein a world effectively a make-believeworldum wherewhere that debt is already insolvent andwe pretend it's solventright everybody we pretend it solve itdo you mean the debt as a whole ratherthan individual debts because some debtsup hey you know aren't insolvent so soyou live in a system where the entiresystem is insolvent yeah and you'resupposed to try to remain solvent soyou're playing by different rules yeahthan the system plays and at the top ofthat systemif you're too big to failyou get paled out by the taxpayer overand over and over again so what ends uphappening is everybody races to try tobe too big to fail it creates thingsvery incentivethatum uh to make essentially theft a baselayer in the economyand what would the mere reflection ofsociety look like if you had theft as abase layer of every traderight because that's what it looks likewho would win in that environmentand theft is a harsh word right and sopeople don't oh no it's not theft welltell me what it islike actually so if it's not theft youdon't vote for it you don't vote forinflation all right you don't have youdon't have a saythat more more monetary units arecreated and and you thinkyou think what's happening is maybe asimple way to do it is thisimagine well you don't have to there'seight billion people in the world let'ssay there's eight eight billion monetaryunits right and 8 billion is not toohard for your mind to understand onceyou get to trillions your brain justbreaks right and so 400 trillion is alot of money right that it's just yourmind can't comprehend that but eightbillion people eight billion monetaryunits of those monetary units in theworld you have two of them I have one ofthem Danny has half of oneif magically the next day there's 16billion monetary unitsdid wealth go up in the world nope okaysame just a different measurementabundance and money creates scarcityeverywhere else so what ends uphappening is but you think it didbecause you're you're for I mean you'reyou're two if it didn't go to fourthen you got your pocket picked so ifthe distribution was equal everythingwould be remain the same exactly butwhat ends up happening is is the therich get more of thatin that in because the rich have more ofthe assets that don't move right more ofthe stocks that take that value and thepoor inflation is wage deflation yeahright so the poor if you don't haveaccess to to uh just to all of thestocks land everything else the thingsthat are holding value better thanothers they're all losing value rightbut they're all some are holding valuebetter than others then then you'reyou're two going to four if it went tothree you would think you were winningbecause you wouldn't we weren'tmeasuring this and the person that it 50cents that went to 55 cents and got hergot a raise right or or half a monetaryunit they think they're getting a raiseand they're getting their pocket pickedlike crazy because they're measuringthat system from the system that's beingmanipulatedso the there is an incentive thereforeto hold debtsespecially at the right interest rate soyou know this house I've bought I've gota two percent Mortgage in an environmentwhere we're living with11 inflation in the UKLuke Roman said to me just this thisweek that he expects which we'll getinto yeah a high double digitinformation perhaps even triple uh digitinflation I'm actually a beneficiary ofthat scenario yeah and if you had if youhad 20 housesyou're more of a beneficiary if you'reblock BlackRock and you're using thatand and you can't lose because you knowthat you're too big to failthen you can leave her up like crazyand you can buy effectively everythingand then rents go up and and again it'spicking the pocket of of any any workingclass any productive member of societyit favors the rent Seekers and then wecall those rent Seekers the eliteand it's all based on theft okay so thetheft itselffor me implies aa conscious active theft and so I reallywant to understanduh who are the thieves who are the justthe I don't consider myself a thief butI'm benefiting from this and so I'vealways tried to understand is this anorganic system of incentives or arethere peopleactively involved in this who understandthe benefitsso so would some people understand thebenefits and turn a blind eye absolutelythe majority it's a system reinforcingand people telling themselves that theyhave to keep this going because if theydon't keep it going the world collapsesand actuallydoes it does yeah and so you couldeasily tell yourself if you're BernieSanders or the Warren and your baseis is telling you how much they love youbecause you're attacking big interestsbig um and you're going to redistributethattheir their whole feedback mechanismthey will disconfirm evidence that whatwe're talking about because theirfeedback mechanism from their base thatis hurt the worsttells them how great they areright and for them to unwind theirbelief systemto face the truthmeansthat a lot of the people that they saythey're helping they're hurting the mostand that would be a really hard thing tothat's actually why these things justfeed back it would have to tear downtheir entire belief systemrebuild it on something that actuallyhelps their baseand that's too it's people don't want tohear that right it it tears them downit's too big a it's too big a shiftit's just too hard to believe and so youso it's easier just to sayI'm doing the best I can in the systemright and and be a cog in that wheeland that that whole system gets more andmore unstableand other things start to happen that'sactually why if you like the greatestgame article I wrote was written inNovember of 2020.you could look at it right nowand see exactly where we arein the system change right you could youcould see exactly what step by step hasto happen exactly in the existing systemI talked about proxy wars coming rightand and and what had to happen I talkedabout cbdc's long before cbdc's or kindof people are talking about it andthat's just starting right I talkedaboutwhat eventually the banks will be whythe banks will move to bitcoin becausethey have to right because otherwisetheir power is going to be taken awaythrough the government because if youhave a direct direct distribution thenyou canum so all of these things if you justlook at that article you can see exactlywhere we are in this transition fromsystems and that's why I don't give theexisting system a lot of energywhen all of these things that I knowwere going to happen and all the nextthings that I know are going to happenokay it's just noise it's boost yournumbers I now get ego death Capital aswell that's the perfect nameOkay soso I spoke to Luke and Luke said to mevery casuallythat he sees 100 inflation coming yeahand we know that Argentina's just goneback over 100 inflation Bitcoin has justhit an all-time high I'm not sure if yousaw Preston's incredible tweet but saidtry and uh try and stop Argentinianseeing this yeahbut in my mind I know the country I livein has had high inflation beforebut when I see 100 inflation I think aLebanon turkey Argentina I do not thinkof the US or the UK or Europeand Luke's explanation is that there'sso much debt in the systemthere is there's only two answersthere's two forms of default there's ahard default and a softer fall a harderFalls unpalatable so it has to be asofter fall it has to be throughinflationand he said you could do multiple yearsof 10 20 inflation they'll take a longtime and he said the best thing is ashort sharp shock two three years of 100inflation like Israel and bring down thedebt to GDP back to 50 percentand then the party starts again soso he's right on the we we talked aboutthis probably on our first podcast orcertainly a second the exact same thingthere's two doors right there's alwaysbeen two doors hard default 400 trilliondollars of hard hard default and all ofthismonetary units that and all the blackpools of money everything collapsingthat day would look like thisthree days later you'd walk to yourgrocery storewhich would be closed you try to getfood off the shelf would be be closedit'd be complete chaos ever everywhereand if you look at countries that gothrough thatit looks dystopian right that's what itthat so that would come immediately andthat's why so okay so it's just it's notjust unpalatable politicallyit's also dangerous it's dangerous andand here's the thing you wouldn't votefor itwe are so we we believe like if you livein Twitter universe right or BitcoinTwitter you believe because a lot ofpeople would sayhow dare the FED do that how dare thegovernment do that well they at the sametimewould vote for more of it because iftheir way of life collapsedright they think what everyone elseshould do yet not themselves as a personas a cog in that system and what thatwould look like that would look like yougo back to the stone ages and you'rebartering for everything and Bitcoinwould do really well in that environmentbecause it would be the only thing thatwould kind of retain value value butthere's a whole bunch of underintendedconsequences that would it would be uglyit'd be really ugly if that was and andyou can see what that looks like forcountries that don't have their currencyright don't have the reserve currencybecause it looks like that right and andand it looks like that and how do theyget out of it nowwhy that has implications for Bitcoinand why this is going to take a longtime to play outisif those people knewVenezuela Lebanon turkeythen then you would think that Bitcoinwould have 100 penetration therebut it doesn'tit doesn't it probably doesn't have fivepercent penetrationso why at 100 inflationdo people not change and that's a cluefor you wouldn't change either or youwould I would but most peoplewhat what Luke's talking about is theyget the rug pulland what would what would that look likein Venezuela say for examplecomparatively to the rest of the worldthey just got their their currencydevaluedand now businesses given it if it was adecent government infrastructure nowbusinesses go back and invest in therebecause they're cheaper than the worldworld right so everybody that's just gotdestroyed wiped out decides to play thegame againright because they think they're winningbecause now you have this economicadvantage and it actually strengthensthe US dollar right what ends uphappening is the U.S essentially isstrip mining the worldwhoa that's what we spoke about withAlex krenstein really it's but but thatfunction yeah and all of those peopletherethink they're now now they're winningnow then you now take that into thebricks and what the bricks are doinganddo you believe is it reasonable tobelieve that with China's debt to GDPwithout the black pools of money rightwithout the what's not knownyou have kind of 350 percent debt to GDPwhich is completely it's no country inthe world has ever created more debtfaster so China's Miracle growth miraclewas a debt miracle that is coming due 25of their economyabout 25 was was housingwhich which is coming due it's notproductive assets it's store of value tobe able to stop this and it's coming duethere's no way to grow out grow to growout of that especially when that growthright remember prices fall to theproduct matter Trump growthshould be making debt more expensivebecause growth is deflationaryin our world does that make sense rightso when people talk about growth whatthey what they should be saying isprices should be falling faster becausemost of that growth is on Railsthat bring prices downso what would a true measure ofgrowth be because you can't just measureprices you have to have consumptionalongside those prices to know so truetrue measure of growth is isproductivity productivity how do youmeasure productivity is that ours workedproductivity is is price is fallingis so so so so you have a mismeasure ofgrowth and so if as you take more thingsout of the GDP calculation photoscalculator apps all of these thingsvideos zoom all of these things asautomation does that work and those jobsare replaced or by automationthen prices should falland that's net negative GDP so then whatmakes up the difference in GDP there'sless thingsto be able to manipulate up in price sothe GDP figures that a quote I evenheard it this morning I'll come back tothat but the quotation or use of GDPfigures is part of the gaslighting yeahit's not part of the gaslighting theyactually believe it oh they believe itthey believe it because this conceptwhat you started with prices falling tothe marginal cost of productioneffectivelymy book could have had one linetechnology is deflationary deal with itbecause if that's truethan an inflationary system must stealthat productivity gain that should flowto society and it must concentrate it upinto some people's hands to be able toto uh to uh to make that work so whyhave they been able to steal it fromsome parts of the economy but thingslike TVs they just haven't been able tosteal that why why is that so so againyou're Miss you're mismeasuring you knowthat chart that when you say kind ofwhat all the some something yeah allthings would start at zero and fall inprice yeah all things yeah what you'reseeing some things falling in price andsomething is rising it's relative isrelative to this to the systemand so all of those things so TVs wouldhave fallen a lot faster computers wouldhave fallen a lot faster phones wouldhave fallen a lot faster but houseswould have fallen too becauseenergy would have fallen too there'sbeen productivity gains in all of thoseIndustries right all of those Industrieswould have seen falling pricesright so what really is happening iswith the mass increase in debtcausing them a redistribution of incomeunfairly to the haves to the to thehouse against the haves not and wheneverything repricesit will kind that we would there'll besome proportionality to it but thepoorest will come out worse and theriches will survive itfrom the existing system because the pieis still one size exactly all we'redoing is we're using debt toredistribute the pie unfairly so exactlythe debts are already in solvent so whoare you going to let win who are yougoing to like uh lose the debt'sinsolvent and so if people haveleveraged up that debt that's alreadyinsolvent and you make the money cheaperthey pay back the debt in cheaper termsbut if they leave her at the wrong timeand you have deflationthen they get wiped out too yeah rightso you're playing you're playing areally scary game at this and this kindof end of days on a on it's not end ofdays on a financial system but lots ofevents could happen to flip it one wayand if you don't have enough time inthat if you've all in on a system andthat it doesn't go your way you're wipedout so you really should have some debtsome creditI think about it as a barbell strategyyeah right what happens in the so playthe probabilities of different differentevents right it lets you let's usebiology is bad I believe biology is badis essentially just a marketing play tobe able to come backand be all in Bitcoin and kind of washhis hands of all the Bitcoin motionorange I I think so no he might he mightactually now get it and and he might butthese are the same things like that batis the same thing that bitcoiners havebeen talking about for a long long timeand the probability of him winning thebat is to me so infinitesimally small II can't assign a zero probability butwhat that actually means if he wins abat is you had a non-linear collapse ofthe exact entire Financial system yeahwhat we already talked about is in someNations as because it's going to happenin the U.S last right in some Nations asas their currencies break down they makethat system stronger so I I don't thinkhe's right at all and and and in thosecountries if you measured what do thosepeople do they don't all move to bitcoinright they stay in the system they getthey get killed and then they believethey go to the dollar Fair sometimes soso a friend of mine uh who who climbsmountains for uh for kind of hospitalsand uh kids with cancerum he was flying into McKinleyum and and as he's as he's flying in Ithink they had to land kind of an uphillice slope or something like thatsomething like it might have been Imight be getting it wrong it might havebeen Nepal but uh but it was eitherMcKinley scary either way they're flyingin and he sees this plane rolled overand he's talking to the pilot andeverything else says they're flying in Ithink it was and he says I guess thatAirlines owed a business and the pilotgoes no no that's this Airlineum and because everyone died andeverything else in this Airline andwhere Russ looks at him and the guy goespeople forgetbut again what you're talking about yeahArgentina orthe system has so much power over themand they're measuring the system by thesystem and they just okay people forgetwhat Luke's talking about is when Israelwould quickly devalue their currencyand then everything's good againpeople forgotright and each wave of that is going tocreate more bitcoinersand each wave of that is going to kindof Harden Bitcoin more and more and atsome point there's there's thistransition but if you're living inBitcoin if you're actually measuringfrom Bitcoin the only thing withoutcounterparty risk to that debtlike everything in the world hascounterparty risk to that debt exceptfor Bitcoinhence choke point 2.0 exactly so but butif if you're measuring from Bitcoin thenthen you then you're seeing pricesfalling to the marginal cost ofproduction everywhereand and that was the point I was tryingto make as I think that's what you'redoingand I think that's I think I get it nowI think it's clickedbecause units are increasing all thetime Bitcoin there is a fixed number ofunits and so even when I talked aboutthe luxurycar it's cheaper in Bitcoin terms nowBingo than it was four years ago andit'll keeping in four years it'll be waycheaper in Bitcoin termsI get itI see exactly what you're saying in inthe existing system has to try to stopthat and if we think operation chokepoint is something if you haven't evenseen the half of what's going to come totry to stop that now now remember theexisting system that everybody believesin If this just clicked for youimagine how many times we've talkedabout this right yeah imagine how kindof that's why when you look at my bookit's going to predict so all of thisthing all of these things and you cansee the next steps out of the actionsthat have to happen from the existingunsustableunsustainable system even if there's aninflationary period andbitcoin's value in dollars goes up butthe purchasing power of dollars dropsthat's irrelevant because at some pointthey have to still devalue the currencybecause you can't end up with onetrillion dollar notes like but at thatpoint so many people have moved intoBitcoin anyway it's still trendedtowards the marginal cost of productionso either way they cannot do anythingabout it that's that's that's exactly ityou're measuring the world differentlyyou're measuring the you're measuringthe world in something that can't bemanipulated you're measuring the you'remeasuring the accurate if prices fall tothe marginal cost of production overtime and the marginal cost of productionis falling exponentially because oftechnology and it's everywhere then theonly way you could measure thatis through a fixed monetary unit thatcouldn't be manipulated everything elsewould be a mismeasurement but we live inthe mismeasurement we all of our jobsare in the mismeasurement or not mostpeople and more and more and more peopleare moving into the right measurementand they're starting to see what whatI'm sayingso proxy wars are they mint are theyused as a distraction look over heredon't see here hence is this why Chinais uhposturing against Taiwan is that forproductivity gains is that to is that adistraction why I can't remember why youwrote there'll be proxy wars yeah soit's so I wrote that in the book and Iwrote it in in that uh in that greatestgame article because you could see howdo you get elected in that cycleso so first first let's take our ownindividual actions yeah firstand let let's let's saytoday a politician says okay Jeff'sright prices fall with a marginal costof production right and this is whatwe're going to do we're going to letthem fallright that means next year hey votersyou're going to actually make less realor you're going to make less money butin real terms your income is going to goup because prices are going to go fasterthan your wages decline no one willunderstand it they think you're a Madmanthey think you're a Madman there's noway you would elect that person rightyou so so so the point is you can'tchange the system from inside the systemno one can we wouldn't allow it tohappen you have to have something sostrong decentralized secureto stop ourself-interest from stopping stopping ityou have to take to take that out of ourhands because we want to we pretend wedon't want to vote for somebody who willsay it's okay we're going to give youmore money but we all do too you'd thinkthat person's a Madman well do you thinkbouquetie gets it and this is his planor do you think it's something do youthink he doesn't get in it's more do youthink he's like a loose Bitcoin or doyou think he fully sees thisI don't I don't know okay I don't Idon't know I guess if he does what agenius because he's done it in a verysubtle way he's done it without tellingthem so he if you would listen to hisstuff far before he was elected he was abitcoiner before he was elected yeah andthis gave El Salvador a massive way toget out of the existing system that theywere trapped in and and all of the crimein El Salvador all of the other justlike Africa just like all of thesecountries are trapped in this Vortexgets worse and worse and worse they haveno way outhe knew about Bitcoin before he waselected and if you look at some of theinterviews him talking about it sothere's a chance he does know this wowand there's a chance that he is actuallybuilding everythingtowards this now even if he wasn'tthough even like if you that's actuallywhy I try not to get into thepersonalities rightevery actor makes Bitcoin Stronger Yeahwhether whether you hate them or likethem right if if he's not doing it inthe best interest of his population itactually doesn't matter because hispopulation is winningyeah and and it'll remove and it removesdictator Powers over time it puts itgives the power to the people so whetherhe's doing it for the right reasons orthe wrong reasonsyou know um it actually doesn't matterbut but he could be a geniusin and he doesn't need to be he doesn'tneed to bethe second order effects ofof aGlobal Reserve currency that has a fixedlimit a true fixed limit yeah evenbetter than golduh it's it'struly unreal it's when you think if ifit games out exactly as you say whichhas been pretty good so faris truly unreal so that so so so why whycould you why would this be so hard tosee right why yeah because all of ourhistory books every single differentwhen we actually say reserve currencywhat we actually mean is something tomake a debt based system workright yeah it carries with it all thebaggage of all the other things rightand that's why okay gold if I'm the newReserve currency tied to gold now I cancreate more monetary units and and andand I'm winning as as an ex as andothers are losing by that same thing fora while it looks like everybody'swinning but because of triff and dilemmaright then then even if you looked atthe us right nowtheir entire industrial military complexis being outsourced to other nationsand they have no way to bring it backbecause because if you brought it backthe cost is too high to bring it backso soto be able to restart their industrythey have to have lower labor ratescompared to the worldand the way the world works today theyhave higher labor rates and it's allbased on debt they're the only purchaserof the world so if you've got all thebricks to countries together and there'snobody to buy this stuff and all theirtheir most of their their drivers areare raw materials to purchase things tobe able to sell to the US and there's nobuyerthe whole thing doesn't workand so if you just and so why people getcaught in that they're anchored to asystem and all the history bookseverything else always looked like thissystem restarting Wars reset thecurrency winner of the war reset resetsthe rules starts againand and most of thoseand if you'd never seen something thatcould be decentralized and secure rightthat didn't have to have that right thenyou have a base layer that doesn't needan institution for its kind of Reserveright you have you have a bearerinstrument asset in the base base layerthat nobody can change the rules rightthat's a that'sthrough history we've never had that soit would be it would be an invention orbe a discovery that would change forwardand all of the other models lookingbackwards would have some sort ofdistortion in them is that fair yeah nowif you on Layer Two added velocityunlimited velocity to that moneybecause it acts as a network instead ofgold gold and you didn't have to replacea debt based system on top of thisbecause you had unlimited velocity witha bearer instrument in itthen the debt that was needed to be ableto drive that to those economies isn'tneeded to be able to drive this the thefuture economiesin in that Network growing and growinggrowing is what we're talking aboutrepricing all of the all of the existingsystem is going to be repriced into thatNetworksee all of this before you saw Bitcoin Ido recognize this I recognized thisbefore I saw Bitcoin Bitcoin became fromfor me and I I think I told you thisbefore I was a holder of Bitcoin but asmall holder and almost test trying tosee what it was but I actually hadn'tdone the work to be able to to defendcould this win against what was comingcould this remain decentralized securewhen you when you aggregate all ofa system that's ten thousand timesbigger than Bitcointhat everyone operates in and tries tomake that makes stronger and strongerevery time they're yelling at thatsystemevery time they're marching on thestreets and breaking windows every timethey go to war to another againstanother country they're strengtheningthat systemthey're giving more power to that systemeverything's good for Bitcoin that'swhat Aries but but they're they'reliterally making that sis but againbecause think about those Wars and thinkabout the broken windows and think aboutwhere does the money come to replace itand and those people will go homeafter they march on the streetand and then all of a sudden magicallyall of the windows get fixed where didmoney come from it comes from morerobbing people what was the number wesaw this morning which number the debtohum I can't remember let me pull up thedebt clockbut again even even that like it'saccelerating it has to accelerate yeahso so remember in my book I said I eventalked about this that debt that itgrownyou had 185 trillion dollars of new debtin the preceding 20 years for 46trillion dollars of global economicgrowth so there's essentially a four toone debt for for growth rightif you ran your personal finances likethatand it had to grow four to one for everyproduct you're kind of be screwed yeahit's the same thing same thing here theown that's but and and it has to andbecause technology is driving one wayfaster and faster and faster the debthas to has to grow the manipulation ofmoney now because the debts are alreadyinsolventhas to grow at an offsetting Pace it'sjust an exponential pattern that is amirror image of the other exponentialpatternwas it 1.4 trillion for the year so faryep oh that's uh is that total deficitbudget deficit for the year so that'sgoing to be way worse like uh I'll takethe because what they're doing is in inthe US they're looking at a laggingindicator of tax receipts from thestimulus okay which is about to collapseand as Jobs collapse too there's goingto be it would need to be way more moneyfrom governmentbecause people are going to sayotherwise they're going to be out on thestreetright and so as as those jobs collapseand those people have mortgages andeverything else if that were to happeninstead of having a atrillion as they're projecting I thinkthey're projecting a one and a halftrillion dollar deficit this year it'llbe a it'll be a four trillion dollardeficit well I mean it's 1.4 trillionnow four months in yeah yeah so yeahyeah it'll be and and and if if youallowed things to roll over when I sayroll over if you tightenedum to the point that the debt startsunwindingit could be way worse than that so thatif that's a full shorter border ofmagnitude worse that's like 75 debt toGDP in a single year it's it's like it'snot it's the but that's it but it's beennuts for a long time it's just anexponential pattern yeah people keeptalking about it like it's a surprisethis is why reset is required it's it'sno surprise it has to it has to happenlike all of this stuff and is it has toresolve itself one way or the other andand you you talked about operation chokepoint well can I come to that just onebecause I've got one question I've gotbefore that leads up to that you saidyou were nominally invested in Bitcoin Iassume you're a bit deeper now we won'task how much but I seem like me justirresponsibly longumbut are you a gold bug as well and thereason I asked this is I I have cash nowthat at the moment I follow in the lootconversation I'm like well I don't wantto hold this cashbut I don't want to go all in Bitcoinbecause of choke point I have some fearsaround that but I don't fear a chokepoint around gold so I've been thinkingof uh but and I say this I see this forthe listeners as well who may bequestioning the same I was thinking Ishould probably have some property Ishould probably have some cashto probably have some gold and I shouldprobably have a lot of Bitcointhat's probably a decent strategy am I agold bug noum do I do I understand the gold bugargument and could it resolve itselfin a short term to uh to Gold couldenough countries agree to a new goldstandard or force that through pricingoil and gold like like the brics nationsare trying to uh trying to do could thathappen and it could be one way toresolve some of this potentially I seeit as unlikely in the long term now itfor me it's more like the short-termcash savings which I hold I'm nowthinking of just holding that in Goldrather than cashso so I would suspect that and andthat's why I said this barbell strategyyou want some cash I've got some cashyou want to keep and you want to keepsome cash because ifif just play the probabilities out Ithink what's happening today is the backdoor window for the funding mechanismfor the US is doing is essentiallychoosing who they're going to save inEurope and otherwisebecause they don't want China the Chinais using that currency as a weaponagainst the us too and so they'recutting people off from that system andchoosing who to saveso the the whole savingum Saving Credit Suisse or brokeringthat deal right and being is is abackdoor funding mechanism to who doeswhich which institutions are going tosave which ones are going to let failholder that makes me think Nordstrom wascut cutting somebody out of that systemso a lot of these things are the thethis this game is a geopolitical gamenow this is this is how to and it hasbeen for a long time okaycan we talk about AI yeahthat's a lot to take in uh I I see theworld differentlyfrom 45 minutes to an hour agoI get it a lot more is that helpful toyou you're gonna say yeah no I alreadygot that no no I wasjusttell me where it gets everythingum okay let's talk about AI I find thatAI fascinating Danny every day isshowing me new cool stuff today heshowed me something uh you know how likewhen a rapper releases a new album ifthey have a guest appearance from afamous rapper that's that can be careermaking he showed me a thing this morningwhere a guys use AI to have Jay-Z as aguest wrapper on his video it's notJay-Z It's just AI doing it and so everyday we're seeing all this cool stuff andmaybe it's not really artificialintelligence it's just super smartprogram but either wayit's a new boom that we're starting tosee there's a lot of investment a lot ofinterest a lot of cool things happeninguh debates about when we get age outlike all this is happening but justgenerally this this obviously reallyrelates to your work your kind ofobservations of the future what is yourhulch what's your general take on AIfirst so General take and I wrote twochapters on AI a general purposetechnology that is going to be smarterthan us and people get scared of it orexcited by by by it's going to take alljobs tomorrow or it's going to make memore efficient in both of those it'seventually going to take all jobsand because marginal cost productionFalls zero it's gonna be better atthings then it's going to merge withrobots and not just the robot humanoidsthat you think it would look like everyversion of types of robots that could dodifferent things than we could imaginetodayum but but it no it's part of it is andICS actually beingshould we go here or notwe've been having some prettyexistential chats about this okay so solet's let's just play forward becausethat's what I talked about in the bookright I talked about all humanintelligence is is error correctionhuman intelligence is error correctionand we stand on the shoulders of otherpeople who have gone before us and thosemodelswe're constantly trying to correctand make better in service of humanityright in service of our own needs makinglife better and when we create thingsthat are better for other people we winmore of the economic pie that's what theworld looks like right it's always looklike that we and we forget all of thethings we're living on top ofum in all of this so we we don't have wedon't have to think about relativitytoday yeah we're we're a couple hundredyears ago people had to kind of figureout all of these things we don't have tofigure out Maxwell's equations orFaraday lines that led to Maxwell'sequations to drive ourtelecommunication systems we just allrely on we don't think of those thingsbecause they're now models that are soprovenand the world just works right theyweren't always proven and we used tohave to think really hard and lifedidn't look like it looks like todaybecause people couldn't figure that outand those insights then moved to thesemodels and we are cracked on top ofthose models Fair that's all we do yeahum and so human intelligence isliterally error correctionand a global kind of driving that andand what that effectively what thatmeans isor a different way to look at that isall we are on an evolutionary scale isone rung in in a ladder searching forwe're limited energy we ourselves arelimited energy limited storage andlimited computeand and we're connectedthrough Trustand division of labor to do certainthingsmicro things better than others and wetrade our time for somebody else's timethat does that other thing betterright that's what the Glo that's whatand and so we create a super computer ofus all of those limited energy limitedstorage and limited brain brains computewe create a super computer it's limitedit was almost an unlimited supercomputerthat we just we actually project wethink about what the world could looklikeand we're constantly doing that alltogether to try to make that that worldbetterand it's connected through trust andmoneyand and then what ends up happening inthat is in for a long timethe bigger the citiesthe bigger the super compute right somore people race to the citiesand you could see a power law in asmaller town had had less supercomputeand the Tiny Town had very littlecompute so not much happened there rightand you could see that create that powerthat power lawand if you run a counter factual to thatright what about where broken money in abig citywhat does it look like in Mexico City doyou have that same type of innovationcoming out of that or do people nottrust each other as much right and whatyou can see is is or take it take adifferent city that has kind of hadcurrency failure and there's a trust youbreak the bonds of the supercomputerright so you can see that that that nowwhen when I saythat limited energy limited storage andlimited compute now take giant waves ofprosperity for Humanity or or phasetransitions for Humanity phasetransitions came when one of those threeor two of those threechangedprinting presswas a massive change in storageright so we're searching for morestoragebecause we have limited and before thatwe had to tell stories and those storieslost Fidelity over timeand now our stories can be put intobooks all all our thoughts and it couldrun it run into storageand when there's more storageand more brains connected to thatstorage you have more compute right andand you have this massive Innovationthat happens as a result of it look atthe UK UK against that same the samething or uh or the British Empirewas created by a higher form of energycoolagainstthat storage and computethe U.S was a higher form of energy thanin the coal in oilagainst that sort and that that functionhas essentially made us and drivenlimited storage limited uh compute uhlimited sorry limited energy limitedstorage limited compute that is Who WeAreon an ever-ending Journeyto find more energymore storage or compute and when we findmore energy more storage more computeSociety it expands so what's happeningright now is that's that storage is nowmoving into a computer Which is far moreeffective than an analog version of abookand it's now Computing on its ownand it's learning on its own and now youhave Auto GPT that has actually justreferencing other layers of informationand creating more learningand getting faster and faster and fasterthat's that's overtaking our ability andeventually what's going to end we'regoing to search for we're going toconstantly searching for more energyright and be able to feed thatwhich we'll doright all in service it eventually whatit'll look like it's not the AI againstus I don't suspect we this iswe hope it it'll look like um it'll looklike we will merge with machines it'sthe next Evolution the the nextevolution is when the musk you know muskscenario uh neural link so whether so sofrom the existing systemthat it that AI will be used against youyou will be your slave in the systembecause it'll be Consolidatedum up to up to whether it's governmentwhether it's and uh whether it's ElonMusk whether in fact anybody who is notin favor of prices falling to themarginal cost of production kind ofdriving Bitcoin anybody who's in favorofof essentiallystopping prices from falling isessentially saying I'm voting tocentralize all power in somebody's handsright right okay that's what they'rethat's what they're doingunintentionally maybe but they're votingto essentially essentially I'd believethat we should steal money at anincreasing rate to be able to transferit to somebody's hands even if you justsaidum like think about the system you haveFinancial regulation to protect youfrom a system designed to steal yourmoneyhowcould that go wrongI mean the thing I can't picture Jeffthough is what this all looks likethat's that's the difficulty in a worldwhereAIdoes start replacing a lot of jobs likesignificantly and at an accelerator ratebut even if we had a fall in themarginal cost of productionwhat how does society function how howdo people what do people do with theirtime how do they have enough so I thinkI think in in 1920 it was 1923 thatKeynes wrote economic possibilities ofour grandchildren whenever that wasmaybe Danny take a take a look at whatdate that was written he's gonna watchchat GB today yeah but but but inwritingum uh that he predicted and this iswhere he got this thing totally wrong hepredicted the trend properly about wheretechnology was going but he didn'tpredict what human nature would do tomoneyso he predicted the global averageworking week would be 10 hours a week inin 2020.what's happened and so what would happenif you let prices fall people would havemore than they have todayum without the time and the jobsit's just such a paradigm shift it's sohard to believe because because youcan't prove that right you have to inferit from what they what the trend woulddo because we haven't lived in thatworld but how what does the world looklike some people because they're sittingon top of rent seeking from that they'renot productive it's not being productiveform of value for other people they'resitting on top of that system thatthey're getting wealth gain at theexpense of other people in the worldso some people are working 80 hours 100hours trying to keep up and they'regetting it's getting harder and harderand harder used to be if you were in theone percent it was really great now youneed to be in the 0.1 percent to bereally great because you'll need to worklessto gain more exactly it's a completeflip it's the in that Paradigm flip isso hard to Fathom because we don't livein it no right or but if you follow therules of economic value if all the ruleslaid out how would that lookbecause it works exactly the opposite ifyou just said wages are sticky right sopeople think oh it's just a transfer ofwealth to these new people and it'sgoing to look exactly the same no itisn't wages are sticky so what thatmeans is if wages are sticky and that'swhy inflation Works going the other wayand wages are sticky people don't won'tgive a pricea wage decrease as fast as prices arefallingso it'll be a it'll be a massive massivetransfer of wealth back to productivemembers of societyand as jobs are lostthe people that are are going to be ableto live on less and less and lessforeverrightwhy don't you pay for the oxygen you'rebreathing right nowit's ludicrous right it would beludicrous to have somebody walk in hereand say oh here's your oxygen maskum but it's not ludicrously would tryit's but it's not it's not ludicrousum in space and it's not ludicrousunderwater where the marginal cost ofproduction is higher for oxygen rightbut it's ludicrous but we can't see thatthat is exactly the same thing thatwe're artificially creating thatscarcity in everything elsewhere wherethe Natural Way natural order of thingswould drive more and more things toabundanceamazingJeffI think we're gonna save save the restof this evening awesome when we do oureventum but thank you that's really quicktodayin a way it hasn't beforeum thank you thank you oh thank you amenforeignforeign",
