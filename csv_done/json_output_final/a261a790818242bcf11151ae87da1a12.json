as in freedomthen we'll run headlong into censorshipand tyrannyprivacy is not secrecy cypherpunk'swrite code and running the numbers isnot a crimenumbersi'm going to talk about three numberstodaybecause this is going to be apresentation in threeactsblack on whitewhite and blackand in the third act we're gonna add alittle bit of colorthe three numbersare 1221and 10.number 12act onelet's beginbitcoin as we all knowbitcoin is codeit's computer code but in my opinionmore importantly it's a moral codeand this moral code is deeply embeddedin bitcoin and in the creation thereofand the moral code in essencesays you shall not inflate you shall notconfiscate you shall not counterfeitin shortyou shall not stealthat's what bitcoin is saying basicallyi will say something to you now thatmightsound outrageousat first namely bitcoinis knowledgeand i mean this literally so bitcoin isliterally knowledge and as another guywho is long deadsaid at one point in time knowledge ispowerof course we all know knowledge is powerwas said by francis bakingand if we can equate that knowledge ispower and francis baking and bitcoin isknowledge then we can easily deduce thatbitcoin is bakingbitcoin is bankingi mean that literally and you mightthink has this guy lost his mindno that's not the case because bitcoinliterally is bakingbecause 24 times the word baking is avalid bip 39 seed phrase which is avalid bitcoin wallet so you can verifythis yourselfdownload something like blue walletenterprising 24 times and you will havea valid bitcoinwallet sobakingtimes 24 that's bitcoinand this works with many different wordsflag gas grade slice solution summer daytraytrap zebra and there are others in totalthere are241 of thesespecial wordsthat work if you just repeat them oftenenough some wordsyou have to repeat 12 timessome others will have to repeat 24.so 12 words12 words in your head 12 magic wordsthis is what bitcoinis and this is what bitcoin can befunnily enough12 times wordalso works and is also a valid bitcoinwallet so this literally is bitcoinand anyone can use this you should notuse this these are terribly insecurewallets but nevertheless this is howbitcoin works bitcoin is just 12 magicwordssohowhow in the hell does this work how canthis ever be secure why is this the waythat bitcoinworksso bitcoin finds strength in numbersstrength in large numbers and your 12magic words they have to be 12 randomwords for them to be secure if they aretruly randomthen theythen they are as secure as anything canbe all cryptography is rooted inrandomness or in a concept that we callentropyif they are randomthen your wallet is secureif they are not random then they areterribly insecure that's why you shouldnever use the banking wallet or the wordwallet or what have you so 12 validwordsthis is what bitcoin is it can't be anyold random words they are very specialwords and there are jacksons involved sothey have to be 12valid words and if they are valid thenyou have a valid bitcoin walletfunnily enough 12 and valid and wordare one of these valid 12 words so ifyou enter 12 12 times or valid 12 timesor word 12 times this will work tooso this is what bitcoin is essentiallyfrom a user-facing perspective again ifyou want to try this out download bluewallet or something similaranything thatcan recover a wallet from a p39c phraseand enter 12 12 times or valid 12 timesor worth 12 times or baking 24 times orwhat have youall right this is what bitcoin iswhich brings usto act twoact twoblack and whitenumber 21.so bitcoin is paradoxical andunintuitiveyou might have heard of the story of thesage in india that went to a king andwanted to play a game of chess againstthe king and the king loved jess so hegraciously accepted the offerbut the kinghe wanted to repaythe sage in case he won so he told hisagewhat do you want is a payment on the offchance that you win against me in chessand to sage he was a very humblecharacter he just wanted one grain ofrice that the king was to place on onesquare of the chessboard andjust double the grain of rice for everysquare on the chessboard so it'sone on the first one two on the next onefour on the next one eight on the nextone and so on and the king obviouslyaccepted and of courseas luck would have it the sage one andthus the king began to put rice on thechess board andif you ever dealt with exponentials orlarge numbers you might know this storyand you might know that this is a lot ofrice that the king has to puton the chessboard so it's a veryunintuitively large number it turns outthat these are 18 quintillion grains ofrice so that is indeed a very very largenumber if you calculate how much ricethis actually is it's 210 billion tonsof riceso this is enough rice to cover all ofindia one meter deep in riceso it's a literal metric for ton ofrice it is a lot of rice back to the 12magic words what you can do with the 12magic words is you can open up a box incyberspace keep in mind that allmetaphors about bitcoin break down atone point in time so if you want tounderstand bitcoin deeply you actuallyhave to look at the code understand thecode and so on so all these metaphorsare imperfect nonetheless i believe thatthey are useful so you can think of the12 words as opening up a paradoxical boxin cyberspaceand of course you can put bitcoin inthis box and these 12 magic words ofcourse we talk about these things as aprivate key and you can think of the boxas being locked and the key is whatunlocks the box and then you can movebitcoin around and so on but also keepin mind that bitcoin bitcoin only existsinside these boxes there is no suchthing as you know like opening the boxand taking bitcoin outall you can do is move it to a differentboxso let's say you put a million sets intothis boxwhich is also why we say not your keysnot your coin becauseyour keys are equivalent to this valuethat's the neat thing about bitcoin issource value in bits and bytes directlyit's not a password to anything that isseparate the value itself is stored inthe information itself so if you have 12words in your head you literally havebitcoin in your head it's not a passwordor anything like that it is the valueitself that is stored in your headand so that's why the keys areequivalent to the coinsso let's say this key these 12 magicwords control a million sets and let'ssayjust for the sake of argument you putthe million cents into this magic box soif the key is random and if you manageto keep it private then everything isgood but if you do something stupid andlet's say you put the 12 magic wordsonto a public presentationthen it's very unclear whoowns these kind of bitcoins like it'smillion sets five minutes agoit was my million setswho owns them now it's a very difficultconcept to pin down in bitcoin theconcept of ownership so if we look atthis magical boxthere's a million sets in thereand now we can say with 100 guaranteethat this box is now empty and themillion sets are 100 percent gone i cansay this with confidence because itweeted this out not too long ago andyou know some of the people on twitterthey're probably way quicker than youwatching this presentation after thefact soi know for a fact that these are 100goneso 12 magic words again how can theyever be securewe spoke about randomness and we spokeaboutthesenon-random wallets like baking and wordand so on and so forth and how youshould never ever use themso the security again comes from astrength in that is embedded in largenumberswe have2048 of these special words and if youtake 12 word seat phrase this is 2048 tothe power of 12 which approximately is128 bit securitywhich is this very large number if youride it out and if you remember thestory aboutthe grains of rice on the chessboardthat's a way large number that 18quintillion so the quintillion are youknow somewhat in the middle so we havemany orders of magnitude larger than thechessboard storyand just to remind you 18 quintillionwas enough tocover all of india one meter deep inrice andto guess a private key you would have tolike one specific oneyou would have to pick out one specificgrain of rice out of thisout of all of india that is coveredvery deep in rice with bitcoin it's evenmore involved so you can think of it asthe whole visible universe covered ingrains of rice and you would still haveto pick out one grain of rice tobreak open a wallet so to speakall right so ifthe 12 words are randomthen you're more than reasonably secureand if you manage to keep your keysprivatethenagain you're secure and you have nothingto worry about soyou have to check both these boxeswe spoke aboutone paradox already i want to rattle offum someof the paradoxes that come to mind whenwe speak about bitcoin so again keep inmind all metaphors are imperfect theseare various things that people have saidover the years what bitcoin is and howit works and what the implications aredon't take any of these too seriouslybut still i think it's interesting tothink about these thingsall rightthe paradigm the paradox of possessionwe saw this already very clearly thatyou can't really possess bitcoin sobitcoin is secret knowledge but you candefinitely be possessed by bitcoin as isevidenced by a lot of people that seemto be literally possessed by bitcoin sobitcoin is everywhere bitcoin is nowherebitcoin can't be copied yet every partof bitcoin can be copiedbitcoin is always changing yet it isunchangeable so no single line of codein bitcoin is the same as it was when itwas firstcreated by satoshi nakamoto butit's still unchanging in essence i wouldlike to say that bitcoin soul has anunchangingcharacter bitcoin is digital yet this iscars digital scarcity used to be anoxymoron but now we have something thatis digital and that is cars bitcoin isdead as the mainstream media punditswill always tell you yet bitcoin isalive bitcoin is a bubble yet bitcoin isthe pin bitcoin is simple yet bitcoin iscomplicated bitcoin is elegant yetbitcoin is complex bitcoin is ugly yetbitcoin is beautiful bitcoin is worseit's better it's a great article byguern written a couple of years agobitcoin is worthless yet bitcoin is tooexpensive bitcoin is finite yet bitcoinis endless bitcoin is private yetbitcoin is transparent bitcoin is energyintensive yet bitcoin is insanelyefficient at what it doesbitcoin is slow yet bitcoin is fast aslightning bitcoin can't be confiscatedyet bitcoin can be lost bitcoin is taxedbut bitcoin is money bitcoin is time andbitcoin is energy bitcoin is savings andbitcoin is streaming money bitcoin isconservative yet bitcoin is progressivebitcoin is political and bitcoin isapolitical bitcoin is lawless andbitcoin is still all when it comes totransactions everything that happensinternally in bitcoin bitcoin definitelyis the law bitcoin is math and bitcoinis physics bitcoin is religion andbitcoin is atheism bitcoin requiresrandomness yet bitcoin creates orderbitcoin price is important your bitcoinprice is terribly unimportant at thesame time bitcoin pays people yetbitcoin can't go bankrupt bitcoin isintangible yet bitcoin is incorruptablebitcoin has rules but no rulers bitcoinis love and bitcoin is you moneybitcoin is a chain yet bitcoin andslavery head tip to ben gunn who broughtthis to my attention on twitter this isthe one that i really like the most umafter studying bitcoin for many manyyears it seemsthatthis is very much very much trueso bitcoin is 12 words in your head andbitcoin is 21 millionbitcoin is knowledge and knowledge ispowerso where does bitcoin derive its powerfrom bitcoin derives its power from theasymmetry of knowledge knowledgeasymmetry information is symmetry all ofcryptography is rooted in information assymmetry and bitcoin as we will see inbitcoin cryptography is not enough soyou need different kinds ofasymmetries for bitcoin to workso one of these asymmetries isthis is true for multiple things but oneof these asymmetries is that things needto be hard to produce and easy to verifythis is both true in money and incryptographymoney needs to be hard to produce andeasy to verifyfor good money to emerge this is this isalways true like if you can't verify themoney then it's terrible money is it'seasy if it's easy to produce then againit's terrible money for cryptography aswell the solution to a cryptocryptographic puzzle has to be hard toproduceand it has to beeasy to verify as well so bitcoin againchecks both of these boxesit is very hard to produce and is veryeasy toverify and to understand this moredeeply we will have to look at two ofthe building blocks of bitcoin which aresignatures and blocks so to interactwith bitcointo use bitcoin in a meaningful wayyou need to have a valid signature andsomeone needs to find a valid blockthese are the two very essential thingsthat make bitcoin tickvalid signatures and valid blocks so ifyou want to do anything with bitcoin youneed to be able to produce a validsignature and someone needs to be ableto produce a valid block so signaturesare private blocks are publicsignatures are created locallyblocks are created globallysignatures deal with secret informationblocks deal with public informationsignatures relate to the 12 wordsand blocks relate to the 21 millionsoi know this was a verygeneral overview of those two things ofcourse it's nuanced and i'm glossingover many many details but still theimportant thing is that the 12 words inyour head and the 21 million there aretwo sides of the same coin so they'relike the two pieces of yin and yang thatyou need to put together for bitcoin toemerge one of them is not enough youneed both you need the privateinformation which are your 12 words andyou need the completely public andpublicly verifiable information and thepublicly verifiable history of theblockchain ofthe thing where the 21 million emergeout fromto make bitcoin work and to use bitcoinin a meaningful way so let's put the twotogetherand as we all know bitcoin is not blackand white so we need to add some colorto it as we all know bitcoin is orangewhich brings us toact threeact threebitcoin is the orange treeto understand this tree we'll have tolook at theroot problem that bitcoin solvesand there is no better person to askwhat the root problem is that bitcoinsolves then its creator satoshi nakamotoso satoshi famously said that the rootproblem with conventional currency isall the trust that's required to make itwork so trust is the root problem andthe problem with trust is the trust canbe abusedso he famously also saidsomewhere else that in bitcoin we do nothave to rely on trustwe can use crypto proofthose were his wordsinstead of relying on trustsoi i would like to show you thatthis is not enough the crypto proofaloneis not enoughand to understand this we have to lookat how the trust problemwas solved historically so how was thetrust problem solved historicallyvery easywe always had some people that weredressedvery nicely with a very nice smile ontheir face and they would saywell just trust us we will take care ofeverything and you can just put all yourtrust in us and we will solve theproblems for you and this is how theworld works so we always had authoritiesthat we had to trust and now supposedlywe can replace this with cryptographybut what happens if we do this does thisreally work sowe have a face of cryptographyunfortunately but there we gothat is the face of cryptography itseems it is definitely the face ofcryptoand sothe situation doesn't really change ifyou know the people are a bit youngerand a bit more technologically involvedand so if the trust does comes from thecrypto bros nothing really changechanges the the crypto bros just becomethe new politicians and that's what wewant to move away from don't we like wealways had politicians tell us justtrust us this is the current state ofthings so the state would alwayssay trust us and we will figure it outand you the plebs have no say anywayand bitcoin bitcoin is not abouttrusting the state bitcoin is about theseparation of money and stateand for the separation of money andstate cryptography is not enoughif cryptographywould be enough we would have hadsomething like bitcoin we would have hadcryptographic money for a long timealready so we had keys and ledgers andthose kind of things for a very verylong timethis is a cryptographic device that isvery very old this is a ledger that isthousands of years oldandwe can't magically put them together andhave something like bitcoinbecause cryptography alone does notprovide integrity cryptography alonedoes not provide legitimacyand to understand like i choose thesewords very carefullyand to understand why this is the casewe have toat least you know like do a little bitof political philosophy and speak tothat guy and this guy is thomas hoppsand he famously said that authority nottruth creates legitimacyand he said this about state power andas we all know bitcoin changes changesyou in a massive wayso now we have our ownkind of political philosophers andthomas hobbes turns into eric cason andwhat eric cason saysabout bitcoin power is the truth notauthority creates legitimacy and that isexactly correct that is exactly rightthe authority in bitcoin comes fromtruth itself it does not come from anyexternal sourceit's a closed loop system that builds upits own truth that anyone can verify youdon't have to trust anyoneand again cryptography is not enough forthat you need something else you needsomething else so i highly recommend toread eric casin he is on a mission toreclaim the word cryptoand you can read his writings oncryptosoverity.org and we're gonna talkaboutcrypto and cryptographynext so when i say crypto here in thiscontext time most of the time i meancryptographyand againi i would like to show youthat cryptography is not enoughbecause cryptography requires secrecycryptography requires secrecyalwayswhich meansautomatically cryptography does notprovide legitimacybecause cryptography is not necessarilytied to realitycryptography alsodoesn't automatically provide any typeof scarcity if this would be the case wewould have we would have had scarsdigital things for a very long time wewould have had it before bitcoin but wedon't like we didn't we need we neededsomething elseso crypto most definitelyprovides like crypto does not providethe scarcity period we have over 9 000 coins listed on coin market capand so it's very very clear that cryptodoes not equal scarcityif you hear crypto just think rockpoolsthat's way more accurate don't thinkscarcity don't think you know quickriches or anything like that just thinkrockpools you will have an easier lifewhich brings us to the next section ofact three which is the great rughere's the problem with rockpoolsit ain't what you don't know that getsyou into trouble it's what you know forsure that just ain't somark twain famously said this aboutrakposand satoshi also had something to saythat he basically said where there istrust in others there's a rocki'm obviously paraphrasing but i canhighly recommend you read the books ofsatoshi all his writings it's acompilationof all his writings online inchronological order and he was talkingabout trust a lotand how trusted third parties aresecurity holesagain a great piece by sabo thateveryone should readand of coursethe great drugbitcoin fixes thisbecause bitcoin is not crypto bitcoin isnot a rock pool bitcoin in fact isanti-ruckball technology bitcoinprovides legitimacy and it provideslegitimacy by combining reality andcryptography it combines also physicsand math which a lot of people don't getand it combines cryptography withanother kind of proofit's not only cryptographic proof thereis another kind of proof involvedit combineskeys with work and most importantly keysand work are not the same thing they'retruly not the same thing they're they'revery different just like reality andtheory is different and oneone way to think about realityis that reality is that which survivesand my friend ellen farringtonhe wrote a great piece only the strongsurvive again everyone should read itand so we have to talk about strengthfor a little bitthis beautiful imagei call it adam's backfor obvious reasons because adam beckis the inventor of proof of workand the beautiful thing aboutproof-of-workis that it is self-evidentproof-of-work is completely self-evidentyou don't need anyexternal source of truth forproof-of-work to make sense soproof-of-work is self-evident and proofof work always deals in transformationso proof of work is always abouttransformation it doesn't matter if it'sthe pyramidsthat transformed stones intolarge pyramids it doesn't matter if it'stheripped guy in the gymproof of work always deals intransformation and if all we have isdatathen all we have is computationso we only have data informationand the transformation of thisinformation which is computation and ofcourse to do compute we requireelectricity and to generate electricitywe require energyand energy of course is costly we cannotprint more energy and this is where theintegrity of proof of work comes from soproof of work provides integrity withoutauthority without crypto keys andwithout relying on secrecy so thedifficulty adjusted proof of work inbitcoin truly is the solution to manymany many problemsand the more people understand this andthe quicker they understand thisthe easier it is to figure out whybitcoin works and why other solutionsfailed and why moving away from thedifficulty adjusted proof of work is aterrible idea you reintroduce all theproblems that bitcoin actually solvesand one of these problemsis the problem of timeso you all remember the story of thesagevisiting the king in india to play agame of chess which had a veryunintuitive outcomei want to tell you a bitcoin riddle youall probably know a little bit aboutbitcoin otherwise you wouldn't watchthis and you probably know that bitcoinhas a block time of 10 minutes so every10 minutes a new block comes inand this is my favorite bitcoin riddlekind of for one of my favorites becauseit will tell you howmuch someoneknows about bitcoin how deep they howdeeply they looked into it already solet's assumeagain every 10 minutes a new block comesin that's the way things are in bitcoinand let's assume that the last blockcame in nine minutes ago when will thenext block come inmost people will say something like in aminute or maybe a little bit longer youknow two minutes something like thatandthe correct answer verycounterintuitively is always 10 minutesso if you said something else than 10minutes thenyou basicallyyou made the gambler's fallacy so theprinciple behind this is very similar toyou standing at the roulette tableand red cameyou know red came in for like 15 timesin a row and now i ask you what are thechances that red comes again or what arethe chances the black comes and if yousay anything else than 50 50 then wellyou're committing the gambler's fallacyso 10 minutes this is the magic numberthis is the duration that it is aboutand every 10 minutes reality assertsitself in bitcoin every 10 minutes truthemerges every 10 minutes past becomesstone and every 10 minutes informationis reifiedso it's about this duration of 10minutes this is the constant in bitcointhis is more or less the only constantin bitcoin almost because everythingelse emerges out of that and you couldsay that bitcoin measures duration viacomputation like this is not terriblyinaccurate and further bitcoin bitcoinnot only measures duration viacompetition it also settles 10 minutesof history every 10 minutes so it isabout these 10 minutes of history butit's not only about the past it's alsoabout the future and we that'sthat's such an important concept tounderstand that bitcoin bitcoin it isfixed in time it's not it's not reallytied to energy or likemining bitcoin doesn't require energy inthe sense that the more energy you putin the more bitcoin our mind andeveryone is just greedy and uh you knowlike we want to produce more bitcointhat's why we that's why we use moreenergy for it no energy relates tosecurity and energy relates to thedistribution of the 21 millionit does not create more bitcoin and thereason why we know this is that we havebitcoin supply curve so bitcoin has apredetermined supply it has an emissionschedule so the supply is emitted overtime and that's why we know in the yearapproximately 2140all 21 millionbitcoin will be mined and this isobviously linked to duration becausewith every valid block new bitcoin areemitted and this is how satoshi solvedthe problem of bringing new coins intocirculation which is an insanelydifficult problem to solve without anyauthority so it is like a naturalprocess a natural growing thing thatemitsthat emits new coins to all those whowho choose to secure itand this is this is why the genesis ofbitcoin is so important and it's sobeautiful and it's the only way to doany fair distribution everything elsefalls back to authoritythat's what i mean when i say bitcoin istimei mean these 10 minutes and the past atthe future and how the past is settledand how the future is predeterminedso the difficulty trusted proof of workis what creates an unfortunate historynick sabo talked about unfortunatecostlinessi think in bitcoin we should talk aboutunfortunate history because the ledgeris just that letter is a history oftransactions who owes what to whom andit has to be unforgeable for it to begood money otherwise it will always bemanipulated and bitcoin creates thisunfortunate historythe difficulty adjusted proof of worksolves the root problem a lot of peoplewhen they start talking about the rootproblem they mean the double spendingproblem but we framed itas trust and integrity so the difficultyadjusted proof of work provides trustand integrity most importantly withoutrelying on secrecy without relying onauthorityso the difficulty adjusted proof of worksolves all the problems of manny's pastand i mean that literally it solves theproblems of gold it solves the problemsof fiat obviously it solves the problemsof all the digital monies that we triedto create in the past so bitcoin has avery rich historyof like you know it depends on how longyou want to go back but bitcoin did notappear out of nowhere like people eversince the internet emerged people triedto do money on the internet that theyalways failedandpeople say they failed because of thedouble spending problem and so on and soforth but there's a lot of thingswrapped up in the double spendingproblem so we already talked abouttrustless issuancewe didn't really talk too much aboutdecentralized time stamping but if youwant to read about that please readbitcoin is time we also didn't talk toomuch about crypt analytics stabilitythat's one problem that nick sabo triedto solve for the longest time theproblem is that you cannot definea cryptographic puzzle or anycomputational problem where you can besure that any computer will solve itbelow a certain threshold of time solet's say pick any supercomputer and itwill take this super computer at leastfive minutes to solve this problem youcannot do ityou just can'tthat was a that was a big problem ofdigital monies because you you youcannot know the breakthroughs incomputing you cannot know if someonecomes up with a new architecture or abetter way faster computer there's like10 trillion times faster and suddenlyyou can solve this problem in like amillisecond and so this crypt analyticsstability the problem of cryptanalyticstability was a really hard problem thedifficulty adjusted proof of work solvesit digital scarcity again it used to bean oxymoron now thanks to bitcoin wehave itand data integrity that's what i want totalk about next and of course thecomputer scientists listening to thisthey will have big question marks intheir mind becausethey all know that we were able to dodata integrity before bitcoin like we wehad had multiple ways of doing dataintegrity but i'm here to tell you nothat's actually not correct because fordata integrity to work you always neededto have keys so how do you do any typeof data integrity without secretinformation without relying on privatekeys what if all you have what if allyou want to have is just publicinformation what if authorities are notallowed what if key holders are notallowedwhat if we must not have a quorum ofpeople that sign off on the on theintegrity of the informationall the other things all the othersystems that want to remove proof ofwork from the equation automaticallyfall back to a quorum of people to keyholders that sign off on informationit's very much a fiat move where wherewe have authorities to say this is thereality this is the gold in the vaultsjust trust us we are we sign off on thisall the gold is there just trust us andyou're dealing with paper notessoremoving proof of workit's an absolutely horrible idea thatreintroduces all the problems thatbitcoin solved so how can you do dataintegrityhow can you do data integrity withoutany private keys how can you do it it'sa really hard problemto understandhow data integrity works we will have totake a closer look at this orange againand we'll split it up again so we'reback into yin and yang and we're goingto talk about integrity and validationwe're going to talk about the 12 wordsagain and the 21 million and aboutprivate keys and public ledgersvery briefly if you have keys and youwant to prove the integrity of the keysit's very easy because you can do keypairs and asymmetric cryptographythen we have private keys and publickeys andwith one or the other you can check theintegrity of the other and just you knowthis is well known this is nothing newthis is allfine and nice and that's very very easyif we have keys data integrity andvalidation is very easywhat if we don't have keys what if wedon't have any private part at all whatif all we have is public datawhat if wewhat if we must not have any keys thisis so important like how to do thiswithout any keys at all how to do itwellthe answer should be obvious but itwasn't obvious for the longest time itwas only obvious to satoshi and theanswer of course is proof of workadam back and so on and so forth becausethe nice thing about proof-of-work againis that you only have to lookyou only have to look proof of work isself-evidenteverything you need for verification ispublicly available nothing is hidden noprivate keys are needed there is noauthority there is no secret secrecythere's just truth there's truthembedded in the data itselfand that's why it's so beautiful youjust can look at itand without any use of any private keysyou can verify that everything iscorrect in the data itself and you cango back to genesis and seethatno one was ableno one was able to modify this data inany shape way shape or formand you do not need to trust anyone youdon't need to trust any quorums any keyholders any external sources the truthis self evident in the data itselfthat's what nvk meant when he said themap is not the territory like in bitcoinin bitcoin the map is the territory inbitcoin the map is the territory thereis no differentiation you just look atthe map you look at the dataand there is no external thing the truthis self-evidentin the data itself in bitcoin truly themap is the territoryso this was the big brain invention ofsatoshi nakamoto because satoshi was thefirst person that was able tothink decentralized completely aboutissuance about security about timeitself the timing problem is such a sucha difficult problem to solve as welllike i encourage anyone who isinterested in other systems to alwayslook at the timing problem we don't havea fixed time in our universeand this is why it's such a difficultproblem just because of relativisticeffects alone together orderly sequenceof events in decentralized computingit's it's it's a borderline impossibleproblem and only the difficulty adjustedproof of work solves it completelyso satoshi knew this satoshi knew thathe had a breakthrough because he said hesaidi think this is the first time we'retrying a decentralized non-trust-basedsystemso he realized that withcrypto proofand the reification of information whichis a phrase i really like which i stolefrom adam gibsonwe cancreate digital scarcity we can createsound money in cyberspace and he alsoknew that crypto proof was not enough heknew that cryptography was not enoughhe mentioned in one of his posts thatwe we can't justwe we have computational proof of thepast computational proof of the sequenceof events that's what he saidand it's this computational proofcomputational proof is different fromcryptographic proofbecause in computational proof in thedifficulty or just a proof of workthere are no private keys involvedit's just pure computationpure raw energy if you willthis is absolutely required to havepublicly available information that isconsistent in itself that anyone canvalidateso bitcoin is knowledgeit is literally true that bitcoin isknowledgeanyoneanyone can have the knowledge of theintegrity of the system it'sa completely open system it's completelytransparentyou can yourselfconvince yourself of the 21 millionyou can check bitcoin's monetary policyyou can check the integrity of thesystembut the opposite is also true thatknowledge is bitcoin as we saw bitcoinit's just 12 words in your headthat's why i believe thattrying to you knowoutlaw bitcoin in any in in any way isequivalent to thought crimebecause all that bitcoin mining does forexample is trying to find random numbersall that holding bitcoin entails ishaving 12 words in your head so if yourgovernment tells you that you're notallowed to hold bitcoin that's what theyare saying you cannot think of baking 24times you cannot think of word 12 timesyou can't have 12 random words in yourhead that's what anyone is saying whenthey forbid you to use bitcoin it's ofcoursenot enforceable butthat's a different kind ofthat's a different kind of speechknowledge in bitcoinbitcoinis private knowledge 12 words in yourheadbitcoin is public information public andtransparent information which leads tothe 21 millionit's private keys and public lettersand the s at the end of lectures isimportant because we have many manyledgers all over the world and you needtohave your ownvalid copy that you in the best casevalidate yourselfand if you want to use bitcoin in anymeaningful way you have to put those twotogether and if you put them togetherthen the orange emerges and just as avery quick example let's sayalice wants to send bobsome sets so alice needs a private keyand she needs a copy of the publicledger and in private she uses herprivate key to sign a message which is atransaction and let's say this messagesays i alice wants to send 21 sets tobob and she signs it with her privatekeysoif everything checks outand if the signature is valid then thetransaction gets broadcast and if thetransaction is valid the bitcoin networkwill accept it and the transaction willland in the manpoolwhich is what connects the private worldof private keys with the public world ofpublic ledgers it connects the 12th andthe 21 it is the link between the pastand the present and if everything checksout and if the signature is valid and ifa valid block is found afterapproximately 10 minutesthen the transaction is confirmed whichis what bitcoin is saying all the timeevery 10 minutes but it it is sayingmore than that with every transactionthat is confirmed with every valid blockthat is coming in it also self confirmsits own integrity always all the timethe beautiful thing about the difficultyjust the proof of work in bitcoin isthat it's accumulative over time it'slike layers of amber that solidify thepastand with this solidified past bitcoinalso says moral code confirmedand as we heard in the very beginningthe moral code of bitcoin is you shallnot inflate you shall not confiscate youshall not counter fate in short youshall not stealand that's what bitcoin is sayingevery 10 minutes without relying ontrustcryptographyis not enougha longish speech on paradoxes andantennamacebefore i start with the speechlet's get one thingout of the waycode is speech and speech is codeand if speech isn't free as in freedomthen we'll run headlong into censorshipand tyrannyprivacy is not secrecy cypherpunk'swrite code and running the numbers isnot a crimenumbersi'm going to talk about three numberstodaybecause this is going to be apresentation in threeactsblack on whitewhite and blackand in the third act we're gonna add alittle bit of colorthe three numbersare 1221and 10.number 12act onelet's beginbitcoin as we all knowbitcoin is codeit's computer code but in my opinionmore importantly it's a moral codeand this moral code is deeply embeddedin bitcoin and in the creation thereofand the moral code in essencesays you shall not inflate you shall notconfiscate you shall not counterfeitin shortyou shall not stealthat's what bitcoin is saying basicallyi will say something to you now thatmightsound outrageousat first namely bitcoinis knowledgeand i mean this literally so bitcoin isliterally knowledge and as another guywho is long deadsaid at one point in time knowledge ispowerof course we all know knowledge is powerwas said by francis bakingand if we can equate that knowledge ispower and francis baking and bitcoin isknowledge then we can easily deduce thatbitcoin is bakingbitcoin is bankingi mean that literally and you mightthink has this guy lost his mindno that's not the case because bitcoinliterally is bakingbecause 24 times the word baking is avalid bip 39 seed phrase which is avalid bitcoin wallet so you can verifythis yourselfdownload something like blue walletenterprising 24 times and you will havea valid bitcoinwallet sobakingtimes 24 that's bitcoinand this works with many different wordsflag gas grade slice solution summer daytraytrap zebra and there are others in totalthere are241 of thesespecial wordsthat work if you just repeat them oftenenough some wordsyou have to repeat 12 timessome others will have to repeat 24.so 12 words12 words in your head 12 magic wordsthis is what bitcoinis and this is what bitcoin can befunnily enough12 times wordalso works and is also a valid bitcoinwallet so this literally is bitcoinand anyone can use this you should notuse this these are terribly insecurewallets but nevertheless this is howbitcoin works bitcoin is just 12 magicwordssohowhow in the hell does this work how canthis ever be secure why is this the waythat bitcoinworksso bitcoin finds strength in numbersstrength in large numbers and your 12magic words they have to be 12 randomwords for them to be secure if they aretruly randomthen theythen they are as secure as anything canbe all cryptography is rooted inrandomness or in a concept that we callentropyif they are randomthen your wallet is secureif they are not random then they areterribly insecure that's why you shouldnever use the banking wallet or the wordwallet or what have you so 12 validwordsthis is what bitcoin is it can't be anyold random words they are very specialwords and there are jacksons involved sothey have to be 12valid words and if they are valid thenyou have a valid bitcoin walletfunnily enough 12 and valid and wordare one of these valid 12 words so ifyou enter 12 12 times or valid 12 timesor word 12 times this will work tooso this is what bitcoin is essentiallyfrom a user-facing perspective again ifyou want to try this out download bluewallet or something similaranything thatcan recover a wallet from a p39c phraseand enter 12 12 times or valid 12 timesor worth 12 times or baking 24 times orwhat have youall right this is what bitcoin iswhich brings usto act twoact twoblack and whitenumber 21.so bitcoin is paradoxical andunintuitiveyou might have heard of the story of thesage in india that went to a king andwanted to play a game of chess againstthe king and the king loved jess so hegraciously accepted the offerbut the kinghe wanted to repaythe sage in case he won so he told hisagewhat do you want is a payment on the offchance that you win against me in chessand to sage he was a very humblecharacter he just wanted one grain ofrice that the king was to place on onesquare of the chessboard andjust double the grain of rice for everysquare on the chessboard so it'sone on the first one two on the next onefour on the next one eight on the nextone and so on and the king obviouslyaccepted and of courseas luck would have it the sage one andthus the king began to put rice on thechess board andif you ever dealt with exponentials orlarge numbers you might know this storyand you might know that this is a lot ofrice that the king has to puton the chessboard so it's a veryunintuitively large number it turns outthat these are 18 quintillion grains ofrice so that is indeed a very very largenumber if you calculate how much ricethis actually is it's 210 billion tonsof riceso this is enough rice to cover all ofindia one meter deep in riceso it's a literal metric for ton ofrice it is a lot of rice back to the 12magic words what you can do with the 12magic words is you can open up a box incyberspace keep in mind that allmetaphors about bitcoin break down atone point in time so if you want tounderstand bitcoin deeply you actuallyhave to look at the code understand thecode and so on so all these metaphorsare imperfect nonetheless i believe thatthey are useful so you can think of the12 words as opening up a paradoxical boxin cyberspaceand of course you can put bitcoin inthis box and these 12 magic words ofcourse we talk about these things as aprivate key and you can think of the boxas being locked and the key is whatunlocks the box and then you can movebitcoin around and so on but also keepin mind that bitcoin bitcoin only existsinside these boxes there is no suchthing as you know like opening the boxand taking bitcoin outall you can do is move it to a differentboxso let's say you put a million sets intothis boxwhich is also why we say not your keysnot your coin becauseyour keys are equivalent to this valuethat's the neat thing about bitcoin issource value in bits and bytes directlyit's not a password to anything that isseparate the value itself is stored inthe information itself so if you have 12words in your head you literally havebitcoin in your head it's not a passwordor anything like that it is the valueitself that is stored in your headand so that's why the keys areequivalent to the coinsso let's say this key these 12 magicwords control a million sets and let'ssayjust for the sake of argument you putthe million cents into this magic box soif the key is random and if you manageto keep it private then everything isgood but if you do something stupid andlet's say you put the 12 magic wordsonto a public presentationthen it's very unclear whoowns these kind of bitcoins like it'smillion sets five minutes agoit was my million setswho owns them now it's a very difficultconcept to pin down in bitcoin theconcept of ownership so if we look atthis magical boxthere's a million sets in thereand now we can say with 100 guaranteethat this box is now empty and themillion sets are 100 percent gone i cansay this with confidence because itweeted this out not too long ago andyou know some of the people on twitterthey're probably way quicker than youwatching this presentation after thefact soi know for a fact that these are 100goneso 12 magic words again how can theyever be securewe spoke about randomness and we spokeaboutthesenon-random wallets like baking and wordand so on and so forth and how youshould never ever use themso the security again comes from astrength in that is embedded in largenumberswe have2048 of these special words and if youtake 12 word seat phrase this is 2048 tothe power of 12 which approximately is128 bit securitywhich is this very large number if youride it out and if you remember thestory aboutthe grains of rice on the chessboardthat's a way large number that 18quintillion so the quintillion are youknow somewhat in the middle so we havemany orders of magnitude larger than thechessboard storyand just to remind you 18 quintillionwas enough tocover all of india one meter deep inrice andto guess a private key you would have tolike one specific oneyou would have to pick out one specificgrain of rice out of thisout of all of india that is coveredvery deep in rice with bitcoin it's evenmore involved so you can think of it asthe whole visible universe covered ingrains of rice and you would still haveto pick out one grain of rice tobreak open a wallet so to speakall right so ifthe 12 words are randomthen you're more than reasonably secureand if you manage to keep your keysprivatethenagain you're secure and you have nothingto worry about soyou have to check both these boxeswe spoke aboutone paradox already i want to rattle offum someof the paradoxes that come to mind whenwe speak about bitcoin so again keep inmind all metaphors are imperfect theseare various things that people have saidover the years what bitcoin is and howit works and what the implications aredon't take any of these too seriouslybut still i think it's interesting tothink about these thingsall rightthe paradigm the paradox of possessionwe saw this already very clearly thatyou can't really possess bitcoin sobitcoin is secret knowledge but you candefinitely be possessed by bitcoin as isevidenced by a lot of people that seemto be literally possessed by bitcoin sobitcoin is everywhere bitcoin is nowherebitcoin can't be copied yet every partof bitcoin can be copiedbitcoin is always changing yet it isunchangeable so no single line of codein bitcoin is the same as it was when itwas firstcreated by satoshi nakamoto butit's still unchanging in essence i wouldlike to say that bitcoin soul has anunchangingcharacter bitcoin is digital yet this iscars digital scarcity used to be anoxymoron but now we have something thatis digital and that is cars bitcoin isdead as the mainstream media punditswill always tell you yet bitcoin isalive bitcoin is a bubble yet bitcoin isthe pin bitcoin is simple yet bitcoin iscomplicated bitcoin is elegant yetbitcoin is complex bitcoin is ugly yetbitcoin is beautiful bitcoin is worseit's better it's a great article byguern written a couple of years agobitcoin is worthless yet bitcoin is tooexpensive bitcoin is finite yet bitcoinis endless bitcoin is private yetbitcoin is transparent bitcoin is energyintensive yet bitcoin is insanelyefficient at what it doesbitcoin is slow yet bitcoin is fast aslightning bitcoin can't be confiscatedyet bitcoin can be lost bitcoin is taxedbut bitcoin is money bitcoin is time andbitcoin is energy bitcoin is savings andbitcoin is streaming money bitcoin isconservative yet bitcoin is progressivebitcoin is political and bitcoin isapolitical bitcoin is lawless andbitcoin is still all when it comes totransactions everything that happensinternally in bitcoin bitcoin definitelyis the law bitcoin is math and bitcoinis physics bitcoin is religion andbitcoin is atheism bitcoin requiresrandomness yet bitcoin creates orderbitcoin price is important your bitcoinprice is terribly unimportant at thesame time bitcoin pays people yetbitcoin can't go bankrupt bitcoin isintangible yet bitcoin is incorruptablebitcoin has rules but no rulers bitcoinis love and bitcoin is you moneybitcoin is a chain yet bitcoin andslavery head tip to ben gunn who broughtthis to my attention on twitter this isthe one that i really like the most umafter studying bitcoin for many manyyears it seemsthatthis is very much very much trueso bitcoin is 12 words in your head andbitcoin is 21 millionbitcoin is knowledge and knowledge ispowerso where does bitcoin derive its powerfrom bitcoin derives its power from theasymmetry of knowledge knowledgeasymmetry information is symmetry all ofcryptography is rooted in information assymmetry and bitcoin as we will see inbitcoin cryptography is not enough soyou need different kinds ofasymmetries for bitcoin to workso one of these asymmetries isthis is true for multiple things but oneof these asymmetries is that things needto be hard to produce and easy to verifythis is both true in money and incryptographymoney needs to be hard to produce andeasy to verifyfor good money to emerge this is this isalways true like if you can't verify themoney then it's terrible money is it'seasy if it's easy to produce then againit's terrible money for cryptography aswell the solution to a cryptocryptographic puzzle has to be hard toproduceand it has to beeasy to verify as well so bitcoin againchecks both of these boxesit is very hard to produce and is veryeasy toverify and to understand this moredeeply we will have to look at two ofthe building blocks of bitcoin which aresignatures and blocks so to interactwith bitcointo use bitcoin in a meaningful wayyou need to have a valid signature andsomeone needs to find a valid blockthese are the two very essential thingsthat make bitcoin tickvalid signatures and valid blocks so ifyou want to do anything with bitcoin youneed to be able to produce a validsignature and someone needs to be ableto produce a valid block so signaturesare private blocks are publicsignatures are created locallyblocks are created globallysignatures deal with secret informationblocks deal with public informationsignatures relate to the 12 wordsand blocks relate to the 21 millionsoi know this was a verygeneral overview of those two things ofcourse it's nuanced and i'm glossingover many many details but still theimportant thing is that the 12 words inyour head and the 21 million there aretwo sides of the same coin so they'relike the two pieces of yin and yang thatyou need to put together for bitcoin toemerge one of them is not enough youneed both you need the privateinformation which are your 12 words andyou need the completely public andpublicly verifiable information and thepublicly verifiable history of theblockchain ofthe thing where the 21 million emergeout fromto make bitcoin work and to use bitcoinin a meaningful way so let's put the twotogetherand as we all know bitcoin is not blackand white so we need to add some colorto it as we all know bitcoin is orangewhich brings us toact threeact threebitcoin is the orange treeto understand this tree we'll have tolook at theroot problem that bitcoin solvesand there is no better person to askwhat the root problem is that bitcoinsolves then its creator satoshi nakamotoso satoshi famously said that the rootproblem with conventional currency isall the trust that's required to make itwork so trust is the root problem andthe problem with trust is the trust canbe abusedso he famously also saidsomewhere else that in bitcoin we do nothave to rely on trustwe can use crypto proofthose were his wordsinstead of relying on trustsoi i would like to show you thatthis is not enough the crypto proofaloneis not enoughand to understand this we have to lookat how the trust problemwas solved historically so how was thetrust problem solved historicallyvery easywe always had some people that weredressedvery nicely with a very nice smile ontheir face and they would saywell just trust us we will take care ofeverything and you can just put all yourtrust in us and we will solve theproblems for you and this is how theworld works so we always had authoritiesthat we had to trust and now supposedlywe can replace this with cryptographybut what happens if we do this does thisreally work sowe have a face of cryptographyunfortunately but there we gothat is the face of cryptography itseems it is definitely the face ofcryptoand sothe situation doesn't really change ifyou know the people are a bit youngerand a bit more technologically involvedand so if the trust does comes from thecrypto bros nothing really changechanges the the crypto bros just becomethe new politicians and that's what wewant to move away from don't we like wealways had politicians tell us justtrust us this is the current state ofthings so the state would alwayssay trust us and we will figure it outand you the plebs have no say anywayand bitcoin bitcoin is not abouttrusting the state bitcoin is about theseparation of money and stateand for the separation of money andstate cryptography is not enoughif cryptographywould be enough we would have hadsomething like bitcoin we would have hadcryptographic money for a long timealready so we had keys and ledgers andthose kind of things for a very verylong timethis is a cryptographic device that isvery very old this is a ledger that isthousands of years oldandwe can't magically put them together andhave something like bitcoinbecause cryptography alone does notprovide integrity cryptography alonedoes not provide legitimacyand to understand like i choose thesewords very carefullyand to understand why this is the casewe have toat least you know like do a little bitof political philosophy and speak tothat guy and this guy is thomas hoppsand he famously said that authority nottruth creates legitimacyand he said this about state power andas we all know bitcoin changes changesyou in a massive wayso now we have our ownkind of political philosophers andthomas hobbes turns into eric cason andwhat eric cason saysabout bitcoin power is the truth notauthority creates legitimacy and that isexactly correct that is exactly rightthe authority in bitcoin comes fromtruth itself it does not come from anyexternal sourceit's a closed loop system that builds upits own truth that anyone can verify youdon't have to trust anyoneand again cryptography is not enough forthat you need something else you needsomething else so i highly recommend toread eric casin he is on a mission toreclaim the word cryptoand you can read his writings oncryptosoverity.org and we're gonna talkaboutcrypto and cryptographynext so when i say crypto here in thiscontext time most of the time i meancryptographyand againi i would like to show youthat cryptography is not enoughbecause cryptography requires secrecycryptography requires secrecyalwayswhich meansautomatically cryptography does notprovide legitimacybecause cryptography is not necessarilytied to realitycryptography alsodoesn't automatically provide any typeof scarcity if this would be the case wewould have we would have had scarsdigital things for a very long time wewould have had it before bitcoin but wedon't like we didn't we need we neededsomething elseso crypto most definitelyprovides like crypto does not providethe scarcity period we have over 9 000 coins listed on coin market capand so it's very very clear that cryptodoes not equal scarcityif you hear crypto just think rockpoolsthat's way more accurate don't thinkscarcity don't think you know quickriches or anything like that just thinkrockpools you will have an easier lifewhich brings us to the next section ofact three which is the great rughere's the problem with rockpoolsit ain't what you don't know that getsyou into trouble it's what you know forsure that just ain't somark twain famously said this aboutrakposand satoshi also had something to saythat he basically said where there istrust in others there's a rocki'm obviously paraphrasing but i canhighly recommend you read the books ofsatoshi all his writings it's acompilationof all his writings online inchronological order and he was talkingabout trust a lotand how trusted third parties aresecurity holesagain a great piece by sabo thateveryone should readand of coursethe great drugbitcoin fixes thisbecause bitcoin is not crypto bitcoin isnot a rock pool bitcoin in fact isanti-ruckball technology bitcoinprovides legitimacy and it provideslegitimacy by combining reality andcryptography it combines also physicsand math which a lot of people don't getand it combines cryptography withanother kind of proofit's not only cryptographic proof thereis another kind of proof involvedit combineskeys with work and most importantly keysand work are not the same thing they'retruly not the same thing they're they'revery different just like reality andtheory is different and oneone way to think about realityis that reality is that which survivesand my friend ellen farringtonhe wrote a great piece only the strongsurvive again everyone should read itand so we have to talk about strengthfor a little bitthis beautiful imagei call it adam's backfor obvious reasons because adam beckis the inventor of proof of workand the beautiful thing aboutproof-of-workis that it is self-evidentproof-of-work is completely self-evidentyou don't need anyexternal source of truth forproof-of-work to make sense soproof-of-work is self-evident and proofof work always deals in transformationso proof of work is always abouttransformation it doesn't matter if it'sthe pyramidsthat transformed stones intolarge pyramids it doesn't matter if it'stheripped guy in the gymproof of work always deals intransformation and if all we have isdatathen all we have is computationso we only have data informationand the transformation of thisinformation which is computation and ofcourse to do compute we requireelectricity and to generate electricitywe require energyand energy of course is costly we cannotprint more energy and this is where theintegrity of proof of work comes from soproof of work provides integrity withoutauthority without crypto keys andwithout relying on secrecy so thedifficulty adjusted proof of work inbitcoin truly is the solution to manymany many problemsand the more people understand this andthe quicker they understand thisthe easier it is to figure out whybitcoin works and why other solutionsfailed and why moving away from thedifficulty adjusted proof of work is aterrible idea you reintroduce all theproblems that bitcoin actually solvesand one of these problemsis the problem of timeso you all remember the story of thesagevisiting the king in india to play agame of chess which had a veryunintuitive outcomei want to tell you a bitcoin riddle youall probably know a little bit aboutbitcoin otherwise you wouldn't watchthis and you probably know that bitcoinhas a block time of 10 minutes so every10 minutes a new block comes inand this is my favorite bitcoin riddlekind of for one of my favorites becauseit will tell you howmuch someoneknows about bitcoin how deep they howdeeply they looked into it already solet's assumeagain every 10 minutes a new block comesin that's the way things are in bitcoinand let's assume that the last blockcame in nine minutes ago when will thenext block come inmost people will say something like in aminute or maybe a little bit longer youknow two minutes something like thatandthe correct answer verycounterintuitively is always 10 minutesso if you said something else than 10minutes thenyou basicallyyou made the gambler's fallacy so theprinciple behind this is very similar toyou standing at the roulette tableand red cameyou know red came in for like 15 timesin a row and now i ask you what are thechances that red comes again or what arethe chances the black comes and if yousay anything else than 50 50 then wellyou're committing the gambler's fallacyso 10 minutes this is the magic numberthis is the duration that it is aboutand every 10 minutes reality assertsitself in bitcoin every 10 minutes truthemerges every 10 minutes past becomesstone and every 10 minutes informationis reifiedso it's about this duration of 10minutes this is the constant in bitcointhis is more or less the only constantin bitcoin almost because everythingelse emerges out of that and you couldsay that bitcoin measures duration viacomputation like this is not terriblyinaccurate and further bitcoin bitcoinnot only measures duration viacompetition it also settles 10 minutesof history every 10 minutes so it isabout these 10 minutes of history butit's not only about the past it's alsoabout the future and we that'sthat's such an important concept tounderstand that bitcoin bitcoin it isfixed in time it's not it's not reallytied to energy or likemining bitcoin doesn't require energy inthe sense that the more energy you putin the more bitcoin our mind andeveryone is just greedy and uh you knowlike we want to produce more bitcointhat's why we that's why we use moreenergy for it no energy relates tosecurity and energy relates to thedistribution of the 21 millionit does not create more bitcoin and thereason why we know this is that we havebitcoin supply curve so bitcoin has apredetermined supply it has an emissionschedule so the supply is emitted overtime and that's why we know in the yearapproximately 2140all 21 millionbitcoin will be mined and this isobviously linked to duration becausewith every valid block new bitcoin areemitted and this is how satoshi solvedthe problem of bringing new coins intocirculation which is an insanelydifficult problem to solve without anyauthority so it is like a naturalprocess a natural growing thing thatemitsthat emits new coins to all those whowho choose to secure itand this is this is why the genesis ofbitcoin is so important and it's sobeautiful and it's the only way to doany fair distribution everything elsefalls back to authoritythat's what i mean when i say bitcoin istimei mean these 10 minutes and the past atthe future and how the past is settledand how the future is predeterminedso the difficulty trusted proof of workis what creates an unfortunate historynick sabo talked about unfortunatecostlinessi think in bitcoin we should talk aboutunfortunate history because the ledgeris just that letter is a history oftransactions who owes what to whom andit has to be unforgeable for it to begood money otherwise it will always bemanipulated and bitcoin creates thisunfortunate historythe difficulty adjusted proof of worksolves the root problem a lot of peoplewhen they start talking about the rootproblem they mean the double spendingproblem but we framed itas trust and integrity so the difficultyadjusted proof of work provides trustand integrity most importantly withoutrelying on secrecy without relying onauthorityso the difficulty adjusted proof of worksolves all the problems of manny's pastand i mean that literally it solves theproblems of gold it solves the problemsof fiat obviously it solves the problemsof all the digital monies that we triedto create in the past so bitcoin has avery rich historyof like you know it depends on how longyou want to go back but bitcoin did notappear out of nowhere like people eversince the internet emerged people triedto do money on the internet that theyalways failedandpeople say they failed because of thedouble spending problem and so on and soforth but there's a lot of thingswrapped up in the double spendingproblem so we already talked abouttrustless issuancewe didn't really talk too much aboutdecentralized time stamping but if youwant to read about that please readbitcoin is time we also didn't talk toomuch about crypt analytics stabilitythat's one problem that nick sabo triedto solve for the longest time theproblem is that you cannot definea cryptographic puzzle or anycomputational problem where you can besure that any computer will solve itbelow a certain threshold of time solet's say pick any supercomputer and itwill take this super computer at leastfive minutes to solve this problem youcannot do ityou just can'tthat was a that was a big problem ofdigital monies because you you youcannot know the breakthroughs incomputing you cannot know if someonecomes up with a new architecture or abetter way faster computer there's like10 trillion times faster and suddenlyyou can solve this problem in like amillisecond and so this crypt analyticsstability the problem of cryptanalyticstability was a really hard problem thedifficulty adjusted proof of work solvesit digital scarcity again it used to bean oxymoron now thanks to bitcoin wehave itand data integrity that's what i want totalk about next and of course thecomputer scientists listening to thisthey will have big question marks intheir mind becausethey all know that we were able to dodata integrity before bitcoin like we wehad had multiple ways of doing dataintegrity but i'm here to tell you nothat's actually not correct because fordata integrity to work you always neededto have keys so how do you do any typeof data integrity without secretinformation without relying on privatekeys what if all you have what if allyou want to have is just publicinformation what if authorities are notallowed what if key holders are notallowedwhat if we must not have a quorum ofpeople that sign off on the on theintegrity of the informationall the other things all the othersystems that want to remove proof ofwork from the equation automaticallyfall back to a quorum of people to keyholders that sign off on informationit's very much a fiat move where wherewe have authorities to say this is thereality this is the gold in the vaultsjust trust us we are we sign off on thisall the gold is there just trust us andyou're dealing with paper notessoremoving proof of workit's an absolutely horrible idea thatreintroduces all the problems thatbitcoin solved so how can you do dataintegrityhow can you do data integrity withoutany private keys how can you do it it'sa really hard problemto understandhow data integrity works we will have totake a closer look at this orange againand we'll split it up again so we'reback into yin and yang and we're goingto talk about integrity and validationwe're going to talk about the 12 wordsagain and the 21 million and aboutprivate keys and public ledgersvery briefly if you have keys and youwant to prove the integrity of the keysit's very easy because you can do keypairs and asymmetric cryptographythen we have private keys and publickeys andwith one or the other you can check theintegrity of the other and just you knowthis is well known this is nothing newthis is allfine and nice and that's very very easyif we have keys data integrity andvalidation is very easywhat if we don't have keys what if wedon't have any private part at all whatif all we have is public datawhat if wewhat if we must not have any keys thisis so important like how to do thiswithout any keys at all how to do itwellthe answer should be obvious but itwasn't obvious for the longest time itwas only obvious to satoshi and theanswer of course is proof of workadam back and so on and so forth becausethe nice thing about proof-of-work againis that you only have to lookyou only have to look proof of work isself-evidenteverything you need for verification ispublicly available nothing is hidden noprivate keys are needed there is noauthority there is no secret secrecythere's just truth there's truthembedded in the data itselfand that's why it's so beautiful youjust can look at itand without any use of any private keysyou can verify that everything iscorrect in the data itself and you cango back to genesis and seethatno one was ableno one was able to modify this data inany shape way shape or formand you do not need to trust anyone youdon't need to trust any quorums any keyholders any external sources the truthis self evident in the data itselfthat's what nvk meant when he said themap is not the territory like in bitcoinin bitcoin the map is the territory inbitcoin the map is the territory thereis no differentiation you just look atthe map you look at the dataand there is no external thing the truthis self-evidentin the data itself in bitcoin truly themap is the territoryso this was the big brain invention ofsatoshi nakamoto because satoshi was thefirst person that was able tothink decentralized completely aboutissuance about security about timeitself the timing problem is such a sucha difficult problem to solve as welllike i encourage anyone who isinterested in other systems to alwayslook at the timing problem we don't havea fixed time in our universeand this is why it's such a difficultproblem just because of relativisticeffects alone together orderly sequenceof events in decentralized computingit's it's it's a borderline impossibleproblem and only the difficulty adjustedproof of work solves it completelyso satoshi knew this satoshi knew thathe had a breakthrough because he said hesaidi think this is the first time we'retrying a decentralized non-trust-basedsystemso he realized that withcrypto proofand the reification of information whichis a phrase i really like which i stolefrom adam gibsonwe cancreate digital scarcity we can createsound money in cyberspace and he alsoknew that crypto proof was not enough heknew that cryptography was not enoughhe mentioned in one of his posts thatwe we can't justwe we have computational proof of thepast computational proof of the sequenceof events that's what he saidand it's this computational proofcomputational proof is different fromcryptographic proofbecause in computational proof in thedifficulty or just a proof of workthere are no private keys involvedit's just pure computationpure raw energy if you willthis is absolutely required to havepublicly available information that isconsistent in itself that anyone canvalidateso bitcoin is knowledgeit is literally true that bitcoin isknowledgeanyoneanyone can have the knowledge of theintegrity of the system it'sa completely open system it's completelytransparentyou can yourselfconvince yourself of the 21 millionyou can check bitcoin's monetary policyyou can check the integrity of thesystembut the opposite is also true thatknowledge is bitcoin as we saw bitcoinit's just 12 words in your headthat's why i believe thattrying to you knowoutlaw bitcoin in any in in any way isequivalent to thought crimebecause all that bitcoin mining does forexample is trying to find random numbersall that holding bitcoin entails ishaving 12 words in your head so if yourgovernment tells you that you're notallowed to hold bitcoin that's what theyare saying you cannot think of baking 24times you cannot think of word 12 timesyou can't have 12 random words in yourhead that's what anyone is saying whenthey forbid you to use bitcoin it's ofcoursenot enforceable butthat's a different kind ofthat's a different kind of speechknowledge in bitcoinbitcoinis private knowledge 12 words in yourheadbitcoin is public information public andtransparent information which leads tothe 21 millionit's private keys and public lettersand the s at the end of lectures isimportant because we have many manyledgers all over the world and you needtohave your ownvalid copy that you in the best casevalidate yourselfand if you want to use bitcoin in anymeaningful way you have to put those twotogether and if you put them togetherthen the orange emerges and just as avery quick example let's sayalice wants to send bobsome sets so alice needs a private keyand she needs a copy of the publicledger and in private she uses herprivate key to sign a message which is atransaction and let's say this messagesays i alice wants to send 21 sets tobob and she signs it with her privatekeysoif everything checks outand if the signature is valid then thetransaction gets broadcast and if thetransaction is valid the bitcoin networkwill accept it and the transaction willland in the manpoolwhich is what connects the private worldof private keys with the public world ofpublic ledgers it connects the 12th andthe 21 it is the link between the pastand the present and if everything checksout and if the signature is valid and ifa valid block is found afterapproximately 10 minutesthen the transaction is confirmed whichis what bitcoin is saying all the timeevery 10 minutes but it it is sayingmore than that with every transactionthat is confirmed
