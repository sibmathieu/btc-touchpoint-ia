  "text": "Bitcoin culturesokay well this is about me but I don'tthink it's happy I mean I see him veryfamiliar names I I had a formereducation in physics then I did someconsultants in Accenture then I did afew Bitcoin startups some are aresuccessful some are and failed andnow I mostly posting on Twitterthat's my full full-time job now I'mjoking but uh but that's what that's theperception so as we said at thebeginning this talk is coming to with avery good timing because there was somedrama on culture uh about culture onTwitter but this talk actually was uhwas uh conceived for the first time liketwo hours before my uh my presentationin Las Vegas in um I think it was Marchor February or something 2022 it was aconference unconfiscatable and as youcan see in this uh in this cropped imagemy presentation was a tone asking me tore-give my presentation about theperfect lighting wallet which is thepresentation I gave in adopting Bitcoinconference in El Salvador but a fewhours before I was like no I don't wantto give that presentation again I have abetter idea so I took my present I did Ijust wrote this uh these Venn diagramsand I gave this a very very short uhlike this is one hour but not becauseit's one hour talk if there is like apanel of 40 minutes so it's it'sbasically a 20 minutes presentation youmay you may see that you may watch thatit's uh I think it's it was funnybecause there were some inner jokesabout people I started to put people inthe diagram but it was not as uh Ididn't really think uh thoroughly aboutthe the problem in a serious way like Idid after that and in Riga a few weeksago during the noob daysum the the conference for noobs justbeforethe main Riga conference balticoniBadger I did it again I I redraw the theVenn diagram completely in a way that Ithink is more interesting to uh to watchand to discuss so this was like the jokeversion and now I I try to do a stilllike still posting basically butthere is some more reflection in it uhso uh before or after you watch these ifyou haven't done that already I wouldsuggest you to take a look at other twopresentations one was from the pizza dayin Prague in 2022 it was Sergey from uhbitrefield and he gave a presentationabout uh real building a circulareconomy but he made a distinctionbetween a Bitcoin the tool you can seethat on the on the left of the screenand Bitcoin the movement and in Bitcointhe movement he analyzed some of thememes like hodla or uh stack sets alow-time preference number go up hyperorganization and he contrasted that asuh as movement cultural tools withBitcoin the tool in itself I I took someissues with uh with uh sergey's Venndiagram distinction mostly because I ama Venn diagram nerd so I I I use thispresentation as well to make my ownpresentation a little bit more elaborateand another presentation I would suggestyou to take a look at after after ourchat today is this one stealing Riga soa few days ago it's by coinsure you canfind it by from the title Bitcoinpsychopath versus Bitcoin sociopaths uhit's a it's a great talk and it'sactually uh also framing the Bitcoinculture as a as a Counter Culture itdoesn't dig very much into thesubcultural distinctions which is whatI'm planning to do today with you but itdoes frame the cultural discussion ofBitcoin a way that I think is veryinteresting talking about phenomenonslike the the nerd fan mobs social partdistinction and the turn of Septemberframework there are a lot of interestingthings in this talk so after this as asRockstar and Jack just mentioned thishappened on Twitter so uh basically Danheld the say uh tweet tweeted out say noto bitcoin fundamentalism and um andbasically somebody tweeted out thispicture in order to mock at the net ofcourse but with with some interestingthings like you see the the family withthe kids the the red meat the stakeTwitter of course the call card whichtriggered a lot of treasure and Ledgeraffectionatos and the Bitcoin standardsand the priest which is a little bitlike an exorcist in this case probablywith the with the cross and the gun ofcourse so there was a some people gottriggered by this like oh my God youcannot compare compare Bitcoin withreligion or guns or meet you cannot talkabout this off topic there's nothingthat Bitcoin has to do with any of theseabsolutely barely with the with a coolcar but not really because more peopleuse this trezor and not for sure withthe book because uh many bitcoinersdon't agree with the economic readingsof the Bitcoin standard or even more thesocial uh readings of the importance ofBitcoin and Western economics and stuffso uh I think that there was anescalation of memes after this likethere was a uh done uh dark peeltweeting out this one which is a littlebit different because there is still thefamily but there is a bone broth insteadof instead of the stake there is Nichenot sure why instead of the Bitcoinstandards and there is marijuana in thein the in the left corner and uh and thebarefoot shoes which is I also use thoseand everybody's mocking me because ofthat and there is likeum like a metal uh a metal steel backupsee the Backup Tool and a 3D printedpink uh like uh automatic weapon andthen there was like a lot of people uhbasically waiting in there was the theofficial maintainer of the Bitcoin corerepository on GitHub that of course gavehis contribution with the Bitcoinfundamentally starter pack with a lot ofpizza and a lot of coffee and a fewnumber Theory algebra and Linux nerdthings so it was uh it was kind of funnyI uh I will start from from a non-reallycultural uh depiction I will start froma division of uh competence fields and adivision of uh knowledge areas basicallymy my first my starting point for thispresentation would be to argue that youdon't really understand Bitcoin theculture but even uh the tool I mean youcan still use the tool as many peopleuse as many tools without having anyconception of how the tool came to be Imean we are using the internet now mostinternet users are teenagers watchingstuff on Tick Tock they have no idea oftcpap version four they don't know thehistory of the internet they don't knowthe cultural implication of the internetthey don't know the inner jokes of theinternet Builders they don't know whatthe internet uh standard task force wasor the protocol war that took place inthe 80s they don't know anything of thatand they don't they don't consider thephilosophical implication of theinternet and they don't they don'tparticipate to Inner internet jokes thesame goes with every kind of tool but ifyou really want to understand theoriginal uh the cultural origins ofBitcoin and some of its culturalimplications and the fact that Bitcoinis not just a tool but as Sergey saidit's also some kind of movement or ascoinsure said I think more precisely itis a kind a Counter Culture it's betterto start from uh from different areas ofareas of competence one is of course theone which is reflected by the last memeby uh by Vlad by uh by the the coremaintainer is the area of Engineers soin order to understand Bitcoin andBitcoins origin you have to be anengineer or at least you have tounderstand some of of these of thisculture which is very particular youneed to understand a little bit ofcomputer science a little bit ofengineering of distributed systems alittle bit of math like again discretealgebra cryptography and stuff like thatyou may not be a specialist but it'svery difficult to fully appreciateBitcoin as a as a project as uh and alsoas a word changing tool without anyunderstanding of the engineering and theengineering culture then my point wouldbe that this oh yeah of course there aretwo different kinds of Engineers thatthey don't often like each other I wouldqualify one as the typical front-endEngineers so they are very good atpeople facing software I call them from10 but this basically means people verygood at ux like the people that are goodat creating this leak uh user interfaceand then there are the more more likeum back to the to the essence back-enddevelopers mostly focused on efficiencyor safety uh and maybe a little bit lesson the front end these are the typicalcomma line tool Engineers these are morenerdish and a little bit less peopleoriented they are a little bit moretechnology oriented my point would bethat in order to understand Bitcoin inits culture you really have to get alsothe culture of the economic speculatorsI don't use this term in a completelyderogatory sense is disturbing a neutralsense speculators can be the veryshort-term uh day scalpers so peopletrading any kind of just to make aquick Buck without any kind offundamental analysis you know just thethe the the the the graph the the pricechart monkeys trying to get a profit byby scalping things and they don't carewhat is it what it what it is and theyjust seek a short-term profit and thenthere is also a more noble uh meaning ofthe term like long-term fundamentalspeculators that will actually considerthe long-term value they will analyzethe market in a very significant way sothis is a more let's say uh this is thiskind of Speculator is more like aneconomist trying to study fundamentalsof the things they will they will askquestions about the essence of money andmonetary phenomenons about timepreference and and aboutNetwork effects and all these uh thiskind of stuff Engineers they usuallydon't like speculators they think theyare just enormous they they don't knowhow to code so they are basicallyuseless Engineers do stuff they writecode they create the tools speculatorsas the term says they just speculate notjust economically but even when theywhen they perform long-term analysisthey they are just speculating you knowjust theoretically they write books theydon't write code this is not a divisionif is this is not a division in uhcompeting uh camps because this is theevent diagram so there is an overlap sothat doesn't mean that no engineer canalso be a Speculator or understandspeculation and vice versa there aresome uh overlaps a notable overlap willbe like you everybody knows Adam Beckazanback Adam back is actually a verypretty good Trader not many people knowthat but he is and he loves to trade andhe is also an engineer of course is oneof the original uh ogs and um so thereis a there is a tension between thesetwo groups and I add that you don'treally understand Bitcoin if you don'tunderstand also some part of the thirdCamp of the third let's say area ofcompetence which is the area of theidealist so the political the ideal isthe social activists in myin my uh Las Vegas presentation I calledthese uh third uh Set uh I called it therevolutionaries and then somebody likeespecially Michael uh Michael godston uhbasically pointed out that is not a verygood name because some of these arerevolutionaries in the strict sense theywant to change everything they want arevolution some of these are actuallyreactionaries they they want to go backto to something like a gold standard orprevious Society new federalism uh it'snot really about Revolution it's alsoabout uh reaction or even uh or evenrestoration so I think the better termis idealists these people are not in forthe technology these people are not infor the the money the speculation theeconomical uh the economical profitthese people are in to change the worldbut if you are just an idealist and youdon't don't understand anything aboutengineering you may end up a little bitlike Roger bearing yourself into notunderstanding the technology and and andbasically misallocating your expectationon the technology and if you don'tunderstand uh any anything about thespeculation you don't understand theeconomic incentives that keep Bitcoinrunning you don't understand how to uhhow to basically make your BitcoinJourney sustainable in an economicalsense so even here there is a lot oftension between these three areas but mypoint will obviously be that there mustbe some balance also the idealists arenot a compact group you can finddifferent kind of Bitcoin idealists forexample you can find the Bitcoinidealists that are more uh they are moresensitive about Freedom issues so thetypical let's call them to simplify leftLibertarians so uh like you know so yessome economic freedom but the spaceactually personal freedom privacy andand weed and you know we want to be freeand and self self-determination in mybody and cultural progressiveness andstuff like this and then you have thethe people that are more oriented to uhvirtue issues and not really Freedomissues uh for example you know we go togo we have to go back to the societywhere there are less uh crappy uharchitecture example if you if we goback to sound money we will make aCountryside Cottages uh great again butbut it's not just that of course it'sabout you know everything it's a typicalI will I will call that the typicalconservative side maybe culturallyconservatives and that's very strong inBitcoin and you can see the the the theprovocative and of course uh Tongan incheckum meme about Bitcoin fundamentals wasabout you know typical conservativeissues like like religion and guns andstuff like that so there is thisdistinction of course again this is aVenn diagram this is it doesn't meanthat everybody should be on the left ofthis uh of this circle or on the rightmost people some people are actuallymany of them are are in the middle andthey share both uh and uh we could callthem maybe uh paleo Libertarians if youwish they they have some kind ofconservative social mindset but togetherwith an Arco capitalist kind ofpolitical framework so there is a lot ofnuances here so starting from theseareas uh these these General archetypesuh what I think is it's funny andinteresting is that the three subculturethat I think emerged from the Bitcoinphenomenon and also somehow informed theBitcoin phenomenon are actually notthese three circles but they are locatedat the very intersections so the myargument in this presentation is thatthe overlaps between these three circlesare actually the main subcultures ofBitcoin right now so let's start fromthe first also chronologically speakingthe first is what is called cyberpunks Iassume that many of you are familiarwith the term the term is the word playon the on the cyberpunk uh literallyGeneral so the cyberpunk is uh this kindofum this topic future uh based sciencefiction uh literature gender and wherewhere governments and Corporation arebasically controlling everybody whichtoday just seems like like a newspaperbut back then was actually uh sciencefiction so uh these guys The Cypherpunks they took the the word Cipher soit's a cryptographic code and they theythey they play the a word play oncyberpunk and you use cryptographyCipher in order to prevent or or to fixa cyberpunk dystopic future and uh thisis the symbol of crypto anarchism whichis very strictly connected as a movementas a political idea which I cyberpunkmovement crypto anarchism would be apolitical idea in which basically wedon't have Anarchy in a normal worldbecause we always have some hierarchy ofphysical Force but assuming we can getaccess to the internet and to computersbasically connected in the internet andto strong cryptography then uh when weare online we can be really in a stateof anarchism because when we are alignedif the counterparty doesn't know who Iam they cannot come to my home to hurtme physically if they can't then itmeans that I can share idea I can tradethe products services and it isbasically anarchist because since nobodycan can hurt me because nobody knows whoI am or where I am uh cryptographiccryptographically enforce privacy willallow some kind of Anarchy in theinternet in the site in the in basicallyin the cyberspace to use a very outupdated term of course there are a lotof very famous name in The Cypher Punkmovement it's a broadly defined veryLoosely defined movement that includesof course Eric user Timothy May JohnGilmore Adam back Calvin nicksab himselfRichard stallman of the three softwareFoundation Mark and reason that now is a corner but back then it was like aan internet OG uh Jacob Appleman of ThorBronco and of BitTorrent and JulianAssange which who is now in in jailbecause he's a journalist and so thereis a lot of famous name in this in thiscamp and there is not just it is notjust something that happened beforeBitcoin and that in that basically uhcreated the culture that that createdbitcoin in turn it's actually somethingthat made Bitcoin uh mainstream for thefirst time the first time the Bitcoinwas mentioned in a political assembly inthe U.S Parliament and was because ofthe fear or the first very very bigBitcoin based Market that was actuallythe Silk Road created by by Ross ulbrichwhich is now uh incarcerated and it'sbasically he's imprisoned imprisoned uhfor for two uh live uh terms forcreating a website basically wherepeople were peacefully trading stuffmostly like recreational substances thatare illegal in some places but not inothers and uh like like marijuana butnot just that like the most sold item onthe Silk Road was actually books becausesome books religious books and not theyare forbidden in some countries so ifyou count in the Silk Road item list byitem uh books were the most tradedcommodity on the Silk Road and of coursealso substances and a lot of stuff uh sothis was a very important Cypher PunkMilestone and it's not all over likeright now people complain that thisSpirit you cannot finding uh find itanymore in Bitcoin that's not true thepoint is that this spirit is a littlebit diluted because Bitcoin grew as a asa movement so the number of cyberpunksactive in Bitcoin didn't uh shrink itactually grew but the number of peopleinvolved in Bitcoin as a movement as uhand as a and as a tool especially thenumber of people using Bitcoin grew alot out of this specific kind of of uhpersonal archetype so there is a lot ofCipher parts that like right now thereare more markets like the Silk Road thevolumes are higher now than during theSilk Road the peak and there are there'smore of this Market more these peopleand these ideas that Ross was trying toto promote with this website and thatcosted him uh maybe the rest of his lifein in a jail uh we are now morewhispering than ever the point is thatthey are more diluted across a a biggerbase of of users and also of influencersand and intellectuals or sealedintellectuals but this is not over andeven now if you look at the stuff goingon in Bitcoin there are purely cyberpunktools like I can name biscu or or or alot of other software I put here joinMarket as an example your Market is a uhis a privacy tool to use Bitcoinprivately and it's very it's a typicalCypher Punk tool because there is noCorporation behind it no company nolegal entity you just run the softwareand it's not even easy to run it's apython software that will crash a lotand uh people are trying to make itbetter with a web interface which iswhich is great and is and is uh isgrowing as I speak but it's a verycyberpunk thing to do uh so it's notoverall then after the Sci-Fi foreignbanks are idealists they are activiststhey are they have a politicalmotivation all of them but they are alsoEngineers their motto is cypherpunk'sRight code so they're not just talkingthey're not just complaining about thegovernment overreach they are creatingsoftware tools to overcome or mitigatecensorship and persecution and slaveryand and what government in general butthere is another subculture whichactually I think took over from so thethe prehistory of Bitcoin all the thingsthat brought to bitcoin like from AshCash to reusable proof of work of alfinito be money or vedai and bid gold ofNick Sabo all this stuff were verystrongly included into the cyberpunkcultural uh cultural humus in a way uhbut then when Bitcoin came out uh it wasperceived and also it was represented ina way it was depicted as a typical uh asa part of the typical startuper cultureyou know the typical Silicon Valleystartup culture which is very differentfrom from the Cyber cyberpunk culturethe uh like Satoshi the this image isthe image of the open source initiativeyou may remember many of you know thatthe open source movement started off asvery political with uh with stallman andand the free software uh foundation anduh and it's a very strong ideologicalcharge and then uh like complementary tothat there was this kind of very neutralpolitically neutral initiative which waswhich was basically the open sourceinitiative so when people think aboutJoomla or when people think about Drupalor or python they don't or or wikiWikipedia right now they don't reallythink about something which is likepolitical activism it's not it's nothingCipher anarchistic or Cypher bank orcrypto anarchists it's just likesoftware which is it's open because youknow permissionless Innovation open isbetter but there's not much uhideological charge and that's actuallysomething that you can find as well inthe in satoshi's white paper so if youread some of the sentences by Satoshithey are clearly political uh they itsays I'm I'm better with code that withwords but I think Bitcoin can be a toolto achieve freedom from from governmentoverreach and also some Clues like ifyou if you look at the Genesis blockwith the uh with the bailout of the UKBanks uh in the 2008 crisis it's a verystrong political statement uh also ifyou read like The the birthday theofficial birthday of Satoshi in theForum it was the day of the of Nixon onsuspending temporarily they go standardand the year of the uh sorry the year ofthe gold standard suspension1971 but the day of the executive order6102 of uh of Franklinton Rooseveltbasically confiscating the gold of allthe American citizens in the in the 30sso it was very political but if you readthe white paper itself it's written inorder to look like a very political likethe the white paper is all about youknow you want to do casual payments onthe internet there is nothingrevolutionary in the white paper it's uhthe the the the goal of the white paperis to present a technological innovationwhich is the time chain so it is the thesolution to the double spending problemthat's the goal and the the framing ofthe white paper is super like don'tscare people away don't be overlypolitical and you can find some some ofthese also when there is the famousExchange range of the Bitcoin talk userbasically cheering becauseWikileaks was using Bitcoin and Satoshiwhich is basically uh cooling everybodydown like I I wish they didn't do thatbecause we are not ready yet to uh toface a nation-state aggression so maybewe should just uh stay low for for alittle a little bit more until we wegrow more and there is like you can gouh if you if you go on GitHub in thebitcoin.org website repository you willfind a huge fight between the Bitcoindevelopers like Kevin Andresen andMichael but even so so basically now coiners but also like uh non-shitcoins like Luke Dash here or GregoryMaxwell uh many people in thedevelopment Community trying to keepBitcoin very neutral against the moreactivist types like John matonis orAndreas Antonopoulos trying to frameBitcoin as honestly of course becauseBitcoin is a tool with enormouspolitical consequences as morerevolutionary and there is a lot ofinsight between them and and you canappreciate actually the reason of bothuh Satoshi was not trying to be uh to bejust um uh like uh it was not justlacking courage it was trying to be itwas trying to be tactical it was tryingto beum smart about not over charging thepirate currency angle and try to staymore on the open source uh angle andthis is actually the kind of subculturethat became mostlydominant when Bitcoin first wentmainstream in 2013 2014 when Iapproached Bitcoin at the end of 2012 Iwas very politically uh I was anactivist in many senses and I was alittle bit turned off by the fact thatmost lead developers they were aretrying to to basically tune this kind ofaspects down there is typically you knowthis is a this is a screenshot of theblog post from my current my current wasone of the most influenced influentialBitcoin developers he created bitcoin Jit was very influential and then he hetried to uh to basically change Bitcoinhe failed and so he rage quit and itwent towards for banks and this is thehis article the resolution theresolution of the Bitcoin experiment ofcourse actually this moment representedthe resolution of the my currentexperiment in as a Bitcoin developmentdeveloper and it was I think he embodiedthe kind of developer he worked forGoogle now he works for big Banks and hewanted to keep Bitcoin very normal hewas horrified by the idea that Bitcoincan use for illegal things or uh or orwhatever that means of course becauseeverything is illegal in somejurisdiction so he proposed to make aBitcoin intending in order to Blacklistillegal transactions and stuff like thatand then it Rage Quit because Bitcoindidn't follow this kind of on of imageactually if you if you if you keeplooking at the way the mainstream isrepresenting Bitcoin right now you maysee that this representation of Bitcoinis still the dominant one like if youlook at the uh this is a not very badnot very good TV series startup wherethese guys basically create somethinglike Bitcoin and it's true that there'ssome interest in this tool by by like uhdrug dealers and and stuff like that butmostly it's perceived as a centralizedtypical startup so you have the nurseincorporating an entity and creating aproductfor these people for these normiesBitcoin is seemed like a nap not like apeer-to-peer protocol that they don'teven I think they assume the writers ofthe of of this kind of series they don'teven understand what a peer-to-peer opensource Unstoppable Cypher Punk protocoleven means andyeah even if you read like uh but thelast Balaji book Balaji of course is isa Corner as well but it's also veryinfluential in in Bitcoin because it wasI mean he created a few huge companiesand uh and now we published this bookwhich is not bad I think but it his ideaof political Innovation is verystartup-like uh it's it's a differentkind of culture from The Cypher Punkideal it's more Normie it's morenormalized in a way so this is the campthe subculture of star Toppers the uh sothe first one the cyberpunks wasdominant in all the the Inception ofBitcoin and then start and kept it stillis it is still present right now it waspresent with the Silk Road it waspresent with uh Amir Taki was stillpresent with the joint market and manyother Cypher Bank tools but the startupangle started to become more dominantafter after a while so many peopleinteracted with Bitcoin under thisrepresentation under this subculture andthen there is a third one which is a uhin Las Vegas I called this cut this thisCamp it is over at austrians becausethey are especially we are I mean butthey are not now I'm pretending to beneutral I'm pretending to be like anexternal Observer uh they are uhparticularly focused on Ocean economicsbut I think it's more probably more uhfitting to call them maximalistsexplicitly so uh what are maximalists uhwhat is bitcoin maximalist at thebeginning it was just a slur like a waythat Bitcoin former Bitcoin journalistand and then Quantum scammer and then coiner Vitaly bootering uh decidedto use to describe I would say most ofBitcoin developers and activists uhright right now the term after this thisinitial use the term was reappropriatedyou know that some slur some negativeterms they get reappropriated by the bythe targets for example in in UKpolitics uh weeks and tourists it wasthey were incense at the beginning onemeans like uh like basicallyum like a street criminal and the othermeans like uh they were like the spreadthe disparager dispersative uh terms andthey they have been reappropriated thesame goes with you know queer queer waswas an insult and now there's like aqueer study uh faculty in some U.Suniversities or all of them I don't knowand the same goes with theImpressionists in art impressionist wasactually an insult was a way to ridiculeImpressionists and they just decided tocode themselves uh Impressionsmaximalist was the same uh vitalikframed everybody who was not okay with coins as a Bitcoin maximalism amaximalist and then the term wasreappropriated by most people and we sayokay you want to use the term let's usethe term in a semi-ironic sense peoplestarted to self-identify as an actualmaximalist like yes okay I'm guilty ascharged I I do think that uh that the coins cannot be useful for manyreasons uh there is a lot of reasonthere are a lot of reasons for youBitcoin maximalism and I will notdedicate too much if you are moreinterested later on I can I can focus alittle bit more but the main point ofMaxima is in this sense is that when youcreate uh digital scarcity once youcannot recreate it in infinitely uh inan indefinite number of time so uh thereis a fixed number of Bitcoins there isnot a fixed number of cryptocurrenciesuh cryptocurrencies can be inflated justas Fiat money if not even more andeverybody can create as many as he wantsthere is no Supply cap in cryptocurrencyso you cannot recreate digitalscarcities and so many of the formerdevelopers of Bitcoin first developersof Bitcoin the main ones uh they theywere accused to be maximalists and theyare in this sense but they didn't uh usethey didn't self-identify as as once forexample uh if you think about LukeDasher uh he considers ethereum a scamwhich I think it is and Litecoin is ascam which I think it is and Monera is ascam which I think it is uh same goesfor Gregory Maxwell so all these peoplewere included in this representation butthey didn't use the term uh they didn'treappropriate the term uh the termstarted to be reappropriated strangelyenough by some guy that was not reallythe developer it was a interesting guycontroversial guy for many for manyreasons and it was this guy he's uh hepassed awayprobably recently like one year ago hisname islike a super hot it was like a superhodler and it and a very interestingblogger and um he basically started touh uh to reappropriate the termmaximalism uh in in his version the termwas not so much about being againstcoins which he was he was very muchagainst coins but especially it wasagainst every kind of change in Bitcoinevery kind of Sudden Change or extremechange basically it was an extremist ofkeeping Bitcoin stable as opposed tochanging it playing it with it the theprotocol especially it was the theorigin of the toxic uh status quodefender in Bitcoin against any kind ofchange even like issued a dead threatsomehow to to the Bitcoin developerum Peter wheeler so it was it was a verystrange guys a guy today he probably ismoreremembered for controversial takes onexternal topics like like feminism andand feudalism and stuff like that but itwas very very influential and then theterm started to be Associated especiallywith the the so-called AustrianRenaissance in Bitcoin so many peoplemany people were already consideringstuff like inflation time preference inthe early origins of Bitcoin like in2001 you can see a very young Peter Todda Todd 16 years old the exchangingemails with Adam back about the issueschedule of Bitcoin they are discussinginflation and basically they arediscussing stop to flow relationshipwith without using these terms but whatsafety animals did was to actually takethe the additional the traditionalterminology and the traditionalframework of the Austrian economicsAustin Economist is this school ofEconomics which just like makes sense asopposed to the rest of the garbageeconomics and it was developed by a fewAustrian guys initially so manger misesHayekand others and so uh now many peopleassociate the Bitcoin maximalism withocean economics andeconomical thinking and economical termslike againtime preference and and all this stuffmany of the things that Sergey put inthe Bitcoin the movement slide they werebasically from this view of Bitcoinmaximally so this kind of economic uh ifyou read the Bitcoin standard you shouldread it I think it's a great book but itdoesn't talk about Bitcoin forbasically almost all of it it basicallytalks about the history of money in astrong Austrian framework and then headds Bitcoin as the last part of coursethere is also the Fiat standard which isa another beautiful book which is thethe basically the follow-up of thisand this is also considered maximalismand then there are like two disguiseright right now if you think aboutmaximalists you think about laser eyesnumber go up and uh bucale like thepresident of El Salvador which is I meanit's it's curious because uh the samethe same cultural movement that was uhtheorizing crypto anarchism uh some ofit at least uh is cheering up for a headof state which is uh at least peculiar Ithink there there's there are some waysin which this is not contradictory atall but it is for sure very paradoxicaland then there is Michael sailor youknow it's a it's a it's a it's veryclose to the Bitcoin standard uh uh sideof maximalismindeed it was the second one to writethe forward to the Bitcoin standard bookbut the first one was a Nasim Talib butthen he just went full so uh toto search for another one and uh and youknow this is probably the most popularbrand of maximalism on Twitter right nowlazarized to the Moon number go up uhand that's the The Branding in a waythat's the the memeum so what I would like to I'm I'mrunning a little bit long but let'slet's try to to finish in a in ameaningful way so uh these uhsubcultures interact in a non-trivialway is some against again this is a Venndiagram that means that somebody can bea cyberpunk and a maximalist and astartuper for example againum Adam Beck was one of the originalCypher punks but is also a Speculatorand he is certainly a maximalist sothese are not mutually exclusive butsome of the people inside thesesubcultures they perceive thissubculture as exclusive and they have avery low opinion of everything else forexample Cypher punks they tend to calleverybody else uh state is larpersbasically larpers mean you know a liveaction role play uh so it means thatyou're not really doing stuff you'rejust pretending you are you're just alarpa you dress dress up like like anactivist but you you know nothing youyou don't build anything uh you knowCypher Banks write code what do you doyou just write books you just createcompanies you just uh you just teachpeople you translate uh documentationthat's that's LARPing we just Cypherpunch just write code and you're sostatus because uh if you are not astrict crypto Anarchist then you'rebasically you're basically a fascist uhwhich I mean I I don't necessarilydisagree but they are very very strongin this uh Us Versus Them distinctionand of course there is uh that doesn'tmean that there is no nothing I couldcall statism in The Cypher Punk fieldfor example uh The Cypher punks tend tosome of them at least on this extremethey tend to be very much you know uhscience cultists I will I will call themthey uh so if you if the government isforcing everybody to do somethingbecause of religion so because Jesus orAllah says so then that's bad and weshould justify the government but if thesame government will will impose thesame kind of stuff because of sciencewhich was something especiallyespecially important in the last threeyears of coronasis then many of theseguys they I mean yeah we are anti we areagainst the government uh but uh but Prouh Pro fauci or stuff like that so thereis some level of statism here as wellbut everything else everybody else is astatus larper then for maximalists uheverybody has so for some people herebasically everybody has just a coinscammer which I mean again I'mpretending to be neutral here but I Iunderstand the sentiment and it'sbasically true and um so many of thesewill just consider everybody here uh a scammer are you using Monerobecause because you're trying to be veryaggressive about privacy you are ascammer are you experimenting withethereum because you want to create somecool startup or use case well you are Corner are you just buying andsellingum uh Shiba Inu uh meme coin you you are coin so uh this is the uh this isthe the perception of the puremaximalist versus every everybody elseand and this is basically what is uh uhoften at the center of some Twitterdrama because here on the Other Extremeyou have uh you have you have what Icall the antima just like antifa but inthis case they're antima the old Twitterpresence is about fighting Bitcoinmaximalism and that's the only uh reasonfor their their life and interaction youknow the typical UD and and Eric and soon and then you have uh for for thestartuppers for some startuppers hereeverybody has uh in the Spectrum willjust be a toxic Castle so we are the onethat that can talk with peopleinstitutions and government and and themarket and we can actually bring onadoption and you guys are just you'rejust basically uh driving everybody awayyou you cannot uh you are better atmarketing you're scaring people away andstuff like that so these are the basicuh conflicts here uh the the nice thingof of this conflicts is that everybodyis is fighting with everybody else thisis the a beautiful Bitcoin meme you knowbrothers and sisters are natural enemiesjust like corners and bitcoiners orbankers and bitcoiners or status andbitcoiners or bitcoiners and otherbitcoiners then bitcoiners they'veruined Bitcoin you Bitcoin sure are thecontentious people you just made anenemy for life but um before I I end andI uh sorry sorry Rockstar if I'm alittle bit long but just cut me off ifI'm if I'm getting too long uh I wouldlike to enter a little bit more or intosome of the conflicts which are I thinkare very important one is a the factthat Cypher punk are really focused onprivacy which I think is very veryimportant privacy is the main thingabout crypto anarchism and The CypherPark movement while some of thespeculators they just want to make moneythey don't like privacy they wantauditability and they like thestartuppers they want to disability notto scare off the government and theaustrians the maximalists they wantedauditability because because scarcity isvery important indeed maximal is uh wellum uh while the the subtappers they alsothey they specialize on adoption theyreally want you know Mass adoptionthat's the goal Bitcoin must be adoptedwhile the idealists they they mostlywant Purity they they are they are readyto sacrifice some adoption if they cankeep Bitcoin pure they are thinking orour thinking is we already have thealternative which is Fiat stay there ifyou don't need something radical if youneed Bitcoin you need Bitcoin andcompromise uh without without any kindof watering though uh there is a goodarticle by by Alex vesky about uhbasically expanding an idea of Francispuyo about the The Remnant the BitcoinRemnant give it a read is very very goodum then uh maximalist they especiallythink about scarcity not just scarcityin the scarcity of Bitcoin like theimportance of the 21 million limit theimportance of the inflation schedule uhthe the difficulty adjustment thehalving but also scarcity in general youknow economics basically the economicalscience is the science of managingscarcity so dealing with scarceresources so there is a strong uh focuson scarcity and scarcity means forexample no coins because digitalscarcity cannot be reproduced andindefinitely and it also means notchanging Bitcoin too much because youneed to in order to have scarcity youneed some kind of stableframework that cannot be changed byanybody because otherwise somebody willcreate inflation eventually so you needbasically immutability of the corefunctioning of the protocol so you needthis this kind of written in stoneelement to bitcoin while on the otherhand the engineers they don't likescarcity much because they want to playand they want flexibility the some ofthem want flexibility in uh kind incoins so they want to use differentcoins for different use cases some ofthem want maybe just Bitcoin but theywant to change it a lot they want tointroduce new codes every year I mean weare not supporting this year what whatyou are what are we even doing I willjust move to denta coin because becausethere's no innovation here so there is alot of tension between the theengineeringengineering drive to experiment withstuff and the maximalist attention tonot breaking the scarcity of of Bitcoinand these I think are very very stronguh I think these are six things theythat they just like some kind of uhDavid star that they can they canexplain a lot of debates a lot of fightson on Twitter and elsewhere and not juston Twitter because some people say thatthis drama are just Twitter driven uhthat's not the case because in physicalmeetups I have seen this kind of debatesmaybe they tend to be a little bit moreconstructive and a little bit less uhthat they are more polite also becausewe are nerds so they will we don't likephysical confrontation especially withpeople like Rockstar but uh but butstill there is a lot of debate inphysical meetups as well there are a fewother debates here for exampleum cyberpunks they tend to be arealistic they tend to be adversarialthey tend to think about all the waysBitcoin could fail so we should fix thisfix that there is this threat model thiscan be broken this can be insufficientwe should fix the you know the securitybudget or the Privacy the fingivitywhatever while the the speculators theyare more like fatalists like Beaconalready won uh there's more there'sthere's a pro approach likeum like startuppers they think thatBitcoin already won because if itdoesn't there will be another cryptothat will just take over whilemaximalists most of them think thatBitcoin already won because he it'sscarcity's number go up technology istoo strong that it will just fixeverything else automatically of courseI'm oversimplifying him I'm this is aalmost a parody of real positions andthen there is a that is a strong accentof saving uh maximalists are all aboutsaving you know hodling against uhspending uh the engineer the engineersthey don't like to to work on on savinguse cases because they are not as sexyas uh as spending you know moving moneyaround there are more engineeringchallenges here than here even if uhlike like cool storage is a prettyinterest testing technical challenge butstill most Engineers they like to toplay with spending use cases and thenthere are there's a very interesting bitwhich is uh Cypher punks they wereperceived on topics different fromBitcoin as a part of a contrariansubculture a Counter Culture again sothey were for example if you think aboutthe 80s the late 80s and the 90scyberpunks were weird guys most of themthey were like the mainstream uh themainstream guys they were like suitsthey were just addressing suits and theywere in ties they were about moneyespecially in the 90s they were WallStreet guys and these guys were actuallydressing hoodies and some of them inconferences they wear masks uh likeother bitcoiners are not like thatsome Cypher punks they are very strangethey they may they may cover their theirface during conferences they they mayhave a particular nerdy subculture Whilemost other Bitcoins especially the thespeculators they tend to be verymainstream but what is interesting isthat this was especially true in the 80sand the 90s now this kind of culturalcontrarianism even if if even if it maynot be the norm across large parts ofthe world population it is almost thenorm in the mainstream representation soif you watch movies or TV series orbooks this is actually pretty normal tobe like a vegan polyamorousprivacy of Obsessed nerd with the hoodieuh while right now it's the it's um andwe go back to the Bitcoin fundamentalistmeme it's actually the more conservativeoriented approach of the of somemaximalist which is perceived as acontrary maybe not contrarian with theactual population because most of thepopulation of this planet is religiouswhile while most of the mainstreamrepresentation of the culture isstrongly anti-religious or you know thethe things we have seen in the memeslike guns and and meat and and this kindof stuff and in this case there it'smore like the engineers which areusually more mainstream like you knowfor everything which is not strictlyBitcoin related Engineers uh tend tobasically follow some Engineers ofcourse them some of them they tend tofollow the same kind of mainstream ideaor meme or or the current thing uh youcan imagine them you know about aboutvaccines about nutrition about climatechange and carbon dioxide while theseguys usually they they come from theangle in which since Bitcoin showed usthat everything the mainstream expertswere saying about but the economics waswrong so the monetary experts were wrongon everything so maybe other kinds ofexperts including the like nutritionexperts or climate experts uh may bewrong as well or maybe malicious as wellso there is a lot of contrarian culturegoing on in this side which is actuallyuh if you go back to the to thebeginning of the presentation uh Vladthe developer has a pretty as a verynerdy but pretty mainstream uh kind ofcultural framing while the while whilethe the original become fundamentalistmeme was pretty contrarian on that pointof view last slide uh okay this is justthe last slide I just want to say thatthe the fight between privacy andscarcity is the most important uh fightto watch right now because I think bothboth sidesneed to win in order for Bitcoin to winbecause privacy is fundamental forsaving uh if you don't have privacy youcannot save because you your money willappreciate but it will be confiscatedand saving is important for privacybecause if you don't move money it'seasier to stay private scarcity isimportant to spending because scarcitywill basically help money to emerge fromBarter and vice versa so okay let'slet's stop it here because I alreadyfinished one hour without even thequestion I hope yeah get into thequestions now sorry the timing is nevermy strong",
