We are building Fedimint as a superior alternative to 3rd party custody. Fedimint is a mechanism for Bitcoiners and trusted community members to onboard their local communities to Bitcoin in a more accountable and private way.This is a quick tour through the protocol to help you understand how it works and to answer questions around the trade offs, technologies, and common terms you might hear. We close this tour with an overview of several use cases we believe Fedimint can help with.The purpose of this documentation is to explain how Fedimint works, in a manner that is easily digestible by a non technical audience, inspired by the bitcoin.org wiki.The following high level overview of the documentation was recorded for the bitcoin design community on 20th September 2022.Edit this pageNextPrimerDocsWikiTech DocsCommunityTelegramTwitterDiscordContributeGitHubMailGPG Key\n\n\n\n",
