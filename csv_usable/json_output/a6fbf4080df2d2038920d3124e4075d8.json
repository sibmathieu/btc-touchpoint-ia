man great to seeyou thanks for making this happen reallyexcited how have you beenit's good you know I wasn't expectingthe deer to start this way being thrustinto this conversation and and I didn'tthink it was even going to be that youknow uh you know kind of talking aboutthe system being rigged but it seemslike uh to me it wasn't really thatnewsworthy but um people seem to want toknow what's going on you know and Ithink they believed that you know I wasawhite dude kind of seeing how the systemwas rigged which is just true so uh it'sbeen it's been gratifying to talk aboutI mean it's an issue it's an issue wereally care about so um the BitcoinCommunity has been it's it's uh moms andand Bitcoin Community it has been uhthey've been the two communities thathave been really been amped up aboutthis that's really fascinating moms andbitcoiners there you go I think uh thoseare the two groups that are going tolead us to the to you know to save ourcountry I think I think you know if Iwere to put my uh obviously biasedexplanation to it I would say they'rethe people that are most concerned aboutthe long term and the people with thelowest time preference so like motherssuddenly have this child of theirs thatthey love so much and they wanted tolive another 60 80 100 years healthy andhappy and so they have a much lower timepreface of the way they focus on thingsand I tend to think Bitcoin is a littlebit like that that's why the uh foodmessage is so resonant among bitcoinersI mean once people get the orange billit's only a matter of time before theystartshedding a lot of the garbage that thefood industry wants to feed everybodywhich is the topic of today'sconversation so tell us tell us a littlebit first about your background how yougot into this nefarious businessas a drug dealeryeah so right now I mean you knowlooking forward I'm you knowentrepreneur trying to change theincentives of our food health systemwhich I think is the biggest issue inthe world and it goes back to my earlycareer so I got into this business youknow I was born and raised in the swampin Washington DC and I was a good youngconservative lad and uh you know gettinginto politics for the right reasons Iwas ideological andum you know worked in campaigns early inmy career and um you know trying to pushAmerican competitiveness forward andwhat I learned quickly is that whetheryou're on the left or the right in theU.S when those campaigns Are Over Youinevitably go into Consulting andum like many people who finish campaignsearly in my career I was across thetable from Pharma Executives and foodexecutivesand you know everything in DC you knoweverything in our world right is sonormalized you know you know I I went toHarvard Business School and see all myfriends go to food companies Departmentcompanies you know that high level aredoing bad things but everyone can kindof go to sleep at night and that'sdefinitely true in DC you know and thesethese stories you know in retrospect arekind of shocking but it's it's it'sshockingly normalized you know whenyou're sitting around the table and whatI saw early in my career you know isliterally like lists of professors youknow around this time 2010 the opioidissue was was heating up and it was howdo we find friendly professors tosuggest for panels and differentorganizations to talk about opioidpolicy and it was you know the presidentof Stanford med school was on that listwho was a pain specialist and Iliterally watched as you know thisperson was put on a list in WashingtonDC and Pfizer who's a big opioid makerdonates four million dollars to Stanfordword you know for a new you know paininitiatives and then that Dean of theschool is put on a panel at the NIH uhto make opioid policy which suggestedmore lenient you know opioid use andthen led to just complete Devastationbut but the these things these movesthese economic moves are literallyplayed out like chessum and it and and then on the other sideand I didn't understand the connectionat the time but we food was a majorclient and you know this story resonateda lot but I saw you know around thistime as well Coca-Cola and Pepsi weretrying to keep soda on food stamps whichis a government nutrition program youknow that 15 of the American peopledepend on uh this obviously makes nosense uh sodas just pure diabetes waterhas you know I would say negativenutritional value but you know it's it'sa Playbook it's like how do we how do werig the institutions of trust and uhliterally saw as Coke Executives theseyou know kind of a grotesque image thesethese old white guys go into the NAACPand other civil rights groups that arevery respected in the United States andpay millions of dollars for these civilrights groups to label opponents asracist to label parents who areconcerned about their kids drinking moresoda racistsum they went to think tanks to pay offthink tanks and and produce bogusstudies and then of course the sodacompanies went to universities and andthat that's a real theme that that Ireally saw that really influenced how Ithink about this today leadinguniversities from Harvard and Stanfordon down are little more than publicrelations entities and in the case offood uh processed food companies pay 11times more than the NIH for basicnutrition research you know which got usthe Harvard study saying that sugaredand kazobisti which has led to a lot ofthe the devastating nutritional policieswe we still suffer from to this day yeahum I think it's absolutely fascinatingthe the extent of the corruption andit's you know these stories keep comingnot periodically you're not the firstperson to bring this out obviously andthey always make a splash and peoplesort of come to accept them but it'sfascinating to me that uh they continueto nonethelessexpect somebody else to do somethingabout it but they continue to in manycases justaccept it as a normal part of realityand continue to consume the products ofthese very same companies like this iswhat I find astonishing and and you canunderstand it when you're trying to quitthose things and you realize just howaddictive they are right and that that'sit's there's a lot of rationalizationthat goes on here but people I thinkreally need to keep listening to thosestories because it's it's very it's verytrue and it's uh I in in my second bookthe Fiat standard I talk about uh uhHarvard University in particular when itcomes to Sugar so uh the guy who startedthe Nutrition department there so a guynamed Frederick's therewrites about him in her book and I thinkGary Tobbs also talks about them and uhthis guy I mean he was getting tons ofmoney from the 1960s onwards from thefood industry and he heavily promotedall these insane ideas of sugar is ahealthy nice snack harmless it's goodstay rejected the idea that the Americandiet was harmful stating for examplethat Coca-Colawas a healthy between meal snacks I'mgoing to share this one sec starerejected the idea that the American dietwas harmful stating for example thatCoca-Cola was a healthy between mealsnacks and that eating even greatamounts of sugar would not cause healthproblems it is autobiography stairsstates that in 1960 obtained a grant of1 million and twenty six thousanddollars from General foods for theexpansion of the school's nutritionResearch Laboratories imagine a milliondollars in 1960 that's a lot that's alot of money that's a lot of that wasserious money that was at that pointgold was 35 an ounce so this is a lot ofmoney and then in the 44 period And aswe're continuing the quote now and thatin the 44 year period as a nutritionisthe raised a total of 29 000 29 millionsix hundred thirty thousandsomething dollars for instance Kellogg'sfunded two million dollars to set up thenutrition Foundation at Harvard thefoundation was independent of theuniversity and published a journalnutrition reviews the stair edited for25 years stair also co-founded andserved as chairman of the board ofdirectors for the American Council onscience and healthin 1980 during his tenure as chairman hesought funding from U.S tobacco giantPhilip MorrisUSA for acsh's activities this isbasically the Pinnacle of Fiat sciencein Harvard University this is the guy hewas living off of the sugar industryGeneral Foods Kellogg'sand running journals and runningnutrition departments in Harvard as Isaid I am a Harper gratim involved insome initiatives at Harvard I want tospeak extremely plainly here this whatyou have on the screen herethere is millions of lives of blood onwhat happened here on this clinical kindof exchange of fundswhat and you go out yeah that onemillion back then right this was a tonof money and it's still happening todayto actually much more pronounced degreeand you just have to ask our Kellogg arethe sugar companies do they wantsomething right even the day we'rebattered over the head that oh there's athere's a wall there's not a conflictthese these donations can't influencethe science it's like let me tell youKellogg and these sugar companies payingyou know in in in today's terms tens ofmillions of dollars back then nowthere's billions of dollars spent onnutrition research they want somethingand what happened here is that thisresearch was taken directly by Kelloggby soda companies by other sugarcompanies and brought to Capitol Hill tobrought to school houses to influencechildhood nutrition policies you know itled of course to the disastrous 1990sfood pyramid now one thing in Americathat's interesting is that we actuallydo listen to our medical professionalsright we actually do like we know evenwith the vaccine most people did takethe vaccine it's it it we actually dohave respect in America for our medicalprofessionals and when that food pyramidcame outit dramatically shifted the Americandiet so you can actually look at a graphof like the components of the Americandiet by like fats and carbs carbs as apercentage of the American diet in theseven years after the release of thefood pyramid which this study led towent up 20 percentand fats healthy fats went down 20percentabsolute devastation to the cells ofAmericans you know carbs and sugar rightthat's our that's ourselves fuel glucosesugar consumption has gone up a hundredX in a hundred years here it is alsofrom the field there we go there we goso so look at these lines right reallydramatic Great Grains which which whichthe food pyramid pushed which which theprocessed part the processing has onlyhappened recently but the processing isripping off the fiber from the grain soit's just the inner shell which isself-stable but has very limited editionvalue and essentially converts to sugarin the blood so grains are a hiddensugarfresh fruits have been actuallygenetically modified uh to include toinclude more sugar even if they're quoteorganic you know and these these theseingredients at the bottom right theseingredients that are body evolutionarilyout for hundreds of you thousands ofyears are made to ingest and eat theseare plummeting so it's all processedfoods going up and all so that's what itjust like we just have to use commonsense when a when a when Harvard whenstudies are paid for tens of millions ofdollars right and then those studiescome out saying sugar doesn't causeobesity we should be eating more sugarand carbs less fats that's then used toinfluence policy and we would hope rightthat this was over but this is onlyhappening in more hyperdrive today themost recent nutritional study the thebanner nutritional study funded by theNational Institute of Healthis funded by at the tops Universitywhich is a leading nutrition school onthe study it's millions of dollars fromthe NIH and millions of dollars fromfood companies so food companies canactually jointly fund with the nihsstudy there was a joint press releasesaying that this study is the mostcomprehensive nutrition uh research everconducted and it's called the tops NIHfood compass and it's saying that LuckyCharms are three times healthier thaneggs and that Honey Nut Cheerios aresignificantly more healthier than beefand just like what created this we kindof think that this food pyramid is is arelic of the 90s and over no no the thethe the 2000 uh 20 nutritionalguidelines 95 of the folks on thatcommittee were directly paid for by foodand Pharma companies and just recentlywe now just this week the folks wereappointed to the 2025 nutritionalcommittees there's massive conflicts ofinterest the majority of folks on thatpanel are paid for you know withresearch by Pharma and food includingnow significant conflicts with anobesity drug to basically profit fromthis mess this miracle Beastie cure youknow what one woman was just on 60Minutes who's nowum a chief person on the on the panelthat's going to make our childrentraditional guidelines saying thatobesity which is only really an issue inthe last 50 years is a genetic conditionand that we should be going to surgicalfirst and Drug first not talking aboutpersonal choice not talking about eatinghealthy that that's actually a fallacythat even if people eat healthyum they'll still be fat so this thiscontinues to this day yeah this is thetough food Compass I just pulled it outso let's see what these people aresaying what you should eatFrosted Mini Wheats are basically thirdplace so first place is watermelonsecond place is kale essentiallynutrient freeand then you've got Frosted Mini Wheatswhich is anti-nutrient full unsweetenedalmond milk this is like their idea ofnutritious food and then at the absolutebottom of the chart is ground beefthat's right six out of 100. one of themost nutrient-dense Foods you couldpossibly have whole eggs and and butterso yeah so so so this this studywas funded millions of dollars by Danonewhich is one of the largest processedfood makers they're actually theindustry leader world leader in creatingalmond milk and what this graph doesn'teven show is that chocolate almond milkis actually rated higher is it's in the90s above grass-fed Greek yogurt okayadditionallyum you you have dozens of name brandcereals dozens in the green inencouraged you have the author this thisuh the researchers who conducted thestudy who are leaders of the White HouseNutrition conference who areworld-renowned leaders of nutritionactually with this pushback they're nowvociferously defending Lucky Charmsthey're saying Lucky Charms absolutelyare Health Food absolutely should beencouraged you know I can tell you rightnow and and again your viewers can youknow I am not a doctor I'm not anutritionist but but but but I can tellyou and I I think we're being to have adigestive system yeah and and I've hadone all of your life I think this goesto why I think you know bitcoiners arereally amped up on this issue it's likewe're being asked to not believe our oureyes like like we're being asked byElites to just to just literally believeuh uh you know absolute insanity and askids are dramatically increasing seeingincreased rates of allergies autoimmuneconditions chronic conditions 25 ofchildren now have pre-diabeteswe are being asked to shut up and Trustthe scienceand you know in the wake of violencehappening to our kids clearlyunprecedented situations obviously tiedto food we're being asked you know evenfolks um my partner Justin Maris and Ihave been you know proud to be pushingthis this food Compass thing Joe Rogantweeted to you know linked to some stuffwe wrote and and and we've been uhhelping get it on a lot Fox News whichis the only Network that's going tocover this we've been we've been intouch and they've been covering everynight we've been absolutely brutalizedby professors and academics saying thatwe have no idea what we're talking aboutwell I think a lot of people wake up Ithink bitcoiners are waking up I thinkmoms are waking up as we talked about II think it is absolutely appropriate aswe're seeing a classroom with 45 a childover children overweight it'sappropriate to be asking questions rightnow yeah absolutely I think it's uh it'svery clear that there are a lot ofproblems with the way that food isconsumed I think one of the mostdepressing things I see is I walk aroundand I look at a school class who's inthe school playground or kids in theirbackyard playing even like if you'relooking at a soccer practice and kidsare all dressed up in their soccer kitsthe majority of kids are still obeselike this is an extremely common thingit's it's a majority of young kids areobese and it's just a completelydifferent type of childhood that theylivefor the majority of us I think in ourgeneration people people who are now intheir 30s or 40sthings were bad always with the candybut I think at that time we weren'tquite as devastated by the by the but bythe food as we are right nowand you know if you look over the yearsthe um there's I I I'm quite convincedby the research of Kate Shanahan fromDeep nutrition which explains that yousee that this damage accumulates overtime so it's not just that you know youeat bad today you feel bad tomorrow whatyou eat today is going to reflect thehealth of your children that you'regoing to conceive soon and then that'sgoing to carry you through in their lifeand I think it's been accumulating overthe years because kids who are beingborn today were born to parents whospent their entire life eatingindustrial garbagewho whose parents mostly didn't eat asmuch industrial car garbage so kidsthese days have it a lot tougher than usmetabolically they have a lot moremetabolic damage accumulated in theirgenes from their parents than we do andso it's it's reaching a crisis point itreally is I think it's absolutely insanewhen you think about it it's to thepoint where it's it's expected that themajority of activities the children doare simply getting together andconsuming enormous amounts of sugar andit's it's marketed as this you know thefun thing where since we all gettogether we all excuse each other we allprovide each other with an excuse we alluh you know we all indulge and uh it'sthe way that we can be healthy friendsand it's a way that we can have aregular healthy friendship it's justsuch a normalized part of friendship andthere's so much marketing effort thatgoes toward normalizing sugar binges asthe default state of childhood ratherthan you know moving going out being achild doing stupid things and climbingstuff and the big places you're notsupposed to be going all of that isbecoming less and less tolerated as apart of childhood because on the onehand kids can't do it anymore becausethey're so much lazier and fatter and onthe other hand because all of their lifeis programmed aroundshitty sugary sludge basically I meanprofound points going back to my earlywork with food companies you know thisisn't complicated what the strategy isyou know we had a Playbook and thePlaybook is around normalization thatthat's that's just like an absolute coreprinciple you go back to the cigarettePlaybook you know it's it's muddy thescience it's fun as many studies aspossible to see doubt and it's going tonormalize these things it's you know getthese get the cigarettes and movies getthe cigarettes you know have doctors inthe ads so when I was working for thefood companies we actually had a hugepush and a big strategy for them wasschools and hospitals so food companiesactually spent big soda spends aninordinate amount of time and attentionto get their products into schools andhospitals and to this day to this daythe majority of pediatric Wards in theUnited Stateshave soda machines that sell sugarydrinks to this day I was just you knowwe just had our first uh son this yearyou know in the past yearcongratulations thank you and and as wetalked about that's a huge it doeschange your perspective it's cliche butthis does change your perspective walklooking at the world these little theselittle guys are going into I mean it'sheartbreaking but right just just justfeet from where he was born there is asoda machine you know and the mom is youknow fedum is served offered soda and an orangejuice which is which I think is just asbad uh yeah right after birth so sohospitals we've normalized it it'sliterally where we give birth my mom youknow another another instance in my lifethat's it's highly led me to to beingpassionate about this you know dyingrecently of cancer which is highly tiedto food which we can get into she wasdiabetic the diabetes led to in manyways to her cancer which we can get intomore and and served offered sodaliterally on her her deathbed as adiabetic dying of cancer of a meta likethis is how normalized it is in thehospital settings and then schoolsum the majority the vast majority ofhigh schools now still have vendingmachines that sell sugary drinks andthat's a huge push right so when wenormalize it right as you said now it'sjust you are a terrible parent for yourtwo-year-old's birthday you're notserving cake and looking at these kidsaround sugar these two-year-olds is intosingle from looking at a bunch of methaddicts right it this is a this is ahighly highly dopamine triggeringchemical that has no nutritional valueyou know I'm a Libertarian I actuallythink most drugs should be legal but butwe have to be very clear-eyed we haveallowed a highly addictive harmful drugto weaponize our food and be totallynormalized for kids it's like I and justgetting to the point about everyonebeing obese and looking at kidsclassrooms I I'm a Libertarian I'm a bigfree choice guy I've actually shifted myopinion a lot on this I don't I think itis gaslighting from the system to saywhat's happening to the to the peopleand to children as a result of personalchoice and laziness you don't have aclassroom of five-year-olds where themajority of kids are obese based onpersonal choice we have a totally riggedsystem where we've taken a highlypowerful drug and this is just againit's just kind of in the past 50 yearswe weaponized our food with this highlydope meaning increased con so I actuallyhave a lot of sympathy and again I Ithink the first thing that we need to doand I do think this is happening I youknow I do think that people are wakingup around covet and around askingquestions but we've got to justunderstand at a baseline our food andour systems have been weaponized againstus yeah absolutely yeah I'm sorrysomething's wrong with my camera I'm notsure what it isum I'm interested in hearing what aresome of the uh common science memes thatmost people think of as science but inreality are just really big foodmarketing terms I think one big one I'veheard is the old the good old uh youneed to eat in moderation everything inmoderation and a balanced diet it's umclosely related cousin are those two Ithink are classic examples of basicallyCoca-Cola and big food marketing slogansthat were dreamed up in the marketing uhboardroom and handed down touniversities for scientistscoincidentally all arrive at it at thesame time and the idea that you know Ifind it astonishing that this even workslike what people just say in moderationwell what is moderation like how what isit what is a moderate amount of sugarwhat is a moderate amount of uh soy whatis a moderate amount of corn what is italcohol what is the modern amount of redmeat one gram 100 grams 1000 grams forall of these things you know you'regoing to have an enormously differentprofile and you can normalize whateveryou want so most people you know theythey talk about it being balanced andmoderation but in reality they end uppicking out on sugar and they end upgetting enormously addicted to Sugar butin their mind it's it's balance inmoderation and the reason this thinginevitably leads to it is that balanceand moderation you cannot do them easilywith highly addictive substances thatare specifically weaponized in order toget your mind to be be addicted to themyeah I I I think it gets to how we'vereally been gaslighted by the system tothink and Define what a drug is you knowwe have opioids are prescribed and youknow okay in some circumstances but youknow psychedelics which aren't addictiveand lead to Greater you knowunderstanding and empathy arestigmatized and then sugaris seen as not really kind of frivolousand not really a drug but it actually ifyou actually trace the devastation thatSugar's caused and the the addictionthat it can ring it's actually I wouldsay one of the most harmful drugsbecause it is subtle and does cause alot of so we just need to have like abaseline hereum and I think this is just it's it's asimple but I think important Point sugaris a powerful drug and what otheryou know what utter gaslighting to toput that food pyramid out and tocontinue to stay oh it's a treat oh it'sa it's a treat let's just havemoderation that's like saying oh heroinyou know we could just a little bit it'sfine this is a highly it's this Gatewayit's this wink wink rightlet's just dig into what sugar is let'sjust dig into what's in Coke it actuallygets even worse what we subsidize nowwith corn right turns into high fructosecorn syrup this is just a recentunderstanding and there's some been somebooks about this fructose is a specialkind of sugar now this is in most of ourkids food this is the main sugar that weuse now fructose fructose shuts off ourhunger signals it actually literallyit's it's it's it's the type of sugarand fruit and evolutionarily and there'sbeen some great books on this calleddrop acid and nature wants us to be fatbut it basically is like we we didn'tused to have like a lot of fruit rightwe didn't like this used to be actuallyfor humans on down it used to be feastor famine Cycles so we were well advisedif we saw a big patch of fruit to to eatas much as humanly possible and thefructose in that food actually shutsdown our hunger signals so we canactually eat as much as possible andload ourselves with sugar and actuallysave some fat for later right so that'sactually the like like evolutionarypurpose of fructose now we derive thatfrom corn and put it into all of ourfood which shuts off our hunger signalsand actually just like makes us want tocompulsively eat morethat that's what kids that's what we'resaying to kids deed in moderation sowe've literally like literally I meanthis word literally we've literallyweaponized our food to shut off kidsHunger signals and make it highlyaddictive and even the CDC even with theuh new guidelines they say 20 ofcalories 10 to 20 of calories for sugarfor kids is okay I mean it's just crazyit's it's literally I really think it'sakin to saying well 20 of your dietbeing heroin you know something with nonutritional value that's highlyaddictive and potentially destructivelong-term that's okay that's okaybecause because you'll be able to keepthat under control complete and utterjust just uh there's just a fallacythere yeah absolutely and I think youknow the key thing uh a key Point hereis that sugar in its current form isextremely different from whathistorically people used to have so yeahhundreds or thousands or of years agomaybe if you did come across a bunch ofberries that happen to be in season andnot having and that have not been rippedup by uh other creatures that would haveeaten them as soon as they saw themripenum if you manage to come across it youknow it was a rare thing but then whenyou did get it the fruits were nowherenear as fruit as sweet as what we havenow which we've been selectivelybreeding over hundreds of years to makemore and more sugar and so that isvery different but also I think the thewhite sugar itself is also very verydifferent like this is also it's it'snever been this yeah the refined whitesugar has never been anywhere near ascheap as what it is right now it used toalways be very difficult to attain itused to be expensive because it's it'sdifficult but with Machinery we can justprint more of it like it's a it facesvery little limits on how much we canproduce from it because you could justindustrialize and increase theefficiency of industrialization if youdon't think sugar is a drug right youknow there's this book um Empire uh byNeil Ferguson about the British Empireand uh you know as the British Empirewas really being built and you know ontheir trade sugar you know was one ofthe key in the 1700s 1800s was one ofthe key exports and it was like thistreasure Jewel because it was a drugbecause it was a highly addictive drugthere were massive wars fought when theythey figured out how to refine sugar andit was this this this cherished you knowdelicacy uh because of the impact thatit had on on someone's body as it wasused less it was really it was a highlycoveted drug and that's that's what itwas seen as and you know when I sayweaponized right we we've just in thepast 50 years or so found this cheap wayto highly process it and just weaponizeour food and how to create even moredangerous forms of sugar like we talkedabout fructose with corn you know andtaking it out of that so this really isa and we really have to look backhistory where this when sugar came onthe scene in a real way you know in thepast couple hundred years as a delicacythis was not there was no compunctionabout this was like a powerful like drugand yeah for the vast uh majority ofhuman historyum this was this was very rare in fruitsand of course the fruit that that has athe genetically modified to have evenmore sugar but those fruits also werecombined with fiber which plunged thesugar impact you always ate sugar withfiberum you know and fruits and other Foodsso yeah what's happening is is totallyunprecedented I think we need to we needto look at everything through the lensof dopamine and I think have someunderstanding that dopamine driveseverything that we do and when you youknow make food highly addictive that'show you get to a situation where 80percent of the country right now youknow is overweight or obese where 93 ofthe country is metabolicallydysfunctional you know wherepre-diabetes and diabetes rates amongadults is 50 which is totallyunprecedented you know where autoimmuneconditions allergies all these thingsare going off the charts I don't thinkAmericans are systematically trying toshorten their lives or systematicallytrying to fatten and you know and anddamage their the cells of their childrenare systematically trying to die youknow younger and you know you know forthe first time since 1860 in America inAmerican history where you know our lifeexpects is now plummeting again I don'tthink all these things are happening bychoice it's because dopamine is the mostpowerful regulator of of of of what wedo and our food is just totallyweaponized and you know getting to yourquestion about your question about othermemes and other you know I I think thisthis whole idea and embracing that sugaris a drug and really trying to unwindthat not not from even a command andcontrol policy but just from a human andpublic policy perspective likeunderstanding that we've really gottenoff track there I think another thingthat I saw you know back going back tomy early days working for these foodcompanies is this lie that nutrition andfood is complicated I I I think there isa systematic effort to fund thousandsand thousands of nutritional studies youknow to have for the news a new reportevery single day saying oh it's salt ohit's sugar oh it's fat this is part of astrategy like like this the thedistraction and number of studies is thestrategy and I think we really take thatbait time and time again if you listento a true independent whether they'revegan or whether they're carnivore thethe real independent smart nutritionfolks are actually in many ways sayingthe same thing it's Whole Foods it'sjust think about what our bodyevolutionarily is made to eat it iswhole foods that have goodmicronutrients you know that aren'tloaded with a bunch of hormones andantibiotics if you can literally just goand say did a person eat this you knowfive thousand years ago does it haveprocessed seed oils sugar grains out youget about 90 there and I and I did I waspart of this it's a systematic effort todistract they literally have a calendarit's like oh we're gonna we're gonnablame salt we're gonna blame it's justblaming a new thing every day todistract us from the fact that nutritionactually is relatively Sim simple we wewe need to get back to basics we need tostop trying to outsmart the body withwith just the next miracle drug or thenext Franken food if we if we got backto Whole Foods if we cut threeingredients from our diet added sugarseed oils and processed grains you wouldhave a complete Wipeout of diabetesheart disease and a bunch of othermetabolic conditions includingAlzheimer's which is now called type 3diabetes which is highly highly tied tofood yeah absolutely I think your yourabsolutely spot on in in in in the factthat they seek to complicate it and Ithink that you see this in so many areasof uh modern Fiat Academia economicsI've said before basically moderneconomics is like uh DDOS attack onpeople's ability to understand what'sactually going on with their Banking andmonetary system effectively you've gottens of thousands of people with phdspublishing papers that you know nobodyreads one percent of the papers that arepublished so nobody not a single personcan even read one percent of themthere's so many papers being publishedand it's such a such an enormous outputof scholarship on all kinds ofum hypotheses that are really irrelevantto the average person's experience withthe world and the sum of it you know thesum output of it is that you end up withpeople just being unable to process allof this information and then justdefaulting for going along with the hurtwhich is what the CNN says and what theNew York Times says and it's just whateverybody says it just becomes thepredominant narrative and of course it'sshaped through advertisement throughHollywood and through the all thesemainstream media organs you see it ineconomics you see it in nutrition andit's uh it's it's very it's very uh itit's very amazing when you uh snap outof the brainwashing on one of these byjust simply listening to yourself youknow thinking and trying to think thisthrough with your own mind and in thecase of food you know just you know takethe crazy decision of spending one weekeating differently and see how it worksfor you and then make your own mind upif you're willing to take that kind ofPlunge Into the Dark which is really notsuch a big dealum but if you're willing to prioritizethat over what is being said in TV orthe newspaper you realize just one ofthe ridiculous ways to time these fieldsof knowledge are like what what arethese people doing in all thosenutrition departments like you we reallydon't need to bepaying uh people from inflation you knowmaking inflationary monetary policy andum taxing people so that we can Financethousands of phds in nutrition to studyall kinds of subscriptions sureirrelevantmechanisms and acronyms and names andproduce an enormous flood of things onPubMed you know everything causes andprevents cancer everything can cause andprevent cancer and yetyou knowin any case just listen to what the uhyou know the pharmaceutical companies orthe drug companies and the foodcompanies are all repeating onmainstream media which is get your sixto ten ratios of grain per day right eatyour plant protein and don't eat a lotof meat and basically just eat cheapIndustrial Waste that that that's thesum of all the signs like there's somuch output and yet the conclusionalways leads the same kind of industrialgarbage that's highly profitable it'sthe same crap that's in your Supermarketall of it and and and it really is thesame crap in that if you if you walk inthe supermarket the vast majority ofthings that you get are just corn andsoy essentially and Seed oils corn soyand Seed oils and then a bunch ofpreservatives and flavorings andcoloring turning it into all kinds ofdifferent concoctions that's that's themajority of the stuff and the vastmajority of food is just coming fromthese foods and yet the research is justconstantly flooding people with all ofthis greedy irrelevant trivia like youyou don't need all that stuff you justneed it really is irrelevant trivia likeyou just need to think did somebody 500years ago manage to eat this thing ornot if they could eat it if they couldeat it 500 years ago then I'm probablyokay eating it now if you just did thatyou're going to be better off thananybody who spends any time trying totake whatever is published on PubMedseriouslyI mean I don't know if you saw recentlyjust just this past week massive newscoverage of the gas stoves and you knowan academic paper saying that gas stovesjust having gas stove in the house ledto Childhood allergiesand this happens every week There's anacademic study you know it's almost likewhen you back it's like this like kindof black comedy it's like it's like ait's like a movie right it's like wehave 25 percent of kids withpre-diabetes we have you know 50 percentof like 12 year olds overweight or obesewe have you know Mass chronic conditionsautoimmune conditions like you know andthen the media is literally like wellwhy is all this happening you knowthey're literally like leading medicaljournalists literally have beenreporting the past week they've said wedon't know what's causing thisexponential increase in childhoodobesity and at the same time you'rehaving gas stoves uh being blamed it'sit's almost like this comical level ofdistraction which feeds into everyeconomic interest the media both isfunded by Pharma heavily and they justneed something new to cover right if thestory is you know we need to get back tobasics and Whole Food Foods that's kindof a boring story right so so so theirtheir needs there's this voraciousappetite for the next peer-reviewedstudy for the next expert for the nextlittle wrinkle for the next disagreementthat that that's like table Stakes thathas to happen for the media and then ofcourse as you said there's this absoluteindustrial complex in the medical in themedical and research establishment bothin nutrition both in health both youknow economics to have that one littleniche and and just disagree about triviaand I could I can I can unpack this alittle bit how I I see it on um on onthe medical establishment my my sisterDr Casey means who started a companycalled levels Health um which which ispart of the movement to give people moredata about what's happening in theirbodies with glucose you know amazinglyjust as an aside uh many U.S statesdon't even allow patients to see theirmedical records uh anymore thatliterally they the patient doesn't havelegal ownership of their medical recordsso companies like levels and some of thebio wearables giving people more data Ithink that's a huge part of the solutionbut she was president of her Stanfordclass top of her top of her class atStanford med school and I think it'svery instructive that a doctor and shetalks about this you know graduating medschool has to choose one of 42Specialties so this is all in the past50 years but we've divided the body andthere's more and more Specialtiescropping up every now obesity uh youknow obesity doctors is a new specialtyright but we've we've broken the bodyinto 42sub-specialties she went into head andneck surgery and then there's 82sub-specialties underneath the 42 so sheactually focused was focusing her entirecareer on like two millimeters of thebodyand her the the dean of Stamford medschool at the time was I had a necksurgeon and he mentored her and heactually did fellowship and focused onone millimeter of the body and and someobscure part of the nose was actuallynamed after him some disease that hediscovered and she in residency isfocused on the this two squaremillimeters and hundreds and hundredsand hundreds of times she's doingsurgeries where she's cutting out sinusinflammation okay so doctors devotetheir lives you know if you really focushard in in a specific area you canbecome dean of a med school you focus onone little area and she had this come toJesus moment and this this kind of outof Body Experience she says in her fifthyear where she's doing her thirdsinusitis surgery of the day where she'syou know literally a passed out patientbeneath her she's cutting open theirface she's taking out the the effects ofthis inflammation and their sinuses thatare so serious they need surgicalinterventions and she looked down to thepage and she realized that patient wasunder her knife six months before andshe understood that a lot of herpatients are actually coming back underthe knife with with more inflammationand then she realized that she had noidea why that patient actually hadinflammationat Stanford med school Harvard MedSchool on down doctors are not taughtwhy people get sick they're only taughtabout the interventions and the specificNiche interventions but the problem isthat we all have inflammation it'sleading to UTI infections sinusinfections it's leading to ear infectionit's leading it's leading to all theseDownstream issues that you're seeing abunch of different doctors for butnobody from Stanford med school on downis trained what the underlying causesand the fact is and if you really peelback and see inflammation in case youstarted doing this as a cause and anunderlying issue with a lot of thingsthat are popping upour bodies in a heightened sense ofinflammation at all times that's heavilydocumented why is that well our bodiesreacting to foreign influences in ourbody right inflammation throughout allevolution is a welcome good thing ifthere's an issue in the body our bodysummons forces and attacks that theproblem is that that we are literallyputting as the foundation or our dietforeign substances in our body andaverage American right now is in aheightened state of inflammation wheretheir body is reacting to foreignInvaders from our food that is literallywhat's happeningum and why you hear this thisinflammation and chronic inflammationbeing a scourge of society and rootcauses it's literally food we're puttingforeign stuff into our bodies so Caseyhad that Awakening and that is notsomething that the vast majority ofdoctors even understandum they are just there to cut out thesymptom they're there to prescribe theObesity medication they're there to cutopen your inflammation they're there todo the heart bypass they're there toprescribe the Statin they're there toprescribe the metformin it's not workingof course you know by the industrialcomplex you talk about of siloing allthese diseases and having you know thethe president of Stanford med school thedean of Stanford med school talkingabout you know doing papers on that onelittle square inch and everyone havingtheir little niche you know that thatthat allows the conferences that allowsfor everyone to feel like a hero butnobody's actually solving the problemwhich again perversely just keeps thisindustrial system going because whennobody is asking why everyone's gettingsick more people are getting sick andthere's more things to do[Music]yeah and I think it's it's trulynefarious as well how much there's aconcerted effort to normalize theunhealthy Life as a normal healthy lifeum what is your experience with thatlike in terms of you know we see rightnow you look at say Fitness magazinesand Beauty magazines and fashionmagazines it's very common that they'llshow somebody who's extremely obese onthe cover and I think it was GQ or oneof these magazines that had someonewho's clearly obese and they're sayingthis is healthy and I mean that thereisn't any compelling evidence scientificthat can lead you to say that we'vemanaged to discover how to make obesityhealthy it's just that it's become soprevalent and so normalized that we'vejustlearn to accept that these physicalmanifestations have no relation tounderlying health issues when of coursethey do it's very obvious that they doright so so this is this is this is mycontribution to that from literally likehelping these food companies Advancethis exact objectiveit's not that complicated you know whenwhen a company has an objective like afood company to normalize you know thiswhat used to be a treat Sugar as youknow just just widely accept it rightthey ask how do we influenceinstitutions of trust that's the numberone question right so the The Firm Iworked for 10 years ago actually was thelead firm for cigarette companiesand there's memos now that that havebeen released as part of uh you knowwhat led to the the cigarette addictionsbut in the 80s and and 70s theyliterally wrote The Playbook and this ispublic now but they're like we need tofind institutions people trust one ofthose is research institutions anotheris civil rights institutions you know onResearch institutions they they quotedit for the cigarette companies they saidyou know it's researchers like moms likeeveryone trusts them you know the moreresearch the better so in the case offood right let's get back into the CivilRights group so you know sitting acrossfrom the NAACP in 2012 the cokeExecutives it was kind of disturbingpatriarchal language that was being usedit's like well lower income folks theylove their soda it's totally patriarchaland a nanny state for us to take thatsoda one of the one of the joys lowerincome people get you know after A HardDay's work so we've got to keep that youknow soda in the hands of lower incomefolks and you know can we do a campaignto say that it's it's a nanny State andeven racist you know to suggest that weshould be limiting and infringing on thefreedom of these you know lower incomefolks who just want their Coke andthat's the message that was carried youknow there's contemporary point in theNew York Times on my tweet thread that Iwrote that I but it was it wasAfrican-American pastors and the NAACPand Hispanic federations you knowjoining joining hands and saying howreally racist it would be to to takethat small Joy this treat from um fromtheir communitiesof course there's two big problems hereone is this isn't a nanny State TheNanny state is the fact that thegovernment's paying tens of billiondollars for diabetes water that isdecimating the cells of lower incomepopulations is addictive right there'snobody even there's nobody saying thatwe should take Coke away I again I thinkmost drugs should be believable weshouldn't be subsidizing this governmentmoney so that was what the argument soit's a total it's a total perversion ofthe nanny stay argument right but butthat just shuts down to so so it was aconscious effort right it's like well ifthe NAACP and the Hispanic Federation issaying this is racist you know who arewe now that leads up to today so todaywhat you have is you have two bigelements happening here so you haveactually millions and millions ofdollars directly going from foodcompanies to body positivity influencersso you have body positivity influencerson Tick Tock saying like literallygiving instructions to people on TickTock saying that is completelyinappropriate for doctors to be weighingpatients to be saying that we should becalling and shaming doctors for weighingpatients or even asking about weightbecause it's pseudoscience to say thatobesity is a health condition thoseinfluencers are being paid directly bysoda companies and Nestle and otherprocessed food companies that's comingout so there's actually a conscientioussystemized like effort to pay bodyconscious influencers on Tick Tock tospread this information about obesitynot being a condition so that's kind ofat that end that's at The Tick Tockthat's kind of the new Battlefront atthe high end you've got an absoluteall-out assault happening right now tolabel obesity as genetics as not tied topersonal decision making and weunfortunately people care about sciencereal science are losing this battle sothe the Olympic maker the the drug thathas the potential if this is approvedfor you know Medicare or Medicaidfunding you know to to be one of themost successful drugs in Americanhistory last year they made 400 000individual payments to doctors over 30million dollars not research fundingdirect bribes to doctors it's on the CMSwebsite and have absolutelystrangleholded the every doctor thattalks about obesity because any doctorthat care that is trying to shootobesity this is a Manna From Heaven youknow a weekly injection where the labelsays that the patient has to stay onthis drug for life because if you go offthis drug you gain more weight than youoriginally had and there's unknownmetabolic factors that lead to a lot ofother side effects so you have a fullcourt press and what does that money getget us what are those financialincentives get us the FDA panel that'sapproving obesity drugs is not FDAbureaucrats it's it's it's people fromHarvard and other Elite institutions whoare obesity experts to a person theyhave Financial conflicts with the drugthen you have the media 60 minutes whichis the majority of their funding theirfunding comes from Pharma ran a segmentwith doctors directly paid by ozympicsaying obesity is genetic they did notto close disclose those conflicts andthen literally almost like a comedybefore and after that segment sayingthat this condition this problem that'sonly been 50 years old is genetic whichis just absurd before and after thatsegment there's Pharma ads and then awoman Dr Fatima Stanford that was onthat 60 Minutes piece just two days agowas appointed as one of the chief peopleas we mentioned on the FDA nutritionpanel for 2025. and she's a harbordoctor paid tens of thousands of dollarsper year directly by the streets of paidspokesperson there we are these thesefolks these these obesity are literallythey're being paid by the drug companiesthey're setting the FDA standardsthey're talking on the Press with nodisclosures and they're creating ourkids nutrition guidelines so imaginesomebody right and and a philosophy nowmaking childhood nutrition guidelinesfor 2025 who dispute the idea of obesitybeing caused by diet that is literallywhat they're disputing we're losing thisbattle and um and it's a big problem andit's it's all just based on money youjust follow the money yeah let's listento her if you dietyou lose weightright the number one cause of obesity isgenetics that means if you are born toparents that have obesity you have a 50to 85 percent likelihood of having thedisease yourself even with optimal dietexercisesleep management Stress Management sowhen people see families that haveobesity the assumption is what are theyfeeding those kids that's pretty amazingif you think about it I mean it's uhit's astonishing how how this is justbecoming uh very normal in most people'smind that yeah it's a within a few yearsyou're going to be considered a crazyconspiracy theorist if you say that dietis related to obesity and health we'reheaded there you know it's all geneticsit's all out of your control and theonly way to fix it of course is bat thedrugs like all of life's problems theycould only be fixed by path drugsI want to I want to make an optimisticpitch because what's happening now isnothing more right than the Playbookthat's been used for decades which hasled to the problem you know this is thisis the same thing as what you talkedabout early on where the sugar companiesfunded Harvard and Harvard life of thefood pyramid you know when that foodpyramid came out at the 90s and you hadyou know 60 minutes and other you knowspecials with Harvard scientists sayingoh Sugar's fine sugar doesn't causeobesity there was a lot less questioningright right so so I I think in somerespect the same Playbook is being usedbut I do think there's a bottom of subRevolution happening you know I think aswe talked about earlier it's being ledby bitcoiners which I think is uh to mea larger umbrella of folks who are youknow questioning the incentives and theMatrix that we exist in and feelingempowered to ask some first principlequestions and feeling empowered not tobe just batted down by Elites you knowknow and degrees and and told not to askany questions so I think there's a bigmovement of that philosophy that's beenawakened a sleeping giant in the pastcouple years I think that there's just alot of normal folks I I think similar tome I mean it's very basic but you knowyou look backwards at our at our parentsI think our parents are suffering youknow much more chronic conditions andhealth issues than they should be andand dying earlier in the case of my momand then looking forward at kids I meanI think anyone that has a kid right nowis not happy about what's going on andthings aren't adding up so I thinkthere's a lot of questions being askedand um it is a little bit disparity Imean they are absolutely hijacked andtaken hostage our institutions of Truston this obesity thing but it does feellike there's this like a lot of peoplebreaking through from The Matrix thatare listening to these podcasts that areyou know installing levels and other biowearables to actually oh wow thatdoesn't make much sense I'm eating whatthey're saying it's okay to eat and myglucose levels are going out of controlwe are waking up so so this is my theoryof change is like that's the that's thebase of the pyramidum and then eventually math is going tocatch up we are literally justmathematically going to be you know asick fat depressed infertile Society tosuch a degree that we're not going to becompetitive anymore and something needsto be done this intervention-basedsystem where instead of you knowsubsidizing and thinking about healthyfood for kids we want taxpayers to payfor a weekly injection for life it'sgonna bankrupt our system like like thisis literally like like we're on theverge of bankruptcy 20 of GDP growing atan increasing rate it's going to be 40in 15 years there there has to be achange eventually or we're literallylike it's not too hyperbolic to saywe're going to cease to exist a countryso I just think we need to keep poundingon this and um bringing the Bitcoin kindof questioning first principlephilosophy two I think the mostimportant thing the most important firstorder issue for our world which is likehow our brains perceive reality if ourbrains are experiencing Mass metabolicdysfunction you know that that shroudshow we see reality and that's happeningto a systematic degree we've got to kindof understand this as a first orderissue and and keep pushing on itabsolutely no I agree with you entirelyum Daniel has a question for you greator more like Iran T saysah goodyeah actually I gotta I've got a linkhere so yeah I think uh and thank youKelly for everything I'll just hit uphere your old mate Warren Buffett hereso here we goI drink probably five 12 ounce Cokes adayand that's about 700 caloriesand I've been doing it more or lessall my lifeI can't imagine anybody that feelsbetter than I do I mean I'm happy Ienjoy life uh you know and I've I'vealways wondered if I'd had a twinand he had to eat broccoli and asparagusand Brussels sprouts and done it everyday and I'd been drinking my cult andeating potato chips and here are somecookies that also you know have 100calories per ounce uh the uh you knowwhich of us I I think the other guywould be gone I mean I think he probablywould have committed suicide actuallyand he certainly wouldn't feel as goodabout life as I feel good every day itis it is a an example of what's called aCascade where consensus becomes fact andwe've had in the past that that red meatcauses heart disease which we now knowuh probably isn't uh it's not thatsimple and and I've even I've talked toAndrew about this looking at Sugar'slink to diabetes or obesity even the thebest study that I've seen there's allthese caveats that it's impossible to doa controlled experiment where you getrid of all the other external factors toactually pinpoint what's going on therebecause there's genetics there's Envirothere's all these different things butit becomes you know consensus suddenlybecomes fact and it's just you know andit's hurting Coca-Cola right now and asa shareholderyou know I mean there's alsomicroaggression and safe zones and Imean the world is a little bit crazyright now board in terms of politicalcorrectness yeah well I I I I'll I'llmake two points I hey I do think youlive longer if you're if you're happy onbalance I I would I would bet on the uhon the person who's extremely happy uhliving longer than somebody that's sourevery day of the year but beyond that Imean itif if you eat 3 500 calories and youburn up 2700 I don't care what it isyou're going you're going to get fat anduh it's just it's a question of you knowhow much you put in and and what yourmetabolism is and and at the annualmeeting uh we had talked about Coke inthe early part and when I went to lunchI I bought three candy bars and each oneof those candy bars had over 200calories whereas a 12 ounce can of Cokehas a little under 150. so one of thosecandy bars you're getting more caloriesand you're getting a lot of sugar and itI just think it's a little uh it's alittle crazy they've been selling Cokesince 1886 you know they sold uh it's a1.9 billion eight ounce servings a daythat's 693 billion servings a year ofCoca-Cola products one kind or anotherand II I you know if you want to eat way thehell more than you burn up right youknow you've got you're going to havesome health problems you know you canthrow GMOs and and preservatives andkale and I even in my book even CO2 butI mean all these things at this pointthe Cascade of where consensus becomesyou know unquestionable dogma and andscience it's just we're living in aweird age wowthat's amazing wow so these are the guysby the way yeahum it's like what you're talking aboutearlier um how they're just trying tonormalize it um but this iskilling his own book on NationalTelevision because right invested in thestock and these are the same guys thatcall around to bitcoin want a Bitcoinpodcast but they call Bitcoin rat poisonandum Charlie Munger the other day uh wason stage saying that Bitcoin is immoraland unethicalwhereas shilling diabetes water I thinkyou called it uh Cali that's perfectlyfine I find these people soreprehensible it's just disgusting yeahthey they really bring it to bitcointhey they don't want the little peopleto be questioning anything you knowwatching that you know a part of me it'sreprehensible as you said but a part ofme hasadmiration for him as an investor I meanhe is literally you know built hiscareer off drugs I mean you know theseare highly addictive drugs that areheavily subsidized by the government anda chummy media that he just kind oflaughs about as 25 of kids havepre-diabetes which is inextricablylinked to the fact that this diabeteswater which is evolutionaryunprecedented you know has been not justeven available and and we don't evenwant to get into it like let's not evenget into like I again I'm libertariansubsidized right him and his chummyrelationships with the lovers of powerhave led to this diabetes water beingsubsidized tens of billions of dollarsover the courts that he's owned that totalk hundreds of billions of dollars oftaxpayer moneyhas gone to push those addictivedrinks to kids you know leading toLifetime customers so so yeah from aninvestment perspective I I admire it butum you know I I again I just really wantto really want to hang my hat on thatit's like let's not even get into aconversation about banning it we it isevil it is evil that Warren and manyother people who push Coke push tosubsidize it with government money withgovernment nutrition money with bothschool programs school programs which Ihave not heard Warren Buffett speak outagainst which which subsidized Coke forkids many many tens of millions of kidsdepend on school lunches paid for by thegovernment Coke food stamps 15 of peoplerely on number one item and thenshameful subsidies which subsidize thecore ingredients in Coke particularlycorn high fructose corn syrup you knowto tens of billions of dollars like thisis wrong we are subsidized sizing thepoisoning of our kids which is leadingto trillions of dollars which Warrenhasn't spoken about either trillions ofdollars of Downstream Health costs forthe American taxpayer it's it'sunconscionable you mentioned theHeritage Foundation and um there is agroup of supposedly free market uheconomists who would tend to callthemselves a free markets who end upessentially being apologists for oh yeahStatus Quo and that is true in the caseof money you know they're out theresaying free markets but they'll tell youthe FED is doing a great jobum because uh you know given thepolitics and the political constraintsthen we need to compromise we need to berealistic and we need the FED that has amore free market leaning monetary policyand similarly with these kind of thingsthey have this kind of dismissivedismissive explanations that well youknow the market wants this and peoplewant to do it and people want that foodand the government is just giving it tothem and of course this falls apart withany kind of critical uh inspection whenyou think about this idea because uh onthe one well yeah if they don't have tolisten to the government then thegovernment doesn't have to take theirmoney and destroy their currency inorder to finance these uh fakescientists to get on TV and tell them toeat garbage so just because people canignore them doesn't mean that it's okayto rob people in order to promote thiscriminal idiotic pseudoscience but evenmore uh concretely is the fact that asyou mentioned in particular in schoolsand hospitals and I would add prisons aswell in these PL three places you knowgovernment science is enormouslydetrimental to the health of the peoplethat are on the receiving end ofgovernment food because Hospital youknow they have all these Guild andlicensing requirements wherein they needto adhere to certain standards and thatmeans sticking by the scientificstandards for what is good food to beserving in this context and that usuallymeans industrial garbage of course wellnot usually always means industrialgarbage and similarly with PublicSchools where tens of millions ofchildren are poisoned every day withIndustrial Waste as well and of courseprisons which are just in the extensionof public schools that's tens ofmillions of people every day eating thisslop that is recommended based on theseguidelines so even if you say well youknow government is going to governmentthen people have to have theresponsibility of eating as they decideit's you know on top of the fact thatyou've compromised as you said thescientific institutions and turning themas an attack Vector against people youare literally shoving that food downtens of millions of people's throatsevery day because these food companiesget the government to buy all of thatslop from them and then they feed peoplewith ityeah and you've hit on this in yourbooks so well and just this this Fiatsystem that you talk aboutI think one problem they were watchingthat buff and quit buff a quote andhearing the Dynamics you're talkingabout is is a lot of these institutionshave become jobs programs right so sowe've taken we were able to ignore thedamage that's being done to theunderlying physiology of our brains andbodies which is what you know reallydetermines our happiness and outlook onthe world and I'm not trying to get toolike deep there but like literally likethat is what metabolicus function isthat's what diabetes is diabetes iscellular dysfunction like if 50 ofcountries pre-diabetic or diabetic thatmeans we're experiencing Mass cellulardysregulation that's literally 20 of ourcells are in our brains it's highlycorrelated with depression suicide itimpacts our outlook on the world butwe're able to ignore that because ofthese chummy Davos panels where WarrenBuffett's joking about the money he'smade on coke and all the people Cokeemployees and you know the the from theschools which is one of the largest youknow most uh employed you knowIndustries to hospitals which is youknow medical is the most employedindustry you know to where you know youhave conservative politicians I've seenI was recently in Texas watching thegovernor of Texas a conservative get aspeech about how proud he is that thehealthcare industry is the largestemployer in Texas and that the new youknow Texas Medical Center in Houston canis so large it can be seen from spaceit's like these aren't good things rightbut we've allowed both the left and theright to be brag about the employmentyou know growth and health theemployment growth in food the employmentgrowth in school you know it's the factthat these are jobs programs you knowhave kind of allowed us to like actuallynot ask questions on why we need so manypediatricians why we need hospitals thatcan be seen from space like that's notnecessarily a good thing in thatindustrial complex isn't isn't good youknow another thing that I think is verypowerful you know calling out some of myformer you know employers and allieslike the Heritage Foundation it's likethere's a real job the club like youknow you just watch Warren Buffett thereyou know CNBC it just imagine him it'slike you don't want to upset the applecar here right you know the heritage ofnation people you know that you know oneof the top people there oh yeahobviously we do a little that we don'tneed to we don't need to talk about thepay to play like you know we know thesame people we went to Harvard togetherit's like it's like this like it's likethis pull and you know I'm not doinganything that brave here or anything butlike one thing I do think about is likeI don't give a anymore like kidsare getting pre-diabetes at anexponential rate it's just like thischummy little Club is just like it's you know you you have even therichest person in the world Bill Gateslike just compulsively wanting to jointhe club you know compulsively liketalking like the just this standardissue points about pharmaceuticals andabout processed food it's like why it'slike why are the richest people in theworld so insecure that they need to belike on the Davos panel talking aboutlike you know these institutions andbutting up a distance that are causingobvious violence to you know toAmericansum it's just an interesting it's aninteresting you've talked about this butit's an interesting force that that doesabsolutely seem to pull people yeah it'sum it's pretty depressing how hownormalized it is as you say and you seeit everywhere and it's sad becausepeople are people's uh most people aredecent and so they just assume everybodyaround them is decent and theirmechanisms of how you navigate Societyin a civilized society as you know youlook around you and you don't think thateverybody has to be a psychopath who'sout there to make an enormous profit atyour expense like it's just too ugly toimagine itbut there is the way that thisinstitution is set up the way that thesystem works it's justit's it's set up for it it's set up inthat way and I think ultimately it comesdown to the fact that government policyis up for grabs and it is enormouslyinfluential in this regard becausegovernment gets to print money this iswhere I tie it all back into the Fiatsystem ultimately once the governmenthas the control of the money printersthen it becomes possible for everyspecial interest to direct it in a waythat is extremelyextremely impactful that it'llcompletely warp people's perception ofwhat is real and what is not and so youbake it so that everybody thinks thatum industrial slob is food and everybodycan believe it because you know afterdecades and decades and Decades ofnutritionists and doctors repeating thisit gets hammered into people's minds andthey just go along with it and this iswhy you know it's it I call it Fiat foodbecause it's a finest by Fiat sciencebut also it's Fiat food because thenotion that we are calling this stufffood is essentially imposed on us byFiat it's all of these enormoussubsidies that these companies get thatrig the market enormously for people andmake you know that it exacerbates thecostliness of healthy food the fact thatso much productive capacity is takentowards producing nutrient-free drugsthat are cheap that are highlyprofitable means that a lot ofproductive capacity is not dedicated toproducing actual nutritious food and sothat's making real nutritious food moreexpensive and it's flooding the marketfor everybody with enormously cheapvery harmful food so it's massivelydistortionary for the economy that youcannotit's very difficult to escape it I meanthe opportunity costs are just massiveand we just kind of accept it I I againjust like four trillion dollars spent inthe healthcare industry like it actuallylike you kind of think it's inevitableright that we have this system that likejust incentivizes interventions once youget sick it actually like designing itfrom any type of Blue Sky you know ondown like like just just first principleit's not you you would never do thatyou'd ask fundamentally with Healthcarehow do we keep people healthy you knowand it's a decision we make right it'sjust a foregone conclusion that now wehave a very marginal very problematicobesity cure which doesn't stop kidsfrom eating inflammatory foods that aregoing to make them sick in other waysit's just a fork on conclusion we'regonna subsidize that with MedicareMedicaid you know and our tax advantageyou know spending we're gonna that is wewe are on verge of hundreds of billionsof dollars of subsidized in that drugand and it's just like that Paradigm youback it doesn't it that doesn't evenmake any sense it's like from theopportunity cost of that money what ifyou took that 100 billion dollars youknow and asked how do we keep peoplehealthy how do we actually incentivizeand and price in some of theexternalities in our food you know notnot even mentioning maybe we shouldn'teven be spending that money on anythingmaybe we should be actually having afree market where we're not rigging thesystem you know in various ways but butwhat's happening right what's happeningwith those choices is the U.S now spendshalf on food as a percentage of GDP asas some other European countries we'vejust totally just like sidelined foodand you know a tomato or or a vegetablean organic vegetable in the UnitedStates often has an order of magnitudeless like like 90 Less in some respectsnutrients than a tomato grown in likeSardinia Italy like on the hillside youknow with with pure soil like our soilis literally like being degraded to likean exponential degree like there's somecrazy documentaries kiss the ground onNetflix so this is all just like theseprioritizations are literally making thefood itself you know dramatically lessnutritious and nutrient dense than itwas than you know 40 years ago so yeah Iyou know I think it's um I think we'vekind of been put in this box and um youknow everyone talks about health carereform and how do we get more access howdo we we don't need more access to thesystem the problem with our system rightnow isn't that not enough people don'thave enough access to drugs the problemis the incentives the problem is thatfundamentally every single institutionin health from medical schools toinsurance companies to Pharma companiesto hospitals they make money when morepeople are sick and lose money whenpeople are healthy that's the problemlike we need to blow up that we willnever get healthier until we blow upthat incentive which is really much morestructural we're being just just lowinto this oh how do we incrementallylike improve insurance or you knowimprove medical records or get morepeople drugs so you know that thatthat's what this system has done and asyou've alluded to and I think thegreatest design of this system thegreatest victory of the systemis that it's able to take good peopleit's like it's like any evil systemthroughout history when you're able tocreate a system so complex that goodpeople can come into it right and filltheir unique you know role in thatsystem and feel be able to go to sleepat night but but the larger systemitself is causing Devastation andviolence like you have a reallydangerous system and that's exactly whatwe have like I think very tragically theUS literally is a magnet for the bestand brightest people in the world whocome here to be doctors but now doctorsonce they once they once they getthrough medical school have the highestdepression rate highest suicide rate andhighest burnout rate of any profession Ithink it's because they they arededicated but the system is broken andsee that they're actually not leading topatients getting better and feel trappedbecause of hundreds of thousands dollarsof debt and their entire you know youknow all their you know it was tough formy sister to leave after you knowhundreds of thousands of dollars and youknow Stanford degrees and and her entireidentity at 31 being tied up with thissuccess most people aren't able to dothat and that leads to severe depressionI believe so I think this is really thecase I think uh I felt something similarto doing a PhD in economics andrealizing that it was all nonsenseum right at a certain point at a certainpoint I just decided like thisthere's no way that this is going to bea good healthy way to go through lifedoing something you don't believe in andI think that's why that's what made meso susceptible to uh Bitcoin that's whatmade me so umreceptive I should say not susceptiblereceptive is the right word morereceptor to the idea that Bitcoin couldmake sense because yeah it was somethingthat existed outside of the system andhow the system says things could workyou know in in just like in nutritionyou're not supposed to be healthy if youdon't eat uh your recommended rations ofindustrial slob every day and yet youcan and with Bitcoin you know we're notsupposed to have a deflationary moneythat works if the money's Supply itdoesn't increase to match the growth inthe economy then we'd have deflation andthen the economy would crash we'd getdepressions and yet Bitcoin continues togrow and uh it continues to bedeflationary and it continues to workand it continues to refuse to fail so Ithink there's definitely something thatthe internet allows the suppressed ideasthat in the analog world wereeffectively suppressed becausecommunication had to go through Centralpoints that controlled things you knowthere was the Harvard nutrition schooland they had a very strong impact onwhat that written and all the newspapersand all TVand without an internet they could theycould have their field day basicallypromoting all of these crazy ideas wellnow it gets much more complicated it's alot more difficult for them to do thisbecause people could communicate on theinternet and they could communicateseparately independently in their theirwitnessing independent information beingdisseminated that shows the exactopposite in people who stick by thisinformation who listen to thealternative information I end up doingmuch better the people who don't 100yeah I mean I think it's that it'scontent in the medical field I thinkit's a similar thing it's it's contentscales and there's an insane amount ofcontent happening I that I'm veryencouraged by you know from from Bitcoinpodcasts to health podcasts to generalinterest podcast I mean this is what JoeRogan you know on down is talking aboutso I mean I think the fact that theseconversations are happening kind of Ithink everything eventually gets tohealth and when we start unpackingincentives it's like the way to controlpeople and the way to to Really controlSociety is impacting the cells in ourbrain so I think it's like it is amazingright that like from across from so manydifferent perspectives we're likeanalyzing these incentives you know andagain I think a really disruptive ForceI mean something I'm very bullish on islike I think we're gonna absolutelycompletely disrupt Pharma and thedoctor's officeum with this trend of knowing more aboutwhat's happening on our body if we knowyou know what if we have an MRI andwhat's happening in our body in realtime I think it really makes us uh lesssusceptible being lied to uh when we'rebeing told that that orange juice youknow is highly encouraging those LuckyCharms are highly encouraged and I meanactually see how those impact ourglucose levels you know and eventuallyyou know I think having more biomarkerslike hydration and ketones and there'syou know 30 other biomarkers that Ithink we're going to have real-timeinsight to it over the next 10 yearsit's kind of hard to lie uh and Gaslightpatients then so I actually you know I Ithink it's the same principles of justlike content that's first orderquestioning you know whether it's ourfinancial system whether it's our healthsystem I think it's all very connectedand I think I think it's very hopefulbecause I think one person you knowtrying to just you know plot outprinciples for themselves and theirfamilies just with their own intellectand own questions I think can get tomuch better answers than being batteredover the head with a bunch of these youknow PhD papers and expertsum you know I I think we're seeing ashiftabsolutely I think there is uh you knowthe drive toward the people using allthese monitors and um all of this datais extremely useful because a lot ofthese people are being able to discoverand I think the sugar the blood sugarlevel one is one of the most importantbecause you can see it like if you eatmeat your blood sugar stays stable ifyou eat highly processed grains yourblood sugar spikes and so if yourproblem is the blood sugar spike itseems very obvious that maybe you shouldavoid the foods to do that so it is itis very useful the conclusion that I'vecome up with is honestly that I don'tthink nutrition is that intellectuallyinteresting or that difficult or thatcomplicated I agree all all of thespecies that exist on Earth are able toeat and survive and not develop all ofthese metabolic syndrome and diabetesand all these diseases that we havethey're all able to do it without havinga single PhD in nutrition you know allthe lines and the giraffes and theelephants and the birds and the antsthey all figure out what to eat so theydon't yeah they don't have anynutritious and phds and you know we liketo think of ourselves as being specialbut really eating is not somethingunique to us as human beings and it'snot a cognitive function it's a bodilyfunction that we share with a lot ofanimals so I I don't find it to be allthat complicated and in fact it it'spretty simple like with all of theanimals every animal out there will eatred meat if you if it got the chance toit the only animals that don't eat redmeat don't eat it because they can'thunt and so they make do with otherstuff but the most nutrients are presentin red meat it's the most nutritiousfood out there andmy my personalumkind of shortcut and just lazy thingsthat I just don't like to think aboutthis issue so much and I just told mewhen I'm hungry and I drink water whenI'm thirsty and that saves me a lot ofheartache and a lot of worrying aboutwhat to eat right now and planning thismeal and following what the latest signsin PubMed is I just I'm a very very youknow bro science approach to it wherered meat works and I don't want to thinkabout food in any way that is morecomplicated than that and also likehaving tried eating red meat only fornow it's been like almost seven and ahalf yearsuh seven years and three months so far Ihaven't tried that then like there'snever been a point at which I'veintroduced any kind of food and I'vefelt that it all improved on just redmeat and water I mean I cheatoccasionally but I'm not kidding myselfinto thinking that this is good for me II can feel why it is not good for me andit's just you never feel better than redmeat and water that's the kind of verysimplistic answer that you come out withall this thing and the reason that youdon't need to despair is that you don'tneed to worry about what all thesecorporations are putting into all ofyour different foods that you're eatingbecause if you just get red meat you'rebasically fine it's such a profoundpoint I I hope everyone hears that pointis like if I had a bun and it wouldeliminate every nutrition School in thecountry we would be such a healthiercountry and I think it gets to a morelike almost spiritual or philosophicalpoint which is like we need to just likehave trust in our bodies evolutionarycapability to know what it needs we haveto have trust and awe of like the Wonderand interconnectedness of our body I donot think it is modern it is notprogress that we've segregated the bodyinto 42 different you know parts andproduce tens of thousands of studiessaying how complicated things are wewill never understand like The Wonder ofour body right and like and have thisright and I think like going back to anevolutionary perspective of like thatpoint about other animals it's like Ithink we do like know what's best for usand I think if we just sit back and usefirst principle thinking of the type offood that our children should beingesting it's like let's stick to whatevolutionarily they're made to ingestand eat over you know tens of ofthousands of years I think a relatedpoint a message I really try to get outI think is just absolute key is justcuriosity when You Face these you knowalmost like Rites of passages for theAmerican patient you know I go back tomy mom you know I was born in utero withmetabolic dysfunction she suffered withpre-diabetes I was born at 12 poundswhich which shows that I might have hadsome metabolic dysfunction it was likeyou know she had gestational diabetesand the doctors are like oh it's it'sfine this is you know 25 women havegestational diabetes take this pill youknow it wasn't like a warning sign it'slike oh it's fine oh the kid's fine youknow I end up having to take a bunch ofthe antibiotics have ear infections ohjust take more antibiotics so so thenyou grow up and my mom has elevatedcholesterol oh most people your age takea Statin here's a stand elevated bloodglucose right oh metformin that's normalwe we face all of these like Milestonesalmost as Rites of Passage Now inAmerica and no and very few patientsright actually are sat down and saidwell what's actually physiologicallyhappening to make this biomarker of yourtriglycerides off the charts or why whywhat's happening to yourselves that somuch glucose is flooding your cells thatthere's like now excess blood in in yourthere's excess sugar in your blood likewhich is evolutionary unpre like likewhen we never like have like awe orwonder from the medical system aboutwhat actually is happening it's likeliterally our cells are being bombardedwith so much glucose and sugar it's likeour our like blood sugars out of it it'slike what does that mean like no it'stake a pill and I am kind of amped up onthis I would say because my mom you knowshe she had kids now who are on this shewas trying to be very healthy sheshopped at health food at Whole Foodsshe but she was left you know like manyAmericans kind of just left discardedright it's just like not you knoweducate these were all warning signs andthen eventually that leads more oftenthan not to a chronic condition thatwill will kill you as it did for her andyou know she got on this train later andmy sister and I you know she gave her alot of books and she died surrounded byall these books on blood sugar onIndependent thinking with Health Care onyou know the the tumor was growing tooearly it was too late for her but like II will say that that does inspire me Imean she now lives in US I mean I thinkjust being actually curious about thebody and interconnectivity about likeour health issues I think really doeslead to happiness it led to happiness inher final days just being on thatjourney and it inspired us so I wouldjust say that too it's like simplifylike how you think about health but alsojust like I don't know I think it'sactually just a great journey to be onwhen you are prescribed to Stan ormetformin or all these other Rites ofpassages just to be a little bit morecurious about what the interconnectivityis and maybe how to prevent and reverseit you can prevent and reverse thesethings really quickly through food andit's just it's just not talked about inthe traditional medical system yeah it'sit it's it's so blatant uh how veryobvious this is that if there's no oneto be made in it then we don't evenconsider it it's obvious yeah yeah andand it's you see it also with um evenwith drugs that are off baton where youknow as as we saw in many cases like allthese drugs can be effective forconditions but they don't get publicizedin fact they get fought because there'sno money to be made from drugs that areoff patent you need to get the patentedstuff you need to get the path and stuffbecause that's what makes the money andthat's what finances the scientists whoget on your TV and on your newspaper andtell you that you know only the patentedhighly lucrative stuff is what worksyeah so I guess you know I think theconclusion that we could come to is thatpretty much most of what we think of asum science when it comes to nutritionand health is probably cooked up bymarketing departments I'm going to jumpto that conclusion you're welcome tojoin medon't trust the peer review we fall forevery time a news article with a peerreviewed study those are publicrelations documents and it's a simplepoint but we need to be empowered andand not believe that study I I would sayit as a Baselineyeah absolutely well Cali thank you somuch for joining us today this has beena lot of fun appreciate your time manit's been enormously depressing but atthe same time kind of hoping because Ithink more and more people are beginningto realize this is the case thank youfor questioning asking so many questionsabout our foundational systems and I dohope the messages empowerment because Ithink understanding how the incentivesof our systems work is the first step toTrue empowerment so thank you so muchfor hosting this conversationthank you sir Take Care
