  "text": "we are now recordinghold on hold on hold on I'm sorryokay now we're good to gookayso I'm hereget my screen Sharerto the screendid that did that screen share just workforeignyes yes cool all right okaysoall right so hello everybody uh welcometo this talk about fetty mint andspecifically going through thefediment.org doc site so there's a bitof background my name is Pete win Ibloody love Bitcoin uh I've also beenquite interested in ecash as a scalingsolution for lightning for a few yearsnow so I got quite interested in thisafter reading the script white paper byFrank Brown and Smuggler a couple ofyears ago which tweaked my curiosity andI've been thinking about it ever sinceum recently I decided that it wasmorally I had to quit my previous careerand just go and work on bitcoin fulltime I didn't know how to do that so Istarted looking around for places to dosome open source contributionsum this led me towards fediment when Isaw what Eric was buildingum that led to me doing a new set ofdocumentation to kind of explain some ofthe concepts that were different infettiment and how they relate to bitcoinand so on and then after that I got arole as a product leader over at Freddyso that's who I am in terms of thedocumentation what you can see on thescreen is this site over here there'slike a whole little primer section onthis which is sort of the areas thatwe're going to go through today so likewhy would you use a Freddie Min who werethey for what is it what are the coretechnology components now this is a lotof this came together as part of a talkthat I did on 30 minute the yeppoonAussie Bush bash so I know you mighthave seen this event over on Twitter soshout out to The Wizard of Oz and thirdBill hold on comrades for organizing agreat eventand then the the sort of artifacts andimagery from that that presentation iswhat became the sort of skeleton forthis documentation siteyeah and so this is going to be a lightversion of that talk so that Talk itselfran for I think just over two hoursmaybe two and a half so in order to keepthings flowing today I've rehearsed alittle bit moreand uh I'll probably just Breeze throughall of the components of the talk and soif anyone's got any questions just dropthem in the chat and then at the end ofthe presentation we'll just come back tothose and have a look and go through theQ aokay so the the talk it's on fettimentwhat's a fediment uh a very technicallevel it's an open source protocol tocustody and transact Bitcoin in acommunity context built on a strongFoundation of privacyor as I like to say it's it's be yourmum's Bank you know or be your friend'sbank or be your major bank or or be yourCommunities Bank it's all about beingsomebody else's bank although I get thatwe don't really like the word bank overhere at a high level conceptwhat we could talk about here is thatit's a community custody platformall right it's it takes in a wholecommunity of people but only only a fewof those people actually have to run theplatform so it's run by this trusted setof community members what it provides tothat Community is private lightningpayments so you get a very simple walletconcept with very good privacy that'squite easy for everybody else in thecommunity so it's for the benefit of thecommunity who then put their funds intocustody and run by The Trusted communitymembers so this is this is how afilament works at a high level so whatwe're going to see today if I just zoomout a sec give you a look at the thepresentation we're going to go throughthe the why the who the whatthe higher the transactions work we'llget into a little bit of the trade-offsand then we'll point to where you canlearn more and get into questionsall rightsowhy fetty mintsowhen I gave this talk previously firstquestion out to the audience was youknow what's the significance of thenumberum 640 milliongiven I've kind of just broadcastingtoday I just say the idea here is that'sthe the total number of utxos that youcould transact in a Bitcoin blockchainover the course of a yearso that's that's our sort of theoreticalmaximum as well this doesn't includeanybody openinglightning channels or doing fancyscripts so what that kind of implies isthat there's there's some sort of limitto the amount of people that might beable to utilize a utxo on chain over thecourse of a year and if we think aboutlightning and we say okay how might weuse lightning across billions of userswe we quickly get to the point where wethink okay well maybe we need differentdifferent ways of solving this andsharing those utxos out amongst morepeople so one of the things I like aboutfediment is it gives you a way to dothat now so how could we right now startto share utxos across multiple differentpeople and start to build a solutionthat could work for billions andbillions of peopleall rightand there's obviously other solutions tothat problem as well so we have you knowcoin pools Channel factoriesumyeah more custodians various differentways of doing it but 30 minutes is oneof thoseso the three benefits that we'd like tohighlight of um of 30 men the communitycustody the financial privacy and thescaling aspects so if we drill into eachof theseinside the community custodywhat we're talking about here is adifferent approach to the problem ofcustodyum specifically targeting How We Dothird party custody and can we bringsome of those people into a moreself-custodial manner so on the one endof end of this spectrum we've gotself-custody which is all about I lookafter everything to do with my ownBitcoin you know I run my own node I runmy own lightning nodes I hold all my ownkeys I take on all of thatresponsibility and what I get for thatthat's really good is I do get likepretty good privacy and I get high veryhigh levels of control over my ownBitcoin and my own funds and what I cando with that but the trade-off that Imake is the convenience it takes time ittakes knowledgeum it's there's a lot of work that goesinto creating that system andmaintaining that system over time andnow for a lot of people it's worth thattrade-off and you know we stronglyencourage people to go down that routeof self-custody particularly wherethere's significant funds at Play now onthe other end of this scale we've gotthe third party so this is your onlineexchanges your trusted third-partycustodians and the trade-off that you'remaking there is that you get really lowprivacy they can see everything thatyou're doing you get low aspects ofcontrol because they can tell you whenyou can or can't spend your utxos yourBitcoin your money so this this is moneythat can be turned off when you're overhere it's some money that you have toask for permission to spend and reallythe point of fediment and Communitycustody as a model is to bring more ofthe people out of thatthird-party custody space and furthertowards self-custody whilst recognizingthat not everybody's willing to makethat convenience trade-off so what we'retalking about in the middle there islike how can we provide a highlyconvenient model for custody with reallygoodwell excellent privacy aspectsand maybe sacrificing some stillsacrificing some of the control from theself-custody but providing bettercontrol than you would get in athird-party environment so that's whatwe're after we often refer to this asour second party trust sorry which we'llcome on to in a momentall right so the next next benefit wehad was all about financial privacyso if we drill into Financial privacythere's a bunch of technical discussionwhich I'll save for a moment when we getto it but effectively what we do byadopting ecash as our model and blindsigning as a way of interacting withthis this Federation this fediment isthat we create like a little knowledgefirewall that sits between the Guardiansthe people that run the Federation onbehalf of the community and then theusers of the communityand what the Guardians tend to see arethese little blinded packages wherethere's some information that they cansign they can process but they reallycan't see anything that's going on belowthis knowledge firewall and theparticular things that they're not awareof aresort of who any particular user is in atransaction the next one might be theydon't actually really know the fullamount of users that they might havethat are being serviced by thatFederation and they also don't know whoany particular Bitcoin belongs to or thetotal balance of Bitcoin for anyparticular user inside that Federationso you get these really nice likeseparation and privacy aspects of ofgoing into a fediment and we'll we'lltalk a little bit later about how thosecome about when we go through the thetechnical aspectsand then the final um benefit that we wetalk about is the scaling aspects ofthisand to to describe thisI like to imagine a road mapand so this is uman analogy I was putting to work a lotin Riga recently talking to people lateat night but um one way I think we oftenthink about Bitcoin it's almost likewe're playing the first person shooterDoom or Duke Nukem from back in the dayand where we're there we're runningaround we're seeing everything else inthe world out there and it's all aboutyou know my node my lightning node I'vegot this stack and then everything elseis sort of over there away from me and Ithink there's maybe like anotherperspective you could look at theBitcoin network from as being more likea road mapand I think if we look at it like a roadmap what you start to see is thatBitcoin is all of these different placeson this road map so here's a handylittle road map for us there's lots ofdifferent places on here and they're allinterconnected by roads and you start tosee that like you know maybe we've got alittle country manner over here with aprivate road leading into a into a townand you know your pro your countrymanner that can be a bit like your coldstorage it's the place that you know youown and nobody can tell you what to doin your own country Manner and you'vegot the full control of everything thatgoes on in therebut sometimes you like to go into townbecause you've got transactions that youneed to make and you want to do somebusiness maybe you want to be a littlebit more Anonymous about what's going onso you don't want to be done at home soyou go into townand that could be like you take a roadlike which is like your lightningnetwork over to a different place whereyou start to do some businessand then sometimes you might want to goto a place that's really Anonymoussometimes you just want to go to Vegasand when you go to Vegasit what happens in Vegas is supposed tostay in Vegas so you want a really highanonymity set so it's like flying allthe way over to this village wherethere's a lot of stuff going on and youcan be completely Anonymous and that'sjust a place you've gone to for a whileand then sometimes maybe you come backafterwards to your your country Mannerand you sit back in your cold storageand I think if you can think of likeBitcoin as this network of all thesedifferent places connected by all thesedifferent roads and airplanes which area bit like your lightning Network andyour Bitcoin can be in any of thesedifferent places as you see fitnow the scaling aspect of 30 minuteswhen we look at that road map is to saythere might just be a single dot on thismap and maybe it's only got a couple oflightning Channel roads coming out ofthat that dot but inside that dot whatwe have is all the economic density ofthat town of that Village that's allbeing supplied by a couple of lightninglightning channels so what we get is avery like natural way of scalingum the lightning Network for Bitcoin bytaking a lot of the economic densityputting it inside this this one mintstructure and then connecting thosemints by the lightning Network so we canmove to these different towns Villagesdifferent places that we might want toexist or back to our Cold Storage butwhen we're inside that place all of thedifferent transactions that go on areall done off chain so if you think aboutit like zooming in on the map what yousee is there's a lot more roads a lotmore granularity and a lot more stuffgoing on and so that's the sort ofscaling aspect that we think about withuh with fedimentso let me just zoom back in all rightso next is the whoso The Who The Who component of this isoften umyou hear people talk about pediments andyou kind of wonder if the expectation isthat there's going to be one very menmany fediments to a free fetty mints andthis is really to paint the picture ofthe uh the idea is that there's going tobe hundreds of thousands to millions ofthese potential30 minutes each clustering togethercommunities of people to then sharethose resources and scale out thatNetwork on some of the different waysthat we think that might exist is on asimilar sort of spectrum to before so onone end what we might have is reallyhigh second party trust relationships sothis can be like a small family or areally close friend group where youreally trust each other but there's notthat many people that would be in thatgroup so it's got a slightly loweranonymity set so you might have afederation like that where you're maybemore storing coins as opposed tospending them and then over on the otherside of this you might have thecommunity which this could be hundredsto thousands of people to maybe like 10000 people community where yes there'ssome trust relationships that areprobably built into other organizationalstructures inside that Community butit's a slightly lower second party trustbut it's a much higher anonymity set somaybe this is more like your dailytransaction fit even so you might movefrom your family fed him into yourcommunity fediment to do more of yourdaily spending because it gives youbetter privacy guarantees and then inbetween you'll have different layers oflike fediments with friends or otherpeople that you might want to takeadvantage of and it really is thatspectrum of trade-offs that go from lowanonymity High trust to lower lowersecond party trust and higher anonymityand then the bit over to the side herewhich I think is worth talking aboutbut it's not umit's not necessarily the focus so a lotof the fediment focus assumes thissecond party trust relationship but it'san open source project it's a modularproject and the the Federation componentthat it uses allows you to build otherFederated services so I think what wesort of expect is probably going tohappen is that they'll probably be evenlarger more Anonymous federations thatcrop up that don't have that closesecond party trust relationship but doprovide a very very high anonymity setum that's a really flexible design spacethere's lots of interesting things thatcould be done in that space it'sprobably a little bit more problematicpotentially from a regulatory point ofviewum and potentially from a trust space aswell so again you don't have those closesecond party trust relationships whichis why we don't necessarily talk aboutit a lot inside the the website but it'sit's likely that there'll be a set ofservices they'll have around there aswellokayso moving onon the Watts so this is a diagram thatmay look Vaguely Familiar from a fewdifferent places I'm just going to popout of View mode so I can grab thispointerso we can point things out so this thepurpose of this umthis diagramjust to kind of try and show all the TheLogical components of a fetty mint inone place so we can talk it through andjust give people an idea of like what'sinvolved and how it interacts and thenjust layer conversation on top of thatso if we go from like a user perspectivewhat we'd say is there's two main usertypes which are the Guardians over hereand the user over here the Guardians theguardian's job is all about maintainingand looking after that Federation sosimilar to something like the the liquidside chain which has its umI can't remember the name they call themthere but the uh it's got its signersand it's various people that are part ofthe maintaining the Federation signingfor the transactions you have a similarrole here with the Guardians theseGuardians do a couple of differentthings the first bit that they do isthey're responsible for custody ofBitcoin so the way the mint works isthat you deposit Bitcoin into the mintand then that mint that Bitcoin all goesinto into one into a multi-sip contractand the keys to that multi-seater ownedby these Guardiansall right so one of the key things thatthey do is they hold the keys for themulti-sig custody now when you'vedeposited that Bitcoin into there whatyou get issued is effectively a fedimentBitcoinso you get to shoot this 30 mint Bitcoinand we'll talk a little bit more in aminute about what that is and so theother job of the the Guardians is toissue and redeem and check the fedimentBitcoin so they will issue Freddie mintBitcoin when you deposit Bitcoin if yougive them a 30 mint Bitcoin they'lleither give you your Bitcoin back orthey will swap it for another fenimentBitcoin if that's what you would like todo and that's part of the transactionprocess that will come on to they alsoprovide some other services so you cando social recovery and backups so forinstance if I'm if I'm the user overhere and this is my Freddie mint walletI can back up my wallet to theFederation because I'm alreadyimplicitly trusting this Federation ofthese Guardians with all of my Bitcoinanyway so I believe them to be somewhathonest so why not take advantage of thatas part of my backup process so that'san area that's being explored currentlyas well so the different ways you coulddesign thatum the other thing that can be done isthere's this consensus and executionengine which just is really like amodular structure that allows you tobuild different applications inside thefediment to do different things so theecash is a particular moduleum the the Bitcoin multi-sig isimplemented as a module if you wanted toadd I don't know State chain support orumI know liquid multi-six support theywould be new modules inside theFederation and they would run insidethisum consensus and execution engineanother area that we'll talk about alittle bit is there's a the ability todo hdlcs or hash time lock contractsinside the fediment which allows you tointeract with the lightning Network in avery similar wayso this is thethat's the the roles of the Guardian theuser quite simply they would come inload the walletSonicumscan a QR code in order to join afederation they can deposit Bitcoin oncethey they do they get their 30 mintBitcoin and they can send and receiveand trade or pay lightning invoices fromthat wallet now one third role that wedidn't discuss was this lightningGateway providernow the lightning Gateway provider iseffectively a special version of theuser role it's a way to think about thisis it's just another user that happensto have a lightning node and becausethat user has a lightning node and as auser they're happy to accept thefediment Bitcoins and they they havethat trust relationship with the mintthey're happy to effectively Bridge thefediment system to the lightning Networkwhich allows this fediment app over hereto pay any lightning invoice or anotherfetty mint via the lightning Network andwe'll see the mechanics of that in amoment so let's go back to e-modeso first though it's free sort of coretechnical pieces that make this workand allow us to do them so I'll go intoeach of those quite quickly so the firstis the e-cash and the blind signaturesso this is our fmbtc of fediment Bitcoinso what is a fediment Bitcoin and whyaren't we just calling it a Bitcoin wellwe just want to differentiate betweenthe ecash notes and the actual Bitcointhat's held in the multi-sig so thisfediment Bitcoin is effectively an IOUthat's redeemable for the Bitcoin that'sin the multi-sig the real Bitcoin is theBitcoin in the multi-sick the stuff thatyou're holding is effectively anaccounting system which is your claim onthe Bitcoin that's inside the multi-zipnow this iot IOU is all verified usingthis blind signature algorithms so we'llcome on to what the blind signature isin a sec but take the first bit of theIOU you know like what is this e-cachenoteso what we see is the ecash note iseffectively not simply it's kind of liketwo bits you've got a very large randomnumber which we use as a reference sothis is just a unique reference that'sgenerated by the user that owns the noteand then we have a federation signatureso this is a signature which has arrivedthere by the Guardians doing a Federatedsignature scheme I don't want to go intotoo much technical details there's somegreat white paper Wednesdays that CodyLowe runs that really go into this ifyou want to know more but but what itdoes is affected me all the Guardianscome together and they sign that thatnote with a particular key and thesekeys are rated at different amounts ofmoney so for instance here we see thatthere's a a reference number signed witha 10 000 SATs keyand so what happens is when I take thatback to the mint and I say I'd like my10 000 sacks they look at this and theyask two questions the first question isis that a valid key and they can checkthat between the Guardians and they sayif no it's rejectedif it's a yes I can value signature yesokay we'll do the second check which isthey take this large reference numberthat was the other part of the note andthey say okay if we've seen this beforeand what they're doing here is they'rekind of controlling for double spendthere you go that's what Cody's justposted a chat message about white paperWednesday so I encourage you to toattendum yeah so they this is controlling yourdouble spends and it's saying okay wellif this every time uh a an e-cash noteis given in what we're going to do iswe're going to burn that referencenumber because we're issuing somethingelse out either the Bitcoin or whateveryou cash no good so if I've seen itbefore it's already burnt somebody'strying to double spend and we justreject that paymentall right so then the Privacy part ofthis is all about how you get thatsignature on that note so obviously if Igive you a note of a reference number onand you sign it you can see thereference number and you've signed it soyou understand what the reference arereference numbers are ahead of time sothe The Innovation that came with withecash which is umwas to use a blind signature algorithmto then add a signature to the notewithout looking at that reference numberahead of time and what that means isthat the the mint effectively doesn'tknow the different reference numbersthat it's signed until the Redemption ismade so it's only at the point ofredemption that that particularreference number is revealed and that'show we get a lot of the Privacyguarantees so the way to think about theblind signing algorithm is the thecanonical example that was given by sortof um David Chow back when he inventedecash I think it was in the 80s but Icould be could be off off there waseffectively think about it like a notein a carbon in a sealed envelope withcarbon paper inside so carbon paperbeing the paper that you can use tocopy your signature across multiplepages so you put the note in you see allthe envelope instead of just giving thenote to the the mint it's effectivelylike a cashier you give them the sealedenvelope they sign the sealed envelopeand then through because they sign theoutside of the envelope it presses intothe carbon paper and then inside you getthe contract which is your referencenumber signed with that signature thatcan then be validated back by the bankat a later time to prove that the notewas real so that's kind of the theprocess that we go through and againI'll leave the uh the more technicaldetails to white paper Wednesdaysnow the second technical component thatthat we need to think about is theFederationsodigicash which was David Charlesbusiness back in the 90s was a completee-cash solution on the internetum it ended up getting shut down andrunning out of money I'm not I'm neverentirely sure whether it was shut downor run out of money but seemed to sufferfrom being a single a single issuingBank entity after the introduction ofvarious Bank secrecy laws didn't seem tohelp so what what's what's been done infediment and the reason for the namefediment is Federated Champion mint soreport one toe of the words there isthat it's it's created instead of havinga single issue of the notes you have nowthe Federation that issues the notes andredeems the notes now what that givesyou is it's three different thingsreallyfirst of all it means that it's multipleparties that hold the underlyingcollateral so instead of entrusting allof your precious Bitcoin to a singleperson and hoping they don't steal youcan now entrust it to multiple peopleand you have this sort of Guardianstandoff amongst all these people wherethey kind of keep each other honestbecause a majority of the the Guardiansnow have to collude to steal that thatmoney so that's one of the things thenext thing is it gives you is a littlebit more redundancy in the paymentinfrastructure so again if this isdeployed onyou know um let's say lower lower specinfrastructure in various places aroundthe world you might want more redundancyaround coming to consensus around thesespends so it means that you know one ofthese say it's a free free Guardiansystem here one of them could be down ifthere's 15 Guardians maybe a few can bedown at any one time and you can stilloperate and then the third thing that itgives you is better regulatorypositioning so again often regulationsare written based on the notion ofcustodial ownershipof the coins that are available there soif you're one of many Guardians one ofmany in a multi-sig you're generally notconsidered to be the owner of thosecoins or the controller of those coinsin any particular instance so again itgives better regulatory view there oflike what you're allowed to do and yeahand then the Thirdsort of technical Innovation inside herethat we'll talk about it's probably thelightning swapsand so I I tend to refer to it as a swapbecause I think that's the the easiestway ofof trying to think think this throughand I'll go through a more piece bypiece transaction in a minute so we cansee how the the money flows but the wayI like to think about this is we havethis little guy I'm going to call himDave for the sake of sake of argumenttoday Dave is a user of our fediment buthe also runs a lightning node and sowhat Dave has decided he says I'mwilling to holdBitcoin but I'm also willing to holdnormal Bitcoin and lightning but I'llswap one for the other as long asthere's some profit in me I don't mind Idon't mind which one it is that I holdso effectively Dave's a guy with twobalance sheetsit's got a bag of ecash in his bag oflightning he says as long as I've gotmore at the end of the day I'll swapsome of this for some of this and someof this for some of this and then thatallows him to create and to receive andpay lightning on your behalf and settleinto ecash on the other side of thetrain we'll again get into that in a secokayso that's the the componentsof the ferry mint so I'll just pause fora sec on this picture and then if anyonehas any questions as I say drop them inthe chat and they can come back to allof this at the endall right okay so the next umnext bit that we'll pop into is aroundhow do we actually execute transactionsso first of all we'll do an intraminttransaction so how would a an e-cashtransaction settle insideof elementoh I've got a lot of talking today allright let's get out of View modeokay so today we've got Alice and BobAlice and Bob happened to be inside thesame 30 men and Alice is going to payBob because that's all she does all dayinside Bitcoin circles so Bob as uhlet's grab this little QR code and he'sshown that to Alice so she knows who isrequesting the money and how much and ithappens to be a 15 000 sat paymentand so the first thing that happens overhere is Alice I guess okay well like 15000 sets I've got this 10 000 Sati cashtoken I've got a five thousand City cashtoken I'm just gonna send those to Boband that's quite different to what wemight expect in a Bitcoin context whereusually Alice would go and talk to thismagic blockchain over here and she'dbroadcast transactions time would passand eventually it would all settle it'sa little bit different in the ecashworldit's effectively she just goes bang hereyou go here's here's the tokens I'lljust give them to you they're worth thismuch moneyand BobBob's got a little bit of computerknowledge about him and he says that'sall right that you've given me thosetokens but I happen to knowthat a move is just like a copy in thecomputer world so how do I know that youdon't still have those tokens so I'mglad that I've got them but I'm notgoing to accept them as uh as completeyet so instead to take step two he sendsthose tokens back to the mint and hesayshey mint here's 15000 30 minute 15 000 Freddie mint SATscould I get a 15 000 sat voucher insteadand the miniature says yep no problemBob here you go gives that uh back toBob and that settles the transaction atthat point so whilst the initialtransaction was made that the the bearercertificates because these actually arethe money it's just small packets ofdata that you could hand overeven though they go to Bob but it's nota subtle transaction until Bob's checkedwith them in and got some new ones butonly he now knows the secret number thatallows them to be redeemed so that's athat's an intramint transaction that'seffectively how they looknow if we come down it gets a little bitmore complex if we look at the wholelightning Network or incrementso the way the lightning integrationworks and the interferment integrationworks is actually quite similar so whatwe'll do is we'll start off with the thelightning version and then we'll justtalk about how it changes when weintroduce the second ferdimentso we've got five steps effectively thatwe're going to go through here so wecould just just go through the setup sowe've got fediment one over here whichAlice is a member of and she's payingBob Bobby BTC pay over here for hislightly node now this is just a standardlightning node there's no Fanny mintsinvolved in the creation of thistransactionand so what what's going to happen hereis thatso I can just seethe chat I'm going to know those for asecond is that the the BTC pay server isgoing to create an invoice and thisinvoice is effectively a contractand this contract saysbasically I'm going to sell somethingthis is how I like to think of thesecontracts I think it's going to help soI'm I'm gonna say here's a hashand I will sell if you can give me tenthousand cents I'll sell you thispre-image of this hashit's a bit like what a lightningcontract doesthey sends this contract over to Bobover to Alice in uh it's a QR code now Ican read this QR code and it basicallysays yeah if you can get to this addressand deliver 10 000 sets I will give youthis pre-image it's available over hereand Alice says all rightI want to pay that I want to pay thatinvoice but all I've got is fedimentBitcoin so how am I going to do this sowhat happens is Alice says I'll write asimilar contract I'll add another hashtime lock contract and I'll say I'lltake the same hashbut I'll make it for 10 100 setsand I'll I'll pay it in 30 min Bitcoinand I'll have a contract that says if ifyou go and pay this invoiceI will pay youand ten thousand one hundred SATs andI'll know that you've paid becauseyou'll have the pre-image for this hashand this contract goes into the into theconsensus engine over here where it sitsall right and so now now Dave did I sayDave yeah everything was Dave so Dave onLightning Network guy the guy with thetwo bags he looks at this and he says ohit's interestingI can get 10 100 SATs in this bag if Ipay 10 000 sets out of this bag whichmeans I'm aheadso what I'm going to do is I'm going togo and have a look and I'm going to plota route through the lightning Networkand find how I'm going to pay thisinvoice fantasticand then he says right I'll go and paythat invoice and he goessends the lightning over to pay theinvoice and as we all know the way thoselightningsas Lightning payments settle is thatthis pre-image effectively gets routedback towardstowards Dave Now Dave knows that thatpre-image also allows him to claim thiscontract over here inside the consensusNetwork which then gets him these setsso what we can see quite nicely there ina visual context is that Dave is downlightning sets ten thousand SATs buthe's up fediment Bitcoin set to 10 100cents so that's how a payment is madeout of the add some perfetti mint andinto lightningall right now of course if he gets toomany of the filament Bitcoin sets hereyou can put those back and redeem theBitcoin and then open new lightningchannels which is how that balance wouldbe retainednow when we talk about the um thepayments into a ferryman effectively thesame things happen so you get the samesetup over here for Alice doing thepayment but if we jump over here toBobwhat he's doing he's setting up asimilar contractwhich again but effectively this timewhat he's saying is like instead ofsending money on my behalf I want you toreceive money on my behalf and then Iwill pay you to receive the money sothis time the Lightning goes through thelightning Network and ends upondavina's balance sheet over here andfetty mint too and then she pays thefediment Bitcoin out to unlock thecontract hereall right and then that's how she getsthis pre-image which would then flow allthe way back here and unlock theoriginal contract as we had earlier sothat's the way the two payments workall rightcoolso how this brings us into thetrade-offs part of the document so againwhen we were going through thedocumentation we wanted to kind ofreally honest view of um you know whatwas really good about Freddie mints andwe think there's a lot of really goodstuff and then can we have a reallyhonest accounting of the the trade-offsthat you're gonna get so when Ioriginally gave this talk in in yeppoonat the bush bash I think I started offby saying you know who likesuh holding their own keys and 21 millionBitcoin and all the hands were up in theair and I was like we're going to playaround with thosethose Norms a little bit today we don'tnecessarily break them but it's it's adifferent trade-off model once you bringcustodianship into into any of thosesystems so what we've done if I just umflip backfit back to the website in herejust to point out you've got what you'vegot is a view of the different riskaspectsthe effect the fetty mint and then youcan drill into each of these and you'llget a rundown of like what the risk isand the mitigation probably the moredetailed one is around the debasementrisk because it's a very nuanced aspectto that so like it goes through theproblem it goes with different ways ofexecuting on it what the impact of thatis and then the mitigations and you knowI'd encourage you to look through thisstuff and just get used to the argumentsso the four that we'll just quicklycover off here kind of first one iscustody not your keys not your coinsum as is true for any custodialrelationship if you give up because it'sself-custody of your Bitcoin to anotherentity be there a second party trustrelationship like a 30 minute or a thirdparty like an exchange it's not yourkeys anymoreum I think the Nuance that we like totalk about here is that fediment is abit more like it's not our keys not ourcoins and a lot of these custodyrelationships do happen quite naturallyinside these second party relationshipsso a good way to think about this is wego back to you know be your mum's Bankbe your mates bank there's an awful lotof bitcoiners out there and I know thatI'm probably one that do holdBitcoin on behalf of other people oftenin a family context so you know youmight own your mum dad's Bitcoin yourgrandad's your uncle's Bitcoin and theydon't really know what to do this isjust a different way that you couldexecute and do that inside a multi-safecontextso yeah that's that's one aspect of thatnow the the mitigation here is reallyabout you want to think about who you'retrusting with your Bitcoin see in thesame way you just wouldn't send all ofyour Bitcoin into some dodgy exchangedon't send all your Bitcoin into somedodgy Federation make sure that youactually do have that trusted secondparty Federation there it could be proofof maybe it's the idea here is likeproof of being able to walk up tosomebody and punch them in their nose ifthey steal all your Bitcoin you knowthat's good solid trusted second partyrelationship but if you can self-custodyand I think maybe a lot of us that areinterested in Bitcoin probably alreadydo then it's you know maybe it's moreabout you spending money or somethingelse so think about those trade-offs uhthe second one is around the inflationor the fractioning problem soso if we go into the the guardian Viewover here this is a view of the assetsand liabilities of a particularfettiment so what we'd say is on theasset side of the balance sheet we knowhow much Bitcoin exists and on theliability side of the balance sheet weknow how many of the um how many timeswe've signed for a particular token soif I'm an honest Guardian what I know isI know whether my assets and liabilitiesmatch I know that I've only signed foras many Bitcoin as I hold in thatmulti-sik and I can test those as aguardian as a user it's more opaque youcan't see that now if I'm a corruptGuardianwhen particularly if I'm a corruptQuorum of Guardians then the problemyou've got is that they can actuallysignextra extra notes to themselves withoutanybody else knowing nowthe Nuance that you've got to bear inmind there is that this would onlyhappen whereit's a corrupt Quorum of the Guardiansand a corrupt Quorum of the Guardians isalready holding your Bitcoin anyway soyou're in a pretty bad situation if thisis going on now in terms of an inflationrisk what you then ask yourself is wellthey haven't inflated any Bitcoinbecause the amount of Bitcoin on theasset side of the balance sheet is stillthere so what you've got is localizedinflation inside a mint and then thequestion becomes right well what can Ido with that because I can't just youknow go to anybody as though it'sBitcoin and give them one of these iousit has to be executed within thisfediment context so I've probably gotthree different exit ramps so one wouldbe um exit via Redemption soso can I redeem thisthrough sorry let's go back to where Iwas can I redeem this back from the themulti-stick and the mint yes or no wellI could but again I'm already a corruptGuardian maybe I'll just steal all theBitcoin in the mint my bits the betterattack to do here which is part of thecustodial risk uh the next one is couldI exit via merchants or other users sothis is a little bit more nuanced buteffectively potentially you could have asituation where a corrupt Guardiancorrupt set of Guardians are able toslowly issue themselves a little bitmore recash you cash notes and then usethose to kind of eat for free as it wereinside the town so they could pay forgoods and services locally people aren'tregularly then using the lightningNetwork or cashing these back out fromthe Bitcoin and they kind of inflatetheir supply on a very local level andthen the third aspect of it is probablythat you can exit via a lightningNetwork Gateway now I think the problemwith the exit of either lightningNetwork Gateway is if a lot ofum ecash goes out it just forces theredemptions onto the onto the asset sideso more of the Bitcoin then getsredeemed and that gets turned back intochannels and so the lightning networksprobably not get into Florida but whatwould happen is accelerate a kind ofmint collapse and when none of the fundsare available anymore now themitigations around that are going to bethings likeaudits automated bank runs again knowingyour Federation and who those Guardiansare like the concept of Guardians havingthis sort of stand off amongstthemselves and being able to raise thealarm that somebody hasn't raised theconcept of of cheating the users out ofthe money and so on and you can alsohave in-app monitoring there as well tosay like you knowif there's a high degree of redemptionsthen something might be going on that weneed to deal with inside the men so allright regulatory pressure for Guardiansis another one of the trade-offs soagain it's a very private system somepeople don't like privacy those people Ithink probably need to grow up a littlebit there's nothing wrong with shuttingthe door when you go to the toilet butyou know there can be problems aroundthat for Guardians that want to hold oneof these systems depending on theregulatory environment now again it'sbeen designed to the whole design offediment it's got a lot of separation ofDuties the idea is the Guardians wouldnot be commercial entities the Guardianswould be entities that do this out ofthe love of the community you know it'sthe the lightning network is already anestablished role so the lightningNetwork person can be a commercialentity so there's a different separationof roles inside there to try and easethe regulatory pressure for guardiansbut that's probably one of the areasthat you want to be clear on before youstep into thisum then the final bit we'll call outhere is the lightning Gateway Relianceso a lot of the the power of the fettymint comes when it's integrated into allof the different fediments and all ofthe different lightning Network nodesand operators and Merchants that existin the greater Bitcoin ecosystem to dothat you need a lightning NetworkGateway so the problem we have thereis if this lightning Network get goesaway what do you do now you're back tojust dealing with people that are inyour local local Federation and maybeit's much less useful now again what wesaid here is that that lightning NetworkGateway can be any user so even in theabsence ofum a lightning Network going awayanother user could spin up anotherGateway and then they could provide theservice to the network and get paid forit on their behalf again this is acommercial service so this is somethingyou can do for a profit so theexpectation would be that there'd be oneor two different lightning providers forany particular Federation and if they godown there's a good economic reason forsomebody else to step into that breachand provide that serviceso that's that trade-offsookay it came through a lot quicker thanwe didback in yeppoon but to learn morethere's several different places you cango and learn about 30 minutes so so oneis the the Discord uh so you can go tochat.fettimint.orgso that's how you find the Discordserver uh the telegram room so T dot meslash fetty mintuh the website obviously we looked atthe docs earlier freddiemint.org or theTwitter handle at fediment uh for myselfum at Pete win on Twitter if you want tosay hi or ask any questions I'm morethan happy to get involved uh maybe onejust cheeky call to actionum we are looking to hyper Bitcoin asvast quantities of the world that's partof our plan for for fetty uh there's asite fetty.xyz hyper which is ourcommunity our call to action forCommunity hyper bitcoinization so ifyou've got a community of people andyou'd like to deploy a fediment in thereand you want some help that's that's theplace to go so fetty.xyz slash hyper soquestions I'm just going to pause forbreath Maybeyeah I got oneI wrote a couple notes uh one on thetopic of a guardian signing is that justlike automated meaning the keys likelyneed to be hot uh I'm not exactly surehow that kind of works like whatever oneof the Guardians is like offline orsomething and then you just have to waitfor to get their fatty mint Bitcoin orredeem their Bitcoinlike just thinking of from like a uxpoint of view if there's issues thereum just but yeah how does the signingwork on the guardian sideumeffectivelyyesthat would be hotkeys I think there'sprobably some more Nuance to this thatumso I did see Cody's in the in the roomas well who's one of the guys that uhhelped a lot with the documentationnow the way it's designed is like yeahthe keys might be hot to redeem theBitcoin does notit's a design choice about how it getsdeployed I think it's pretty great tothink about it so you could potentiallymake it cold or you could potentiallyseparate them out in a similar manner tohow you would do your validatedlightning sign thing but at the pointwhere you move the Bitcoin you need thekeys to be active so depending on howyou've deployed perfetti mint they'reprobably more likely to be hotat that point or you would have somesort of process like bitmex style for weonly do one withdrawal a day at thistime that you can send through your yourredemptions for Bitcoin but we'll justhold them until this point in time butyeah most likely hot uh one thing that'sprobably pointing out is that you couldseparate out the keys for thetransaction signing and the the the coldthe multi-sig signing as well for theredemptions so you could have asituation where you keep the the keys toredeem the multi-sig Bitcoin cold andthen that's something that you executeunder a processversus the transaction signing insidethe fediment which would be hotyeah Pete you're definitely right aboutthat in terms of the um like theincentive Keys the consensus Keys haveto be hot because they're running uhepic rounds every like couple seconds orso but for the multi-stig that's justlike it's a giant deposit it's just likea giant multi-tig wallet right noweventually it's going to be aum for uh Frost wallet or a roast walletwith Taproot but those keys you onlyneed to sign with those when somebody'strying to Peg out and so while currentlythose are hot just because like you wantto make it easy for people to leave theminum technically those could be coolokay cool yeah makes senseall right so there's a whole host ofquestions that came through in the chatumit looks like Cody's doneniceumCody if you answered most of thequestions in the chat or is thereanything that's worth picking outuh yeah I answered most of them I meanlike there's some of them just kind ofmore technicalities like for um why notattend a list of unspent tokens is thatso when we're talking about tokens likelet's distinguish between the ecash andtheum Bitcoin right so it's like for thefediment Guardians they're runningBitcoin notes like they can be prunedBitcoin nodes but they have to come toconsensus on what the current blockheight is for peggins and Peg outs rightand so they're maintaining like the utxI said all the normal stuff that youwould do with Bitcoin but the thing theyalso have to maintain is the list ofredeemedum ecash uh ecash um notes that'sdesigned for right because like he wassaying is that the only thing that theFederation knows is yes I signed this atsome point right and so if they don'tmaintain a list of all of the ones thatpeople have redeemed where they'veshowed back up and they said like heythis is an ecash note I'm redeeming thenthey could show up later and just belike hey like here's the proof yousigned for this right and so like yesthat's a valid one so that's where youhave to maintain the list of spent oneyou can't maintain a list of the unspentecash notes because that's the wholepoint of the blind signature right likethey don't know what it is until it getsredeemed and once it gets redeemed thenthey can do uh they can do that and solike they they're they're asking for theamounts that they've issued they're notcapturing for this specific tokens thatthey've issued until they show back upand once they show back up then the theycan say like yes I'm redeeming thisspecific 100 sat cash note or whateverthat I expectyeah that makes senseand then I think I'll just pick outthere's a question from Sid or maybemore of a comment that says so in a waya fed him in it's like a side chainwhich is maintained by the Guardians thedata maintained and the chain isactually the unspent token so a littlebit I think there's there's a reallygood talkuma honey badger recently by by Niftyfrom block stream looking at differentlaity solutions where she compareduh was it lightening liquid and thenfetty mints and she had a model like alayer cake model where she talked aboutthe being there's always a multi-sigthere's always like an accounting systemand there's always an exit criteria forgetting back out of the side chain andlike a lot of the difference comes inthe accounting model whereas you knowlightning it's like a two of twomulti-second the accounting is theseunspent transactions liquid is a largermulti-segg and the accounting is a fullblockchain that tells you who owns whatat any point in time and then in the 30minute it's generally a slightly smallermulti-sig for the time but then theaccounting system is quite differentbecause it's actually a set of thesetokens and so to account for the moneythat's held inside the multi-sig youalways issue a token and then the userhas to hold that token and then that isa claim back on the stuff so you havethis almost likeFree banking style physical paperaccounting model for claims on amulti-sig so it's worth having a look atthat that talk it should be on onYouTube and the Baltic only budgetsection because that does a really niceway of thinking about it it's the youknow the ecash tokens are really theaccounting system for that so you can doaway with a blockchain which then givesyoudifferent trade-offsand the the lighting Gateway becausethat's presumably going to be part ofthe like a member of the mint 2 becauseit's going to be getting the tokens fromthe minute it's going to maybe want toexchange them later for Bitcoin uh Ikind of see that like maybe having somelike regulatory issues there becauselike uh the lightning Gateway isprobably offering this service as abusiness and taking fees and then partof that business model will be using themint so I could see like Regulators thisis just me thinking out loud a littlebit but Regulators thinking out loud andsaying all that mint's actually part ofthis Ln gateways business kind of fallsunder thatum but I just took a real rough notewhile you were talking about it thinkingout loud a bit but yeah I mean withregulation you always want to make surethatyou you understand the regulation insidethe specific jurisdiction I mean theconcept of event when you view it asa set of trusted Guardians in acommunity that are looking after Bitcoinfor friends and family that's generallynot viewed as suspicious orum I guess immoral or incorrect in anyway from a regulatory point of view it'sgenerally allowed and that's a spacethat you can operate in be you know wedon't want to go go around and breakinto every every child's piggy bank justto make sure that the money you'reholding for them isthat maybe maybe we do who knows younever know where these things goum so I think that's it real fast yepso real fast addition to that is thatjust um there's a Chinese wall rightbetween theum lightning Gateway and the mint rightis that the mint is purely it's purely athreshold controlled asset structure ofthat the only thing that they'rediscussing the mint is not do makingfees the mint is not facilitatingtransactions every single transactiongoes through the lightning Gateway andthe lightning Gateway is the one thatmakes it right so that's like just athat's a very specific design decisionin terms of that the mint is not makingmoney the mint is not doing this forpurpose of business like they're not uhlike all like this was something whereit would actually be a lot easier tolike do like transactions within themintum just like you know like hey you getthese tokens and then you just redeemthe mint or whatever the mintfacilitates that matchmaking between thetwo of you but that's like a specificdesign decision of like the mint is notengaging in business with these peopleis purely a threshold controlled assetstructure where likeum you're depositing Bitcoin and it'slike being held in a threshold both ofthese things but they're not makingmoney off of it or anything the onlypeople who make money are the lightningGateway and the lightning Gateway can beanybody but this is just like theproblem with any lightning node is thatit's making money right and so likewhatever like the regular I mean theregular Regulators because they couldlike decideyou know I mean like wasn't it like twodays ago that the SEC decided that likeall ethereum transactions fall undertheir jurisdiction because like most ofthe nodes are in the US or whateverright so like they could say somethingstupid but like in general it's going tofall under the exact same structure forthe lightning Gateway of any otherlightning node and for the mint as justany other multi-stig structureyeahcool um sojust uh leverage I'm happy to hangaround for a few minutes and just answerany remaining questions but we did getto the top of the hour so obviously ifanybody has to gofeel freeum so TJ says King does sending to fettyoffer an alternative to mix or breakingtrackingumI guess you you could say that maybe theway I think about that is in what's thepoint of of breaking the linkor tracking that you're after becauseobviously going into any sort ofmulti-cycle side chain and then comingout later there's probably a potentialto do that but if you're thinking moreabout you know like transactionalprivacy then yes certainly like ifyou're looking to spend money and nobodyknows who's spending it then doing thatfrom a fairly mint is a great way ofachieving this so if we go back to theexample that we had of the lightningNetwork invoiceand then somebody in a federation payingthat invoice what's visible to the worldthere is that the lightning node thelightning um BTC pay server knows thatit was paidas far as it could tell the only thingthat would be visible to the outsideworld is that that was paid by alightning Network Gateway who'spresumably facilitating payments forlet's let's call it several hundreds tothousand people inside this Federationand we don't know who in that Federationhas been paidnow the flip side of that if you're thelightning Network Gateway again youdon't know who inside that Federation ispaid but you do know what you paid soyou know that you paid a b2c pay serverand maybe you know it was five dollarsand so you can guess it's a particularhat or something like that but you don'treally know who bought itso there's that aspect of privacy stillto work out but that's more of a likelyNetwork problem now I think some of thework that's just been done on LDK uh Ican't remember the name of the modulebut to do the routing off on a lightnode it's probably going to help thatbecause then you could have the theapplication could create its own onionand then pay the payment on its behalfwhich would then limit the amount ofknowledge that the Gateway has or analternative way of solving that is youtake the merchants and you put themerchants in a federationand now all that's visible on on to theoutside world is really that some stuffmoved from place over here that has tonsof people in it to a place over herethat has tons of people in it and wedon't know anything more than that wedon't know who any other people is so ifwe go back to like the um the mapanalogy and all the different placeswhere Bitcoin could be it would be a bitlike there's a bunch of people inChicago and a bunch of people in NewYork and a car leaves Chicago and drivesto New York and you say well who is inthe car and you go I don't know somebodyfrom Chicago has gone to New York wejust don't know who it is so it's verygood from like that level of privacy andobfuscation on the network so I thinkthere is good the general privacyimprovements as well by integrating thisinto intoabout the execution kind of things inthe meant to you could obviously haveotherthings that get executed in there and Iknow you've mentioned in the past uhPete about kind of being like blackboxes like stuff goes in you can dostuff with it stuff comes out yes rightyou can there's all sorts of stuffhappens in Vegas yeahthis is allowed it's a perfectlyregulatory file Focusbut yeah yeah just as an example umJustin and I when we were at a BTC BusPlusum we did a Stimpy module which wasimplementing Simplicity which is blockstreams marketing language like upgradepotential for Bitcoin as a module rightso that's like not something that couldcome to Bitcoin in the foreseeablefuture until you know like after likeAPO and like four other softworks orwhatever right but like that's somethingwhere on pediment just because of themodule system because we've got aconsensus uh engine side of it that likeyou could do that and so that's what wedid we called it a a simp time lockcontract was that you locked to a hashof a Simplicity contract and then youexecute this contract on the side andthat would like a peg in or Peg outBitcoin if you satisfy this positivenicethis is uh another question just pickingoff from the bottom of the chat so Aggiesays I feel there's an above averageamount of trust put on the FederationGuardians on part the members I'm notquite sure what the game theory is thatwould prevent Anonymous Guardian fromturning Rogue I I mean that's that'ssomewhat true I think the the way Ioften think about this is that wethere's already a lot of Guardians wellnot Guardians a lot of custodians thatexist and many that that aren't Roguethat have much higher degrees of Bitcointhan you might find in one of theseCommunity myths so these are designed tobesmall small communitiesgroups of people where there's already atrust relationship in there like as Isaid there's definitely a design spaceforhuge anonymous online mints you know youcould almost think ofbitmex as being this huge Anonymous kindof on online no kyc gambling mint thatexisted back in the day the people weremore than happy to send Bitcoin to itapparently by hundreds of thousands asfar as the Insurance Fund looked at theend of it so there's there's definitelya view that people do do that even withsingle custodiansum and we see it all the time withexchanges and other systems so I thinkwhat this is saying is that there's justmore of a design space for instead ofthe only options being new custody andthen somebody you definitely shouldn'ttrust custody in it you know maybethere's some people you already trustcan we make it easier for those peoplebecause they do and then can weeffectively create a world where insteadofum you know a country having four Banksand there's no competition and they justturn slightly evil over time we've gotcountry that has a million Banks insideit and there's a lot of competitiongoing on at a local and National leveland they're all keeping each otherhonest because they're all Bank Runningeach other and they're having a grandold time like that's a better world tolive in so that's that's what we'reafter thereI think it'd be a lot easier to take aindividual Court as well that you knowif they screw you over compared to liketaking a big company or exchange thatscrewed you over yeah and you knowsometimes we talk about it with um it'slike you know quite smaller communitieswhere there is a lot of that trustelement built into the running of thefabric of society soum you know you can you can talk aboutit almost likethe maybe the trust element is you youwalk over there to your uncle who's gotthe keys and you kick him in the nutsbecause it's not giving you your keys oris messing around right you know there'sdifferent ways of resolving this sort ofstuff one of the things that wastheorized in umthe bush bash was talking about likewould you start to see constitutions andvarious other like legal systems startto crop up around these mintsformalize the system to make it easierto then take people to court if anythingdodgy happened and the layering legalcontrols I mean that's all out of thescope of the protocol are the protocolsopen you can do all that stuff that'sreally more of an implementation andCommunity detail but yeah there could belots of different ways you could layeron additional real world meet spacetrust into these things as wellum just a couple numbers that I thinkmight help clarify some of this is likeher on-chain Bitcoin there's been atotal of 2.2 or so billion transactionsever and so it's like okay so on-chaindoesn't scale the whole world justbecause you know there's 11 billionpeople and just like in the entirehistory of Bitcoin we've got 2.2 billionoutputs this isn't even just likeunspent outputs total right and then soit's like oh okay well lightning isgoing to scale well lightning just toopen up just like a single Channel likedon't even talk about splicing don'teven talk about like sizing differencesdon't even talk about like the advice isthat like just for every single personin the world to have a lightning channelwould the two full years of uh the twoyears of full blocks rightum just to do the channel open right noteven talking about the closes not eventalking about like not even talkingabout like the pinning attacks thatwould eventually that would uhdefinitely still happen get that sothat's like okay so we need like somesort of layer on top of lightning inorder to like fediment is proposing tobe that sort of scaling one and then interms of the custody aspect of it likewhen people are like oh hey the you'retrusting the guardians or whatever andlike why can't you just sellself-custody like the the guy whoreplied to how Finney like hey why wouldmy currency be anything other thanBitcoin and how can he proposed uh microbank right and um uh like they kind ofanswer to it is like think about yourself-custody solution and it's like anysales custody solution that survives yougetting hit by a bus involves thresholdcustody which is that you have a backupsystem that people that you trust wouldbe able to recover your funds if youdied right and so like now the momentsthat you're talking about that well okayso if they're able to recover how arethey storing these pieces how are theydoing and it's like well now you startrunning into the betterment territorywhere it's like if you're going to betrusting them to be your backup thenlike let's actually formalize that trustrelationship and Define it in such a waythat like for example for the thresholdbackup scheme for um defendant membersit's like you know you have some backupso you can take a majority of theGuardians and recover here if you loseyour fatty wallet or whatever butwithout those extra shares that you havethey still have a if all of them pollutetogether then they can recover yourwallet right and so that's like a coupleof different options for that one butjust like the the things to kind ofthink about in terms of like the scalingBeyond lightning because that's notgoing to fitum 11 billion people on it and then alsojust the threshold controlled assetstructure of like do you have a custodySolution that's going to surviveyeah and just to add to that as well Imean we mentioned earlier that it's amodular system and like the ecash is amodule the themulti-sig aspect is a module so you canjust look at this as it's a standardizedway from an open post protocol formanaging multi-six in kind of cleverways you could take the ecash out andjust run this as a multi-sickarrangement with a backup module andthen all of a sudden what you've got isyour your multi-sig system encased in atiny little Raspberry Pi that you cangive one to your brother and one to yourmom and one to your dad and like theycan then come together and get someBitcoin when they need toum and there's there's other waysso I did see some questions about thebackup so that yes there is a conceptthat because you're using this this coreroom of Guardians to manage your Bitcoinanyway and they can if they're corruptthey can effectively steal it you may aswell use that same take advantage ofthat same trust relationship that'sexisting to work with your backups soyou can like do like a smear sharding ofthe of the backup data into theGuardians and then use it to recoverfrom them so you can do almost like anoffline recovery of like okay I'm gonnago to the Guardians and I'll reveal thatI am actually Pete and they'll say yesyou repeat we know who you are we can gothrough a checklist to say you appear tobe the right person you're in the righttimes and you're talking right you looklike the guy in the pictures that we'vegot available here and they can executea process if they're family membersmaybe it doesn't even need to be achecklist maybe it's just like yeah ofcourse you're Peter and then when Benturns up and he says I'm like oh I'm I'mPete and goes oh you're not Pete you'reBen real no you're Ben or anybody elsesounds like Cody turns up say I'm Peteand say you're not pee you don't lookthe same you look a bit different weknow we know peas he's my brother it'syour name you've got that sort ofrelationship but it's all now formalizedin a software setup where all the keysare managed on your behalf and you cando the recovery back into a simpleapplication so like there is thisconcept theof that sort of social recovery I meanthat's a lot of the details of like howthat will actually work at gettingworked out at the moment but yep that'senough that's an option and you canstart to get a little bit clever withthat where we said if we go back to thespectrum of the different fetty mintsthat might exist maybe in the thecommunity one with thousands of peopleyou don't have such a good trustrelationship with those people forbackup but you do with your family ifany mint so you there's nothing to stopyou backing up the keys for yourum for your community filament to yourfamily fedimentthe same Software System you just say ohcan you back up this system over hereand it's the key for this one and I'vehave a family Infinity mint key in thereI could have my community fairly men myfriends Freddie mint my non-fediment Icould do that or I could have twotrusted fediments A and B and I couldback up the keys from B into a and thekeys from a into B and then if theGuardians tried to recover them they'dlook at the keys and go these don't makeany sense none of this no this is realso like there's different ways you canplay around with that once you've gotthis concept of like okay well here's aa selection of different people that Ican trust with those keysall rightI've got one more question uh this wasthis more like I guess like if you havean idea but how could you see like thewhole collaborative custody model thatseems to be pretty popular at the momentlike with block and Unchained CapitalCasa potentially being a part of likeFederation setups to say for examplethey have one of their multi-sig sitebeing like some third party which couldhelp with you know preventing Guardianswho may know each other from colludingwith each other as well as having athird party who could potentially act aslike an auditor who's the trusted thirdparty that says but they can't sign theydon't have enough light of the Quorum ofthe keys to do that but could you seelike yeah collaborative custody beingpart of like fediment setup or somethinglike that like I'm sure people would doheaps of stuff like this as it kind ofgets uh rolled out but yeah justthinking out loudyeah I mean I think it is justcollaborative custody bybase design really like it's I meanthere's nothing to say you couldn't haveAuditors in the mint in in a way we kindof like when we go back to theyeah you know the risk around dilutioninside the mint so like can we createmore of this the the notes that actuallyexist for the Bitcoin like one of theguards against that is that you have thedifferent the different Guardians andthey have their view of the assets andthe liabilities and if they ever viewthat to be out of sync then they wouldraise an alarm the problem that itdoesn't necessarily help with is thatyou've now got like the corruptGuardians can still just sign stuff offto the side over there and not tell youabout it and you don't you don't knowthe difference because it's still avalid signature and as far as I can telland again this is probably a white paperWednesday question but I don't believethat you can tell whether you were partof the signing round either so all youall you know is that the the thresholdkey was correct that signed that so it'snot like say I'm and I'm an honestguardian and you know everybody else isa dishonest guardian and I and I thinkoh it's weird that I only seem to beredeeming stuff that I've never signedbut yeah I've been in most of thesigning sessions because my uptime isthis so I can't necessarily trackagainst that I think is that correctCodyum you know which ones your partner okayyeah yeah so you know which ones you'rea part of and then also I mean for likewithin the consensus because we're usingDLSbut againthreshold signature I think it's BLS thecryptography library that umthat I'm part of the signing or whenit's redeemed and I check the signatureI know that I was part of that yeah forthe Epic ground you can see that youthat youright but for the um for the on-chainwall that's the thing that's currentlywell with the multi-sig like you canjust see it just used for multi-sig butthe two options for going to Tap Root sothat it's supposed to keypad spend orFrost gross if we do frost then youcan't find a point I don't know whichoneright umRosesoall right cool and then I think TJ saysyou mentioned fetty.xyz slash hyper Idid indeedumgo there if you if you want to getinvolved and you're looking to get somehelp setting up a community Federationso you'll see more details about whatwe're up towe'll be in touch if you sign upall rightum maybe to pick up Simon here whathappens if a guardian loses a keyum so again you do have some built-inredundancy so you know some aspects ofthis is gonna it's gonna depend on likehow you've deployed a particularfediment so is it people's laptops is ita bunch of Raspberry Pi's that are justhidden all over the place there's allsorts of different crazy stuff you canget intoumthe first thing to say is that if oneGuardian loses a key then you can stillcarry on with the remaining guardiansbut you would you would want to monitorthat Freddie mint and you might say gothis Key's gone offline and it's notcoming back okay well now we've only gotyou know this much space left before wecan no longer sign so we might want totake some actions against that so someof the things that you could do is youcould move the Bitcoin whilst you stillhave the remaining Keys into a newmulti-seek and then reissue certificatesagainst that for instance or you couldset up a whole new Federation and youcould have all your users pay out viathe lightning Network into the other oneand so you Bank Run yourself into a newFederation and then you just let the oldone collapsesoil once we get umI guess with frost and roast morebetter integrated I think this is thecase then you can start to moredynamically assess who the members ofthe multi-sik are so we should be ableto roll keys inside althoughI don't take my word for that yeahrolling Keys is just like a it's likereally complicated right like verydifficult and so kind of I thinkohcoolall rightum I think I've got most of thequestions there is there any any otherquestions anyone wants to bring upotherwise I'll probably pull this one toan endyeah thanks for the talk it was reallygoodall rightfantastic uh I don't think we get anyannouncements on the recordings so I'llsaywe are finished recordingwe've got a betterment developer
