  "text": "are you mani'm terrific i'm just oh there it is andi'm just about to share the fact that weare livesureoopsi'm nervous and i'msilly uh not just simply retweeting i'mhitting the rethink retweet all rightwe're livethere it is the video showing up ontwitter successawesome yes i see myself on twitteruh all right so man first of allthank you for for taking the time forthis discussion i umyou know you've been prolificparticularly in your writing in the lasti don't know a year or so or possiblylonger butumyou know you write a lot of reallyinterestingthings about bitcoin but also you're soauthentic in your writing and you youshare a lot of the sentiments or youexpress a lot of the sentiments that ithink a lot of us shareand so um you know i'mlike everybody else i'm trying to figureout what this thing is and what it meansfor us as individuals and what it meansfor us as uh you know civilization andhumanity and so i thoughtmaybe we should get together and try tofigure some of that out together yeahthat sounds wonderful i'm trying tofigure it out too and i think i thinkthere are so many of us who are whomaybe first heard about bitcoin andthought it was a new kind of money andthat that's all it was and now yearslater we're realizing it's so much morethan money it's uh it's it's scaffoldingfor a new civilizationit'sit's something that changes your spiritand your time horizons and it and it'ssomething that you see beauty in andhelps you see beauty come back out of itand really see the potential of thehuman spirit so it's um it's becomesomething bigger and it's alwayswonderful to talk to someone else who'scurious about those same topics ratherthan to talk about price predictions forexample right right absolutely i meanyeah at this point i mean i reflected onthis with a number of friends recentlybutthe economic case is pretty ironclad forme and i'm not that intrigued by it likei like to keep up on the goings-onbecause in this day and ageyou know wherever pretty much anywhereyou live you have to be adaptable youhave to be aware of how things arechanging so that you can you know planaccordingly but that the the economicargument is pretty ironclad for mewhat's what's interesting to me isthe phenomenon of the individualtransformations that are taking placeand how that feeds into the emergence ofa new culture that's the real like whythe hell is that happening sort ofquestion and uh you know you mentionedthis is more than just about money andof course i agreebut you could also say it in another wayand sayyou know this is more than just a simpleupgrade to money oran up an upgrade to money is far morethanwhat it sounds like you know so i thinkwhat's happening here is we'reredefining what money even is and we'regoing to greatly expand the horizon ofour previous understanding yeah i thinksaying this is more than just aboutmoney can be flipped around to say moneyis more than just about consumptionmoney is about purpose and directionit's capital forwhat it is that you are trying toachieve in this world or how you grouppeople together into a team a company umto make amazing things happen how youstring companies together to cooperatewith one another to make something evengreater happen than not not one of thosecompanies uh could could make happen somoney is just so much more thanlamborghinis or you know uh wastefulspending indulgence money is aboutcoordinationand and achievement things that we can'tcooperation co-creation it's about thesethings that we can't otherwise do andwe're finally realizing that at this atthis fundamental honest level becausebitcoin is this fundamentally honestmoney that puts work ahead of anygamesmanship it's got nothe game has no loopholes where somepeople get to print money for nothingand other people have to work for for itlike everyone has to work for bitcoinuh the miners have to work for it andthe rest of us have toearn it um in one way or another so itit it doesenlighten us and and really reframe whatwe thinkof money because we've grown up in ageneration or two ofmoney is aboutuhlike celebrity lifestyle lifestyles ofthe rich and famous not about lifestylesof the hard-working and productivelifestyles of the creative andintelligentandand that's what money is really for themoney comes fromnot people who flaunt wealth and spendit and produce nothing money comes frompeople who create wealth and who havepowerful ideas thatallow things to exist that didn't existbeforehow and what we're gonna hopefully diveinto all that but just you know forpeople that are listening that may notbe uh familiar with you yet what what'sthethe background story about how you cameto bitcoin and you know kind of the thecoles notes rabbit hole story yeah umi ii'm 51 nowifirst heard of bitcoin in 2013 so i waslike 43 at the timeand uh i had so i was well into mycareer i'd had i had a successful careeruh in anin a media company and i'm canadian likelike you umand was working for the toronto thecompany that owned the toronto starwhich was the largest newspaper companyin the country this will be quick uh andand i joined them just when the internetwas getting started and i i played alarge role in their internet ventures iwas there the day we launched thewebsite i launched a number of uhinternet companies for them i ended upbeing the president of their digitaldivision and i ended up umbeing heartbroken about it and resigningin 2012 because i just didn't see eye toeye with a new ceo who had been put inwhowho at the time i viewed as just acaretaker of the old business and notaligned with the vision of the new and iwas lost for years after that i thoughtit would be easy to land on my feetagain and just start upmore businesses but it turned out itturned out to be harder than i thoughtthere were still lots of peoplei was able to get jobs but i wasn't ableto get anything that really made me feelfulfilled but earlin 2013 i found myself in doing privateequity like so many people who have hadsuccessful careers end updoing them and i had been evaluatingcompaniesfor much of my career as well because ihad run corporate development for thiscorporation which was investing in lotsof other companies and managing thecompany strategy and i used to have thisjoke i've told it on a couple of otherpodcasts when people would come in andpitch their business to me they'd have apowerpoint and they'd take me throughtheir powerpoint they said what do youthink my business is worth and i wouldjokingly say somewhere between zero andall the money in the worldand uh in 2013 a friend uh who i'd onlyever met online i hadn't even spoken tohim like we were just on reddit we weretexting back and forth and i hadn't yetbeen on our slash bitcoin because ihadn't even heard of bitcoin uh but wewere in a we're in a philosophysubreddit and he said have you heard ofbitcoin i said no and i think hedirected me to the white paper and iread the white paper and i was i knew ididn't understand everything in it likei did i didn't understand this part withthe equations on itbut i understood a lot of it and i waslike oh my god this is either going tobe zero or all the money in the worldandand i just kept and and i saw that theni became closer friends with this personwe spoke endlessly just as i drove to iused to listen to philosophy audiobooksand then i just would get on the phonewith him and talk with him about bitcoinbecause there was so little content atthe time and we talked about bitcoin foryears and i was like well bitcoin beworth it makes sense a single bitcoinwill be worth many homes because there'sgonna be many more homes in the worldthan there are bitcoins and just iremember all of these earlyconversations and trying to understandwhat digital signatures were and so i'vebeen very much involved in bitcoin likeobsessed with bitcoin you know myfriends and wife used to make fun of meif you were imitating tomorrow you justput on a dummy's voice intobitcoin right like i was just that thatkind of obsessed that was like the onlything many of us can relateright that was the only word that cameout of my mouth and uh in the block sizewars i started uhbecoming a contributor in the communityi was i was anonymous or pseudonymousand i wrote a lot of essaysin our slash bitcoin at the time infavor of people running the uasfthe user activated software client whichwas going to force the miners to run thesegwit activating version of bitcoinbecause they weren't signaling it notenough for signaling in favor of it toactivate it and that was um and that wasthe first time i started really tryingto speakum to bridgebetween the people who had a hightechnical understanding of bitcoin andthe people who didn't the people whowere bitcoiners but but didn't knowenough and and and i had one essay itwasn't like super popular or anythingbut it was one that i thought was veryvaluable because i ended up managing toexplain to all the people who weresaying why is it important that we runthe uasf is it to signal something it'slike what's the reason i said what youareand it occur the penny dropped for meit's like if you run this piece ofsoftware which will start rejecting anyblocks for miners that don't signal infavor ofactivating segwit on august 1st if iremember my dates correctlyit's basically letting them know thatyou're going to boycott their blocksright this is an economic boycott and weall take and if only one or two of usboycotts these blocks we won't win butif all of us signal to them and showthem that we are running software thisis no bluff it will startdiscarding their blocks that they workedso hard to create and they will not gettheir block reward and it will not beadded to the blockchainthatthat this is why we all have to pulltogether and so that essaywas reasonably successful for me on onreddit and i ended up being beinguhasked to become a moderator of our slashbitcoin which which i accepted but idon't really do much moderation i don'treally do any moderation on thereum but that was for me the first timewhen i started to put myself out intothe community uh with my writing and istopped after uh i was kind of burnedout this is so many of us were it waslike it was a non-stop task when youposted one of these essays on reddit youhad a millionfloodsters and liars andbig blockers and corporate chills andethereans liketrying to spin it the other way so itwas and we weren't really mature interms of knowing that we would win wedidn't have a lot of confidence so itwas exhausting and i think i got someminor form of between having left myprevious career and fight fighting inthe blocks i were i was left with a fairbit of ptsd and it wasn't until i thinkfebruary of this year that i said okayi'm i'm going tostart writingas actively as i can about bitcoin andjust really commit my life to bitcoin ii had lost my other job at the timebecause of the covert restrictions i wasworking for a company that really feltthe hit and ii've terminated myself i was presidentof the company at the time and we had tolet some people go so i i made sure iwas one of themand uh and and it wasn't easy to findsomething else and but i just felt iloved bitcoin so much and the timing wasrightso i started writing about bitcoinandyou know thisjourney of understanding bitcoinand you know this may sound weird tosome but being in relationship with itand having it transform you is is neverending right and right we may some of usmay be able to demarcate certain pointswhere you know the penny really droppedin certain regards but i think we'd allprobably admit that it's it's non-stopyou know we haven't none of us havefound the bottom of the rabbit holequite yet yeah and so when when thatpoint happened in february and youdecided to make that shift i meani can only assume that that relationshipwith bitcoin has intensified since thenbecause you're spending more time on ityou're thinking about it more you'rewriting you're engaging more what's itbeen like for you personally in terms ofhow you've changed how you think aboutthings since since going full-timebitcoin let's sayyeah um well it's like i finallyprofessed my lovetothisbeing that i've that i've that i'd lovedfor years and it has accepted my loveand uh and it welcomed me and andit asked me to prove my love right itdidn't just say like it i startedwriting and i was inspired by it and istarted writing more and i startedwriting more quickly andand thenother bitcoinersshowed that they support supported mywriting and i i actually had this umthis view this exact line word for wordin my in my mind when i started this isaid if i take care of bitcoin bitcoinwill take care of meand and so i went into this thing nottrying to take care of myself but tryingto take care of bitcoin to the extentthat i could clarifying confusion aboutit helping people understand it helpingit be in this world and and beinga spokesperson for it um an honestspokesperson for it not shillinguntruths about it that would somedayunravel and you know even if i'd saidsome good things about it but then itold a lie about it people say well youknow he said these other things but itturned out he was lying about this so itwas i i felt a serious responsibility tosay only the true things about it but tosay things in ways as i had with theessay that i mentioned to you back in2016tosay things in ways thatpeople who were not technical couldunderstand to bring to bring it down toearth andand in surrendering myself to theservice of bitcoina lot of ideas began to pop into my mindii'd say like i umsomehow some idea popped into my mindthat i would write really shortarticles about all these differentfacets of bitcoin rather than try towrite one big thing to give all thereasons for bitcoin and so i ended upsaying i end up saying i'm gonna writethis series called why bitcoinum and each article the gimmick was eacharticlewould begin with why bitcoin right likethat and so like why bitcoin or like orwith the word y and have the word whychoose bitcoin why bitcoin relies onenergy to create new coins why bitcoinis supported by the laws of physics whyit's the most important thing in theworldum and i did i didn't really know allthe ideas that i had but i was i in atelegram group i announced that i wasdoing thisit wasn't a huge telegram group it hadabout 100 people but people were reallyenthusiastic about it and they gave metons and tons of ideasand so i just had a google doc with allthese titles andand i sat down to write it one day andnothing really came to me so i would youknow i was i i didn't get upset about iti just said now is not the time i wentto sleep that night and i woke up atthree a.m in the morning with the firstarticle like it had come to me in mysleep right so this i i credit i cancredit my subconscious to it but i canalso credit my connection to bitcoin toit and bitcoinsaid here's their first article and itwas called it's it's the first articlein the why bitcoin series which iscalled why choose bitcoin and it andwhat i think differentiates it from somany of the other articles that say wellwhy should you choose bitcoin which i'llsay well it's fungible it's divisibleit's supply capped it's cryptographicit's secure it's like all this litany ofreasons and then each one is hard toexplain why it is it was just a simplereason that came to me and it wasbecause bitcoin asks you to choose itbitcoin doesn't force you to use itunlike the dollar and bitcoin can becomebetterto earn your choicebecause it's software unlike gold whichcan't change and that was it that'sthat's pretty much the summary of thewhole article but bitcoin needs to earnbillions of people's choice and so it'sgot to be so good but it can be whereaseverything else that contendsyou know the dollaror the peso or whateveryou don't choose it there's a gunpointed at your head or you're born intoit right andand if you and you might you must if youdon't accept it you're violating a lawand the police will come and arrest youright because it's the it's legal tenderbitcoin is something you choose and youmight have to fight to use it on top ofthat so it better be really good rightthere's something that's free to use andif you don't use ityou might go to jail and there'ssomething thatyou have to choose and you have to studyand you have to understand but that'sthat's what's going to win at the end ofthe day i felt and and that began the umand that and then i was able to workwith some of the titles that had beenshared with me every now and thenplucking one off and and writing it andsometimes it would just come to meumi think the second one i was i was justwalking in the forest and umand i i have a really nice forest herein in canada and it was uh it was notyet springtimeand uh i i i somehow felt like incommunion with the treesand and they were laughing they weresaying you think you're in canada what ajoke we've been here since beforecanada's justyou humans make drawings of the earthwhich aren't the real earth and then youdraw lines on the drawings and you saythat's something that's real it's notreal this the forest is real and it'sbeen here since before canada and itwill be here after canada andif you want bitcoin to be here aftercanada that's you can now understand whybitcoin relies on the laws of physicsto keep running not on any state'sexistence and and that was like thesecond article because these things areforever they never change they'rethey're permanent and because that's allbitcoin needs is for the laws of physicsto remain constantit'll run forever so bitcoin willoutlast nations um it'llit'll just outlast there it'll it'll behere for humans for as long as humansneed money and so these profoundthat feels really profound to me rightand was very serious and very real umthatyou know money's country's money comesand goes the roman empire's money isnot worth anything anymore but the romanempire did amazing things but bitcoinsfor the ages it's forever it really willlastall that long because it continues tooperate and get betterit gets better with human mindsimproving it and agreeing all that it isa choice that all of us want to makeand it continues to run because the lawsof physics continue to rununchangingly soand so it just you know and and istarteduh continuing to surrender to surrenderdeeper and deeper into this thing andand my certain milestones happened likei was sharing these articles and then iwas invited to appear on a podcast herein a podcast there and somebodyprominent would share one of my articleshere or there and it just started togrow and i started to spend more of mytimewith otherwith other bitcoiners and start andreally listening and and my ambitions tobecomemore of a spokesperson for bitcoinincreased and and i felt the only way todo that is to understand it betterthere's no other way i'm not i i wasnever tempted to say well let me justbuild an audience of followers by makinga big bold price prediction uh and thenand then turn out to be wrong becausenobody really knows these things rightlike i do have a price prediction anddollar termsbut it's not by date it's just it'sinfinity by some point in time rightlike it's going that's the only let'ssee right the dollar is going away thedollar's going to zero andand and bitcoins notso that so it's going to you knowsomething overuh zero is infinity and that's andthat'sand that's what's happening but that'sthat's not what people are interested inhearing right because there's traderswho are like should i buy now should ibuy in a week should i wait for whatshould i wait for the price to dropnobody knows rightum i wanted to really get at thesetruths about bitcoin that were much moreimportant and as each time i foundanother one of these things and itworked its way into my brainwell all these other connections wouldstart to happen and then that would leadto the nextthe next thing and somebody wouldpropose some really interesting thing imean there were so many thingsinteresting things happening this yearit's hard to even it's hard to evenbelieve that all this stuff isit's a little over a year old now rightlike i think when michael saylor firststarted getting involved and talkingabout his ideas about energy and bitcoinbeing a wall of energy and encryptedenergy and the use of energy and a userenergy that started a whole line ofthinking uh that became there andthere's all these ideas around bitcoinbeing very lifelikeit'sit's not alive in the sense that you andi are in one sense because it can't diebut it it did need to come to life itdidn't need to go into existence and itneeds to use energy to continue to growand it does continue to grow andi've got some really fun pieces ofwriting that that one hasn't beenpublished yet but will be in aboutin less than a month about um looking atbitcoin as though it were alive and anda living thing through the ages likebitcoin's gonna outlive you and meright in the same way that you and me idon't know if you have any pets but youand like we outlive our dogs right likeyou know five or six generations of dogscould live for us and if they would lookat us they'd say wow look at how longlived and how smart and powerful thatbeing iswe kind of have this view like i havethis i look up at bitcoin and say wowlook at this being that'suh so indestructible and so honest andso capable and and so enduring that it'sgoing to outlive me and my kids and mygrandkids and and protect us it's likeyou know it so i don't want to say thatwe're it's pets we are caretakers andproviders for there's a mutual respectuh relationship but butwe used to have relationships with dogswhere they were working dogs right likethey weren't just pets to be fed thereason we have the relationships withdogs that we do have is they wereshepherds and they were hunters and theywereumretrievers right like that's what that'swhat they're making naming thegerman shepherd the golden retriever theyeah pointers uh and soum so we kind of have this also this uhsymbiotic relationship with thislife-likething already which is profoundi was just like you know i've tried notto use that word too much during thisinterview no problem you know it'sinteresting to hearyour experience of kind of going outintointo nature which you know i've alwaysconsidered the forest or nature likemy church right because it'sit's truthful it isit is bare truth and you know to myyou know my spirituality for lack of abetter term i guess has always beenreally grounded in in in truth and notto discredit umthe existing traditions because i thinkthere's a tremendous amount of wisdom inthem albeit possibly misinterpreted bymany many adherents but the point justthat i wanted to make was thatbecause and i canrelate to this experience because whenyou kind ofyou know whether you want to say commitcommit submit you know whatever tobitcoin you say this is going to be thething that i devote myself to to tryingto understand to contributing to tointegrating in various waysa clarity reallywashes over your perspective right andit kind of a lot of the noisegets drowned out and the things whichareof greatest importance rise to the topand crystallize veryin in a in perhaps a way that's neverhappened to you before andwhat hap you know what then happens isyour your perception iswell one it's far more clear and one ofthe things that i've always strived foris in you know if you're genuinelyseeking truth then i think one of themainmethods by which you do that is you tryto see with clarity right you try todeclutter the mind you try to removeyourself and your influence and yourbiases and your prejudices and yourdelusionsout of your perception to start to tryto see as as truthfully as possibleand bitcoin seems to bea mechanism or a totem or a prismthat permits that to happen andonce it places you in thatframe of mind[Music]thethe incidences oflet's say insightright that you seem to be experiencingnowregularly as a result of like i shouldwrite about this because this thisinsight came to me and i think it'sworthwhile of worthworthwhile toexplain further they seem to happen moreand more and more and more to the pointwhere as you said right at the beginninglikeyou want to contribute to this thing butit'si don't know it's it's it's difficult toto articulate but like the the the wayopens up let's say that like when youwhen you decide to commit to exploringand integrating this thingthe clarity that's established and thepurpose that that emerges becomes farmore clearer and i think in your writingcertain pieces that's very clear becauseyou're you'reyou're sofocused on and aligned with anddedicated to articulatingsome of the you know the highestprinciples that this thing seems toeither emit or uh elicit in people whichis honesty which is integrity which istruthfulness which is fairnessyou know andyou know it's it's fascinating how ittransforms your perspective i guess isthe main point there yeah i i think youknow the world is this torrent ofactivity there's all this stuffhappening around you all the time and alot of it isfeels chaotic and you don't know whatthe truth is in general because there'sthere's institutions and other peoplewho's who aren't as interested in thetruth or who are actually interested ina particular narrative which is justanother word fora lie quite often right it's it's ifthis were true this would benefit meright like if it were true that you hadto buy my company's productso much so that actually your governmenthad to legislate you buying my productand if you didn't buy it they'd arrestyou right soand people weave these tails and theyand we're watching them manifestthemselves in front of us and and you'resitting there looking and saying well iknow that that's false i know thatthere's falsehoods in there but where doi look for truth where can i grab on tosome truththat isn't in the control of somebodywhose incentivesjust are to distort the truth to servetheir purposes and lo and beholdyou can grab onto this thingbitcoin is something that nobodycontrolsitstruth right like it is true that whenyou hash something enough times you geteventually get a low enough number andit is true that the code runs the way itdoes and it is true that it thatand then you start to see other truthslike so you you finally in like imaginemyself in this storm like there's ahurricane and i've been blowing aroundand is blowing around everywhereand there's a chair coming at me and acow flying at me that's what it's liketo live in the world today and then yougrab onto this thing and you can hold onto it and you have your feet firmlyplanted in the ground all of a suddenandand there's a stable point of referenceand from that stable point of referenceyou can start to look at other thingstoo like you can start to look and saywell that other thing that we use ismoney hold on a minutethere's people printing it left rightand center and keeping it for themselvesand using it to cover up to paper overfor the mistakes that they made thatdoesn't seem right and fairand umand i have worked all my life and i hadto work for my money but these peopledon't have to work for it and there's noway to tell apart what my money is fromwhat their money is there's somethingwrong there that why is it wrongthere's a notion of fairness right whyshould they not have to work and i dohave to work and and what is work rightandlike work is where things come from solike i have to make things in the realworld and they don't have to make thingsin the real world so they get to take myreal things in the real world becausethere's no there's no things in the realworld other than the things that thoseof us who have to work for it make andwe're still holding on because they'retelling us different stories they'resaying let us print money and and if wedo everything will be okay you'll berich we'll be rich it's all it's all foreverybody's good and you're like holdingon to this thing and you're saying no ican tell that that's a lie that's yournarrative that and and that and and andthis so this is the thing bitcoinallows us to and we we start of courselooking at the money thing and we startto look at austrian economics but thenwe start to get involved in so manyother things it's like wait why does whyis the food not taste the way it didwhen i was youngerwhy is everybody gaining weight why iseverybody sedentary why is everybodyfeeling depressed this wasn't the way itused to bewhat changed and and you suddenly seeeverybody's obsessed with money there'sa fight over money that didn't existbefore people people just wanted thenecessities and we want to go out intothe street and play street hockey andstreet baseball that's what the kidswanted we didn't want to show off fancytoys or fancy like there's no such thingas fancy shoes when we werekids the designer i remember the firsttime someone had a designer shirt thelacoste shirt or designer jeans thedroid ash jeans it was so bizarre andand this was the creeping in of thisfiat mindset where it just made no sensethat this person should bevalid like we valued each other asfriends for each other's sense of humorand sharing these common things and nowwe're supposed to value them becausethere's aalligator sewn into their shirt thisdoesn't make any sense this is anothernarrativeandand all this timewe were we started to wash away from thetruth it because all the other the powerof the knowledge of the discipline ofmarketing and advertising distorted likethe whole point of it is to change yourmind with emotional images of you willbe happy if you buy this product whichturns out to be the biggest lie of alllike the happiness doesn't come frombuying a product and showing it off inother people's face look at my jeansbrook shields wore my gene i wore thesame jeanslike it'stheand soi we finally grab on to bitcoin andwhenever we do and and it's shelter fromthis storm of lieswell it's the light of truth in manyways which again like we cannot avoidseeping in you know wandering intoreligious language when we talk aboutthis thing these days and not you knowi make no apologies at this pointbecausethe more i do so the more apt it seemsbut in this particular caseit just is true that theevery truth is a judge and you might saythat the greatest truths are thegreatest judges and the contrast thatsuch an open bearabsolute truth like bitcoincreates withanything that's less truthful let's sayis so now apparent and that's why it canbe that totem right so when you look outinto the world and you listen to theseeither incompetent or coward uh cowardlyor uhcrookedcrookedlying dishonest politicians or companiesor whomeverit'snot you know to many of us that was aparent before butyou didn't have likethe team back the team of truth backingyou up you know you're kind of justawash in the all these lies with no realway to to pierce them and now there isthat thing to pierce them there's thethe light that shines on them and saysthat'sand you know you you are lying you aredishonest you are cowardly you areincompetent one or all of those thingsand now that we have this thing that notonly kind of as you integrate it intoyour own perception helps you seethe representation of of untruthwherever it may be but it's actually atool to dissolve it actively right andwhat it's doing in the culture isactually coming for untruth anddissolving it as it spreads through ityeah what did and another meta like we iwas going to give a metaphor of a treebut i think i'm going to give themetaphor if it's it's the brick housethat the little pig of the three littlepigs it's the brick it's the brick housethat's sheltered that the big bad wolfcan't blow down right like when we stepinto bitcoin the big bad wolves outthere they can huff and they can puffbut they can't blow bitcoin down andthey can't blow down our conviction uhbehind behind this thing and so it'sreally it really is powerful like weused to be scared of them we used to belike the little piggy in thein the house made of grass or the housemade of uh hay and or the house made ofwood sticks we just didn't have thepower they they terrified us and now westand in this brick house and they andthey huff and they puff and we laugh atthemand they can huff and they puff all theywant and we're inside and they say letme in and we say not by the hair of ourchinny chin chins you cannot get mybitcoinleota dot gifright yeah exactly like we're yeahthat's exactly with our laser eyeslaughing laughing at the most like i'mlaughing at the president of the unitedstates of america and certainly at theprime minister of canada andi'm laughing at them because their wordsare stupid their ideas are silly they'reentirely unconvincing and theirstupidity doesn't terrify me i because ihave hopethat i can build something with and andi actually have a tremendous tremendousamount of sympathyfor the people who don't see bitcoinbecause they don't seethey don't see the brick house theyhaven't stepped into it they are on therun they are being chased by the big badwolves and many of themand the wolf is charming in this caseright it says don't worry i'm here tohelp you it's like the wolf in littlered riding hood you know dressed up asthe grandma it's like my what big teethyou have well my what amount of moneyyou've printed oh they're better to makeyou rich with and my what uhlike what are you saying what big bombsyou haveyeah oh protected they're better toprotect you with right um so it likeand it isand and if we're switching stories tolittle red riding hood bitcoin is theact of the hunter with the axe who comesanddestroys the big bad wolfand uh and so it's like all of thesewonderful uh children's fables can befound we can apply them in a sense tobitcoin because so many of them areaboutrealizingumseparating the good from the evil andletting the good defeat the evil andrecognizing the good i i'm i'm so moveduh at times i'm going to get a tattoo ofa black swanbecause i'm so moved by the story of theugly duckling which for people who don'tknow it there's a story of a ducklingwho was born and was uglier than theother ducks and they all made fun of himand uh and it turned out he was abeautiful swan at the end right likethat's a spoiler a happy ideaand uh and so many of us outcasts rightlike this the rest of civilizationhas laughed like i was always anoutsider um in my career i was pushingfor these things i was in a newspapercompany pushing for embracing theinternet which was destroying theinternet and all these kind of things iwas referred to as a black sheep but i ifelt more like the ugly duckling andthen we have this notion of a black swanevent which is it there are black swansthey're rare um and they're even morebeautiful than white swans andand i think that the combination of ofthese two ideas um of the fact that it'sa it is beautiful even though it mightbe ostracized in its early days and it'srare and special and exceptionalis just a wonderfuluh combination of these two thingsand uhand so i i mean we could probably ihaven't really thought about this i thefirst time i thought about the threelittle pigs and uh and the big bad wolfof red riding hood was here now butin this which is exactly what you whatyou alluded to right when we start toput our heads together in dialogue newthings come up and and so i'm reallyenjoying this conversation we'll see thethe the interesting thing is is that allof those stories are archetypal in asense that's why they resonate they'respeaking to elements of our consciousand unconscious mindsthat appeal to the most profound or mostmoving truths right so whenyou know these stories that are aboutcourage and triumph and truth and goodversus evil likeit's not by accident that those are theones that populate ourcosmos of storytelling it's because theyappeal to ustheyresonate and draw something from us andthey animate our spirit they say yeslikethat is the truth that i want to existin the world now also they can beweaponized against you right becausethey can pacify you in a way they can bethe wizard of oz sort ofnarrative where they say welllet's i'm going to show you thisstory that makes you feel good and makesyou feel that you know good hastriumphed over evil there's nothing toworry about but behind the scenes i'mgoing to manipulate you right and ithink you could broadly say that thatcharacterizes our time and just back tothat notion ofof what howhow bitcoin is that kind of light oftruth and also how it tends to changepeople is i think prior to to blockingbitcoin and of course prior to bitcoin'sexistencea lot of people that were critical ofthe status quo let's sayhad resigned themselves in various waysi know that was the case for me you knowi always been critical of many of thethings we often discuss in bitcoingovernment and monetary system and allthat kind of stuffand like your your main play there wasto be a gold bug and that's no funbecause you're basically just waitingfor the end of the world and think wellat least i'll have some gold it's likeyeah well who gives a who's gonnawant it when the world is thereumand and that was really unhealthy for melike if i look look back in hindsightum i just was not livingthe life that i wanted to be living iwasn't holding myself accountable to theideals and the principles thati think are most valuable to holdoneself accountable toand that manifested in my happiness andmy situation in life and all of thesethings and because what else you gonnado if you if you recognize such a biginsurmountableuh insidious problemand don't have the tools to combat itand that's why part of the reason why ithink bitcoin is so transformativebecause you no longer have to res notonly to your point not only do you nothave to resign yourself but now you canlaugh at the circumstance that you'reyou're confronting because there'ssomething there's almost you're on theside of the unstoppable thing now rightand i know there's assumptions wrappedup in that and it's good not to beuh you know too hubristic in in yourconfidence and stuff but it certainlyinvigorates the spirit whensomething exists with the principlesthat you believe to be the most rightand good and valuable principles likehonesty truth integrity freedom and toknow that thosethey're not just ideas that you can holdto help you guide you through the chaosof life but it's actually an instrumentthat you can use to create that life outin the world and others can use to dothe sameandyou know thatthat dramatically changes yourexperience day to day well it i'm justlistening to you i'm saying you knowwe've got a few things on our side we'vegot the truth on our sidewe've got morality on our side fairnessand we've gotpower on our side like this thing isstrong like and we've got the strengthon our side with this so we should behappy we should be laughing atliars who are weakand immoralthey're gonna they're they should theythey are self-destructing right likeit's what it's one of these uh kind ofhard insights to have thatwe did build beautiful institutions inliberal western democracy especially atthe early state likeyou know what thewhat thefathers of the united states puttogether at the time of the revolutionwas extraordinary and they tried tobuild all these checks and balancesto protect the individualandand prevent government from beingcorruptedand so they had the three branches ofgovernment but we we already see thatthe separation of powers isn't like apresident should of the united statesshould not be able to run and say i'mgoing to pass it i'm going to createthis law like that's not your job youryour job as the executive is to executea law that congressuh creates that the legislature createsyou're not supposed to write lawsbut everybody has it in their head thatyou vote for a president who's going tomake laws and every president everyonewho runs for presidenttalks about the laws that they're goingto make like they're not even remotelyattached tothe principles of what their job issupposed to be as described in theconstitution of of the country um and sowe've what we've seen is this gradualerosion of the institutions throughthrough forms of corruption andand i like i remember the first time ithink i was in grade eight or maybegrade seven when a in history class ateacher told us about the differentforms of government and they said wellat the time because at the timecommunism was still a big part of theworld right i was 19uh82 when i was in grade 8 or 83 orsomething right so uh the soviet unionwas still together and all of easterneurope was was run by theseauthoritarians or they told us aboutauthoritarianism and totalitarianism itold them about democracy and they saidyou know the ancient greeks didn't thinkdemocracy was a particularly good formof government it was kind of the lastform of government in a city statebefore it collapsed and the reason thatthey didn't think it was good wasbecause you just had the mob ruledemocracy is the rule of the majoritywhich is the world of mob and it alwaysled to collapse and people thought thatan aristocracy at the time was reallygood and aristocracies were named afteraristotle who was the highest thinkernone of this really made a ton of senseto me at the time i just thought it wasinteresting but i went and studiedpolitical science in my first couple ofyears of university and i was really andthat was when communism was falling allover the world right1989 was my first year of university andthe nations were like i was i wasleaving on the uhlecterns of my communist professors uharticles of like you know they justexecuted ceausescu right likethey put the dictator up against thewall and shot him uh for his crimesagainst humanity that's that's whatthat's what you're espousing here and iwas very proud of western liberaldemocracy and it was and it was goodright like we lived free andand for the most part umpeople were reasonably healthy and asnew things were being discovered we wererationally integrating them into ourcivilization cures for diseases werebeing found and improvements toautomobiles were made and somebodyinvented the home video game console andlike society was just progressing nicelyit wasn't thisorgy of consumption people hadn't gottenunhealthy to a great degree right likethe bigthe big controversy was should you smokeor not and you know should we pass nosmoking laws indoors right it used to belike you knowwe tend to have a youngergroup of bitcoiners but you know what imy first job people smoked indoors inthe office like and you sat next if youwere a non-smoker you sat next tosomebody and so this was kind of thisfirst controversy ofi think i think people might relate toit today right like you don't want tosit next to a smoker and eventually thesmokers weren't allowed to smoke indoorsat all and now they have to go outsidein the cold and smokethis was this was a this was the rightissue at the timeand and we ended up saying you knowsecondhand smoke is dangerous so youcan't smoke around somebodyand i mean that has beenlike i'm certainly athousand percent opposed to forcedvaccinations i just want to say thatthat because what i'm about to say mightmake somebody think that i'm not butit's like this notion of well if you'reif you're smoking and and you'reexhaling smoke that might be dangerousto somebody beside you it's it'sactually okay to tell them not to smokewhile they're beside you right it's notit's not okay to cut out their tonguesor you know mask them or put up theirlines right it's it's not well see iwould i would i would take a differentapproach on that i thinkthis fall like presumably you're in aroom an office a restaurant that's ownedby somebody so i think the owner of theproperty sets the rulesand if you if you as an individualdon't smokeand people are smoking in there and youwant to go hang out there then that'syour choice yeah andand i think this does lead to ultimatelypeoplerealizing that they have to work witheach other not just dig in their heelsand say my way or the highway right likeultimately you get to some compromiseyou say you know we're gonna have asmoking roomright and and this was the i rememberearly in my career this was thesettlement like at theat the cafeteria at the toronto starwhere i worked right right there was thecompa the building smoking room and itwas like through glass doors and peoplewent in there and the smokers went inthere and smoked and they could smokeyear-round indoors and the restaurantsalways looked horrible because there'sso much smoke behind the glass you knowthing and you're like oh god it wasn'tthat important for a time too right incanadayeah like it wasn't an advertisement forsmoking but it was people had reached asensibleliving together it wasn't it wasn't thatthe smokers and the non-smokers had tobe at each other's throats and had topass laws to restrict each other'smovements and choices and options andand that's what we just need nowis like let's live in peace with oneanother we're not nobody's trying tohurt anybody elseyeah and if you want to keep yourdistance keep your distance if you wantit's the toronto starsthey're playing to their incentives ifthey say no we're not segregating thecafeteria anyone can smoke anywhere theywant how much talent will they lose thatpeople don't want to work in a workplaceso they do what's best for theirobjectives and people voluntarily chooseto participate or not and and that'sthat's how it should work not mandatedfrom on high by one central sourcemandating morality mandating healthmandating all sorts of thingsyou know and that's how far we've fallenand i think part of what you weregetting at here isthe issue is thatas you said you know particularly in theu.s the founding fathers i mean the thetremendous wisdom uh that they codifiedinto those founding documentsis rea i mean incredibly impressive butthe problem is isthere was noyou know they tried to build in checksand balances of various kinds but theywere still just rules and what we seemto be in today is a a place wherethese rules that were put down and thateveryone kind of agreed to be theguiding principles and absolute bedrockof the societyare no longer impervious to narrative ifit's powerful enough and what thesociety seems to be today iswhichever narrative most plays on theemotions of most people is the truth andthat is so incredibly dangerous and itdoesn't seem to matterthese absolutes that were formallyagreed upon they can easily be pushedaside if the narrative has asufficiently strong emotional resonanceand one of the things that is soencouraging about bitcoinand it may be the case that it's it'sthe first umsocial absolutethe first enforceable social absolutethat we've ever hadwhich is just a mind-blowingly amazingsort of thing and and how that's gonnahow society and culture and people willcoalesce around that absolute aslife itself coalesces around absolutesisis one of the things that i think getsus so excited about this butyou know i i think that and that'sthat's the interesting tension happeningtoday we have the emergence of a socialabsolute that you opt into and as yousay you choose it andyou know you abide by the rules of thatabsolute and then simultaneously we havethe breakdownand theyou know the umthe casting away of all formerrules or attempts at absolutesin favor of emotional narrative and youmight say you know if you look at thisfrom a kind of psychologicalpsychological perspective you might saythat this is kind of a falling back intothe unconscious you know all that alltheall the structures we've built up toconstruct you know a conscious mind thathelps us navigate the world and interactwith one anotherthe the precepts of that we've kind ofdissolved back into the unconscious andwe're kind ofnow in this mass mind sort of uhhysteria or neurosis and that's thethat's the tension happening today andit's very clear in in the bitcoinecosystem bitcoin community you havefree thinking people who you know wantto interact voluntarily who accept therules of this game and who end up beingyou know transformed by the principlesthat are inherent in this game as isprobably always the case when you acceptcertain rules of the game versuspeople that are basically the exactopposite it's it's pure narrative it'snot grounded in truth and it is by nomeans absolute and andyeahyeah exactlyyou know i i'm i'm somewhat inclined togo back to the story of the three littlepigs when you when you say this becausethat story takes place oversome very short period of time you knowbut imagine if it actually takes placeover a much longer period of timesomebody builds their civilization outof strawand it lasts up until some period oftime where the challenges to theircivilization they build abasic democracy without a individualrights constitution andit operates it for time until the windsget strong enough until the big bad wolfcomes around which is the the mob votingthethe minority the majority voting theminorities rights away and thatcollapses and then you get the americaninstitution which is they build astronger house out of wood which is ademocracy which is also a republic whichprotect which has a bill of rights andit protects the individual rights butthose rights eventually but then the bigbad wolf all these narratives come andthey blow downthe rights and they blow down theinstitutions because while they held for200 yearseventually they wore outand we see that enough psychopaths tookenough jobs in the government andlegislature andall the incentives to write all theselaws and vote all these expenses in andof course the fiat moneytotalitarianism comes in and so my moneyceases to be money and now thegovernment becomes all powerfulbecause they control they control moneyand that house blows is blowing down andthat's what we're watching right nowwe're watching that house blow down andthenwe buildwe need to build something stronger wecan't rely on a bill of rights toprotect our rights anymore becausethere's just too much narrative and toomuch people have figured out the evil inthe world has figured out how to violatethat the big bad wolf has figured outhow to violatethe sanctity and the beauty of whatamerica stood for and what it wascreated forand and what so many other nationsacross the world imitatedandso and now we've seen this birth of thisnew thing which it is a different billof rights it's not it's not just rulesit's rules enforced inunbreakable code that everybody runs onconsensus that requires real energy tosupport and now this is stronger thanany wind and anybody can blow right likeit and it's clear exactly how much windit takes to blow down this thing youneed more power you need more wind thaneverybody else doing all the miningblowing together at the same time allright like that's the 51 attack so youneed to have more energyto just that's and that's the only waywe can think of right now that we knowto evenyou know and it doesn't blow down thewhole house if you have 51 like it blowsdown one break the last block that wasadded to the house at a time you need ifyou want to destroy 10 blocks you needmore energy than was laid down for thelast 10 blocks and this house keepsgetting built one more brick block every10 minutes on average with even moreenergy behind that block and the abilityto blow it down so we've got somethingreally strong it doesn't now it doesn'tprotect you or me physically right ifyou and i were together and we got intoa fist fight we'd get hurt even if eventhough we own bitcoinbutthe thethe achilles heelobviously in america and and the rest ofthe world turned out to be the moneyright it turned out to be that when youseized all the money and made it allinto paper and gave yourself power toprint it that was the only industryin an otherwise free marketthat had to beseat captured bythe by politicstocause the situation that we're seeingnow which is the the collapse of thethe collapse of that civilizationbecause everything is about handoutsfrom the people with the power to printthe money and not about earning it andso all these everybody everybody lobbiesgovernmentto get grants because they make the casethat they're that they're what they needthe money for is a better use than whateverybody else is so we find ourselvesin the in thein the socialist plea even though weallegedly have a free a free market oryou you're free to plead your case tothe government to be included in thelatest bill which is going to hand outtrillions of dollarsofwithout anybody earning it right justfor for the right form of begging andthe right form of influence and theright form of pedal of peddling pullwithin it and and it's very sad to seeand it's very tragic and people whodon't see the brick house who don't seebitcoin are kind of terrified they theyhave two choicesthey can try to stand on integrityand watch the house blow down aroundthem or they can play the game ofblowing the house down right they cansay fine you know what i'm gonnaplead my case for the governmenthandoutsbut it but at the end of the day youcan'tthere's nothinglike the fiat money inflation is justit's empty promises if nobody is workingand nobody's creating anything and we'rejust creating illusionsor weapons to go fight wars overseaswe're just redirecting all of ourenergyaway from what it is that we really wantwhich isbase you know which is which is what wereally need in our lives umandyou say this in one of your pieces rightit and and many bitcoinersuh i think feel this way and it's likeeveryone realizes that getting intobitcoin at this stage in the adoptioncycle you're going to see your wealthgrow fairly dramatically right but thethat's not necessarily the point rightand and you touch on this as of manyothers it's the point is like whenyou'vesecuredyourwealth your you know yourformer work your life force however youwant to describe it in such animpenetrable way that neither time norspace nor attack nor whateveris going to be able to access itwhatwhat that instills the individual withis a tremendousfelt sense of liberation yes rightbecause it and it that may sound weirdto some people because like well money'smoney if i got 500 grand in equitiesversus 500 grand in bitcoin what's thebig difference and i would just say idon't really know but there is a bigdifference you know and of course theobvious stuff is like well yourbrokerage account could go down thestock you know the company could go outof business there's all sorts of waysthat that could go away that bitcoincouldn't but it's such aeven though it may seem like a minordifference like it's a huge differenceyeah but i think we've all experiencedlike when that happens yeah your entireperspective ofyou know who you are and what you wantto do with your life force you know withyour time and with your energy and yourworkexpands dramatically and then and thisis why i think we then end up digginginto ourselves and saying wow i now havethe freedom to allowthe best parts of me the things that ivalue most about myself my principlesand my values my integrity and honestyto rise to the top and now i have thefreedom to actually push those thingsout into the world because i have thisbedrock of security that i know is notgoing away and that is so transformativeit is complete and i i think i'd love tohear from you how how it's transformedyou personally i think the the biggestrealization that's stilllike it's i i'm still in the process ofhaving it dawn on me so like it justbecause it takes time to sink inabsolutely is this notion of sovereigntynot just freedom why like what's thedifference between this word it's like iam my ruler it's not that i'm free it'slike i'm i'm a ruler uhbecause thanks to bitcoin i i i decidewhat to do with my wealth and and i getto keep my wealth i have i have a domainthat is inviolable i am the king of mydomainright um which is which is my bitcoinand nobody can touch it and i can chooseto do various things with it i can spendit and send it to somebody else i thinkthe one of my favorite analogies thatlinks to this is what it means toestablish a lightning channel withsomeone right like if i open up alightning channel with you that andyou're a king and you're sovereign it isa treaty between our two kingdomsthat we willmove these satoshis that are inbetween our two kingdomsamongst one anotherwithout charging each other a fee to doso we agree on what the wealth is andwe'll do it for exchanges and i alsoagree because i have a channel open withalex vetskyumthat if you need to usemy channel as a trade our treaty as atrading route to be able to do businesswith himthen i because i entered into the treatywith him and i entered into the treatywith you that treaty is you may usemy lands as a trading route and you cansend satoshi's to him through there andnobody else in the whole worldcan violate that treaty right like theu.s government can't stop it somebodyelse who has bitcoin can't stop itsomeone who has hundreds of thousands ofbitcoin cannot stop it we havewe have sovereign dominion over ourmoneyand we choose touse it in a way that we that enablespartnership and collaboration andcommunication and trade with one anotherwe're peaceful network of kingdomsand it is a very powerful idea and ithink it is a veryreal and true idea that we have raisedourselves you know where we were slavesbefore we're slaves of thefiat system where somebody else couldsay well you can't if you want to sendmoney you got to go through the bank thecentral you know the essentialauthorities and that's the only way tosend money and they're making it harderand harder to even hand money over whereyou have to meet in person it's likewell we've we've done away with thatsystem we're free men nowand women andmachines and like intelligent robotswe're freewe're free of that system we're free ofthose obligations and we rootright we have we have trading routes uhin and amongst each other that happen atlight speed and with the same assurancesand cryptographic power that keep thatbrick house standing uh against anyamount of force that anybody wants totry to use against it and let's say andlet's say my grandkids you know we'llkeep our channels open the rest of ourlives i know i know you well enoughalready but let's say our grandkidsdon't get alongthey don't have to go to warthey just have to close the channel ifthey no longer want to deal with eachother right if they don't longer uhtrust each other your node keeps goingdown right you're not you're notresponsible enough to keep your node upit's waste of mycapital to keep it tied up in our nodewith you i'm going to peacefully shut itdown we're going to have a mutual set wedon't need a arbiter to settle thedifferences between us we certainlydon't need to go to war over it we'llbroadcast a closing transaction and ourch and our treatyis peacefully concludedand i can use those satoshis to startsomething else we really truly are andand we can be sovereignwith anybody anywhere in the world rightbitcoin is this global thing it's notjust a local phenomenon right i don'teven know where you are right now in theworld but we could exchange public keysand and open up a channel if we don'talready have one opened up with one andwith one anotherand it's serious and it's real and it'sfor generations if we want it to be forgenerations and are responsible in whatwe do with itso that you know for me this is and itcomes with responsibility right it's notoh if i mess it up i'll just you knowi'll just tell the bank oops i misplacedmy credit card right like if you if youdestroy all your backupsbecause you're careless and forget allyour passwordsyou've lost your fortune it's lost itsseas and there will probably you know beoccasions here and there where thathappens i think we'll probably getreally good at preventing it fromhappeningbut there's no bailouts in the realworld right because it's a real worldit's like it obeys the laws of realityand in the laws of reality time onlygoes into one direction you don't getdo-oversandand so that's kind of that's kind ofthis really seriousidea that to me is it's as serious aswhen the trees in the forest told me youknow we're going to be here pastyour country and because because thisforest is real and your country is adrawing and it's the same like thismoney is real and our freedom over it isrealnot like our dollars that are in thebank that somebody else is printing themby the hundreds of millions a dayand keeping for themselves or doing godknows what with it umit'sand controlling hours and potentiallyseizing hours but then taxing hourswe really have a responsibility now thatwe havesovereign moneyand and we've got to grow into itbecause none of us have had thisresponsibility for a day in our livesnot even the people running the banksbecause if they up they got abailout and certainly not the people inthe government because all they ever didwas print money that was unearned so itwas the people who were closest to thereality are the people who who were themost working-class people because theydidn't get handouts they had to actuallywork for their money and even thoughtheir money was indistinguishable fromthe money that other people didn't haveto work for they did have to work for itand so they did have to treat it withresponsibility and protect it and watchout for it even though they wereoutsmarted and outmaneuvered by peoplewho ran who pulled the strings of thesystem and and that's why so many ofthemare i think clueing into bitcoin i i noi don't say this experience that i'mabout to recite to you happens to meoften but it was a delight it happenedyesterday i had a plumber come tomy in-laws cottage wherei was i was just there helping them outbecause they couldn't make it and i wason a call talking about bitcoin while hewas doing his work and afterwards hesaid uh let's he told me what he saidand he said by the way i accept bitcoinand i'm like what isn't that goodbecause he overheard me talking about itand he's a farmer he's farmed for 48years of his life and he's also aplumber because he's gotta do two jobsbecause that's what a real person in thereal world doing real work does and hetakes pride in his work and he does goodhonest work and we were talking aboutbitcoin and it was a very funconversationand uh and he pointed out to me thatactually the town where the cottage isin i did i didn't actually know this butsince 2019 has accepted bitcoin for themuse for municipal taxes and municipalservices andso this is the town of innisfil ontariomaybe we should build it like it's it'sactually been a pretty innovative townnow that i think about it i i justthought about it as the placeon lake simcoe where where we had ourcottage but they actually they weregoing to build a public transit systemand instead of doing it and have emptybuses going back and forth and payingpeople to they just did a deal with uberwherethe budget that they were going to putinto all this stuff they basicallysubsidized uber rides for people so thatyou know so that people who were alreadyworking there or living there and wantedto work didn't have to apply and get itbecome part of the transit workers unionjust anyone could volunteer to work as atransit worker if if they had a car andand people who wanted to ride thetransit um were getting slightlysubsidized uh uber rooms and interestingand so they didn't build a publictransportation system they they workedin partnership with a corporation usingthe latest technology to make thingswork i don't know how successful it wasor wasn't i don't know if anybody's paidtheir municipal bills with bitcoin butthey're kind of open um to doing someinteresting thingsand uhanyhow but i was more telling this uhstory just to talk about this thisgentleman who is both a farmer and aplumber and he gets bitcoin and i thinkwe're going to see more and more andmore of that and he knows why he gets itbecause it'she works hard and he wants his money toprotect him and someone like that whohas to you know whose crop might failhe knowshe knows what it means to be sovereignright because if his crop fails he loseshis income that year he doesn't hedoesn't get a bailoutrightyou know it'swhen you said we've never experiencedthis before of course i agreebut this is where and this is why iasked you kind ofhow does that liberation how does thatsense of sovereignty make you feeltransform you etc becausei mean obviously we're products of ourenvironment rightthe way we are today is largely becauseof the different laws that we have theparameters that we have to operatewithin right as you said before you knowgravity and thermodynamics and all lawsof physics and chemistry and biology andall the stuff it all coalesces aroundthese parametersandwe that what you just described and thisthis may besocial absolute that bitcoin representsis a brand new thing for humanconsciousness to encounter and that'syou know that's what's so juicy aboutthis becauseand this is why i look to thetransformations happening in bitcoin sooften becausethat is where the effect is beingrepresented first and most most stronglyand so you look at these people and saywell why are these things happening likewhy are they feeling so much morehopeful confident liberated courageousyou know creative all these thingswell i thinkobviously something's being awakened inthem but this thing is having thateffect on them so what does this socialabsolute this system that is bitcoin howis it affecting the very evolution ofour own consciousness yeah you know andhow quickly is it doing so because if wejust look at how the effect on onindividuals in this system likeit'son any sort of historical scale it seemsto be happening very quickly i mean i'msure you would say the transformationthat's happening you i could say theones that happen to me the ones iobserve people are are changing veryquicklyyeah yeah i think some things happen youknowthere's the famous line i can't rememberwhich totalitarian dictator said it uhbut it was something you know sometimesnothing a few weeks happen in decadesand then sometimes decades happen in afew weeks yeahironicallythis is a point that gigi made to merecently he said you know remember whenthe soviet union fell it didn't fallslowly it was like it was over it was itwas suddenly you woke up one day and umand there was no soviet there wasn't awar fought to defend it there weren'tthere weren't riots in the streets withcivilians killed it just endedit was and it was remarkable how quicklysome of these things came to an end andso we're seeing a different but it wasalso it was a very pregnant dying in themaking like by the time that it endedthere was not a single person in thesoviet union who believed that this wasa better system than anything else rightthey would they would have takenanything so the system had no moralsupport left in it and and i think thisis kind of the question of what's ofwhat we're encountering right nowthere's there's two parts to this islikemany people listening to your podcastbecause of what your topic is and whothey arethey've let go already right like theythey they no longer believe in westernliberal democracy as a system that canbe trusted to support institutions thatare honest and fairand in the best interests ofthe people and they're right or likeunless we're all deluded about it it'slike wow these politicians are reallythey're so insincere you know like ipicture i seethe image in my mind of nancy pelosisaying it will cost nothing to give 3.5trillion like it's such a bald lie righti need 3.5 trillion dollars and it's andit's free all rightwho could believe who how could youexpect anybody to believe such a baldlie and like how can you even utter itright like have you no shame at all likeat least put some effort into coming upwith a lie right it's like well it'llcreate some wealth like tell to at leasttell a decent lieum not not that i want you to lie butjust you know you're so you're sotransparent about about what you'redoing so so we have lost our faith inthese institutions and we're trying tobuild something new and we still haveand here's here's why it's histransformative i get to this is we knowthat it's not as easy as running a nodelike the nuclear power plants aren'tgoing to continue running just becausei'm running a node the watersanitationplants that i can run water out of mytap and drink clean fresh safe waterisn't going to just keep running um likeif if civilization were to collapse ifall if all the institutions collapse andpeace and order collapse bitcoin doesn'tautomatically make it appearbitcoin allows for the system of moneyto bere-privatizedandand and to stop all this corruption fromfrom taking place but it doesn't makethe work go away right like the work toknow the work to first of all know likethese are all complicated things they'renot just somewhere where you sit backwe're so cut we've gotten so used togreat automation like we sit back andeverything runs and oh look it's notrunning right okay i'll reboot it but ifyou're if you're rebooting your computerdoesn't fix it you haven't got aclue what to dothat nuclear power plant that we allrely on for the electricity to keep thelights on we need people need to knowwhat to do to keep it running and thenthey need to do it and the same with thewater treatment plants and the same withthe extracting gas from the ground likeand everything that we rely on makingfood not having supply chain issuesoperating ships like the whole globalinformation andand uhmanufacturing and transportation economythe whole economy requires stillrequires that people know how to workthese things and figure out how to workthem better and more efficientlyand all of this stuff is gettingdistorted and broken by the breakdown inin our institutions because the money isbrokenlike like if we weren't talking tobitcoiners i'd spend another 10 minutesexplaining why that is but i would justtake it for granted that um bitcoinersat if they don't know yet they're on thejourney to discover why why it's allbreaking because the money is brokenbut wewe need to reclaim it and we need to fixit and we and we still need to do thework right like when i say you're a kingyou're sovereignthat's notyou know there are a lot of kings whohad their heads chopped off andrightfully so because theythey were like fiat kings they didn'ttake their jobs seriously they didn'ttake they didn't take it seriously thatthey had to sustain the institutions oftheir kingdomand our our collective kingdom iswestern civilization is civilized let'scall it civilization uh moderntechnological scientific civilizationand a lot of this stuff is beingdestroyed like even the word science isbeing distorted now trust the sciencemeans trust the guy dressed up in awhite coat on tv it doesn't actuallymean someone who hasperformedexperiments for us independently yeahthat are independently verifiable andthere was a control group and we caneach repeat the experiments or with someequipment can repeat the experimentsit's like here's a celebrity on tvreading a line or you're someone who'sbeen made famousand and you're supposed to trust themit's an authority not a scientist rightand their authority comes frombeing built up for you know throughpopularity not from facts and reason andso this is why bitcoiners i'm saying arebeing transformed because we know thatthere's a responsibilitythat comes with what's coming in thefuture and we're we're one of and maybethe only like i'm not really aware ofother people other groups who are sayingas sad as it is our civilization iscrumbling its institutions are no longerreliable we need to build newinstitutions we need to be resp and andthe reason that they're crumbling isbecause instead of responsibly runningthese institutions corruption is runningthese institutions people who are usingthem to make money to to extract profitsuh without doing the work to extractthem to build business models ratherthan to solve problemsthat like that that's what that's what'scollapsing in the old civilization andwe're saying well we're going to build anew civilization and we know that thatcomes with responsibility we know we'regoing to have to farm we're going tohave to do the regenerativefarming because this kind of agricultureis unhealthy and it's destroying theland and it's destroying our bodieswe're eating unhealthy tasteless food inover in over quantity we're becomingunfitwe're becoming sick we're developing allsorts of diseases and a big part of ithas to do with the food that we'reeating and the way that we're treatingit and our education is broken and ourhealth care system has misaligned itselfincentives it doesn't try to heal us ittries to treat us forever because that'sa good it's a much better business modelto have someone taking a pill everysingle day for the rest of their livesthan is to have them take one pill andcure their problem right right um and soand that's i think that's this is whatas far as i can see in the worldbitcoiners are like the biggest movementand the fastest growing movement to dealwith this i've come across a couple ofpeople who have like these narrow viewsaround one of these topics around fixingpersonal health personal wellnessand i really commend i i know thosepeople's hearts are in the right placesand they're trying to hard to figure outthe truth around thisbut they're not aware of everything elsethat's broken and they don't understandwhy why they're going at symptomslargely right i think some of theproblems yeah i think so i think like ihave this other thing i want to write anarticle about how bitcoin is like acopernican revolution how you knowbefore copernicus we looked at the skyandthe planets moved around they wanderedaround and sometimes they would go inone direction then suddenly they wouldchange direction in the night sky fromone night to the other and we didn'tunderstand whyit looked like mars was going to theleft in the night sky and then suddenlyit would go to the right in the nightsky because we didn't have a propermodel ofthe systemwe didn't know it was the solar systemwe thought the earth was in the centerof everything but with all of the andit's it's a great history of how of howtico brahe had to map the movement ofthe thingsand build data for years and years andyears so that different ummathematicians and scientists couldstudy this and then finally someone goeseureka the sun's in the middle of thisthing and the reason that it looks likemars is moving to the left and then tothe right is because we pass it rightit's moving to the it's moving to theleft and then it's moving to the rightbecause we just passed it so it's it'slike you know the things in front of youand then it's be it's behind you andthen it all makes perfect sense we havea model of the ga of the cosmos which inwhich the sun is at the center of oursolar system and it all makes sense andi think bitcoin is this copernicanrevolution of seeing how civilizationworks the money is in the middleright it all revolves around the moneythere's that great saying money makesthe world go round right and and moneymakes the economy go around so if you'rewondering what's broken in health careit's the money if you're wonderingwhat's broken in agriculture it's theit's the money right like the governmentreally stepped in decades and decadesago because they wanted to ensure foodsupply toreward certain kinds of food productiongrow corn grow wheat grow sugar likethey literally right like i rememberwhen my wife and i got married we'vebeen married 25 years now we went tohawaii and hawaii just was just at thetime i haven't been back since it wascovered in sugar canes and what peopletold us was yeah the government payspeople to grow sugarcane because sugar'san important crop so it wasn't like thethe people wanted sugar it was thegovernment thought that people wantedsugar and maybe they were right maybethey were wrong but they paid thefarmers to grow sugar and overabundanceand we've seen all of this stuff forpeople who've studiedsome parts of agriculture and controlboards and you and i in canada we knowthat there's the whole situation withmilk andit gets overproduced in some parts ofthe country and it's hard to produce inother parts of the country all becauseof regulations and they over produce itand they pour a lot of it down the drainat the endat the end of the day anywaysbecause it's not it's not subject to thefree market it's subject to these lockedand loaded political interests and i ithink and the and the incentives rightthe the milk the dairy farmers who areinvolved in the system they have it goodthey're protectedandand if you want to be a dairy farmerit's against the lawyou will go to jailyeah and you can't can't do ityeah and so the point point being isthat free markets don't exist without afree market money at the base layerbecauseif if there's no free market money thatcan't be corrupted everything ultimatelywill beperverted in some way through theintervention of the people that cancontrol that mechanism but you mentioneduh you know one really important pointthat i think over the last 18 months alot of us have wrestled with morebecause of you know that it's becomingquite apparent that the transition isunderway and that the difficult timesare are currently what befall us and ithink a lot of us are realizing thatlikeas much as we understand bitcoin and wethink we see the future of what can bebuilt on bitcoin it's still the casethat however however big of a critic wewere of the status quowe still were conditioned by derived oursignals from and to certain waysconformed and developed in that systemand soin order tobe fit for purpose for a new system weactually have to go through a prettydramatic transformation and this bringsme to a question that i wanted to askyou because you knowfor all of us i think we balance thistremendous hope and excitement aroundbusiness around bitcoinand this uh discomfort this alienationthis uncertainty thisanxiety around who we need to transforminto to be a proper bitcoin citizenlet's say to see this through to itsrightful endandi've been thinking a lot lately andreading a lot about symbolism and one ofthe symbols that i find helpful for meis that of and i've been reading a bunchabout alchemy and stuff like thatis the forge right where you have thisspace of intense heat and pressure rightheat and smashing and you know all thatstuffand it very nearly destroys the thingthat's in the forge but if it's handledproperly what comes out on the other endis a tool of immense utility right andthe reason why i bring that up is notjust because it's a great metaphorbut becauseit's a useful symbol right symbols allowus to takeunconscious and conscious let's saydisordered energy that otherwise canhave a very disruptive effect on our onour consciousness and ourour self let's say and allows us tocontextualize it and channel that energyproperly so that we can use itconstructively towards some end and inin that sense you know this ideametaphor image symbol of the forge isnot just likesomething trivial it's it actuallyallows me to continue the evolutionarypath that i'm trying topursueand the question i have for you umyou know if you want to comment on theother stuff first fine butwhat i'm really wrestling is with soeverything is symbol right we our worldis simple that's and and narratives andstories are just symbols put together imean we we can't do away with them it'simpossible that's just how we engagewith reality yeahwhat is bitcoin a symbol of we know whatit is functionallywhat is it a symbol of what what whatpsychic energy does it contain andchannel for usabove and beyond what it doesfunctionally for us because it is asymbol also right it is a tool but it isalso a symbol and i'd love to get yourperspective on that iyou're putting me on a spot with ananswer that i certainly don't haveprepared and that and that it's notleaping tomeuh right right awayi'm inclined to thinkit is it is many things i wrote onearticleumcalled bitcoin as a testand and it really spoke abouthow it like like what you just describedin the forge example it tests variousparts of you to the point of breakingnearly right it punches yourself but ittests your curiosity it tests yourpatience it tests your ability to tell atruth from a lie it testsyour conviction like i can't remembereverything that i put in there and itwas great i read it it was phenomenalyeahand and and it ends up being a teacherso like so in that article i said it's ateacher because it teaches you about youit teaches you about what yourcapabilities are and it strengthens youright every time you go into bitcoinit's like you're i'm going to use youran symbol of the forge it's like you'regoing into the forge and you're comingout and you're either stronger or you'reweaker but you but it tests you eachtime right it tests your strength um andit tests your ability to become strongeri was i i have another good example ofsomething that i was talking to somebodyelse about this morning and in fact butit it makes you stronger or it breaksyou umand we don't see that it breaks manypeople but we do see people who itbreaks we call it bitcoin bbs yeah yeahwhen it happens to people and they andthey snap um but i test you and theother symbol that i use in that in thatparticular article and i've used it manytimes because i think it's so true it'sa mirrorit's a mirror that you can look into andyou can it's not just a mirror that youlook into and it shows you who you arebut it's a mirror that you can watchyour transformation in and i don't knowif there's there must be some mythicalmirror in some mythology where you couldlook at i think there's something likein harry potter there was the mirrorthat you stared into and it showed upright in peter pan and the lion king thereflection in the water you look in andyou see an element of your spirit notexactly what you are yeah and in theportrait of dorian gray you see hehis portrait aged rather that ratherthan him so so this notion of thismirror that doesn't actually justreflect exactly what you are butreflects what you can be and what youshould be or what you're becomingis i think this is what bitcoin is ifi'm if i'm giving you a symbol like i iam so transformed from who i am that iactually tell peoplei died rightlike he died and this person is standingin his place right and and uh and i hadto and i had to be the one to kill himright like and that was the process thatbitcoin and psychedelics took me throughandand it continueswe'll get into thatat the journey because i can't i can't ican't give all the credit uh just to bequite alonebut uhbut that was the j and self-reflectionright like i don't want to say i likethose i couldn't have done it withoutthose two external things right but yeahsure i mean it's so much pendium of allyour life experiences right you can'treally i mean you can you can isolateones that were particularlyprofound or transformative or helpfulbut i mean this is the full selfemerging and it draws on all experienceright and so and so i i had to rebuildmyself and reconstruct myself and i i dolove thatmetaphor i have a very good friend whothe first time i met him said he had torebuild himself several times in hislife like tear himself down and buildhimself up stronger and i think that's avery useful and way to view what'shappening in the world because the wholething is burning down and we need tobuild it stronger and it includes ourview of the world which is what you werejust talking about right like what whatdo we need to transform into we need totransform into the people who areresponsible and able touhto be the guardians and the protectorsand caretakers of the world that we'rebuilding otherwise it'll fall apartright and um and so that'sthat's what we're building ourselvesinto as best as we can envision it rightthis isn't an easy like it doesn't cutthe universe doesn't come with aninstruction manuallikeuh nothing in nature is labeled they'llsay this is what you're supposed to dowith it a berry might be poisonous itmight be nutritious and delicious it'skind of only one way to find out rightumso i so i i think this is what this iswhat's going on bitcoin is this teacherand this mirrorandand this forge i'll give you all ofthese symbolssimultaneously because well what is thesymbol that's all symbols that's anothergood question what do we call thatsymbolyou know what do we call the symbol towhich all symbolsuh dissolve into i mean i guess in inalchemical and and kind of along theline of young's work that would be theuroboros right the thing from which allthings ultimately stem and thethe act of the individual is toand this is the the myth of the herois to have such a strongsense of self that you canyou can dive into the chaos of the purepotential the ouroboros and defeat thethe dragon there to re to extra extractsomething of value to bring back and toreintegrate into the self or the cultureor et cetera you know so yeah this thesymbol of symbols is pure potential andum[Music]welli i feel i feel pretty strongly aboutbitcoin i think that there's a lot ofamazing things happening there but it isit's that sort like where did we startum to me maybe the symbol is it's it'sthe old and healthy and it's the biggesttree in the forestum it's the one that you can hold on toit's the one that whatever the storm isit isn't going to blow downand you can live under it and it'll dropfruit for you umsix and a quarter of them now every 10minutes and it'lland it's shielded from the storm andother people gather around it and it'sme and it's the meeting place it is itis the old wise treeand it can teach you about yourselfand it can and can tell you what it'sbeen like forever and it'll be here forforeverumso i i don't know that i have a ton ofconviction around this i've made it upon the spot here but i'm pretty sure theold i'm picturing the old tree in theforest that i go for a walk in and thati sit under and i meditate there and ifeel like it will always be there andit's certainly been there forforever and it is and i could and icannot and i know that it's going tosurvive whatever stormcomes in general until something reallyextraordinary might come but but well asa symbol it's it's there for mei'd like to explore the comment you madeaboutyou know you tell people or at leastyour perception is that you had you'vedied and come back you know this thissymbol of the phoenix right and againin thisyou know the monomyth the hero myth thatcontinues to emerge throughout the agesand all sorts of culturesit is the story of someone whoputs basically puts their old self onthe line knows that their old self hasto be destroyed in service of becomingsomething greater and whether that'srepresented in the phoenix or whetherthat's represented in the the heroesfight with the dragon or you knowthere's many different manifestations ofthis but it is that idea thatin service of a higher principle you letgo of or you destroy or you kill offcertain aspects of of yourself and whoyou aresuch that those principles can be morehighly refined and then integrated intowho you are to become an even betterversion of yourself andi i'd love to hear how that's transpiredwithin youum where would you like me to startwherever you feel like startingi don't know it was a big umi i think i mean i'll first say that i ii think a lot of us feel the same wayand we often somewhat jokinglysay that like we refer to our fiatselves and our bitcoin cells right andour bitcoin selves are very much still awork in progress but there's a cleardemarcation point you're like oh god ican't believe i used to do that i can'tbelieve i used to be that and so there'sa clear difference and i don't know ifthat's a good point for you but it'sprobably not a bad point like i think ithink if i put it in the context ofthings we've already discussed becauseit's such a complex thing umthat uhyou know i i was a professionalbusinessman and who was universityeducated with two degrees in businessandand at some point in my career actuallywore a suit to work every dayandand believed in that system rightand i believed that if i did good workin that system that the institution thati worked for and the institutions thatsurrounded itreally worked well and i becamejaded about it and and a lot of thingswent wrong and i and i became depressedand i and iand i kind of lot i think i lost myselfin there because the things i believedin let me down and sono wonder i was depressed right likeall the things that i held the deer andbelieved in democracythe proper institutions theseparation of powers the checks andbalances the integrity of money the factthat work earned you in that smart workuhmade things happen just enough enoughepisodes happened in my life thatshattered every one of these beliefsand i didn't know what to believe inanymore and i and i was immediatelyattracted to bitcoin but it didn't havethis immediateumkilling my old self because i stillworked a fiat job and i stillspent money onfrivolities i would sayto try to find joy in them because ifound joy in the frivolities back when iwas fiat chomer i'm gonna i've neverused that equation before since you saysince you said i i i enjoyed thosethings and i enjoyed doing them andthere were some things that were reallydear to me that have you know sustainedthrough both livesbutuh butfiat tomer was dyinglike he just wasn't happy anymore and hetried he kept trying to find happinessand he he just couldn't find it and solike this is where we're going to haveto bring the psychedelics inum i ended upi ended uptrying to make a long story short iended up with a friend who had studiedthis because they were trying they gotinterested in psychedelics to treatdepression because their mother wassuffering from depression and they hadread uh how to change your mind bymichael pollan which is all a book aboutnot psychedelics as recreational drugsbut as treatments foruh for depression which they had beenpioneered for and used for and i did asupervised session of mdma therapy i'dnever taken the drug beforeandwithin a couple of hoursmyi it was like a big reset button it wasthe great reset on my psycheinstead of i was resenting so much in mylife and i was so disappointed ineverything and everyone around me and ididn't believe that i was worthy of loveand i didn't believe that i was lovedand i realized that that was all anarrative and a tale in my head and likemy mind opened up and i could see no youknow whatthe reason your children are frustratedwith you is not because you don't theydon't love you anymore it's because youdon't think you're worthy of their loveanymore andand they want you backthey want their father who they lovedbackumwho let them love them right not who gotupset and and the reason ii always tell this trivial story aboutit it's like my wife is in her injuredherself and it's really unfortunate butshe can't she can't really bend down butshe can't empty the dishwasher anymoreand she can't load the dishwasher justbecause she's got this condition and andi really resented having to empty andload the dishwasherit was it really bothered me becauseevery time i would walk into the kitchenthe sink is filled with dishes and ihave to bend it and it's like iyou know why am i the only one who hasto do this right it's it's not it's notfair umandand i i saw and i was just able to takethat thing and throw it out and say likethis is such a trivial thing it's such ait's such a nun thing it's such anothing don't be worried about it andlike to you know to this day since thatsince that one first treatment now ayear agoa little over a year ago because it waslast september i never walk to the sinkand see it full and get upset that wasthat full i'm like okay you know this issomething i can do for my family becausei love them and i'm doing it and and i'mnot fussed about it at all i actuallylook forward to emptying the dishwasherright like that was the power of thisthing and so that i think that was thebeginning of the rebirth but butwe're just talking about kind of likethe superficial layers of fiat tomerthere were like some really like at mycore i wasn't about emptying thedishwasherat my core i was about i studied a lotof philosophyself-studied self-taught i'd like ium i really particularly studied thephilosophy of ayn rand and went verydeep and very long into objectivismwhich is very reality and logic andscience-oriented philosophy and it has abottom which is it's axiomatic thingsand those wereand i fought for those things like anatheism right it's militantly atheistand i was a militant atheistand these werethese were truths that i defendeddeeplyand as i continued toprogress anddid somerepeated therapy sessions togo deeper like it was the second time idid one of these sessions where idecided that i was going to write aboutbitcoin that i was going to let go oftrying to find another fiat job and justsurrender myself to bitcoin as idescribed earlier on in this meeting andand and eventually i let go of the actlike my firmness of these axioms there'ssomething beneath them we can't usephilosophy and science to describe whyexistence exists or why consciousnessexists but we can open our eyes and seethe miracle that it does exist and thattime does flow and just in one directionit doesn't keep flowing backwards andchanging directionand that certain thingsexist in our eternallike atoms you know and the subatomicparticles and the quarks would makewhich make those things up andi andthe more i saw those things in a sensethe morespiritual i becameand the more i was able to integrateuh different things and live livewithout having to be militant aboutsome of these axioms i can't necessarilyintegrate everything else around thembut i i can seethatsomuch of my writing is about loveinterestingly enough right it's notabout money it's aboutwhy we should love each other and whybitcoin itself is worthy of love and andhow how that all comes together and andthat isthat has nothing to do withthe philosophical truths of whetherexistence exists or not there's there'ssomething deeper there and i'm i'm i'mstarting to write about it but i haven'treally published that much about it andcertainly not in the bitcoin context yeti've written a couple of uh public postsuh aboutabout about this but having likethere was an experience where i i reallylike had to let go ofthese things as stopping points or thesethings as dead ends that you could notprobe any deeper and surrender to wellwhat might be deeper there and it'll benoise and it'll be hard it'll be hard todecode it'll be hard to make sense ofbut i'm starting to make sense of someof these things and and i'm not i'm noti shouldn't say i'm not like i'll sayi'll say the phrase and then i'llexplain it i'm not really prepared inthe sense that i haven't prepared myselfand i don't have good notes to speakabout all of thoseuncertain details now but i'm i'mpreparing myself it's not like i'm notprepared i refuse to talk about this andi'm prep and i but i know what i want totalk about in these experiences and iwant to share them and i want toorganize them but i want to do so in ain a responsible anduseful way i don't want to confusepeople i want to help people see clarityand i'm i'm having privatecommunications with people about whati've seen butyou know i ii'm certainly not militantly atheistanymore anduhand and and like that was that and thatwas something that was so at the core ofmy being that i'd say like you know ichanged my job from someone who resentsi changed my attitude towards emptyingthe dishwasheri killed the atheistright like that was and and that and hedid not want to die because he livedwith that belief very very dearly andthat was a very very hard thingfor him toaccept becausethat because that changes everythingyeah it does or it changes it changes alot and you know one of the things thati've beenthinking withthinking about lately ishowbitcoin and let's say bitcoin's notnecessarily needed for this but let'ssay how the effect of it will bechanging the relationship we have to ourwork right i think there's there's a lotof likerational reasons you could identify likeoh well if you're more secure about yourfuture and your time preference islonger you're less in a rush in a hurrysure the dishes aren't as big of a dealas if you're just on that hamster wheeland every second count and you've got toget back to your emails right so itchanges that in a very obvious waybut i thinkand again this this kind of wanders intothe religious territory which is why ithink about it because like you you knowi you know 20 years ago now or whateveri was reading the end of faith anddawkins and all those people andi had always i'd always kind ofcharacterized myself more as an agnosticbecause i i saw and believed in and wasyou know uh just by default however i icame up in the worldalways had a reverence for the mysteryand i wouldn't allow myself to just bebrass tacks like you know the materialworld is all there is sort of thingbut i was very much umi had a very judgmental attitude towardsfaith and spirituality and all thesethings they seem juvenile to me let'ssay to put it simplyand you know my experiences withpsychedelics as well and with marijuanabefore that but had dramatic and but inparticular psychedelics dramaticallyexpanded my horizons to do two thingsone for me to sayoh okay well there's way more to thisstory than i originally thoughtand and two to humble me greatly and oneof the ways that it did that was tomake myselfkeenly and acutely aware of my ego selfversus the eternal thing that liesbehind my ego self and what that does isit allows you to see all theconditioning that you've been subject toand the the latent biases and prejudicesthat operate in your mind and that causeyou to act and be a certain way in theworld and once you can create thatseparation then i think you're in abetter position totoconsciously build your perspective in inthe way that you want to rather thanbeing kind ofsubject to your your unconsciousconditioning which i think in the worldtoday many people areyeah but theonce you one establish a relationshipwith the mystery the divine once youonce you have a sense that there'ssomethinggreater that animates life generallyrather than just you know the brasstacks of physics and evolution orwhateveri thinkit sacralizes your your life and yourbehavior in a different way and i'mfinding the same thing is is happeningwith how bitcoin is influencing meyou know it's it's it'sreinvigoratingme with a sense of the sacred and notjust about how i perceive and observethe world but in actually the actionsthat i take in the worldand uhyou know and to to the point about thedishes in the sink likei think that's a big difference like ifyou're a hardcore atheist then that kindofthat sacred doesn't permeate the worldin the same way whereas if you have adifferent relationship to the unknownlet's saythenyou know ev you couldi think you by default almost come tothe conclusion that every act is sacredand then it does two things one itallows you touhtake those actions with greaterconsciousness and with greater joy andacceptance around them but it alsocauses you to choose the actions youtake more carefully because if youbelieve that every action you take is soconsequential is a is a piece of thedivine let's sayis sacred in itself because you're youknow there's an aspect of you that'ssacred then you're more much morediscerning with how youwhich actions you take and i think thatgoes back to that that fiat bitcoinpersona that we've been playing withit's because like when you're the fiatpersona you don't think about that atall you you are completely subject tothe the signals that uh arecoming at you and you're completelymaybe not completely but you're verymuch trying to appease the variousconstituents in your life that arejudging you and all this kind of stuffwhereas yeah there's a there's fardifferent motivations at play in thebitcoin self and i would say i wouldthink much healthier ones and ones muchmore grounded in a truthful perceptionof what is and this is why i think we inthe in the bitcoin space a lot in a lotof the conversations i've been havinglatelyisspeculating and discussing thisodd emergence ofreligiousimpulsesin bitcoiners as they go through thisand we have to be careful with thatright becausewe don't just want to say hey i'mfeeling a religious impulse now i'mgoing to adopt xyz dogmatic religionbecausei want to close the gap of that impulseimmediately i think what we should sayis likeokay that this impulse is emerging yeahokay how should we how should we playthis is why i'm telling you i i needtime i need time to be able to speakabout these things because i'm trying toput togetherscience and everything that we knowabout science and also what thewhat the troubles have been with sciencelike science has been stalled foralmost 100 years now in terms of thefundamental theories of physics it justwe that can't unite the quantummechanics with classical rel withrelativityit's kind of stuck at the theoreticallevel we haven't been able to makeprogress there what what's going onthere why is that umwhat's morality like how does that fitin with science these are things we allcare about right what is what isthe divinehow does itis it like even even is it but what butif it is what what is it and and bitcoinand and because bitcoins this thing thatwe held on to that allowed us to openour eyes and start to look into thesethings and examine them really closelyright likei i had to killthe tomer who thought that theobjectivist ethics was the one and oh ithink it's very closeand it's certainly apath towardshavingrationalrules that you can explain to everybodyand especially now with bitcoin that canbe enforced in some way where it's notjust optional there are rules that areunbreakable that are more that are moralrules and i've written about some ofthose things but it's notthe end it is it's a milestone that onephilosopher reached along the path thatwe as humanity are going to take and andif i'm going toachieve the fullness it's not to standstillon the shoulders of one philosophicalgene genius and giant it's to use thatas a springboard to rise higher and tofigure out what else there is and that'sharder right just echoing and parrotingwhat somebody else figured outeven though it's hard to understand itis is just echoing and parroting itrightfinding new knowledge and andexplaining that knowledge with othersand persuading others throughthrough reality that you've actuallyfound something that's fundamental andtrueis hard it's hard work right and uh andbut it's that to me it feels like that'swhat that's a big part of what mycalling is and that's and that's whati'm kind of dedicating my time to andit's why i'm careful i'm very carefulabout what i write and what i saybecause i don't want to i don't want tolead people astrayand and i don't want to uh destroy myreputation in insaying something that turns out to beum careless right i'm happy to be wrongand i'll always admit when i've mademistakes buti want to make i want the mistakes thati make to be honest mistakes that werehonestly made despite my best effortsright like um and so if i'm doing thevery best work i can do i don't expectlike i'm not i certainly do not expectin my work to achieve omniscience i knowthat that is way beyond right i'm justlooking to see if i can figure out acouple things that help take us a fewsteps down the road towards truth ratherthan away from truth and and it's hardright it's hard it's very hard workumto look at the whole universe and try toput a whole bunch of different thingstogetherthat areconsistent and true and i like i reallyvalue this conversation that we've beenhaving here because i think you'vebrought some symbols and some ideas toit and asked some very good questionsand and some light bulbs have gone offfor me that i'm going to go and meditateabout and think about and write aboutlater and i and i this is to me why it'swhere this community is so incrediblyvaluable because where else like if i goto a university i'm just going to havepolitically correct angry emotionalpeople who think that they have all theanswers and and their answer is i got tobelieve their answer i'm or i need to becancelled or i'm wicked so there's noopportunity for dialogue and discoursein the institutions that used to be theplaces where you're supposed to havedialogue and discoursebitcoin twitter bitcoin bitcoin podcastsbitcoin medium that's where all thisthinking is taking place in the worldtoday isn't it isn't it amazing is itremarkable where else would you ratherbeif you'resomeone who's deeply deeply curiousabout fundamental philosophicaltruths like metaphysics like what is andhow do we know it as epistemology andmoralitywhat's a good moral code why what whatmakes something good versus eviland you know what's first of all theanswer to that question is nowhere thisis the place you know to do it but youknow what's what i ihow i perceivethe role that i playin this and that everybody plays isi agree totally with you with what yousaid and what i think is happening islike i mean this iswhether it's happening on twitter orpodcasts or in the various greatarticles that are being written likepeople are just engaging in this processand the process isokayi'll take out i'll take all the inputsthat i'm having the insights i'm havingthe epiphanies i might be having i'mgoing to try totranscribe them put them out there inthe hopes thatthere's a resonance with something thati said not for my own benefit but thatthen gets included into kind of thethe the main corpus of of understandingaround this thing at this current pointin time so that we can all just continuerefining and refining what we're findingbecause i don't think you know i askedyou before you know what is bitcoin asymbol ofand it's entirely possible thatwell this is what i'm saying is likethese these moments of insight and thesedistillations ofof our articulations can be incrediblyprofound but what i think happens mostof the time whether we're talking aboutthe emergence and development of globalmyths religious stories and even what'shappening hereis that we actand we think and we expressandwe humbly submit to that process that itdoesn't it's not for our benefit butit's in service of the truth and whatultimately happens isthe greatest truth the theemerges rather than is like almostdiscovered and and then yeah what'sreally interesting about that iswe derive so much of our perspectivefromthe culture the community that we engagewith right like if if you and i oftenuse this overly simplified example but ithink itproves the pointif you and i were born in auhlittle town in the amazon rainforestwe'd probably be very different peopleright if we were plucked from birthmaybe we look the same but we ain'tthinking the same we ain't speaking thesame we have different values and soand that's the trick right and thisagain is is explicated in religiousstory it's like how do youhow do you becomethe mostgenuineyou know truthful version of anindividual capable of acting andadapting in the worldwhile being a a part of a broadercommunity and culture of people to whichyou provide benefit to and which youderive benefit from whilst maintainingyou know almost theyeah maintaining your individuality andyour own you know independentconsciousness right and what i loveabout what's happening here and why ithink this process that we've been uhdiscussing is going to continue andprobably accelerate is because thiscommunity of people that we justreferred to that arechewing on these philosophical andspiritual and religious and economicideasis only getting bigger every single dayyou know so if if we if we consider thatgroup of people the ones that we'recurrently getting our our feedback fromthat then feeds into our own thinkingand our output and let's say just foreasy numbers it's a million peoplestrong or ten thousand people strongwhatever what happens when it's ahundred million and then a billion andthen two billion and three billionthat culture that we are feeding intofeeds us back and the the thethe broaderthe bigger it becomes and the moreuhinsight and wisdom that it propagatesthe more we're able touse it you know to continue feeding intoitin a in a in a greater way let's say andso that's one of the things that excitesme so much is likeman this is all just getting startedlike as you just said you can't go intothe universities these days and havethese conversations everything is sostructured and rigid and strict yeahwe're having it here but imagine whenthis scale is 10x and then 100x i meanhow rich intellectually is that going tobe to participate it's even more it'seven more than intellectually i i knowyeah absolutely i'm going to go back toyour question uh aboutwhat what is bitcoin a symbol of and i'mgoing to i'm going to reassert that it'sa mirroruh it's one of these magic mirrors andand i say it in that bitcoin as a testarticle i think that's the one where isay maybe it even shows you the truenature of your souland i think that this is this is what'samazing to me about bitcoin right likehere's here's a community here's a wayto livewhere i can be my true self i don't haveto be the business man in a suit we'relike wearing the clothes that societydecrees and i don't have to do a jobthat somebody else wrote the descriptionfor that's not the job that i want to doi'm me i finally you know i had to killthe person who was pretending to be allthese other things so that i could walkout and and emerge as me and i think idon't think i'm the only one right likei don't think bitcoin bitcoin doesn'texist so the tomer can be tomer right uhoh and and that's the only one it's it'sso for all of us uh is because it's aswe said earlier because it's this anchorof truth that you can start to seethings and one of the things that youstart to see so it's like it's a mirrorit's a lens it's something that helpsyou to see clearly and it helps you toseeand if it if it helps you see who youaretruly and lets you express who you aretruly then you will be satisfied in thislife right you will not be satisfied inthis life pursuingthe genes that brook shields wore in thejordash commercial in 1984.i just i'm just trying to tie togethereverything we've talked about beforelike that won't make you happy becausethat's not you that's what somebody elseis telling you somebody else is tellingyou you want to bebut youand nobody is telling youwho you are nobody can tell you who youare there's only one person who canfigure it out and that's you and thatrequires a lot of surrender and a lot ofhonestyand so you need some you need some wayto be able to be independent to not bedoing a job that somebody else told youto do to be choosing your job to bechoosing what you do with your life tobe choosing who you choose to be aroundto be choosing what you spend your timethinking about and becoming and if youbecome a farmer or you become a plumberor you become like these are all if youchose that thing that's great right likeif you know and and and i'm not sayingyou narrowly are like what you do youwake up and you do plumbing and then yougo to sleep and that's all you do rightlike human beings are so much morecomplicated they're so much moresophisticated you're a husband a wife adaughter ason a father like there's just so manydifferent things thatweave into the tapestry of one person'sexistence and what you enjoy and whatyou and what you love to do and you cannow thanks to bitcoin you can actuallybe honest about that if you want tosmoke you can smoke right like it's notno bitcoin is going to judge you and saywell you don't get to be a part of ourcivilization anymore because because youenjoy doing that thing that i don'tenjoy doing right it's like there's alive and let live uhatmosphere and we um and we actuallyenjoy each other's uhdiversity and again not diversity in theway that the word has been seized whichis hardly any diversity of synthesisright it's like yeah it's all thisamazingyou know like every single one of us iscompletely unique that's the diversityright like you and and when but when weall walk around like zombies pretendingto be the same because that's the samething we don't get to experience actualdiversity but when i'm me like this isyou know this is what you get and if youif you like it great and if you don'tlike it i'm not like i'm not runningdown the street saying you got to listento me it's like go your own way rightbut if you but if you like me and i likeyou we'll spend we'll spend hourstogether and we'll be friends and that'si think that's this beauty that of wherewe might be headed isall these crazy characters becauseeveryone's so unique and you find theseamazing characters and they find you andyouhave at it sometimes you get alongreally well with some people some peoplekind of rub you a little bit the wrongway but you still value something aboutthem and some people you just wantnothing to do with and and you can livethat way and you don't have to be at warwith each other right like so i thinkthat that's this that's you know i guessi i would say to people who arelistening really surrender to findingout who you are it's the it's the thingyou least regret in your life it youknow is is like knowing who you are andthen accepting accepting that and lovingit becauseyou shouldn't be ashamed like ifthere might be something about you thatyou think is shameful and it's if it'snot about going around and hurting otherpeoplethere's probably something deeper insideof you that's making you think that ifif you think that that's who you trulyare but um i can't i can't solve thathere but i'm just saying if if you'vegot somethingthat you enjoy that other people judgeas not being gooddon't worry like it doesn't matter likeit's you right and it's this you're theyou're the ugly duckling right you'rethe black swan you are beautiful andand it's okay for you to enjoy the thingthat other peoplemight frown upon i know a lot of peoplewho tell me that they love playing videogames i'm not as much into right andthey say but i worry because i thinkit's this it's that's the other well youknow you have to find a healthy balanceof doing some of these things but if youreally really enjoy these thingsand they help define what you are thenthen beenjoy the stories it's like i reallyenjoy reading books like fiction ireally do i don't feel guilt over that idon't like oh i'm wasting my timereading fiction i feel like i learn alot from it but it's not arationalization i actually do learn alot from it and that's probably why ienjoy reading fiction i think you learna lot from many of these video gamesdifferent ones have different thingsthat you learn from and you developskills right quick reflexes andand there's arguments as to why youshouldn't enjoy them but like i'm justsaying at the end of the day don't letdon't let the tv judge you and don't letthe mob on twitter judge you don't letthat get under you here's an interestingthingi i agree and bitcoin is free to moneyand that means you can be free to be whoyou are and express yourself how youlike and i totally agree with that oneof the interestinguh aspects of this though is thatbitcoin changes your relationship totime and it changes your systemevaluation and how value ishierarchically arranged in your brainand so it puts someadded pressure or a new angle to onesaying is this the best use of my timeyes right like not even from aproductive point of view but just likeis this what i enjoy the most and one ofthe things that i think how bitcoinfacilitates and aids in that isi do think that bitcoin is suchis perceived as being of such greatvaluethat you know again like like this ideaof truth and god being a judgethe thing of greatest value is thegreatest judgeright and sowhether that's a personal god whetherthat's another god whether that'sbitcoin whateverand it helps you reconstruct your valuehierarchies and it helps youdowngrade the things thatof lesser value and helps you upgradethe things of greater value and i thinkone of the phenomenons that's happeningin bitcoinis kind of like most things that arefrivolous or that have a a market priceor value in relation to or judged bybitcoin are downgraded dramaticallyright you want to turn everything thatyou can into sats and then you knowwhat whatever remains whatand what remains is the things oftranscendent value that can't be pricedlove beauty relationships friendshiptruth honesty integrity these things getboosted up to the top of the valuehierarchy as a result of everything elsegetting pushed down and so you know andthat's weird and and that has the effectof people saying likeor or starting i think to grapple withsystems evaluation and time differentlylike that's weird it's actually thinkabout think about it for one second andthink about how normal it is to valuelove friendship integrityhonesty above but it's it's not normalit's natural maybe but it's not normalit's not normal in our civilization andthat's why our civilization iscollapsing because our civilization isunnatural right like we we have elevatedwe have elevated frivolity overessential human experiences right i havei have one i think it may be likebitcoin as a test is one of my favoritearticles that i've written but the otherone that ranks really really high upthere and probably exceeds it is rich orpoor bitcoiners have what money can'tbuy and it explains why bitcoins haveexactly the list of things that you justdescribed it's why we have friends whywe have intelligence why we haveintegrity and and and i like i don'tknow where some of these articles comefrom it wasn't like i i just sat downthe day after miami which i wasn't eventhere but i saw these pictures and icould feel everybody's joy and happinessand i and and like the headline came andi just poured it out and said like whatwhat is it about bitcoin is and idescribedwhatum what the process of becoming abitcoiner is i first say what are thethings that money can't buy right and isay that these these virtues like inintegrity and honesty and principles andand friend and friendship where youcan't walk into a bar and buy a friendyou can't walk into a store and buy afriend and you can't buy intelligencelike these thingsaren't for sale for money but theprocess of becoming a bitcoin or a of stgrabbing the truth and studying it andlearning the truth and understanding whyit's important to live by principle andfinding other people who live byprinciple who then become your friendsright it's like all of a sudden thisprocess of becoming a bitcoiner has youlook back after you've done it it's likeyou know it's like the karate kid hedoes all the exercises the rocky worksout and then you've become you've goneon this hero's journey and suddenly youhave built the strength to have all ofthese abilities in the worthiness to besomebody's friend and and to earn thefriendship of somebody else who is aanother person of integrity and sothat'll be a real friendship a lastingfriendship not a drunken stupor ofsomeone who you know you went and gotsick with and threw up and you have anight that you barely remember toremember you have you have so manyshared values with these people andthat's this amazing journey that bitcoinhas gone and i believe that that'sactually a much more natural journeya much more normal journeybecause if we were living in the junglewe would have we would have to do thesethings we wouldn't have all the benefitsof modern civilization like we wouldactually have to survive together wewould have to figure stuff out and yeahand it would be a different level ofunderstanding we're trying to learnsurvival skills as opposed topast the dunbar number skills thesemassive integration society skills butthat's much more important than you puton a suit and you stand it at the frontof a store and you do what's written inthe job description and hr slaps yourwrist if you don't do it exactly rightand they and they eventually after sixyears give you a job behind the counterif you if you did do it right like thatthat's not a way to live that's notnatural and you use that money to buychocolate bars and a subscription touh some video streaming service that youwatch zombie movies on all day likerightso so i'm sorry to have interrupted youbut it was just kind of like no ii i agree with what you're saying ithink you know that just to finish thepoint isi think that's whychoosingbecause what sits at the top of yourvalue hierarchy becomes the judge of allother values you could call that god andthat's whyi think historically throughoutcivilizationthe choosing of god is so consequentialwhat what properties and values andprinciples does your god have becausethat will be what orders your valuehierarchies that will be what magnetizesthe certain values to it and that willbe what pushes other values down furtherand so i thinkthe enterprise of trying tounderstand the constituents of realitylet's say and let's say the unseenimmeasurable components ofof reality is to try to determine whatprinciplesare what are the principle theparameters in in terms of principles andideals that exist there and how to alignwith them best and i thinkthat's why you often hear god describedas truth as love as unity because theseare some of the core principles thatanimates life let's say that leads to agreater experience of human life andif you have the correct thing at the topof that hierarchyagain you're gonna you're gonna attractlike things to it like the experience ofphysical beauty let's say like theexperience of love and friendship orrelationship like the experience ofactually speaking truth and beingauthentic all those things will go upthe value hierarchy and i think that'swhat we're seeing in bitcoin or inbitcoiners rather and actually you knowwhen we talk about bitcoin as a symboli think it'swell i'll just say this and then it'llbe there but it you know it seems to methat it could be aa psychic repositoryfor the truth love and unity of godof of thethrough the truth love and unity thatcharacterizesthe unseenparameters of reality let's saywhat if it's a symbol that's emergedthatrepresents that more so than anythingelse and is that part of the reason whyit's having the influence on values thatit's having on people i know that's likeno the the non-hardcore bitcoinerslisting will be like you that's you guysyou're insane but they already thinkthat they already think that about me soit's all you know it's all good but umbecause again like just think about itman bitcoin as a technology is adistributed data immutable database youyou as a big as a bitcoiner you get tochange numbers from one place to anotherbig deal why should that have any effectit's it's the principles that are imbuedin it to permit it to act in that waythat symbolically has such a you knowimpact on ussymbols are like tunnels yeah where doesthat tunnel lead right i think what'skind of interesting as well about yesit's it is it is simple in the end butit'sbut it's so reliable it like we had whatdo we admire about it we admire itsreliability we admire its truthfulnesswe admire its creativity we admire thework that goes into it it is a i i ikeep coming back that i'm not trying towin an argument here about the mirrorright it's like it reflects re itreflects these things about reality itreflects these things about re about thedeep of reality that that you know thethe cr the creation story from the bibleis that god workedright it's likefor six days like he had to create theheavens and the earth and that took alot of work and and we can look atreality we can say well look at how muchreality look at how much work how muchenergy had to happen for the universe toexist forfor stars to come to get for like allthat hydrogen to come together and forma star and and the fusion happens andall that energy is released and it's allso used to fuse atoms together and thenthat thing goes nova and so like justthink of all the work that has to gointo creating the universe at the statethat it's in at the time that we're inandlife has to come together it has tosomehow come to be on planets where allthesedifferent atoms exist because there werestars before that made all the hydrogeninto all these atoms andnow all these molecules start to formand these are more complex things andthen you get this self-reproducingmolecule and andlike how much work had to happen inorder for that to take place and thenfor it to become sophisticated enough tobe to build a cell which is i don't knowif you've ever seen theseup close by electron microscopeelectron scanning microscope views of acell it's as busy as a whole city itlooks like tokyo there's organs in itand there's traffic moving and there'sall these proteins going back like thisallit took work to make this and i i i andi just mean like think of how many howmuch energy had to go into this thingcoming to be and then it becamemulticellular somehow where the same dnamolecule that's inside of all of thesethings which was a self-replicatingmolecule is now replicated in these twocells that are working together or inthe case of you 25 trillion cells thatare all working together to each one dotheir own special duty and every once ina while one of them has to lay down itslife for all the others so that theother so that the whole organism cansurvive but it it dies like and thensomehow sexual reproduction takes placewhich is how you have this recentlytheir own view that sex is like acryptographic multi-sigthing like you you tear you tear offhalf you tear off half of your privatelike your dna is your private key rightit represents you and only you and itdoesn't exist in anywhere else it's ait's a one-of-a-kind numberand your body is your expert it's yourpublic key right that's your expressionof the dna it's a deterministic uh thingof running of running that there's orderin it too but there's also a lot ofchaos inside of dna and uh and you tearhalf that often some other individualfrom the species tears off half of itand you somehow join the two thingstogether like i i still don't reallyunderstand the evolutionary theorybehind how if you take this random 50and they take a random 50 and thatsomehow all fits together i'm surethere's some better explanations thanwhat i'm familiar with but it seemsit seems really divine to me to me andand and that creates your new multi-sigwhich is your kid and umand and it's got all these astronomicalnumbers and none of them ever will existever again unless you have twins likethis backup copy of each other but it'sall of this work is is what i'm sayingit like it all happens and then suddenlywewe arrive and we are consciouswhich is amazing in and of itself likehow where does consciousness come fromthe awareness ofyou could open your eyes and you can seethat existence is like existenceprobably is not aware of itselfotherwise until something comes up to beaware of it unless you're you believe ina conscious god which which iincreasingly do but i don't want totaint this conversation by taking sideson this right so consciousness nowexists and it's aware and we we have toaccept that it is and we're awareof being a lot and we're aware of beingalive what like what awhat a miracle that we can exist and beaware of existing and and be aware ofother people existing and have thisability to understand things and theability to manipulate reality torearrange reality to i can raise my handup i can raise it down i cancreate a podcast with with you so wehave this creative ability individuallyand collectively we're co-creating thispodcasttogetherand and we can controlto some degree the future and we andevery one of these layers of realitythat i described like the atoms or thesubatomic particles like they all theyall exist forever and but some chaosarises within each of these layersthat leads to the next layer right likewhat i was describing the universeexists in reality exists in all theselayers that keep building up and everynow and then a new layer emerges rightlife emerges and multi and cellular lifeemerges multicellular life sexuallyreproductive life conscious lifecreative life and i think that's kind ofthis the tip of the spear is what wehuman beings are we actually can createthings um especially and we've talkedabout it here we can create things asindividuals we can co-create them as ateam we can co-create the co-creationsof companies with other companies andbuild up all these amazing uh things butunlike all these other stable layersbeneath us we feel like we're in thisunstable state right like humanity keepsright like and it is we see the there'sa rise and fall of a civilization a riseand fall of a civilization a rise andfall of a civilization and and are wedoomed to live in these cycles forforever or is there a way to achievestability and does the stability comefrom another layer that emerges fromsome invention that we actually come upwith that gives usthe ability to be stable forever andlike i dearly hope and i deeply believethat bitcoin could very likely be thatthing that a lot you know because whenyou when you when we now do study thereasons why civilizations keepcollapsing pretty common cause is thatthe money got broke right the money gotbroke and then the institutionscollapsed and then the civilizationcollapsed and what used to be thedefenses stopped defending it and andwhat used to be the people believing inthat civilization stop believing in itbut bitcoin is built to last forever andthat'ssome of the insights that we talkedabout before and it's built to not becorruptedand so it's it's really a very very verypowerful first time in historyidea that might actuallystabilize this layer of existence thatwe call humanityand begin the next layer eventuallywhenever whenever its time comes andmaybe bitcoin is that layer on top of uslike i say you know when you build ahouse of cards and you pile them up it'sit's the layer on top that you puthorizontally that stabilizes the layerunderneath because if youand i feel like bitcoin is this layer ontop of our layer that can stabilize usand let us live in harmony with thelayersbeneath us with nature with the earthand i've got this one science fictionstory that i wrote which says bitcoinwill help us save the planet even pastthe death of our sun because we willbecome masters of energy and willactually be able to move the whole solarsystem slowly over hundreds of millionsof years but we got all the time in theworld as i say towards a younger starand then move our planet into orbitaround that other star when we get thereover 100 million year interstellarjourneybut but we can we can do it if we figureout how to master energy and guesswhat's builttoabsorb all the energy we can ever mastershockingly right it's like yeah likeit's not it's not going to melt you wantto talk about a forge that it's like thedanger to the forge is you make theforge too hot and the forge cracks youcan't make this forage too hot like youcan pour all the energy in the sun in itand it'll just eat it up in a few morezeros on theuhon thecumulative proof of work variable rightit's like and then it'll eat you knowand then it'll get to the point whereonce it's eaten one whole starit's only one more zero to eat the nextwhole star right because eacheach step is a doubling and soand it's only one more zero to eat thenext four starsyeah it's it'sinteresting and i've thought about thatkind of as you're saying how how lifeand realitypatterns within patterns within patternsin this sort of fractal uh style ornatureand you know thethe you know the organs of the body orbiological systems are basically builtto adapt to the environment around themand cut up the reality you know so theycan consume what's sustaining anddiscard what's you know the waste andpropagate in that wayandso it's it's all every one of thosepatterns isengaging the truth of the reality that'sthat's uh relevant to it and i you knowi think it'syou knownot much of a stretch from for me atleast to think thatso there's the biological component thenwe have the conscious component and ithink part of the religious enterpriseis trying to determinewhat is the reality that's relevant toit right how how does consciousnesswhat is the appropriate relationship forconsciousness to have with realitybecause it's not so easy to discern asbiological life because it's invisiblefor lack of a better term yeahand so i think that's part of thereligious enterprise to try to definethe parameters of the reality thatconsciousness is engaging with andwhat i see happening with bitcoin as yousay is another pattern being built fromthe substrata of consciousnesson top of it itself and what'sinteresting about that is because eachpattern is nestled within it everysingle one is kind of linked to thetruth of the one below it yes right andso it needs it needs it if anythingbeneath it fractures and breakseverything above it collapses so exactlyand that's why we see reality is builton all these layers of eternal thingsthings that don't break down because ifthey broke down we wouldn't be here towitness them so it's like that's exactlymy point and so what what is thateternal thing well again shall we callthat god shall we call that thestructure of reality who knows you knowup to each person to decide but i thinkyour the point you just made isabsolutely perfect is that it wouldn'twork unless it was tethered to the truthin some way and i think the the thingsthat persist throughout all of thedevelopment of the universe andbiological life and all that kind ofstuff are the things that are tetheredto that deepest profound truthand so if bitcoin is that thing thatwill persist as you just articulated youknow we'll be able to harness energy inmillions of years time whatever but thepoint is if it is a truth that persiststhen that necessarily means it'sconnected to the most profound truth thestructure of reality or if you want tocall it god right basically the sameidea yeah and this is why and that's whyi say is it is it a representation ofthatprinciple of that truthsureyeah like bitcoin is truth right orbitcoin bitcoin is humanity's connectionofof truth to the deepest elements ofreality and that and that and and so whyare so many bitcoins having religiousexperiences like we're seeing deeperinto the truth than thanwe've ever been able to see beforecertainly in our lifetimes and maybe inthe whole history of humanity because wehave this thing thatshows us how we are all structured andhow our civilization is structured andhow humanity gets how we as individualslike it it lets me see the true natureof myself as i said and it lets me seethe true nature of humanity and it letsother people see their true nature likewe're talking truth baby right likeevery time everyevery single thing that we've talkedabout as in contrast toa world without bitcoin that is a worldthat we described is filled with a stormof liesand narratives that don't cling to thetruth that don't harness reality theydon't harness energy they don't have anythat aren't based off of provablestatements right the whole thing abitcoin every statement in the thing ismathematically verifiably provably truewhether it's a transaction or a blockand the blocks are anchored and tetheredto energy and reality so whether whetherit's ayou knowwhether it becomes a tool that we'veseenthat helps us to look in deep intoreality right it's like these binocularsit's a telescope deep into realitybecause it changes our consciousness sothat it can seethese truths that were before hard forus to see and almost impossible for usto collectively to collectively agreeupon right now now we've got thiscollective agreement across the entirespecies there's not a dispute about asingle bit and so it's a spreadsheetwell it's pretty special because everysingle person in the world agrees onevery single bit of data in thisspreadsheet there's no disagreement atthe edges we don't agree to disagree weall agree because we can all because weall have a method to divine this andand we and it checks out for everybodyerror-free right and it's it'sabsolutely pristineand perfectand uh yeah no i've got i've got thisone article like every now and then italk about because why people wonder ifbitcoin is alien technology i i couldhave said like why people wonder ifbitcoin isdivine technology and because it lastsforever it makes this perfect replicasthat nothing else in reality has theseperfect replicas everywhere everywhereelseand oh there's just so many things aboutit it's a good it's a good article ireally like i really like reading thatone it inspires me and and i i've hadsome discussions with people on andthey've like added a couple of thingsonto it but it's like it's built foreternity uh like these other layers andand if it does achieve what i describedin my science fiction story then itmakes us build for eternity too and andthat to me is like i'll use a religiousand like that redeems us if we're notself-destructive but we're stable and wecan live in harmony with the layersunderneath us then that's that's thatsaves us it's it's it's a salvation it'sa redemption right we we get to exist asa species forfor eternity because we'vebecause we've partnered with bitcoin tohelp us stabilize ourselves and wepartner with the layers underneath us topreserve and protect them for foreverlike we're a very important part instabilizingrealitythe reality that surrounds us the layersbeneath us immediately in the layersabove us immediately and so we all livesymbiotically and partnership tocontinueand for eternity and that's and that'sdivine soit's it's really really powerfulyeah and you know i think part of thereason why this rabbit hole is neverending and we're all so ferocious aboutpursuing its depths and refining ourunderstanding and asking all thosequestions is because the morelike we like we keep saying you've got aspreadsheet which seems mundane but allthe things that go into allowing it tobe what it isis what is is what our minds latch on tothe meaning around it and so the moreyou go down that rabbit hole the moreyou learn about it the more the thehorizon of meaning of this thing expandsand expands and it's it's led me toyou know thinking and even feeling inmany respects latelywhat i think is also a religious notionofthe truth that sustains you or themeaning that sustains you and like youyou almostyou know it's just it's wrapped up inthis notion of the truth shall set youfree which i think has broad applicationaround right in many ways in bitcoin butthe the fact that like the meaning ofthat truth alonefills you with something that'ssustainingand i don't know how to articulate whatthat is but i do think it's behind partof the motivation of continuing to tryto understandwhat bitcoin is because it it makes thepool of meaning deeper and that theninvigorates invigorates and enlivens youlet me play off of it like there's aword um that we use called hope that ishopeand what like what does it mean again ithink i think people misinterpret itoften it's likehope is thiswishful thinkingrightand it's not it's more than thathope is a rational optimism it's like arational belief it's having good reasonslooking at reality and integratingeverything that you can in consciousnessthat good will continue the good willcome out of what you're working that'swhy bitcoin is hope bitcoin isn't likethe white paper doesn't say close youreyes and cross your fingers and hope forthe best right it says here's how youhere's how youstabilize money and achieve consensusand prevent it from ever gettingcorrupted and that's what the code doesand that's what the people running nodesdo and like it all comes it all comestogether and so no wonder we're filledwith optimism with rational optimismbecause we're in that brick house thatthe three little piggies are in which issafe now we are not going to getdestroyed we're not going to kill eachother we're not going to destroy eachother we're not going to destroy theplanet we're what our civilization's notgoing to crumble and and we're going todie we're going to manage we'rewe're going to make it right like and weare going to make it and and that'swhere the hopecomes from and hope is not uh this sillynotion and we can and we can confrontthe skeptic and the doubter and thenihilist andand laugh at them or or treat themseriously and debate them and say no youknow what we are going to make we haveeverything we need we have amazing mindswe have access to energy we have theability to use the scientific method todiscovernew knowledge we have mathematicalknow-how we have so many of us who areso smart uh that we don't each have totake on a huge burden of saving ourspecies we each do what we cancontribute to do we each do our verybest work each and every one of usand and we exchange our very best foreverybody else's very best andcollectively what can arise is why onearth would that end it's like it shouldit should propagate it should get betterand better and stronger and strongerforever it shouldn't keep going throughthese cycles of decline it doesn't makesense that it declines it that's thething that seems irrational that's thething that seems foolish that it and andagain i think we've now put our fingeron it and we're not the first asbitcoiners to put our finger on why itfalls it's the money fails and that'sthe coordinating mechanism betweendifferent human beings with this withspecialized knowledge who didn't allhave to you know kill their own food andmake their own clothes and and buildtheir own homes we were able tocooperate through the use of money andif we can fix the money we can it's notjust fix the world it's stopthe cycle of civilization collapsingbecause money collapses and and this iswhat we can be really really hopeful offor and this is the first time inhistoryyou know maybe maybe in a hundred yearswe'll look at and say oh you know whatit too like the united states of americaits institution somehow became corruptedbut we fought a war it was a virtual warit was a digital war to preserve one ofthese aspects of bitcoin and not let itbecome corrupted right those block sizewars which were fought to ensure twothings one that everyone could run anode and two that we fixed themalleability bug and allowed segregatedwitness to happenwe knew we didn't know we weren'ttalking about what you and i are talkingabout now but we knew deep down insidethat that's what we were fighting forright we were fighting for this thingthat would allow us to be free and tohave self-sovereignty and to work witheach other in peace andand that's what we fought a war overpeace for uh for peace and uh and i'm soglad it worked out uh the way it didbecause if it didn't we'd be hopelessnowyeahon that note let me ask you thiswhat happens if bitcoin fails right itis the cause for hope it's been sotransformativenot only will we have been wrong let'ssay and we will ourselveseven ifi i think being having been deluded is abit strong because maybe the thepremises we were using were correct butthe outcome just ended up notmaterializing but neverthelesslet's say for whatever reason bitcoin'snot as incorruptible as we think and itfails what happens toyouyour perspectiveyeah how you engage the world so myinitial reaction i'm then going tocontradict my initial reaction is i'd bevery disall of us will be very disappointed manyof us will become depressed uh some ofus will take our own lives uh because wehad all this hope in it some of us willbecome we'll join whatever corruptsystem replaces it i'm assuming you'resaying it doesn't get replaced by aneven better system right it's not likeyeah because we would all opt for thebetter system so um so it would be avery sad moment but but i'd say also theother thing that bitcoin has done to usand i i observe this and this is thething i was good i said i was going totalk about but i didn't is it it makessuccess it makes us strongerevery timebitcoin gets attacked and we resistanother attacksomeone tries to change the rules hereumand we resist it and survive they justmake us stronger right like what youknow if you're if you're slave if you'rea slave and your slave master says liftup a 60 pound bag of this and carry itover there it's very hard and you do itand then the getting or the next daythey make you lift 65 pounds and you'relike well i wouldn't have been able todo it if you didn't make me left the 60pounds first but thank you you know in asense thank you like you're a badtaskmaster but you've strengthened meand then they make you lift 70 poundsand you gradually as they increase theworkload you're actually gettingstronger and stronger and then somethingturns around and it's like you can beatthe out of your slave master andyou are strong and you are strongerbecause they made you do all the workand the work makes you stronger and usbitcoinersi think arethe strongest becoming the strongestspirits in the world right because weare putting up with and identifying andfighting againstall of these injustices and so ifbitcoin itself ultimately fails we won'tbe unitedthe idea is we won't be in consensusover the spreadsheet anymoremaybe the spirit so of what we havefought for and believe inuh is not as unified anymore butthose values that we hold aren't goingto go away from everybody right therewill be people who say okay bitcoindidn't survive but i still believe inintegrity and i still believe inprinciple and i still believe in tellingthe truth and i still believe indiscovering the truth and so i don'tthink you can kill that right likethat's the that's an idea that can't bestopped even though some people might bevery heartbroken that the thing that thesymbol that they tied it toum did not persistbutuh but it then becomes you know the thebitcoins the locus of attack right nowand if you actually destroy bitcoin thenyou scatter all these in high integrityhigh truth hard-working people to thewinds and now you can't even find thembecause they're not even using bitcoinsoit probably wouldn't be the end of theworld uh we would need to rebuildsomething that we can that we can use asour money but i hope it wouldn't killthose things that bitcoiners have thatmoney can't buyyeahyou know it makes me think of what a acosmic or divine test of of faith thatwould be to to introduce something andsay see it's possible but now i'm goingto take it away so that you you have touphold it without that i mean rightagain you know the death of christ maybesome someanalogous comparisons being appropriatethere butumi hope it doesn't happen and i you knowif i'm a betting man by virtue of owningbitcoin and i'm betting that it it's notgoing to happen but umtomorrow i uh i'm sure we could talk forseveral hours and and i hope we get theopportunity to do so again but maybethat's a a good place to shut it downfor now do you have any otherthings you want to share topics youwanted to cover places you wanted todirect people any any last weekthis has been a great conversation andand i am i i could go on for hours buti'm i'm also exhausted by the the stuffwe've covered i i i'm excited to to letpeople know that in addition to mywriting i've had the opportunity to workon a video a short film that's going tobe released soonit was commissioned by louis liu whoruns mimesis capital um and it's aboutbitcoin being generational wealth andit's a message of hope and so just ijust say keep your eyes out andhopefully within a week or two uhsomething will be coming out that'sdifferent uh it's about like 1314-minute uh film about awesome how bighow bitcoin is for for generations andit taught and i i bring it up because umit we've talked about so much of thisthis long-term notion and and it's it'sa message of hope uh it's it makes somepredictions about the future but it'snot it doesn't matter here or if they'reprecise it just talks about howtoday bitcoin can give us hope forbuilding a better future and i can'twait to share it with the worldthat's awesome i can't wait to see ityeahwell man thank youyeahsweet well thank you once again and andthank you and keep up um all the greatwriting it's a tremendous uh value addto the space i think you're the way youarticulate things is isyou knowextremely valuable and whether you'renew in the space or been here a longtime it's those types of voices that ithink really enrich things so you knowkeep up the good work and i'm surethe the muse will continue to use you touh you know have increase your output astime goes on let's say yeah yeah thankyou very much it's been
