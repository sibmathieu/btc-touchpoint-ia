  "text": "let's do it well Richardhow's it going man I'm uh I'm thank youfor doing this I'm looking forward to itthank you John and I appreciate you andyour funum so I mean well I appreciate a lot ofyour work I mean I I'm a huge fan ofeveryone really who is inspired tocreate in this spaceum it's just amazing how inspiring thisthing is and then to see everyone kindof translating it in their own way youknow with their own Swagger and stufflike that like I just love it and yourstuff has been incredible I always loveto see new drops and so I just wanted toget together for a chat and kind of heara bit of your story your inspirationyour process and whatever else you wantto talk aboutum and Bitcoin it definitely just bringsout uh like you said it's just soinspiring and Bitcoin itself is rathertechnical but one thing is like you knowas I learned these technical aspects ofBitcoin it really like I know it's not aperson or it's an organism that somepeople would say but like thesetechnical aspects of late I've beenutilizing that and trying to personifyparts of Bitcoin and that's one of thethings I've been doing lately in regardsto the music and just trying to give uhthis non-person thing human-likequalities yeah I like it and and I agreeyou know for a lot of people this thingis probably fairly foreign you knowbecause a lot of people aren'tinterested in economics or monetaryhistory or technology or any of thatkind of stuff and I feel like you know alot of the art that gets produced in thespace and yours in particular like itgives it that personal slash emotionalslash aspirational Dimension and that isobviously far more appealing to peoplebecause everyone can relate to I meanthat's kind of what art is right itrelates to the emotional part or theinspirational part of someone ratherthan you know hardcore technicalunderstandings of things and I thinkthat just makes it far more relatable sowhen someone sees like your video Ithink a recent one was Bitcoin is Hoperight where uh I think myself and sailorhad a little excerpt in it and that'syou know that's an appealing messagethat everyone can understand everyoneunderstands the the function or thefeeling of hope they might notimmediately understand how Bitcoin fitsinto that picture but giving them like ataste of likeyou know opening a window I guess tothat element of this phenomenon thatmaybe piques their interests and causethem to go further and learn more I meanI think that's the role of art generallyand I just love that you know you canyou can call it propaganda in a way youknow because all this stuff is kind ofit is propaganda promoting Bitcoin butlike I was thinking before we came onlike what's the differentiating factorbetweenlike State propaganda and this and Iwould say thatlike this is naturally inspiredpropaganda right it's like it's notbeing imposed on anyone it's not for anyparticular end it's just kind ofit's the result of inspiration and itmay serve the function of propaganda itmay serve the function of bringingpeople in and anduh and trying to get them to think aboutit in a certain way I guess but it'svery different from like a statecentralized narrow sort ofpropaganda I would sayit's bottom up too like the reason why Istarted doing this whole Bitcoin thingis I was just so inspired by it it justconsumed me all the time and this isjust out of my self-interest and I makemusic and I do things like that and Ijust want to spread the Bitcoin messagesome people do the same thing withwhether it be Christianity Buddhismwhatever religion they're into orwhatever it could be a sport it could bebasketball so some people pushed it youknow and from the state when you talkabout the state type propaganda that'stop down where like there's some form ofcoercion or some form of uh Forceinvolved there and so like when I thinkabout this uh Bitcoin just inspiring usto like push its own message it's it'sall driven by like uh bottom upincentives rather than some centralizedentity totally and I want to get intokind of the the basis of your you knowyour background and and coming into thisbut what what do you think it is ormaybe even just for yourself like whathas it beenthat's been so inspiring about Bitcoinlike what do you think it is aboutBitcoin that inspires you to take thetime and the attention and everythingthat's required to actuallyproduce this type of content but to dothis type of workyou know I for me personally I was likeuh like you know the Bitcoin ethos lowtime preference all that stuff I wasalwaysalready doing that prior to bitcoin butBitcoin gave that like Avenue uh a aviable option you know it made it likeuh it optimized that option for peoplewho do choose to take that path towardslike you knowum produce more than you consume type ofLifestyle where you you can you're aSavers it essentially uh incentivizesand assists Savers and um that questionyou asked about why do I think it's soinspiringwas that the original part of thequestion yeahyeah you know II think I don't know what it is exactlybutthere's a lot of aspects that Bitcointouches and one thing that always comesback to me is this concept of uh of timeand like uh this concept of time is likeum it in a sense it almost gives uh thisuh how do I say this Bitcoin Networklike with time like our time is solimited on live and it's absolutelyscarce and Bitcoin is the only thingthat matches that scarcity of our ourtime and here uh our time here on thisplanetright and that attribute of it and theeffect like the the consequence ofhaving that attribute seems to be thatitin a weird way allows you to mostproperly optimize your time as a resultof having that quality and as a resultof being able to effectively trade timeyou know with the the highest Fidelityever perhaps with other people and inthat trade in those exchanges doing whatexchange and trade always does which iscreate more value or or create more timeor at leastallow you to optimize your time put moremeaning into the amount of time you haveor something like that you know and Ithink I think that's probablyyeah I think that's an element of theinspiration that a lot of people drawfrom it certainly changes people'sinfluences people's perception of timeyou know in a number of different waysyou know both likein the sense of your own future like andand perhaps in the possibilities or thesecurity or the optionality that youhave around your own future because youhave this tool like the future becomes alot lessanxiety-inducing and you have a like agreater comfort with the futurebut also in that kind of value judgmentin terms of what should I do with mytime and I think it influences thatthinking in a lot of people too you knowin in for probably for multiple reasonsand in multiple ways but just to saythatI guess we're always confronted withthat question every second of every dayit's like what am I going to do at thistime and nestled within that is wellwhatever the answer that question isit's because I value that thing morethan all other options available to melet's say in that given scenario orcircumstance and I think um part ofbitcoin's capacity to inspire peopleis that it gives them more clarity onvalue itself and therefore what to dowith their time and therefore who andwho and what they want to become and youknow it's obviously a process and what Ifind so interesting in observing allthis is just seeing all the bitcoinersout there beginning to Grapple with thisand then you know seeing themanifestations of that process too so inyour case like the art that you makepublic and you know in other people'scases writing or businesses or orwhatever like these are all kind ofmanifestations of people establishing anew relationship with timetheir future and their and what theyvalue and how those things are beinginfluenced bythis tool in Bitcoinyeahumthat's a lot to dig into I don't knowwhere but attacked that part but uh Iagree with pretty much all of thatuh all right well why don't we startwith because I I know you've been makingmusic and stuff like that for ages Imean I looked at your YouTube page andyou got stuff there like a decade agopre-bitcoin I presumeum so what was the you know what was therabbit hole story for you how did youlike first come to come into this andthen I guess realizewell continue on down the rabbit hole asyou realize more and more what thisthing representsso originally I I made uh I made rapmusic and like that made rap beats backwhen I was like 13 14. and this is along time ago and then I just uh I've Ilearned via the Internet you know likeon forums back when I was 13 14 yearsold and then uh I just kept doing itkept doing it and then over time periodI got kind of I lost interest not lostinterest because I still made music butI just stopped posting I stopped sharingI just made music just for myself andthen over a long period of time and uh Igot into Bitcoin I think 2017 or soafter uhjust not making not being as active onmusic I got into Bitcoin and uh Bitcoinjust re re-sparked that uh that uhdesire to start retelling the newsstories because I was tired of uh doingthe whole YouTube Grind from 2010 to2012. like I was pretty like making alot of weekly videos trying to get theviews chasing the ad money and it wasn'tthat much money either and um I gottired of it and I I stopped Bitcoinreinspired me to tell new stories fromuh I guess the orange lens you would sayand uhI I just kept putting out the Bitcoincontent since and it's been like my museto write Melodies uh visit sound designall kinds of thingsand and but and so what year did you saythe Bitcoin you kind of got the Bitcointhesissay 27. oh the I mean no 2017 I startedinvesting into it I didn't get theBitcoin thesis until like 2018 late 2018early 2019 after a series of Andreasvideos and then I think it culminatedwith the Bitcoin Center in 2019 rightand then uh and then I just keptconsuming content since you know I wasthinkingum as I was watching a bunch of videosin preparation for thisand I'd seen most of the Bitcoin relatedones you know intermittently as youpublish on publish them on Twitter butlike like my own consumption obviouslyhas been oriented towards like Bitcoinrelated consumption for a while now butI it in a Bitcoin denominator World in ain a Bitcoin infused culture let's say Ijust feel like I think a lot of themusic is maybe going to become orientedtowardeither like investigating exploringelevating amplifyinguh celebrating these themes that youmight that we often discuss in Bitcoinwhether they be hope orIndependence or Freedom or truth likebecause it just these are suchmeaningful topics and this is suchthey're soabundantly and obviously imbued inBitcoin and they seem to bepropagating in us as a result of ourengagement with Bitcoin like I and togive it a little more context like Ithink about a lot of the Fiat music thatwe hear today yeah whether it's rap orpop or whatever it's all so superficialright so superficial just garbagebasically it's just filled with Fiatgarbage even if the tunes likeoftentimes like I can get down withright like I almost hate it sometimesbecause I'll hear like some Uber Fiatartist and their super Fiat lyrics butlike it's designed to get you to Bobyour head and move along with it rightso yeah I'm not saying that I don'tenjoy any other music than Bitcoin stuffbut I'm much moreI have a much like stronger response tomusic that still does that right Still'sgot a great beat and makes you Bob yourhead and tap your foot or whateverbut it's infused with like lyrics and meand uh and themes that are extremelymeaningful and I just like when you whenyou when the contrast is so evidentbecause you put them next next to eachotherit makes me excited that like I thinkwe're gonna see one far more of thatmusic because like yourself people a lotof a lot more people are going to beinspired to make it and I think it'slike it's actually going to be goodright it's not yeah there's beencategories of music in the past wherepeople are trying to likeI don't know promote their cause orfocus in on a particular thesis but it'skind of lame and I just feel like likeBitcoin yeah exactly exactly but I feellike Bitcoin inspired music is actuallyme dope as and I can't wait to likeI saw a tip actually I think she just acouple days ago I think she published aplaylist or uh or like awhat's the word I'm looking foryeah playlist or a CD or something withlike all of her tracks on on one thingthat you could just press play andlisten to and I like I look forward tomore of that because I think thecombination of the musical talent andand the Rhythm and all that kind ofstuff with the dealing with this methese themes that we all find someaningfulumis just going to be super appealing andso you know as you're a music produceras a music producer when I do listen tolike what will you redeem the Fiat musicI agree like a lot of it is pretty trashbut one thing I do appreciate is justthe engineering because uh the audioengineering has just gotten so muchbetter in the sound design so that partstill has me geeked but the part thatmakes me feel like a child or gives methat Joy of a child when I make thismusic is when uh I create something thatI Envision like a story like whether itbe whatever type of story that I want totie to bitcoin or even not Bitcoin theones where I want to tell a story andI'm able to execute on that and then I'mlike just I'm filled with this childlike Joy you know and they want to shareit with some people and then they feelthat similar or at least the feedback itfeels like it's similar that's when I doget the Goosebumps and I feel like likethe most fulfilled when making music butlike the Fiat stuff like you say it hasnice beats nice Melodies and nicerhythms and you know you jam into itright and to me I still enjoy that aswell like um because a lot of the peoplewho aren't into Bitcoin still love thatstuff too so I do enjoy that just fromthe engineering and sound designperspective butthe thing that makes me feel most likethat that childlike feeling is when Imake something where I tell that storyyeah yeah and interestingly enough Imean again maybe I'm I'm going out a bitgoing a bit out on a limb here but youcould make the case that like the soundgen engineering aspect of modern musicis kind of the proof of work aspect youknow that stuff is actually you knowyeah it's engineering it's it's it'shighly involved it's highly skilledbut when it comes to the lyrics that areriding on top of that work they're justFiat trash you knowum and May and you know it's maybe it'smostly The Sound Engineering that'sdoing most of the leg work there andthat's what kind of keeps peopleuhwell keep you know keeps people enjoyingit um even if the lyrics are shittybecause like it's likeokay I like to go but in audioengineering even things like umthere's songwriting not in terms oflyrics or Melodies but even in justsound design like you know because uhthe audio is a medium is just amazingwith frequencies you can make certainparts darker or brighter wider furtheryou know all these things you canmanipulate and and just in sound designand audio engineering alone there'ssongwriting involved in there it'salmost like uh I guess you would tiethat in actual writing to how youpunctuate or how you develop the rhythmof the sentences butin audio engineering you do the samejust playing around with the stereofield and frequenciesand to go back to what you said before Imeanwhy do you think it fills you with thatchildlike sort ofenergy when you're dealing with you knowmaking music around Bitcoin relatedthemesyou know for me it's like uh so I when Ido these videos I start with an idealike I usually say a line I just saylike when I just recently did a coupleweeks ago I did this the song Runawaywhere I covered Kanye's runaway and Idid a Bitcoin version to it I had thisone line that only it's just one line inthe whole rap but it you start off withthis line and then you you over time youbuild that that idea of this line andand the line was there's a hole in theheart where the soul should be that wasthe line that I I just it just stuckwith me for like weeks and I couldn'twrite this write this rappers but it itstarted from that line hole in the heartwhere the soul should be and theneventually I get I built theinstrumental around it build the wraparound it recorded the song put it allmix and everything do the audioengineering part and then I I startedgrabbing the video clips I started doingthe the typography work and then it allcomes to like just it's almost likeWorld building you know you knowsoftware Engineers they they create appsand programs that people could dance inor YouTube lies and operate in and withsongwriting and video editing it's likeyou you start with this I started withthis one idea and I eventually builtthis little mini worldthat is within those two and a half ortwo minute song you know and that partlike just from like I have this inklingof an idea and then to see it fullyfleshed out that's the part that makesme feel uh yeah I feel like a childright because you kind of get to likeyou said create your ownlittle mini world slash story I mean asyou're saying that I I think of the TheRemnant one that you did as well andlike you know I guess you because I'venoticed lately am I writing in sayingthat I think you're using some like AIimagery and stuff in some of your workI am using a lot of AI imagery and uhtext to speech generation so like a lotof the AI protect like uh yeah so the AIimagery for sure I don't actually createthe AI menu because my prompt writingevery time I do it it's just bad I justdownload people's cool AI imagery andline it up with mine but uh all rightthe text one is is eerily creepy I'vedone uh they've modeled rappers whereI've done one with pressure T andKendrick Lamarand they both sound really good I'vedone one where I had uh just a narrationwhere like he sounds like a coolnarrator and I'm telling like uh thisfuturistic Citadel story about like 400a b 400 years after Bitcoins at theGenesis block and and uh it just it'sscary I'll say that it's scarily goodlike how good this AI stuff is yeah noso I didn't even realize I mean I kindof expected that it would exist but Iwasn't as familiar with the text tospeechum stuff like I'd seen the imagegeneration and the chat Bots and stuffbut not the text-to-speech butum your stuff andI think one the tip just recentlyreleased had like Tupac and Jay-Z yeahin it and I was like holy I wasjust inspired by her goodbecause she did one a couple months backwhen she first did Tupac and Jay-Z and Iwas like I looked it up and then I didit and yeah it just sounds really reallygood and it does to make the flow andeverything work it does require a littlebit of mingling and audio editing but ingeneral it's pretty darn goodyeah I mean so I mean just as an asidelikewhat happensto how we interpretlike reality basically certainly what wesee in the digital on you know onlineand stuff when faces and voice like haveyou seen the the face generationlike do you see that Tom Cruise onewhere some guy like yeah yeah the Deepfakes so when you can do that with theimage and then also with the voiceyou know like we're in such spookyterritory where you have no idea ifsomething's real or not you know to meit's a double-edged sword because like Iobviously like I'm not going to pay abunch of these rappers you know to makesongs with me or I'm not gonna like hirelike these uh voice actors to make likejust a quick Twitter video so it gives alot of people access to be creative onthe flip side like we were just talkingwe started off with propaganda andthings of that nature like this could bemass produced and like people wouldn'tbe able to discern the differencebetween reality and faith and soyeah double-ed sword for sure yeah wellthat certainly seems to be where we'regoingum do you see yourself as like someonewho's trying to promote big like are youtrying to propagandize or is this justlike you can't help but do itI do feel like umI I would say on the edge I would sayyeah I would sound propaganda yeah I Itruly think this is like uh like justParadigm shiftingum just technology and like it's it'schanging the way I view the world andit's redefining words for me so yeah Ihope to us because I I find tremendousvalue interacting with Bitcoin so when Imake these songs and messages I hopepeople canand the people who are already in theBitcoin because I think my stuff is notfor like new new people into Bitcoin butit's still like make uh hotlers evenmore convicted I guess so yeah I wouldsay to embolden the huddlers and justjust double down on your convictionyeah well I I certainly think it hasthat effect becauseI know a lot of people love itum how has Bitcoin changed how you seethe world or influenced your perspectiveyou know the for me it's the um theAustrian perspective like when I firstgot into Bitcoin like Andreas reallytaught me why this is important thenafter diving down to safety Dean's workand then I just Dove down like Yash andrabbit hole we just read a lot of workfrom there it just really helped me um Iguess they call it practiology but uh ithelped me just deduct and and observeall kinds of uhthings in life outside of Bitcoinwhether it be uh nutrition or whether itbe uh anything I can it helps me moreclearly see the world and better explainand articulate my my thoughts and ideasyeah and just from like uh just justbecause I put a little bit of money intoit in 2017 because I was you know I wantto make some money but and then you knowa couple of money stay for the money andthen change your world view it's likeyeah it's pretty nutsit's totally nuts do you have likefriends peers family that either seeyour work orhave noticed you know that shiftand have questions about it or have youorange filled everyone in your life orwell my brothers are both pretty orangepills now uh they're pretty they're noton a Bitcoin sweater like that and Iguess majority Bitcoin is on bitcoinTwitter but like yeah probably mybrothers they're pretty orange peeled umI do remember though back in 2019 uhthere is a short list I remember readingI think it was like the fourth part inBrandon Quinn's mycelium essay series orsomething and I just called my bigbrother and I was just telling him likeoh we gotta like the symbiosis withBitcoin or and I was just telling it'sgoing to change human evolution blahblah blah and he's like bro he thought Iwas crazy brothat's a 2020 after 2020. I pretty mucheverybody uh like at least in my closergoes like understood the thesis and justhumbly stacked after 2020. really andthe response to it on yeah wow that'simpressiveI got people in my life that get thethesis butnot totally like I think they're kind ofhedging you know they're like oh likethis seems to be something new and seemsto be not going away and John's notcompletely insane so like there's maybewe should listen to him a tiny bit butuh but definitely not like seeing theorange light sort of orange pilled so ifyou've got people that are just on thehumble stack and you know on the grindthat way that's or several people inyour life that are doing that that'spretty impressiveum what do you think like is this ismaking music your career or do you wantit to be or you know how do you see thisevolving over timeI don't know yet I'm just a legit I usedto be former military now I just uh Iwork a blue collar job I solder I manageproperties I work you know and uh makingmusic I look at it as like I love thegym I love basketball I love music thoseare certain things I do right it's justlike a part of likeyou know things that fulfill me and soI'm gonna just keep doing it and peoplewant if it becomes a career cool if notthat's cool too I just I've just beendoing it for a long time right what'sthe response been like to the Bitcoinvideos in particular like on Twitter andstuff like that I mean I'm sure it'sbeen I'm sure it's pretty positive butyou know any any particular standoutsalthough it's been overwhelminglypositive but uh one thing just for meobserving my own uh my own work is onething that I I find pretty rewarding iswhen I first started my my musicproduction overshadowed the videoproduction but over time my videoproduction slowly catching up and justgetting just almost or close to uh myaudio production and my music itself sojust personal development was that Ijust find like I've been getting betterat uh a video production as well as justdistilling these ideasbecause Bitcoin has really Grand ideaslike at least the things in the world ofBitcoin distilling it into a short ideainto a two minute video or or somethingalong those lines it's just been verygood at uh just being more precise withthe messaging it's been making me betterat it nice is there a particular aspectof Bitcoin that you find MostFascinating and I'll give you somecontext for that uh question likeyou know there's many aspects of Bitcoinof course you know the monetary historycase the current macroeconomic case theRenaissance 2.0 the individualtransformation and kind of shift inperspective like we mentioned the timepreference piece all that kind of stuffso I like to on this podcast inparticular like to delve into like howthis has changed people's behavior uhand yeah you know what I usually say islike if something doesn't changepeople's behavior then you know what'sits relevance really and so the factthat this thing is changing people'sperception and therefore their behaviorso dramatically and so positively and soconsistently like to me that is just themost insanely interesting phenomenon onthe go but is there an aspect that youlike to focus on or that you'reparticularly intrigued by in Bitcointhat ends up inspiring a lot of the yourworkyou know of late I've been trying toI've been I guess looking far out intothe future like long after we're gone soone of the things I guess they call itbeing getting Cosmic with Bitcoin orwhatever you know and one one thing I dolike is uh like in the uh video where Idid uh sampled you in American hot onwhere or you talk about uhuh the where's my mind remix why notRemix by the Pixies that was awesome youknowthat one I remember your line reallylike uh you're because I had thisconcept that was that I thought of thatwas similar to the line you said whereyou said uh these predicates that werehuman civilization were based upon I'massuming you meant property and how wedefend these property rights or whateverand then uhand that you said that line where likewhat does it mean when we're going tobuild what is civilization going to lookwhen these predicates aren't evennecessary because the Bitcoin Networkalready handles a lot of it you knowknuts find a home he says uh knowing hisowning and then it's similar to the thethis whole concept of property and Ijust been thinking about these wordsthat for me the future of the I thinkabout this futuristic Bitcoin worldwhereum just these certain words are justlike flipped on his head and the thingswe we think of as property today orwhatever it is today isn't the same inthe Bitcoin world and for me it's justredefining words such as umof recent times you've seen the conceptof yield you know things blowing upwe're trying to attach bi games to theBitcoin world butafter seeing all this recently and andjust redefining trying to redefine worseme the concept of yield has changed orthe concept of ownership because to meyield like when we talk about yield inthe Fiat sense you're talking aboutpercentages you're talking about thesenumbers that are getting these nominalgains on on whatever it is but afterseeing these last couple months I'vebeen really like trying torefocus on this word I don't know whybutyield to me in the Bitcoin standardyielding might be like uh the assistantChapel or a very beautiful painting tome a lot of these old old works arestill yielding returns today or like abeautiful building it still yieldingreturns it could be you'll return athousand years into the future 100 yearsinto the future and so like bitcoin'sredefining like re reshaping how I viewcertain things andI wonder how that that looks like aftermany many iterations into the futurethat's interesting so you mean thatyield taking on a non-financialdefinition exactly because because Iremember last summer I was helping myuncle we were building he was building atemple in Southern California I washelping him so I I me and a couplecousins we were helping themand uh he doesn't uh he hit there is aninvestment of his time and energy butthere is no not there is no yield interms of uh of whether it be Fiatdollars just there's nothing coming backother than they're getting a place ofworship you know a place to getcongregate and worship and come togetherfor his community and uhto me so what like things like that likeyield or in your video the video Isampled you you're talking aboutproperty the concept of property isgoing to change it's almost likea private key like our currentviewership of a propertyit doesn't really apply to bitcoin youknow because that because me and youcould know the same private key and inthat case who owns the Bitcoinyou know so so for me it's just allthese redefining uh yeah just redefiningyour perspective and how you viewcertain things yeah well I guess that'salways a Hallmark of a paradigm shiftand if we're making the case thatBitcoin is the biggest paradigm shiftand perhaps that's to be expected butyou know to go back to the yieldthing I'm sure you've heard the jokeum I think Alan Farrington I don't knowif he made it up but I don't see himI've seen him wear the T-shirt yieldedsome friends we made along the way whichis kind of like tongue-in-cheek uhcritique of of you know the yieldfarming and all that kind of that'shappened in the space so you don't haveyour you don't have you lost all yourmoney but uh you still have some friendsperhaps but you know it is aninteresting point thatuhperhaps we will be more place morefocused or emphasis or at least be moreaware onwhat we get from our investment from ourwork that perpetuates even beyond ourown experience perhaps like thenon-financial returns of doing anythingreally and I think that you know yourexample of the church is a good one or aplace of worship orlike just like thatthat should be beautiful yeah or someexactly or something beautiful a piece apiece of music or artwork or video likethethe yield on that or the return on thatjust is able to perpetuate and continuefor you know however long the the pieceof art or the theoutput of the work is able to persistand you know how how much how do you puta value on how much satisfactioninspiration Joy you know all thesethings that people get out of thoseworksyou know and andshould you or can you factor that intomotivation and or planning for actuallydoing work for actually undertaking aproject and I think you know in this inthis Paradigm wherepeople have less anxiety about thefuture they're more financially stablethere they have more Financial Securitytherefore they can pursue things thatare more meaningful I think like thatdomain of consideration willdramatically open up to people becauseyou you you're able to slowly get offthe hamster wheel where you're justbasically trying to survive and you'retrying to Stave off deprivation and whenyou have that more greater abundance oftime when you have that greaterabundance of security when you have thatmore sort ofuh like mental Clarity or or calmness orpeace then you can focus on like okaywhat do I want to devote myself to andwhat are the returns or so-called yieldsthat I'm looking to get out of it andmaybe it's it has nothing to do with afinancial return maybe you're like Ineed to devote myself to like a year ofworking and what I hope to produce atthe end of it I hope that the benefit ofthat is people being a you know amillion people being inspired or peoplebeing able to be inspired foreven after I'm gone or or just pureenjoyment that people are able to accessin some way like I think the luxury ofbeing able to consider our work in thatway is one of the benefits that Bitcoinis delivering and I think it's going tobe beautiful when more and more peopleare put in a position where they canlook at things in that way where it'snot always about reducing your relativescarcity let's say but when you'reactuallyconsidering how to deploy your limitedresourcesin ways that will returnthe intangibles like Joy like like uhhappiness and and that kind of stuff andnot justyou know how much you know what's myfinancial gain from from undertakingthis activityyeah it's like uh you know how I startedI'll tell you I get this childlike Joywhen I make some of these songs and tellthese stories and see it kind offruition now that now that I thoughtabout it like that is the yield you knowyeah like it's just feeling that likebecause you know some people like theyget to old age and they just becomebitter yeah and they that could bebecause that's how they are or it couldbe the system just working against themyou know where like all their actionsjust seem to never amount himlike it's a hopeful future or whateverit is and they just get battered downand beaten and for me like yeah becauseof Bitcoin it's changed the trajectivewhat the way I was moving forward and uhit like this even just things like thismaking a song like that's that's a inthe grand scheme of things it's verytrivial just something like doing myfree time it just provided me this Joylike just kissed me rejuvenated andpositive and feeling grateful to youknow yeah 100 and I think it was in oneof your recent videos that uh sailoralluded to that as well or or basicallyreflectedwell yeah and because you know I asked Iguess I asked him why and he saidsomething to the effect that like youknow the current system grinds peopledown you know it doesn't deliver to themwhat they need you know to be lifted upand to be ambitious and to be hopefuland it and as you say that can result inthat person that you just alluded tothat might be bitter at the end of theircareer because they've just beenstaving off deprivation their whole lifeand not engaging in things that actuallybring meaning and joy and value intotheir life and Bitcoin is Hope becauseit's a mechanism that actually allowsthat to be reversed actually allowspeople to now shift the focus and bringthose things more into their life andmore into to abundance or you know notnecessarily I mean they can still pursuematerial ends but they would be far morefree to determine what those are forthemselves rather thanagain being subject to uhyou know the deprivations or subject torelative scarcity as a result of beingstolen from surreptitiously you know andwithout any means of of stopping thatandthat's certainly been again anotherobservation for me like if I if you lookout on in Bitcoin land and as you saidearlier like how much of is representedon Twitter probably not very much of itbut to the extent that it isI see a lot of that sort of behaviorwhere bitcoiners engage in things thatlike are not uh financially rewardinglet's say you know they do them out ofpure inspiration they do them at a purecontribution they do them out of Charitylike multiple non-financial rewardreasons andI think and there's there's a specificreason for many of them let's say or aprimary reason but I think likesomewhere around there is likeuh they want to access I mean they'reclearly doing it because it's meaningfuland the meaning is not nominal you knownot financial and that just seems to beso common now is to be a norm likepeople are so motivated and inspired bythis thing that they're willing toostensibly sacrifice you know resourceslike you know or waste resources from aconventional sense to contribute orcreate in this way but what they receivein return is definitionallymore valuable than what they've given upand therefore it's it's obviously not awaste and in many cases it'stremendouslyum inspiring to many people Beyondthemselves you know as is the case withyour work and other you know creators inthe space writers in the space all sortsof things and soyou know the thing I like toor that gives me goosebumps occasionallyit's like I I wind the clock forwardFive Years on that because it's it's soearly and and even a few years ago noneof none of that was really thatappearance you know of course like youknow devs were you know devoting theirtime to working on you know Bitcoin corelet's say and other stuff like that butnot on the same scale whatsoever andthree three short years later I meanit's far more apparent and so what aboutfive years from now you know whenpresumably the value of Bitcoin is muchhigher there's way more people in thespace there's way more Avenues toexpress that those sort of sentimentsit's justI can't wait which is why I'm sograteful I know what you mean front rowC4because even like last cycle I thinkninety percent of the content you wouldsee was just trading talk it was justlike it was charts it was like 90 of thespace was charged outside of thetechnical stuff and I think the onlyperson that would push it to people thatcould understand like me was probablyAndreas that's probably like there'svery few and uh and you know back to thewhole uh giving like the more the giversin the Bitcoin space where you'retalking about like these people are notdoing a lot of it aren't isn't forfinancial reward because it's just not abig market for this stuff yeah but Ithink that has to tie back to the timepreference right the lower your timepreference becomes you're more able togive because you're more certain of thefuture and so I think that has to docome back to the the time preference itmay be because big interacting withBitcoin uh extends your time Horizonlong enough whereit really does change is we're like uhwe can do rewarding things like givebecause giving you know one of thethings I always believed in is like asmuch given you you get back and so yeahI think that that has probably has thelink with the time preference at leastwhen I think of it initially yeah andthe same is truefor that same reason for likeundertaking great works like youmentioned it you know a church a fewminutes ago and you think about theselike insanely inspiring monuments aroundthe world and I know you know againthere's been various motivations and youknow in some cases it was a top-downapproach and and slaves were you knowemployed to build these things but othertimes it was artists and Artisans whoout of their own inspiration wanted toglorify an idea basically or create aplace of worship or showcaseshowcase something showcase somethinginspiring and came together to to makeit andthe more I think the more a society isoriented towards low time preferencebecause perhaps the money in use and theother cultural factors that areDownstream of that uh the more the moreof that you get but also the more Ithink like the greaterthe more amazing it is or the greaterquality is because all those peopleyou know are so capable of committingand devoting themselves to the work andso you don't get as many cut Corners youdon't you know you're not rushing thingsall that stuff and and so quality reallygets to shine through and the the thereason for undertaking that work theinspiration and the and the you know thejoy and the meaning can be like reallyshowcased it really gets imbued in thework as a result of Simply that capacityto uh well simply the availability ofthe time to do it so the availabilityfor all those people involved to havethe time to not be a tremendoussacrifice basically like they can theycan bear it and they're not going tostarve and their families aren't goingto start starve and all that kind ofstuff and you know weas cultures and societies andcivilizations I mean it almost seems thecase thatyou know maybe we always take two stepsforward and one step back because likethethe capital Foundation that people haveavailable to is that have the peoplehave to Avail of let's sayum continues to degrade or dissolve overa few generations for a variety ofreasons confiscations inflationRevolution whatever and justand I don't think we'll completely uhBitcoin is not going to completelyresolve that because I think there'llalways be a sense of it'll all be acircularity to development I thinkthere'll always be the pitfalls ofapathy and comfort and things like thatbut it does seem to be the case thatlike the Capital stock the capitalFoundation the the foundation of wealththat each individual and each family andas a result a society has will be farmore impervious to that kind ofdegradation to wherever you knowwhatever form of whatever instigatesthat degradation or whatever the causeof it is and as a result I mean the thestarting point of of wealth in time andtherefore the the starting point oflike determining what's most valuableand meaningful and then applying yourwork and applying your trade in thatDirectionwill be so much more available to peopleand that should necessitate and Fosterand contribute to a far morebeautiful abundantI would say peacefulfulfilling meaningful culture andsociety would it notyeah I agree and because you know I Ilike to I sometimes try to catch myselftoo well because I think I think ofthose things a lot as well of like whatit means when we can just protectourselves from the like you said thedegradation of society and individualshaving a tool that can protectthemselves but I do like to think aboutBitcoin and its incentives you knowbecause sometimes when we think likethat I personally I get two utopianssometimes like like you know what I meanthis is like uh chill out chill outBitcoins at Utopia I was out there bymyself like especially when I'mpreaching Bitcoinbut uh the incentives doesum like you say like um allows for likefor individuals to at least protectthemselves from like uh a society of ifyou have a society that's lessproductive or or a society where thesethings erode and degrade at least thereis this tool to protect you and I'd liketo think of Bitcoin and I'll actuallythink of these systems in winners andlosers you know the Fiat systemincentivizes I guess you would say theftor or that cancel uh chasing that cancelon position or chasing them to be in aposition of like the cancel on Alpha Iguess you would say right and whereand then in the Bitcoin world where it'slike the incentives isI don't like to me yes we do depend onothers in the Bitcoin world but likeindividually whatever you produce orwhatever you and a group of other groupof individuals can produce theincentives align with the individualmore so than like um the parasite Iguess or the kennel on Alpha I just I'mgonna show you it's not working out nothat's I I like the term and I I totallyagree and that's why I think it's sosustainable is because exactly the theincentives basically align and andpeople are able to keep the fruits oftheir labor and then have the capacityto exchange them with everyone else andI I that's why I think it leads to morepeace and more abundance and and greatersecurity and again I mean of course weall have to check ourselvesumI mean we can be forgiven right becausethis is such a radically different thisis such a radically new thing for us tocomprehend and contend with and we'retrying to connect all the dots and onceyou connect the dots you know rememberthose like children's books where youlike you connect the dots and what youend up drawing like a uh a castle orsomethingcan you hear me Jeff yepI don't know how long it's Gonna LastForever all right we'll we'll uh whathappened you the battery on your airpodsdied or something yeah my battery'sairpods are dying can you forget achicken can you use the the mic or thespeaker on your phoneyou know it's it's busted my phone'spretty busted oh okay okay all rightwell we'll we'll shut it down soon butum on the Utopia question you know likewe're all my point was just that we'reall trying to figure out what this meansright and as we do that we try to beintellectually honest we try not toyou know delude ourselves butit does seem like you know if youanalyzehistory up to this point you you try toanalyze like what those predicates werethat manifested the world we have todayand you say okay what happens if youswitch those out what happened if whathappens if you fundamentally change thecharacteristics of those things whatlogically would you expect to resultfrom that and I think you know many ofusyou know that's the Bitcoin Renaissancesort of vision andit I think it's good for well I thinkit's going to be really really reallypositive but as you say there is noUtopia and there will always be problemsand if for no other reason thatuh we get complacent and we getapathetic no matter how good thestructure of the system that we'reembedded within is and so I you know asa side note I think that's why kind ofritual and tradition is going to be suchan important thing in a Bitcoin standardbecause I thinkthat's going to be one method probablyamong many of reminding ourselves andlet's say it's done on a family orCommunity or so or or you know even astate or a larger level but these thesesort of rituals are going to be used orTraditions to remind us of the thingsthat are valuable that we ought not toto to forgetum to try to avoid the pitfalls of thepast knowing that they're ultimatelyunavoidable but perhaps mitigate the howdestructive they might be you know asthe cycles of history wax and Wayne andwe move forwardyou know I like to think of Bitcoin notneeding these Traditions or ritualsbecause like if you don't like if youdon't hold your keys or if you don't runyour note or you rely on somebody elseto do all this for you like you say likeif if like my let's say five generationsand your kids kidsum they decide you know I don't want totake the ownership of owning my own Keysyou know I'm gonna give it to thisversion of that TX or whatever you knowso like it almost like differentselection and it's a system you justself-regulates itself and just weedsthose people out oh oh you want to putyour coins on Mount gox or like theversion of that in 50 years or in 30years or something and sothat's how I like to look at it and sothe trajectory is away from the mountCox is the way from the cell season anduh all these uh centralized institutionsyeah I agree with you and and I thinkeven something likelike your your key ceremony like you'recoming of age ceremony like that thatmight even be a thing within familieslike okay son or daughter you're 13 nowthis is your entry into adulthood maybethere's other aspects of that in termsof knowledge and experience and takingresponsibility but one of them might belike now is when you take charge orresponsibility for your keys foryourself dad's not you know that Mom andDad aren't doing it for you anymore andthat is kind of ceremonialized becauseof how important it is you knowum and it it gives them the propercontext the proper weight the properGravity the proper set upum but even even though I agree like Ithink this thissystem helps to self-regulate in thatway and it it just punishes people whodon't treat it properly and thatself-corrective mechanism will go a longway to producing what we'd probably deempositive outcomes in societyum I just do think I think we willdiscover like all these these themesthat we've been just discussing likevalue and meaning and and work and whatto devote ourselves to when we're out ofa state of deprivation you know and wecan reallywe can determine how we're going todeploy our resourcesoutside of a context of necessity let'ssay I think those sort of things mightinspirethe refinement or the evolution or thereintroduction of tradition in some waysbecause we'll I feel like we'll discovermeaning or things will become ofsufficient value and we'll want toglorify it really and and remember it incertain ways and possibly in ways thatareuhsomewhat superordinate may be to justthe self-regulating mechanism of uh youknow I do agree with you like like theserituals around like these very technicalthings whether it's possessing your ownprivate Key Making certain transactionsI have been trying to like I think Itold you earlier I've been trying topersonify or make symbolize these verytechnical aspects of Bitcoin and maybeall the people who created whether it bepitchers art paintings writings whateverlike or music I've been trying tosymbolize these uh very technical thingsinto this uh you know beyond just I justdid a cryptographic signature you knowbeyond that and so like give it there'sa way to make it into a ritual or aceremony like you say and so like maybethere's all this music and all this artand all this cultural things aroundBitcoin is driving us towards thatritualistic and ceremonial aspects ofsomething pretty darn technical yeah Ithink that could definitely be the caseand then you know another one that seemsto be emerging already in the space islike people's relationship to food seemsto be changing at least for some againlike I'm I always generally for me itdid I did at first I was like man Icould never had safety you know likehe's crazy you know and then my brothersent me Jordan Peterson video and SeanBaker on Rogan I watched itI did it for two years I went Carnivalfor two years and I wasn't like I waslike in decent shape and then I justlost a lot of even more weight I thoughtI was already and I just lost moreweight and so yeah it definitely it doesmake you question everything whether itbe food politics everything right rightbut that's exactly my point so I thinkthat will happen for all areas but Ithink one of the potential outcomes ofthat is like as youdo I still got youyeah you're still here okay I lost yourvideo but uh just checking you're stillthereum I think one of the other like forexample let's say when you have that newrelationship to food like I see ithappening and I see it happening withmyself likechanging diet wanting to have adifferent relationship to my foodwanting to have a direct relationship tothe farmer who grows it or raises thecattle maybe even wanting to be there inthe process of harvesting that meat andceremonializing that in some way toexpress my gratitude for the farmer'swork for the animal's life for all theprocess that goes into it like I couldand all of that just by virtue ofthe changing perception or meaning thatI'm ascribing to my relationship to myown sustenance and then what you knowand of course there's an a reciprocalsort of meaning there it's like well ifI'm going to acceptand go and and uhand and express my gratitude for thework and this of the farmer and thesacrifice of the animal let's say howdoes that influence how I treat myselfright like how does that influence how Idetermine my own action in order toexpress my gratitude for that and so allof that taken together you could veryeasily see ritual forming around thatbecause it's such asuch an important thing such ameaningful thing and so I don't knowwhat shape that will take but just tosay I think those are the types ofthings by virtue of our changeperception of and change relationship toall these different things food andotherwise I can seethat Amplified meaning coalescing intorituals and traditions that end upbecoming more refined and more refinedand more ingrained into our lives andour culture and that kind of thingall right well Richard is havingtechnical problems so we're gonna haveto shut it down but and he won't be ableto respond but Richard thank you fortaking the time man I appreciate uh yourworkcan't wait to see more of it in thefuture and uh we will do this againsometime peace brotherlet's do it well Richardhow's it going man I'm uh I'm thank youfor doing this I'm looking forward to itthank you John and I appreciate you andyour funum so I mean well I appreciate a lot ofyour work I mean I I'm a huge fan ofeveryone really who is inspired tocreate in this spaceum it's just amazing how inspiring thisthing is and then to see everyone kindof translating it in their own way youknow with their own Swagger and stufflike that like I just love it and yourstuff has been incredible I always loveto see new drops and so I just wanted toget together for a chat and kind of heara bit of your story your inspirationyour process and whatever else you wantto talk aboutum and Bitcoin it definitely just bringsout uh like you said it's just soinspiring and Bitcoin itself is rathertechnical but one thing is like you knowas I learned these technical aspects ofBitcoin it really like I know it's not aperson or it's an organism that somepeople would say but like thesetechnical aspects of late I've beenutilizing that and trying to personifyparts of Bitcoin and that's one of thethings I've been doing lately in regardsto the music and just trying to give uhthis non-person thing human-likequalities yeah I like it and and I agreeyou know for a lot of people this thingis probably fairly foreign you knowbecause a lot of people aren'tinterested in economics or monetaryhistory or technology or any of thatkind of stuff and I feel like you know alot of the art that gets produced in thespace and yours in particular like itgives it that personal slash emotionalslash aspirational Dimension and that isobviously far more appealing to peoplebecause everyone can relate to I meanthat's kind of what art is right itrelates to the emotional part or theinspirational part of someone ratherthan you know hardcore technicalunderstandings of things and I thinkthat just makes it far more relatable sowhen someone sees like your video Ithink a recent one was Bitcoin is Hoperight where uh I think myself and sailorhad a little excerpt in it and that'syou know that's an appealing messagethat everyone can understand everyoneunderstands the the function or thefeeling of hope they might notimmediately understand how Bitcoin fitsinto that picture but giving them like ataste of likeyou know opening a window I guess tothat element of this phenomenon thatmaybe piques their interests and causethem to go further and learn more I meanI think that's the role of art generallyand I just love that you know you canyou can call it propaganda in a way youknow because all this stuff is kind ofit is propaganda promoting Bitcoin butlike I was thinking before we came onlike what's the differentiating factorbetweenlike State propaganda and this and Iwould say thatlike this is naturally inspiredpropaganda right it's like it's notbeing imposed on anyone it's not for anyparticular end it's just kind ofit's the result of inspiration and itmay serve the function of propaganda itmay serve the function of bringingpeople in and anduh and trying to get them to think aboutit in a certain way I guess but it'svery different from like a statecentralized narrow sort ofpropaganda I would sayit's bottom up too like the reason why Istarted doing this whole Bitcoin thingis I was just so inspired by it it justconsumed me all the time and this isjust out of my self-interest and I makemusic and I do things like that and Ijust want to spread the Bitcoin messagesome people do the same thing withwhether it be Christianity Buddhismwhatever religion they're into orwhatever it could be a sport it could bebasketball so some people pushed it youknow and from the state when you talkabout the state type propaganda that'stop down where like there's some form ofcoercion or some form of uh Forceinvolved there and so like when I thinkabout this uh Bitcoin just inspiring usto like push its own message it's it'sall driven by like uh bottom upincentives rather than some centralizedentity totally and I want to get intokind of the the basis of your you knowyour background and and coming into thisbut what what do you think it is ormaybe even just for yourself like whathas it beenthat's been so inspiring about Bitcoinlike what do you think it is aboutBitcoin that inspires you to take thetime and the attention and everythingthat's required to actuallyproduce this type of content but to dothis type of workyou know I for me personally I was likeuh like you know the Bitcoin ethos lowtime preference all that stuff I wasalwaysalready doing that prior to bitcoin butBitcoin gave that like Avenue uh a aviable option you know it made it likeuh it optimized that option for peoplewho do choose to take that path towardslike you knowum produce more than you consume type ofLifestyle where you you can you're aSavers it essentially uh incentivizesand assists Savers and um that questionyou asked about why do I think it's soinspiringwas that the original part of thequestion yeahyeah you know II think I don't know what it is exactlybutthere's a lot of aspects that Bitcointouches and one thing that always comesback to me is this concept of uh of timeand like uh this concept of time is likeum it in a sense it almost gives uh thisuh how do I say this Bitcoin Networklike with time like our time is solimited on live and it's absolutelyscarce and Bitcoin is the only thingthat matches that scarcity of our ourtime and here uh our time here on thisplanetright and that attribute of it and theeffect like the the consequence ofhaving that attribute seems to be thatitin a weird way allows you to mostproperly optimize your time as a resultof having that quality and as a resultof being able to effectively trade timeyou know with the the highest Fidelityever perhaps with other people and inthat trade in those exchanges doing whatexchange and trade always does which iscreate more value or or create more timeor at leastallow you to optimize your time put moremeaning into the amount of time you haveor something like that you know and Ithink I think that's probablyyeah I think that's an element of theinspiration that a lot of people drawfrom it certainly changes people'sinfluences people's perception of timeyou know in a number of different waysyou know both likein the sense of your own future like andand perhaps in the possibilities or thesecurity or the optionality that youhave around your own future because youhave this tool like the future becomes alot lessanxiety-inducing and you have a like agreater comfort with the futurebut also in that kind of value judgmentin terms of what should I do with mytime and I think it influences thatthinking in a lot of people too you knowin in for probably for multiple reasonsand in multiple ways but just to saythatI guess we're always confronted withthat question every second of every dayit's like what am I going to do at thistime and nestled within that is wellwhatever the answer that question isit's because I value that thing morethan all other options available to melet's say in that given scenario orcircumstance and I think um part ofbitcoin's capacity to inspire peopleis that it gives them more clarity onvalue itself and therefore what to dowith their time and therefore who andwho and what they want to become and youknow it's obviously a process and what Ifind so interesting in observing allthis is just seeing all the bitcoinersout there beginning to Grapple with thisand then you know seeing themanifestations of that process too so inyour case like the art that you makepublic and you know in other people'scases writing or businesses or orwhatever like these are all kind ofmanifestations of people establishing anew relationship with timetheir future and their and what theyvalue and how those things are beinginfluenced bythis tool in Bitcoinyeahumthat's a lot to dig into I don't knowwhere but attacked that part but uh Iagree with pretty much all of thatuh all right well why don't we startwith because I I know you've been makingmusic and stuff like that for ages Imean I looked at your YouTube page andyou got stuff there like a decade agopre-bitcoin I presumeum so what was the you know what was therabbit hole story for you how did youlike first come to come into this andthen I guess realizewell continue on down the rabbit hole asyou realize more and more what thisthing representsso originally I I made uh I made rapmusic and like that made rap beats backwhen I was like 13 14. and this is along time ago and then I just uh I've Ilearned via the Internet you know likeon forums back when I was 13 14 yearsold and then uh I just kept doing itkept doing it and then over time periodI got kind of I lost interest not lostinterest because I still made music butI just stopped posting I stopped sharingI just made music just for myself andthen over a long period of time and uh Igot into Bitcoin I think 2017 or soafter uhjust not making not being as active onmusic I got into Bitcoin and uh Bitcoinjust re re-sparked that uh that uhdesire to start retelling the newsstories because I was tired of uh doingthe whole YouTube Grind from 2010 to2012. like I was pretty like making alot of weekly videos trying to get theviews chasing the ad money and it wasn'tthat much money either and um I gottired of it and I I stopped Bitcoinreinspired me to tell new stories fromuh I guess the orange lens you would sayand uhI I just kept putting out the Bitcoincontent since and it's been like my museto write Melodies uh visit sound designall kinds of thingsand and but and so what year did you saythe Bitcoin you kind of got the Bitcointhesissay 27. oh the I mean no 2017 I startedinvesting into it I didn't get theBitcoin thesis until like 2018 late 2018early 2019 after a series of Andreasvideos and then I think it culminatedwith the Bitcoin Center in 2019 rightand then uh and then I just keptconsuming content since you know I wasthinkingum as I was watching a bunch of videosin preparation for thisand I'd seen most of the Bitcoin relatedones you know intermittently as youpublish on publish them on Twitter butlike like my own consumption obviouslyhas been oriented towards like Bitcoinrelated consumption for a while now butI it in a Bitcoin denominator World in ain a Bitcoin infused culture let's say Ijust feel like I think a lot of themusic is maybe going to become orientedtowardeither like investigating exploringelevating amplifyinguh celebrating these themes that youmight that we often discuss in Bitcoinwhether they be hope orIndependence or Freedom or truth likebecause it just these are suchmeaningful topics and this is suchthey're soabundantly and obviously imbued inBitcoin and they seem to bepropagating in us as a result of ourengagement with Bitcoin like I and togive it a little more context like Ithink about a lot of the Fiat music thatwe hear today yeah whether it's rap orpop or whatever it's all so superficialright so superficial just garbagebasically it's just filled with Fiatgarbage even if the tunes likeoftentimes like I can get down withright like I almost hate it sometimesbecause I'll hear like some Uber Fiatartist and their super Fiat lyrics butlike it's designed to get you to Bobyour head and move along with it rightso yeah I'm not saying that I don'tenjoy any other music than Bitcoin stuffbut I'm much moreI have a much like stronger response tomusic that still does that right Still'sgot a great beat and makes you Bob yourhead and tap your foot or whateverbut it's infused with like lyrics and meand uh and themes that are extremelymeaningful and I just like when you whenyou when the contrast is so evidentbecause you put them next next to eachotherit makes me excited that like I thinkwe're gonna see one far more of thatmusic because like yourself people a lotof a lot more people are going to beinspired to make it and I think it'slike it's actually going to be goodright it's not yeah there's beencategories of music in the past wherepeople are trying to likeI don't know promote their cause orfocus in on a particular thesis but it'skind of lame and I just feel like likeBitcoin yeah exactly exactly but I feellike Bitcoin inspired music is actuallyme dope as and I can't wait to likeI saw a tip actually I think she just acouple days ago I think she published aplaylist or uh or like awhat's the word I'm looking foryeah playlist or a CD or something withlike all of her tracks on on one thingthat you could just press play andlisten to and I like I look forward tomore of that because I think thecombination of the musical talent andand the Rhythm and all that kind ofstuff with the dealing with this methese themes that we all find someaningfulumis just going to be super appealing andso you know as you're a music produceras a music producer when I do listen tolike what will you redeem the Fiat musicI agree like a lot of it is pretty trashbut one thing I do appreciate is justthe engineering because uh the audioengineering has just gotten so muchbetter in the sound design so that partstill has me geeked but the part thatmakes me feel like a child or gives methat Joy of a child when I make thismusic is when uh I create something thatI Envision like a story like whether itbe whatever type of story that I want totie to bitcoin or even not Bitcoin theones where I want to tell a story andI'm able to execute on that and then I'mlike just I'm filled with this childlike Joy you know and they want to shareit with some people and then they feelthat similar or at least the feedback itfeels like it's similar that's when I doget the Goosebumps and I feel like likethe most fulfilled when making music butlike the Fiat stuff like you say it hasnice beats nice Melodies and nicerhythms and you know you jam into itright and to me I still enjoy that aswell like um because a lot of the peoplewho aren't into Bitcoin still love thatstuff too so I do enjoy that just fromthe engineering and sound designperspective butthe thing that makes me feel most likethat that childlike feeling is when Imake something where I tell that storyyeah yeah and interestingly enough Imean again maybe I'm I'm going out a bitgoing a bit out on a limb here but youcould make the case that like the soundgen engineering aspect of modern musicis kind of the proof of work aspect youknow that stuff is actually you knowyeah it's engineering it's it's it'shighly involved it's highly skilledbut when it comes to the lyrics that areriding on top of that work they're justFiat trash you knowum and May and you know it's maybe it'smostly The Sound Engineering that'sdoing most of the leg work there andthat's what kind of keeps peopleuhwell keep you know keeps people enjoyingit um even if the lyrics are shittybecause like it's likeokay I like to go but in audioengineering even things like umthere's songwriting not in terms oflyrics or Melodies but even in justsound design like you know because uhthe audio is a medium is just amazingwith frequencies you can make certainparts darker or brighter wider furtheryou know all these things you canmanipulate and and just in sound designand audio engineering alone there'ssongwriting involved in there it'salmost like uh I guess you would tiethat in actual writing to how youpunctuate or how you develop the rhythmof the sentences butin audio engineering you do the samejust playing around with the stereofield and frequenciesand to go back to what you said before Imeanwhy do you think it fills you with thatchildlike sort ofenergy when you're dealing with you knowmaking music around Bitcoin relatedthemesyou know for me it's like uh so I when Ido these videos I start with an idealike I usually say a line I just saylike when I just recently did a coupleweeks ago I did this the song Runawaywhere I covered Kanye's runaway and Idid a Bitcoin version to it I had thisone line that only it's just one line inthe whole rap but it you start off withthis line and then you you over time youbuild that that idea of this line andand the line was there's a hole in theheart where the soul should be that wasthe line that I I just it just stuckwith me for like weeks and I couldn'twrite this write this rappers but it itstarted from that line hole in the heartwhere the soul should be and theneventually I get I built theinstrumental around it build the wraparound it recorded the song put it allmix and everything do the audioengineering part and then I I startedgrabbing the video clips I started doingthe the typography work and then it allcomes to like just it's almost likeWorld building you know you knowsoftware Engineers they they create appsand programs that people could dance inor YouTube lies and operate in and withsongwriting and video editing it's likeyou you start with this I started withthis one idea and I eventually builtthis little mini worldthat is within those two and a half ortwo minute song you know and that partlike just from like I have this inklingof an idea and then to see it fullyfleshed out that's the part that makesme feel uh yeah I feel like a childright because you kind of get to likeyou said create your ownlittle mini world slash story I mean asyou're saying that I I think of the TheRemnant one that you did as well andlike you know I guess you because I'venoticed lately am I writing in sayingthat I think you're using some like AIimagery and stuff in some of your workI am using a lot of AI imagery and uhtext to speech generation so like a lotof the AI protect like uh yeah so the AIimagery for sure I don't actually createthe AI menu because my prompt writingevery time I do it it's just bad I justdownload people's cool AI imagery andline it up with mine but uh all rightthe text one is is eerily creepy I'vedone uh they've modeled rappers whereI've done one with pressure T andKendrick Lamarand they both sound really good I'vedone one where I had uh just a narrationwhere like he sounds like a coolnarrator and I'm telling like uh thisfuturistic Citadel story about like 400a b 400 years after Bitcoins at theGenesis block and and uh it just it'sscary I'll say that it's scarily goodlike how good this AI stuff is yeah noso I didn't even realize I mean I kindof expected that it would exist but Iwasn't as familiar with the text tospeechum stuff like I'd seen the imagegeneration and the chat Bots and stuffbut not the text-to-speech butum your stuff andI think one the tip just recentlyreleased had like Tupac and Jay-Z yeahin it and I was like holy I wasjust inspired by her goodbecause she did one a couple months backwhen she first did Tupac and Jay-Z and Iwas like I looked it up and then I didit and yeah it just sounds really reallygood and it does to make the flow andeverything work it does require a littlebit of mingling and audio editing but ingeneral it's pretty darn goodyeah I mean so I mean just as an asidelikewhat happensto how we interpretlike reality basically certainly what wesee in the digital on you know onlineand stuff when faces and voice like haveyou seen the the face generationlike do you see that Tom Cruise onewhere some guy like yeah yeah the Deepfakes so when you can do that with theimage and then also with the voiceyou know like we're in such spookyterritory where you have no idea ifsomething's real or not you know to meit's a double-edged sword because like Iobviously like I'm not going to pay abunch of these rappers you know to makesongs with me or I'm not gonna like hirelike these uh voice actors to make likejust a quick Twitter video so it gives alot of people access to be creative onthe flip side like we were just talkingwe started off with propaganda andthings of that nature like this could bemass produced and like people wouldn'tbe able to discern the differencebetween reality and faith and soyeah double-ed sword for sure yeah wellthat certainly seems to be where we'regoingum do you see yourself as like someonewho's trying to promote big like are youtrying to propagandize or is this justlike you can't help but do itI do feel like umI I would say on the edge I would sayyeah I would sound propaganda yeah I Itruly think this is like uh like justParadigm shiftingum just technology and like it's it'schanging the way I view the world andit's redefining words for me so yeah Ihope to us because I I find tremendousvalue interacting with Bitcoin so when Imake these songs and messages I hopepeople canand the people who are already in theBitcoin because I think my stuff is notfor like new new people into Bitcoin butit's still like make uh hotlers evenmore convicted I guess so yeah I wouldsay to embolden the huddlers and justjust double down on your convictionyeah well I I certainly think it hasthat effect becauseI know a lot of people love itum how has Bitcoin changed how you seethe world or influenced your perspectiveyou know the for me it's the um theAustrian perspective like when I firstgot into Bitcoin like Andreas reallytaught me why this is important thenafter diving down to safety Dean's workand then I just Dove down like Yash andrabbit hole we just read a lot of workfrom there it just really helped me um Iguess they call it practiology but uh ithelped me just deduct and and observeall kinds of uhthings in life outside of Bitcoinwhether it be uh nutrition or whether itbe uh anything I can it helps me moreclearly see the world and better explainand articulate my my thoughts and ideasyeah and just from like uh just justbecause I put a little bit of money intoit in 2017 because I was you know I wantto make some money but and then you knowa couple of money stay for the money andthen change your world view it's likeyeah it's pretty nutsit's totally nuts do you have likefriends peers family that either seeyour work orhave noticed you know that shiftand have questions about it or have youorange filled everyone in your life orwell my brothers are both pretty orangepills now uh they're pretty they're noton a Bitcoin sweater like that and Iguess majority Bitcoin is on bitcoinTwitter but like yeah probably mybrothers they're pretty orange peeled umI do remember though back in 2019 uhthere is a short list I remember readingI think it was like the fourth part inBrandon Quinn's mycelium essay series orsomething and I just called my bigbrother and I was just telling him likeoh we gotta like the symbiosis withBitcoin or and I was just telling it'sgoing to change human evolution blahblah blah and he's like bro he thought Iwas crazy brothat's a 2020 after 2020. I pretty mucheverybody uh like at least in my closergoes like understood the thesis and justhumbly stacked after 2020. really andthe response to it on yeah wow that'simpressiveI got people in my life that get thethesis butnot totally like I think they're kind ofhedging you know they're like oh likethis seems to be something new and seemsto be not going away and John's notcompletely insane so like there's maybewe should listen to him a tiny bit butuh but definitely not like seeing theorange light sort of orange pilled so ifyou've got people that are just on thehumble stack and you know on the grindthat way that's or several people inyour life that are doing that that'spretty impressiveum what do you think like is this ismaking music your career or do you wantit to be or you know how do you see thisevolving over timeI don't know yet I'm just a legit I usedto be former military now I just uh Iwork a blue collar job I solder I manageproperties I work you know and uh makingmusic I look at it as like I love thegym I love basketball I love music thoseare certain things I do right it's justlike a part of likeyou know things that fulfill me and soI'm gonna just keep doing it and peoplewant if it becomes a career cool if notthat's cool too I just I've just beendoing it for a long time right what'sthe response been like to the Bitcoinvideos in particular like on Twitter andstuff like that I mean I'm sure it'sbeen I'm sure it's pretty positive butyou know any any particular standoutsalthough it's been overwhelminglypositive but uh one thing just for meobserving my own uh my own work is onething that I I find pretty rewarding iswhen I first started my my musicproduction overshadowed the videoproduction but over time my videoproduction slowly catching up and justgetting just almost or close to uh myaudio production and my music itself sojust personal development was that Ijust find like I've been getting betterat uh a video production as well as justdistilling these ideasbecause Bitcoin has really Grand ideaslike at least the things in the world ofBitcoin distilling it into a short ideainto a two minute video or or somethingalong those lines it's just been verygood at uh just being more precise withthe messaging it's been making me betterat it nice is there a particular aspectof Bitcoin that you find MostFascinating and I'll give you somecontext for that uh question likeyou know there's many aspects of Bitcoinof course you know the monetary historycase the current macroeconomic case theRenaissance 2.0 the individualtransformation and kind of shift inperspective like we mentioned the timepreference piece all that kind of stuffso I like to on this podcast inparticular like to delve into like howthis has changed people's behavior uhand yeah you know what I usually say islike if something doesn't changepeople's behavior then you know what'sits relevance really and so the factthat this thing is changing people'sperception and therefore their behaviorso dramatically and so positively and soconsistently like to me that is just themost insanely interesting phenomenon onthe go but is there an aspect that youlike to focus on or that you'reparticularly intrigued by in Bitcointhat ends up inspiring a lot of the yourworkyou know of late I've been trying toI've been I guess looking far out intothe future like long after we're gone soone of the things I guess they call itbeing getting Cosmic with Bitcoin orwhatever you know and one one thing I dolike is uh like in the uh video where Idid uh sampled you in American hot onwhere or you talk about uhuh the where's my mind remix why notRemix by the Pixies that was awesome youknowthat one I remember your line reallylike uh you're because I had thisconcept that was that I thought of thatwas similar to the line you said whereyou said uh these predicates that werehuman civilization were based upon I'massuming you meant property and how wedefend these property rights or whateverand then uhand that you said that line where likewhat does it mean when we're going tobuild what is civilization going to lookwhen these predicates aren't evennecessary because the Bitcoin Networkalready handles a lot of it you knowknuts find a home he says uh knowing hisowning and then it's similar to the thethis whole concept of property and Ijust been thinking about these wordsthat for me the future of the I thinkabout this futuristic Bitcoin worldwhereum just these certain words are justlike flipped on his head and the thingswe we think of as property today orwhatever it is today isn't the same inthe Bitcoin world and for me it's justredefining words such as umof recent times you've seen the conceptof yield you know things blowing upwe're trying to attach bi games to theBitcoin world butafter seeing all this recently and andjust redefining trying to redefine worseme the concept of yield has changed orthe concept of ownership because to meyield like when we talk about yield inthe Fiat sense you're talking aboutpercentages you're talking about thesenumbers that are getting these nominalgains on on whatever it is but afterseeing these last couple months I'vebeen really like trying torefocus on this word I don't know whybutyield to me in the Bitcoin standardyielding might be like uh the assistantChapel or a very beautiful painting tome a lot of these old old works arestill yielding returns today or like abeautiful building it still yieldingreturns it could be you'll return athousand years into the future 100 yearsinto the future and so like bitcoin'sredefining like re reshaping how I viewcertain things andI wonder how that that looks like aftermany many iterations into the futurethat's interesting so you mean thatyield taking on a non-financialdefinition exactly because because Iremember last summer I was helping myuncle we were building he was building atemple in Southern California I washelping him so I I me and a couplecousins we were helping themand uh he doesn't uh he hit there is aninvestment of his time and energy butthere is no not there is no yield interms of uh of whether it be Fiatdollars just there's nothing coming backother than they're getting a place ofworship you know a place to getcongregate and worship and come togetherfor his community and uhto me so what like things like that likeyield or in your video the video Isampled you you're talking aboutproperty the concept of property isgoing to change it's almost likea private key like our currentviewership of a propertyit doesn't really apply to bitcoin youknow because that because me and youcould know the same private key and inthat case who owns the Bitcoinyou know so so for me it's just allthese redefining uh yeah just redefiningyour perspective and how you viewcertain things yeah well I guess that'salways a Hallmark of a paradigm shiftand if we're making the case thatBitcoin is the biggest paradigm shiftand perhaps that's to be expected butyou know to go back to the yieldthing I'm sure you've heard the jokeum I think Alan Farrington I don't knowif he made it up but I don't see himI've seen him wear the T-shirt yieldedsome friends we made along the way whichis kind of like tongue-in-cheek uhcritique of of you know the yieldfarming and all that kind of that'shappened in the space so you don't haveyour you don't have you lost all yourmoney but uh you still have some friendsperhaps but you know it is aninteresting point thatuhperhaps we will be more place morefocused or emphasis or at least be moreaware onwhat we get from our investment from ourwork that perpetuates even beyond ourown experience perhaps like thenon-financial returns of doing anythingreally and I think that you know yourexample of the church is a good one or aplace of worship orlike just like thatthat should be beautiful yeah or someexactly or something beautiful a piece apiece of music or artwork or video likethethe yield on that or the return on thatjust is able to perpetuate and continuefor you know however long the the pieceof art or the theoutput of the work is able to persistand you know how how much how do you puta value on how much satisfactioninspiration Joy you know all thesethings that people get out of thoseworksyou know and andshould you or can you factor that intomotivation and or planning for actuallydoing work for actually undertaking aproject and I think you know in this inthis Paradigm wherepeople have less anxiety about thefuture they're more financially stablethere they have more Financial Securitytherefore they can pursue things thatare more meaningful I think like thatdomain of consideration willdramatically open up to people becauseyou you you're able to slowly get offthe hamster wheel where you're justbasically trying to survive and you'retrying to Stave off deprivation and whenyou have that more greater abundance oftime when you have that greaterabundance of security when you have thatmore sort ofuh like mental Clarity or or calmness orpeace then you can focus on like okaywhat do I want to devote myself to andwhat are the returns or so-called yieldsthat I'm looking to get out of it andmaybe it's it has nothing to do with afinancial return maybe you're like Ineed to devote myself to like a year ofworking and what I hope to produce atthe end of it I hope that the benefit ofthat is people being a you know amillion people being inspired or peoplebeing able to be inspired foreven after I'm gone or or just pureenjoyment that people are able to accessin some way like I think the luxury ofbeing able to consider our work in thatway is one of the benefits that Bitcoinis delivering and I think it's going tobe beautiful when more and more peopleare put in a position where they canlook at things in that way where it'snot always about reducing your relativescarcity let's say but when you'reactuallyconsidering how to deploy your limitedresourcesin ways that will returnthe intangibles like Joy like like uhhappiness and and that kind of stuff andnot justyou know how much you know what's myfinancial gain from from undertakingthis activityyeah it's like uh you know how I startedI'll tell you I get this childlike Joywhen I make some of these songs and tellthese stories and see it kind offruition now that now that I thoughtabout it like that is the yield you knowyeah like it's just feeling that likebecause you know some people like theyget to old age and they just becomebitter yeah and they that could bebecause that's how they are or it couldbe the system just working against themyou know where like all their actionsjust seem to never amount himlike it's a hopeful future or whateverit is and they just get battered downand beaten and for me like yeah becauseof Bitcoin it's changed the trajectivewhat the way I was moving forward and uhit like this even just things like thismaking a song like that's that's a inthe grand scheme of things it's verytrivial just something like doing myfree time it just provided me this Joylike just kissed me rejuvenated andpositive and feeling grateful to youknow yeah 100 and I think it was in oneof your recent videos that uh sailoralluded to that as well or or basicallyreflectedwell yeah and because you know I asked Iguess I asked him why and he saidsomething to the effect that like youknow the current system grinds peopledown you know it doesn't deliver to themwhat they need you know to be lifted upand to be ambitious and to be hopefuland it and as you say that can result inthat person that you just alluded tothat might be bitter at the end of theircareer because they've just beenstaving off deprivation their whole lifeand not engaging in things that actuallybring meaning and joy and value intotheir life and Bitcoin is Hope becauseit's a mechanism that actually allowsthat to be reversed actually allowspeople to now shift the focus and bringthose things more into their life andmore into to abundance or you know notnecessarily I mean they can still pursuematerial ends but they would be far morefree to determine what those are forthemselves rather thanagain being subject to uhyou know the deprivations or subject torelative scarcity as a result of beingstolen from surreptitiously you know andwithout any means of of stopping thatandthat's certainly been again anotherobservation for me like if I if you lookout on in Bitcoin land and as you saidearlier like how much of is representedon Twitter probably not very much of itbut to the extent that it isI see a lot of that sort of behaviorwhere bitcoiners engage in things thatlike are not uh financially rewardinglet's say you know they do them out ofpure inspiration they do them at a purecontribution they do them out of Charitylike multiple non-financial rewardreasons andI think and there's there's a specificreason for many of them let's say or aprimary reason but I think likesomewhere around there is likeuh they want to access I mean they'reclearly doing it because it's meaningfuland the meaning is not nominal you knownot financial and that just seems to beso common now is to be a norm likepeople are so motivated and inspired bythis thing that they're willing toostensibly sacrifice you know resourceslike you know or waste resources from aconventional sense to contribute orcreate in this way but what they receivein return is definitionallymore valuable than what they've given upand therefore it's it's obviously not awaste and in many cases it'stremendouslyum inspiring to many people Beyondthemselves you know as is the case withyour work and other you know creators inthe space writers in the space all sortsof things and soyou know the thing I like toor that gives me goosebumps occasionallyit's like I I wind the clock forwardFive Years on that because it's it's soearly and and even a few years ago noneof none of that was really thatappearance you know of course like youknow devs were you know devoting theirtime to working on you know Bitcoin corelet's say and other stuff like that butnot on the same scale whatsoever andthree three short years later I meanit's far more apparent and so what aboutfive years from now you know whenpresumably the value of Bitcoin is muchhigher there's way more people in thespace there's way more Avenues toexpress that those sort of sentimentsit's justI can't wait which is why I'm sograteful I know what you mean front rowC4because even like last cycle I thinkninety percent of the content you wouldsee was just trading talk it was justlike it was charts it was like 90 of thespace was charged outside of thetechnical stuff and I think the onlyperson that would push it to people thatcould understand like me was probablyAndreas that's probably like there'svery few and uh and you know back to thewhole uh giving like the more the giversin the Bitcoin space where you'retalking about like these people are notdoing a lot of it aren't isn't forfinancial reward because it's just not abig market for this stuff yeah but Ithink that has to tie back to the timepreference right the lower your timepreference becomes you're more able togive because you're more certain of thefuture and so I think that has to docome back to the the time preference itmay be because big interacting withBitcoin uh extends your time Horizonlong enough whereit really does change is we're like uhwe can do rewarding things like givebecause giving you know one of thethings I always believed in is like asmuch given you you get back and so yeahI think that that has probably has thelink with the time preference at leastwhen I think of it initially yeah andthe same is truefor that same reason for likeundertaking great works like youmentioned it you know a church a fewminutes ago and you think about theselike insanely inspiring monuments aroundthe world and I know you know againthere's been various motivations and youknow in some cases it was a top-downapproach and and slaves were you knowemployed to build these things but othertimes it was artists and Artisans whoout of their own inspiration wanted toglorify an idea basically or create aplace of worship or showcaseshowcase something showcase somethinginspiring and came together to to makeit andthe more I think the more a society isoriented towards low time preferencebecause perhaps the money in use and theother cultural factors that areDownstream of that uh the more the moreof that you get but also the more Ithink like the greaterthe more amazing it is or the greaterquality is because all those peopleyou know are so capable of committingand devoting themselves to the work andso you don't get as many cut Corners youdon't you know you're not rushing thingsall that stuff and and so quality reallygets to shine through and the the thereason for undertaking that work theinspiration and the and the you know thejoy and the meaning can be like reallyshowcased it really gets imbued in thework as a result of Simply that capacityto uh well simply the availability ofthe time to do it so the availabilityfor all those people involved to havethe time to not be a tremendoussacrifice basically like they can theycan bear it and they're not going tostarve and their families aren't goingto start starve and all that kind ofstuff and you know weas cultures and societies andcivilizations I mean it almost seems thecase thatyou know maybe we always take two stepsforward and one step back because likethethe capital Foundation that people haveavailable to is that have the peoplehave to Avail of let's sayum continues to degrade or dissolve overa few generations for a variety ofreasons confiscations inflationRevolution whatever and justand I don't think we'll completely uhBitcoin is not going to completelyresolve that because I think there'llalways be a sense of it'll all be acircularity to development I thinkthere'll always be the pitfalls ofapathy and comfort and things like thatbut it does seem to be the case thatlike the Capital stock the capitalFoundation the the foundation of wealththat each individual and each family andas a result a society has will be farmore impervious to that kind ofdegradation to wherever you knowwhatever form of whatever instigatesthat degradation or whatever the causeof it is and as a result I mean the thestarting point of of wealth in time andtherefore the the starting point oflike determining what's most valuableand meaningful and then applying yourwork and applying your trade in thatDirectionwill be so much more available to peopleand that should necessitate and Fosterand contribute to a far morebeautiful abundantI would say peacefulfulfilling meaningful culture andsociety would it notyeah I agree and because you know I Ilike to I sometimes try to catch myselftoo well because I think I think ofthose things a lot as well of like whatit means when we can just protectourselves from the like you said thedegradation of society and individualshaving a tool that can protectthemselves but I do like to think aboutBitcoin and its incentives you knowbecause sometimes when we think likethat I personally I get two utopianssometimes like like you know what I meanthis is like uh chill out chill outBitcoins at Utopia I was out there bymyself like especially when I'mpreaching Bitcoinbut uh the incentives doesum like you say like um allows for likefor individuals to at least protectthemselves from like uh a society of ifyou have a society that's lessproductive or or a society where thesethings erode and degrade at least thereis this tool to protect you and I'd liketo think of Bitcoin and I'll actuallythink of these systems in winners andlosers you know the Fiat systemincentivizes I guess you would say theftor or that cancel uh chasing that cancelon position or chasing them to be in aposition of like the cancel on Alpha Iguess you would say right and whereand then in the Bitcoin world where it'slike the incentives isI don't like to me yes we do depend onothers in the Bitcoin world but likeindividually whatever you produce orwhatever you and a group of other groupof individuals can produce theincentives align with the individualmore so than like um the parasite Iguess or the kennel on Alpha I just I'mgonna show you it's not working out nothat's I I like the term and I I totallyagree and that's why I think it's sosustainable is because exactly the theincentives basically align and andpeople are able to keep the fruits oftheir labor and then have the capacityto exchange them with everyone else andI I that's why I think it leads to morepeace and more abundance and and greatersecurity and again I mean of course weall have to check ourselvesumI mean we can be forgiven right becausethis is such a radically different thisis such a radically new thing for us tocomprehend and contend with and we'retrying to connect all the dots and onceyou connect the dots you know rememberthose like children's books where youlike you connect the dots and what youend up drawing like a uh a castle orsomethingcan you hear me Jeff yepI don't know how long it's Gonna LastForever all right we'll we'll uh whathappened you the battery on your airpodsdied or something yeah my battery'sairpods are dying can you forget achicken can you use the the mic or thespeaker on your phoneyou know it's it's busted my phone'spretty busted oh okay okay all rightwell we'll we'll shut it down soon butum on the Utopia question you know likewe're all my point was just that we'reall trying to figure out what this meansright and as we do that we try to beintellectually honest we try not toyou know delude ourselves butit does seem like you know if youanalyzehistory up to this point you you try toanalyze like what those predicates werethat manifested the world we have todayand you say okay what happens if youswitch those out what happened if whathappens if you fundamentally change thecharacteristics of those things whatlogically would you expect to resultfrom that and I think you know many ofusyou know that's the Bitcoin Renaissancesort of vision andit I think it's good for well I thinkit's going to be really really reallypositive but as you say there is noUtopia and there will always be problemsand if for no other reason thatuh we get complacent and we getapathetic no matter how good thestructure of the system that we'reembedded within is and so I you know asa side note I think that's why kind ofritual and tradition is going to be suchan important thing in a Bitcoin standardbecause I thinkthat's going to be one method probablyamong many of reminding ourselves andlet's say it's done on a family orCommunity or so or or you know even astate or a larger level but these thesesort of rituals are going to be used orTraditions to remind us of the thingsthat are valuable that we ought not toto to forgetum to try to avoid the pitfalls of thepast knowing that they're ultimatelyunavoidable but perhaps mitigate the howdestructive they might be you know asthe cycles of history wax and Wayne andwe move forwardyou know I like to think of Bitcoin notneeding these Traditions or ritualsbecause like if you don't like if youdon't hold your keys or if you don't runyour note or you rely on somebody elseto do all this for you like you say likeif if like my let's say five generationsand your kids kidsum they decide you know I don't want totake the ownership of owning my own Keysyou know I'm gonna give it to thisversion of that TX or whatever you knowso like it almost like differentselection and it's a system you justself-regulates itself and just weedsthose people out oh oh you want to putyour coins on Mount gox or like theversion of that in 50 years or in 30years or something and sothat's how I like to look at it and sothe trajectory is away from the mountCox is the way from the cell season anduh all these uh centralized institutionsyeah I agree with you and and I thinkeven something likelike your your key ceremony like you'recoming of age ceremony like that thatmight even be a thing within familieslike okay son or daughter you're 13 nowthis is your entry into adulthood maybethere's other aspects of that in termsof knowledge and experience and takingresponsibility but one of them might belike now is when you take charge orresponsibility for your keys foryourself dad's not you know that Mom andDad aren't doing it for you anymore andthat is kind of ceremonialized becauseof how important it is you knowum and it it gives them the propercontext the proper weight the properGravity the proper set upum but even even though I agree like Ithink this thissystem helps to self-regulate in thatway and it it just punishes people whodon't treat it properly and thatself-corrective mechanism will go a longway to producing what we'd probably deempositive outcomes in societyum I just do think I think we willdiscover like all these these themesthat we've been just discussing likevalue and meaning and and work and whatto devote ourselves to when we're out ofa state of deprivation you know and wecan reallywe can determine how we're going todeploy our resourcesoutside of a context of necessity let'ssay I think those sort of things mightinspirethe refinement or the evolution or thereintroduction of tradition in some waysbecause we'll I feel like we'll discovermeaning or things will become ofsufficient value and we'll want toglorify it really and and remember it incertain ways and possibly in ways thatareuhsomewhat superordinate may be to justthe self-regulating mechanism of uh youknow I do agree with you like like theserituals around like these very technicalthings whether it's possessing your ownprivate Key Making certain transactionsI have been trying to like I think Itold you earlier I've been trying topersonify or make symbolize these verytechnical aspects of Bitcoin and maybeall the people who created whether it bepitchers art paintings writings whateverlike or music I've been trying tosymbolize these uh very technical thingsinto this uh you know beyond just I justdid a cryptographic signature you knowbeyond that and so like give it there'sa way to make it into a ritual or aceremony like you say and so like maybethere's all this music and all this artand all this cultural things aroundBitcoin is driving us towards thatritualistic and ceremonial aspects ofsomething pretty darn technical yeah Ithink that could definitely be the caseand then you know another one that seemsto be emerging already in the space islike people's relationship to food seemsto be changing at least for some againlike I'm I always generally for me itdid I did at first I was like man Icould never had safety you know likehe's crazy you know and then my brothersent me Jordan Peterson video and SeanBaker on Rogan I watched itI did it for two years I went Carnivalfor two years and I wasn't like I waslike in decent shape and then I justlost a lot of even more weight I thoughtI was already and I just lost moreweight and so yeah it definitely it doesmake you question everything whether itbe food politics everything right rightbut that's exactly my point so I thinkthat will happen for all areas but Ithink one of the potential outcomes ofthat is like as youdo I still got youyeah you're still here okay I lost yourvideo but uh just checking you're stillthereum I think one of the other like forexample let's say when you have that newrelationship to food like I see ithappening and I see it happening withmyself likechanging diet wanting to have adifferent relationship to my foodwanting to have a direct relationship tothe farmer who grows it or raises thecattle maybe even wanting to be there inthe process of harvesting that meat andceremonializing that in some way toexpress my gratitude for the farmer'swork for the animal's life for all theprocess that goes into it like I couldand all of that just by virtue ofthe changing perception or meaning thatI'm ascribing to my relationship to myown sustenance and then what you knowand of course there's an a reciprocalsort of meaning there it's like well ifI'm going to acceptand go and and uhand and express my gratitude for thework and this of the farmer and thesacrifice of the animal let's say howdoes that influence how I treat myselfright like how does that influence how Idetermine my own action in order toexpress my gratitude for that and so allof that taken together you could veryeasily see ritual forming around thatbecause it's such asuch an important thing such ameaningful thing and so I don't knowwhat shape that will take but just tosay I think those are the types ofthings by virtue of our changeperception of and change relationship toall these different things food andotherwise I can seethat Amplified meaning coalescing intorituals and traditions that end upbecoming more refined and more refinedand more ingrained into our lives andour culture and that kind of thingall right well Richard is havingtechnical problems so we're gonna haveto shut it down but and he won't be ableto respond but Richard thank you fortaking the time man I appreciate uh yourworkcan't wait to see more of it in thefuture and uh we will do this againsometime peace brother",
