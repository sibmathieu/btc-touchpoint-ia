  "text": "so we'll start umtalking about i want to get into thetechnical and of course the financialaspects of the bitcoin bondbut let's start with the technicalaspects there's a lot of listeners andwatchers who willyou know not befamiliar with the liquid network or notfully you know have understand how itworks uh and it is a very important uhpart of of bitcoin the bitcoin ecosystemat this point uh the bitcoin bond istokenized and issued on the liquidnetwork uh adam i'd like to just give usa an overview for those who don't knowmuch about how the liquid network worksand how in particular this bond istokenizedright so a lot of people are familiarwith lightning and liquid is effectivelyanotherlayer two for bitcoinand uh things you can do on liquid soit's it's uh lightning is a way to dofaster and cheaper bitcoin transactionsand ultimately every lightningtransaction is a kind of delayedsettlementbitcoin transaction so it will only dowhat bitcoin can do where liquid is aside chain so it can add new op codesand features and it does that so as wellas being able to transact bitcoin in itit looks very bitcoin like in terms ofyou know the user experience with awallet and the the workflow you knowpost addresses around things like thatit has a number of other features so ithas confidential transactions sothe amounts and types of assets intransactions are encrypted so only thesender and recipient can see them andnevertheless the kind of cap or you knoweverything adds up in terms of theinputs and outputs to a transaction isverified withcompact zero knowledge proofs basicallyand then it has support for assets souser issued assets anda special type of user issued assetwhich is the blockstream amp servicewhich is away tosort of manage securities so it's amulti-sigand then you know there can berules implemented on a on a server thatis some kind of policy like you knowmaybe this asset is available only to usinvestors or any to european investorsoronly to investorswho are qualified or who have providedkyc and things like that so liquid ampis a tool to do that kind of thing butyou can use it as a tool to programother things and so there's somethingcalled a block stream mining note whichis asecurity luxembourg securitized 2000terra hashmining instrument that's uh issued byblockstream and that that works usingblock stream amp so people who arefamiliar with that will know how itworksand then theel salvadorbitcoin bond isalso proposed to be an amp asset sorunning on liquid same kind of userexperienceyou can also you know store these assetson a hardware wallet and you know use agreen platform or some other walletslike uh site swap and spectre and otherwallets have support for liquid as wellasledger and so on so there's variousintegrations a number of exchangeshave liquid support so that you can youknow another common asset that's onliquid isa number of stable coins sotetherball bitcoinsel cad which is a canadian dollar stablecoinand and and more so uh side swap has auh euro stable coin on a liquid sothat's uh liquid i think one of thecommon interesting features issort of atomic swaps trustless ordersthat kind of thing so sideswap is ais a liquid walletand a swap marketplace for liquid assetsso i'll pause thereso it's a federated systemuh how manyi guess uh members of the federation areon the network nowi think something like 60 so a lot ofdifferent exchangesfinancial institutionsmining poolsprop trading companies you know allkinds of different entities basicallyand so it's the network i meanblockchain is a technology provider thenetwork is operated bythe participants andyou know even though it'sfederated i think people tend toyou know assume too much control andit's in its uhin its day-to-day operationyou know you can transact nobody'sasking you to sign up for anything xerosign up you know same experience to setup a bitcoin wallet hardware or softwarethe difference is thethere is no mining and so the blocks areprocessed byblock signers and there's a subset ofthese 60 members have block signersthey sign the blocks but as we found outyou know as everybody found out orlearnt from theblock size debate some years ago and theresolution to thatthat ultimately is the asset ownersand the value in the chain that sets therules in the change soyou know ultimately if there was atusslebetween the block signers and the assetowners the asset owners could fire theblock signers andcoordinate to bring some new blockcenters inandi think some more more factors kind ofprovide a trade-off as well which is dueto the confidentiality it's very it'smuch harder to selectively interferewith transactions to block them to frontrun them you know if you don't know whatthe transaction is or the swap or thetrade settlement isyou can't front run it's all encryptedor you can't usefully print on it if youdon't know what it is and the otherthing thatyou know the finality is fairly fastbecause blocks are on a one minuteintervaland the consensus algorithm isnot probabilistic as it you know it'snecessarily probabilistic on bitcoin buthere there are block signs so it doesn'tneed to be probabilistic and so itsfinal after two confirmations i meantypically it's final after one but youknow there's some kind of esotericrace condition that could occur i don'tthink it's ever actually occurred inpractice so after two minutes it's finalso you know unless you catch somethingin two minutes too late so that's fartoo fast foryou know human judgment basically sothat's the plan i think the other thingis to bear in mind that the assets onliquid can't beyou know removed and sent to anotherchain or something because they werenatively issued on the change so theany funds at risk from thefederation block signers in a kind ofyou know two-thirds block signingmajority for uptime and kind of securityof the bitcoin pegged in and bitcoin areprimarily used foruh fees because it's a bitcoin layer thefees themselves are in bitcoin or liquidbitcoin and so those funds are managedsort of in an automated way so the blockstandards are actually hardware securitymodulesand so each of each of thecompanies running these things is put inthere you knowin their exchange securityplace where they store their secureexchange service they put an extra pieceof hardware and so a second line ofdefense is thatto actually compromise the system amajority you know a large portion ofthis network would have toyou know succeed in tampering with thehardware and have the intent tosteal from the users and i guess anothersort of secondarydefenses we know you know everybodyknows who they are because it's a as agroup of companies and so they have skinin the game in you know not not rippingoff their customers not hurting theirreputation andbeing able to continue to rely on anduse liquid so i think it's a sort oftrade-off point you know somewherebetweenif if you put funds on a single exchangenow of course the exchange could runsolvency issues or you know go offlineandstoring in your own wallet on the mainchain of course that's the most bearerand uncensorable and final thing so it'ssomewhere in between though i think youknow bitcoin is stored in a liquidnetwork uh far safer than storing anycustody of one exchangeum because you only any given you knowone two three exchanges couldyou know go offline orbe malicious and you wouldn't beimpacted so that that's the contrary offyeah so it's pegged to bitcoin so it'llyou know basically it's underliedbythe reserve asset of the systembut you're making some you knowtrade-offs in terms of like the securitymodel of the base layerto make liquid more amenable tosupporting something like a financialinstrument like like the bitcoin bondand you've been runningyour ownfinancial asset right um the the miningnotesuh on the liquid network for a while nowyeah sowe started the first sales tranche backin march this yearand theuh the go live date wasearly july so it's been running forfive months now and has minedthe dashboard hereabout 2.2bitcoins to datesandyeah so it it pro like the the financialthe the block stream mining note isit gives you the economic rights tothe bitcoin's mind by 2000 terahashover a three year periodand umso you know the originaluh offering price was 200 000 euros butit's gone up you knowboth due tokind of input costsandtapering over time pre-market discountandthe value of the bitcoin that it's minetoday increasing as well so thetrench sevenwas sold you know recently like a weekor so ago and that one was at 320 000euros we have to bear in mind you knowwith umtwo bitcoin in ityou're looking atsay we're like 571.3yeah there's like about 110 000 eurosworth of bitcoin in there as well rightso that's part of the make up of theinstrumentand you knowthey're all fungible as well thedifferent sales trenches so what we dois we mark it by bitcoin so as we addmore hash rate we add as much bitcoinas the existing units have minedat that you know switch on momentso that makes them more fungible okay sothen thei guess the the benefits ofof the note then are paid out on theliquid network and lbtc so if i have youknow if i earn a certain amount uh fromthe 2000 tara hash mining activity on mynote how do i get paid uh so actuallythere's it's not paying dividends it'srolling up so it's a kind of prepaidyou know it's a kind of term investmentso you put you you pre-fund it you knowyou don't payfees monthly for the power you don't geta dividend for the bitcoin bitcoin rollsup inside and we chose to do it that waybecauseuh some complicated modeling that wewe've been doing mining for a few yearsand we noticed thatit's actually more profitableyou know if you've got a certain part ofmoney in a certain income streamit's actually more profitable to gosmallerand not sell bitcoins to pay for thepowerbecauseyou know when when the price goes downand the hash rate goes down you mine alot of bitcoinsthose extra bitcoins are what reallycount and thenif you if you get through a cycle andthe price comes up again that will savethe day and so you know we we did somemining for a period whereyou know if you if you model what if wehad bought bitcoin at the beginningand it was over two years and you knowthe beginning of bitcoin price is 15 000at the end bitcoin price was about 7 0007 500 soif you bought bitcoin you'd be down 50but we were up 25 in dollars so we werelike well how did that happen andhow it happened is the price fell allthe way down to 3 500 so that kind ofgives approximately when this washappening a few years ago now and umyou know so we we mined far morebitcoins than we expected in fact twoand a half times as many right so eventhoughthe price was half we'd mine two and ahalf times as many bitcoins as one mighthave expected and so we ended up with a25 dollarincrease over that period and so thelesson and then and then you know priorto doing the bond we went back testedall 36 months periods on a you knowmonthly basisand worked out the average return andthat this strategy was a good strategyso we we baked it into the bond and wealso wanted to encourage people toyou knownot spend the bitcoins as they come offso that we you know figure that adefaultbehavior for the bond is a way toencourage that you know you hold itthree years and then you get yourbitcoins paid out and you know the threeyear lev at the three year mark you canchoose how to get paid you know liquidbitcoin unchained bitcoin or even a eurowire transfer if you really want and youknow some investors may be not set up tohandle bitcoin so it's a way for them toget the bitcoin exposureas well that makes sense so in the caseof the bitcoin bond then umthe asset itself will be issued onliquidi would hold that in a wallet like ablock stream wallet for instance andas dividends are paid outi would be paid then in in liquid or ifi had a choice that could be paid insome other uhsome other asset i guessuh yeah so so the this is clarify so nowwe're moving on to the el salvadorbitcoin bond so i just want to clarifytheissuer isel salvador you know the governmentitself andblockstream is a technical advisor andyou know some we are quite a hedge funda while ago to demester's uh companyadmin capital so we're hedge fundmanagers so we have some financialmodelingexpertise in-house and so we did some ofthe modeling for this bond butum the issuer is el salvador andbitfinex is in the mix as the bookmakerand sothey are working with the el salvadoriangovernment for a kind of securitylicensing securities licensing sopotentially a newa new uh jurisdiction that providesyou knowbusiness friendly licensing terms forthe uh operation of an exchange and sothey're working with the government toget something set up there and thenthey wouldyou know provide the market like amarket for you to trade these on and youknowthey may be tradable on other marketsand they're also a liquidamptoken so you could withdraw them to awalletas well but i mean there's something youknow there are a number of unusualthings about this bond as far as normalsovereign bond issuances go like themakeup of theinvestorsthe venuesand advisors involved of course morecryptocentric at least on this firsttranche and the use of capital is alsounusual and we can talk about it",
