maybe even dismissive but as theyears have passed it's become obvious toeveryone that it's not going away andit's probably going to be a centralfeature of our future is this a goodthing is it a bad thing can you benefitfrom it and by the way what is itexactly you may have been afraid to askthat question so we've searched long andhard for about five years actually tofind someone who can answer all of thosequestions in a credible way thatnon-experts can understand we thinkwe've found one he is michael saylor youprobably recognize he's an entrepreneurof course co-founder and ceo ofmicrostrategy he is a hugeinvestor in bitcoin specifically and wethinkmaybe despite that or because of it orboththe man to ask so he joins us nowmichael said we're really happy to haveyou here thank you very much thanks forhaving me tucker so i basically summedup my own position as clearly as ipossibly could i didn't know what tomake of cryptocurrency i don'tunderstand iti made fun of it it's clearly not goingaway it's clearly a really big dealso let's just start at the beginning ifyou don't mind explaining what is itokay what is bitcoin bitcoin is thefirst engineered monetary system in thehistory of the human racefull stopso now to explain it the first questionis what's moneythe second question is what's theproblemand the third question is what's thesolution rightbitcoin is the solution now go back tothe beginning what is money well aneconomy consists of good services andproperty you know i want you to dosomething for me i want that product iwant you to manufacture something for mei want that house i want that landthat's half the economynow the question is how do i send 37horses to youand then how do we keep the booksbalanced so you have to send me backmoneymoney is socialeconomicenergy it is it is money is monetaryenergy or it's it's the energy thebackhaul energy that we use to tradewith if i can send you 10 bushels ofcorn and you can send me money equal to10 bushels of corn then we can tradewith each other so in the history of theworld human beings have tried differentmonies we've used sea shells we use thegiant stone coin or the yap people weuse tobacco bales in uh in pre andcolonial america we've used copper coinssilver coins we've used stone coins weuse glass beads in africa these are alltypes of money eventually we got to gotto settle on gold and gold coins asmoney but gold was never fast enough asmoney how do you move10 tons of gold from here to thereso ultimately people use ledgersand those ledgers were issued by amerchant or they were issued by a mayoror they're issued by an emperor and youknow you can go back 5000 years and youcan find sumerian tablets in clay wherethey've etched in like 37you know bushels of oats in return forsomething these were the ledgerssouh moneyis is thatthat shared ledger of who owes what towhomand um and and a lot of times the moneyis a token like a glass b but theproblem with the glass bead is if theafricans use the glass bead and theeuropeans show up and they canmanufacture a million glass beads theeuropeans dump a million glass beads onthe africans the africans lose theirhomes and their livestock and all theirwealth and they're impoverished so ifyou have weak money and someone else hasstrong money if they can manufacture themoney likein the pacific islands they use stonecoins some europeans showed up in a shipand he realized that stone coins arerare on one island but they're veryplentiful big stones on another on hesailed to the other island picked up thestones brought them back to the firstisland and slaved everybody on theislandi was likeproblem so so the problem with money ishow do we keep trackin a fair distribution of who owns aclaim to what if there'sif there's a hundred million dollarsworth of capital in the economy ofproducts and property and and andcorporations and the like you have tohave a hundred million dollars of moneynowif i issue a hundred million dollars ofcurrencyit equals all the stuff in the economynow if i start to inflate the currencyand i issue another 10 million dollarsyesnow i've taken 10 percent of the economyand given it to my friend that's theinflation rate if i keep inflating thecurrency if i double the amount ofcurrencybut the amount of stuff in the economyis constantwell then the price of everything that'sscarce and desirable doublesyes okay if it's not scarce anddesirable it won't go up but if there'sa hundred things and there's 10 times asmuch money it stands the reason that thethings cost 10 times as muchsoso money is is economic energythe problem is inflationbecause in the history of the worldwe have inflation when uh when theromans created gold coins they startwith a certain amount of gold and theywould cut the they would debase thecurrency right they would cut the amountof gold or cut the amount of silver inthe coin and when they cut it to a smallenough level no one would take the coinanymore so the mercenaries don't wantthe coin the emperor can't pay themercenaries the empire topplesif i just issue you paperyou know whatever the paper might be andthen i triple the supply of the papereventually the currency collapsesso the problem with currencies in thehistory of ta of time is the trust inthe issueryou're trusting an individualright you're either trusting a bank or ajp morgan or you're trusting a familythe rothschildsor you're trusting a kingor princeor you're trusting the mayor or you'retrusting a governmentnow if we look at the modern eraeconomists like seyfadina moos who wrotethe bitcoin standard he estimates thatthe inflation rate in the modern eradollar weighted is 14 percentokay think about thatfor the last decade on average uh all inthe world we've been inflating thecurrency by 14 per yearnow it happens that that's equal to therate at which the s p 500 index is goingup 14 on average a year for 10 yearsrunningumthat thewhat's the issue wellwhat is inflation it's not really wellunderstood some people think it'scpicpi is the rate at which a market basketof consumer goods is going up but thegovernment gets to pick the basket i'venoticed okay if i pick things likedomino's pizza and streaming youtubevideos they will never go up in price ican actuallyi can actually adjust the basket so ijust pick things that don't go up inpricethe shape the case shiller index is up27 percent year-over-year you know injuly so the price of that averagesingle-family homes up 27homes in canada up 15 percent the s pindex is up 34 percent this year over 12monthswhat's the inflation rate if you wantedto buy a basket of desirable stocksthe inflation rate is the s p indexsoi can calculate any inflation rate iwant inflation is a vector if if i wantto be rich then i need to buy scarcedesirable assets so my inflation ratesthe rate at which picassos and leonardoda vinci paintings and stocks and and uhproperty in new york city is going up inprice or a house in the hamptons that'sa high inflation rateif i want to be a consumer and live inmy parents basementand order domino's pizza and take uber'sand watch netflix and stream youtube theinflation rate will be the cpi it'll bevery lowsoyou can have any inflation rate you wantas a practical matter the best inflationrate for an investoror for anybody that wants to staywealthy or be wealthy if you'reconcerned about maintaining youreconomic purchasing powerit's the monetary inflation rate therate at which the supply of money isexpandingthe supply of money expanded maybe 10percent for a decade before covet andthe s p went up 10 a yearyou know we know the money supplyexpanded 30 percent postcovid the s p isup 34the feds stepped on uh on the moneyprinter the same with the eu centralbankin the western world in the strongestcountries we seewe see the money supply expanding 20 25or more per year the currencyis collapsing it's losing it's losingits values being devaluedin in uh weaker countriesgo to argentina the officialinflation rates 45 the unofficialinflation rates 85 percentgo to venezuelathe inflation rate i mean the currenciescollapsed 98 99 in a year uh same inlebanon 90currency collapse in a year sowhat you have right now going on in theworld is currency collapse which we callinflationandthe mainstream view of inflation is it'sonly cpi and sometimes it's pce it'sit's an index of things not includingthe highly volatile food and energyright but in but in what universe canyou live without food and energy exactlybut but it's not really good like commonsense saysif if everybody tells me inflation ratestwo percent or five percent but thehouses are costing 20 more 15 percentmoreand everythingif you talk to anybody that manufacturesanything they'll say that the prices areup 20 25 year-over-yearso how is it i'm supposed to actuallybuy something how do you buy a share ofstock that went up 34 a year when yougot a cpi adjustment of 2 or 5so it sounds like the people causing theinflation are lying about the inflationclassicallyi i just i just first of allif you define inflation as the cpiyou're using simple arithmetic todescribe the economyyou can know you can't define you can'tdescribe the economy and model it withsimple arithmetic any more than youcould describe fluid dynamics oraerodynamics with simple arithmeticright the fluid is flowing around theairfoil you have tomulti-in-dimensional you know algebraand vector calculus to describe acomplicated phenomenathe economy is a complicated phenomenaanother way to say it is the price ofeverything is is varying everywhere atdifferent rates all the time right rightcommon sense says the price of housingin the hamptons is going up at adifferent rate than the price of land inkansasandthe price will be going and the price ina certain jurisdiction for a certain usesubject to certain regulations will goup at a different rate than anotherjurisdiction for another usesothe problem is inflationinflation's a phenomena wherebya government authority prints morecurrencyright and why do they print morecurrency because if i want to pay atrillion dollar bill i either have totax you a trillion dollars or i have toprint a trillion dollars of money turnsout that it's a lot easier to printmoney than it is to tax people and soit's either inflation or taxationthroughout the history of the world fromroman emperors beforeev every single coinage system everymonetary system ever establishedcollapsed because of inflation if youlook at the history of of the sumerianstates you know the the persian statesthe greek states the romans statesmiddle eastlook at all the all the renaissanceitalian stateslook at every king of englandif you just go forward you find everyone of these currenciesstarted by issuing i issue a coin withthis much gold in it and then i cut itand i cut it and then i go to silver andthen i go to copper and then i coat itwithsome brass or some nickel you rememberwhat happened in the u.s where we usedto actually have silver quarters yeahand now we don't because the silver wasmore valuable than the quarter yeswhy right we're debasing the currencyright so the problem is inflationand inflation just to be really clearwhat you just said which is fascinatingis caused by expanding the money supplyyessimply putyou live in a town there's a hundrednice housesthere's a million dollars in the moneysupply the mayor prints another milliondollars distributed to the citizenswhat's the price of the house do rightand so and you're so you're saying thatinflation is always the cause of thecollapse of the currency and thecollapse the currency sounds to me likeit's the cause of the collapse of thecivilizationyepbecause ifif you look at all these wars right howlong does a war go on it goin world war one every single nationwent off the gold standard within a weekof the declaration of world war onethe germans the french the the brits theamericans we printed moneyuh the money got debased there wasrampant inflation eventually after fouryears you can print money for about fouryears before you collapse the currencyand then you don't have any means tofight the war the germans sued for peacebecause they ran out of money after fouryears okay world war ii we ran out ofmoney in four years vietnamyou know we paid for it with inflationeventually um eventually nixon had to gooff the gold standard because they'dprinted so much money they couldn'tredeem the gold they defaulted on it wewent to the fiat standard and we justbegin to print more moneyyou'll find that throughout history andof course put yourself into the positionof the roman emperor orthe city mayor or the nobleyou you have a monopoly on the coinageyou need to pay the army you can eithergo to everybody that lives in yournation and take half their stuffor you can just print twice as manycoins but what i thought the whole ideabehind modern monetary theory was aslong as you have the world's reservecurrency inflation isn't a threat to youwellif you printhow would you say this if there's acertain amount of goods and services andcapital in the economy and you just keepprinting moneyyou're notcreating any morecapital in the economy you're notcreating any more products you're notcreating any more buildings you're notcreating any more services all you'redoing is doubling and tripling theamount of currency soif i just gave everybody in the unitedstates a billion dollarsand everybody went out to buy a ferrariright would there be 250 millionferraris likei i can i can print the money right likelook at venezuela look at zimbabwe theycan print the money you can give someonea trillion dollar notebut that doesn't create more stuffright you're just creating paperso ultimatelythat in that inflation it works only toan extent if you can export it and whatyou're doing is you're notyou're not creating anything what you'redoing is you're redistributing wealthlike if there's ten billion dollars inthe economy and there's this much stuffand i give a billion dollars to youyou now get 10 of the stuff fromsomebody else which means that everybodyelse lost 10 percent of their stuffrightas i inflate the economy i'm actuallyor inflate the currency i'm actuallyredistributing wealth from those that uhstore their life savings in currency orcurrency derivativesin cash if you have if you had a milliondollars in the bank 12 months agotoday it buys you 34 percent lessrightthe s p is up 34 you have a milliondollars if you put it in the stockmarket you've got 1.34 million dollarsif you hold it in cash you've got amillion dollars if you go to buy a stocknow it costs you 34 more to buy thestock if you go to buy a house in thehamptons it's 40 more to buy the housein the hamptons you know if youother things are going up in price yourcash is fixedso it turns out thatthat um you've got some people thatdon't have net cash positions if you'reif you're a sophisticated investor andyou're wealthyall of your assets are in property youhave buildings you have companies youhave you have real estate you havecollectibles you havesports franchises right your things ifyou'remiddle class working class you'reworking for cashand whatever cash you've got rightis either sitting in the bank or uh youdon't have a lot of net cash sothe real significance here isif the dollar loses 20 percent of itspurchasing power each yearthenthe value of your salary isdeteriorating by 20 a year it's notfalling at the rate of cpi inflationit's falling at the rate of monetaryinflationthe road to serfdom is workingexponentially harder for a currencygrowing exponentially weaker okay that'sthe problem you're a dentist you'reright you're you're generating fivepercent more a year for a decade i'minflating the money supply at 20 a yearfor a decadeif you save every penny in 10 yearsyou'll be able to buy one quarter ofwhat you could have bought today becausethe price of housing is going up at 20percent a year and you're just not evergoing to catch up right becauseyou're uh you're getting paid thecurrencythe only way you can actually stay aheadis to grow your cash flows faster thanthe rate of monetary inflation andthat's why the rate of expansion of themoney supply is so critical and thatthat there's not even a word for thatother than cost of capital the bestsurrogate for monetary inflation in myopinion is the s p index a distributedmarket basket of scarce desirableproductssomoney is energythe problem is inflationif if we're inflating at 10 a year youknow you've got 10 pints of blood inyour body will you go to give blood itake a pint out when i take a pint ofblood out of your body you lose the redblood platelets anybody common senseknows you run the boston marathon thenext day you got a problem you can'tperform as an athlete it takes aboutfour to six weeks to replace the redblood cells so when i take a pint ofblood you're not going to be able toperform for a month to two probably twomonths laternow imagine if i actually took a pint ofyour blood every monthforeverthat's inflation so i'm running aneconomy i'm the kingyeah you have a dojo and i send someonefrom the government and we just take apint of blood from every one of yourfighters and then next month we do itagain and next month we do it again andnext month we do it againnowwhat do you expect your ac your athleticperformance to bein decline yeah yeah that's the problemof an of the currency which iscollapsing but let me tell you that'sten percentvenezuela is not ten percent zimbabwe isnot ten percentthe argentine peso was one peso to thedollar twenty years ago and it's likeit's pushing toward 200 pesos to thedollar today they've lost 95 98 99percentin a hyper-inflating economy or rapidlyinflating economy you're not losing 10percent of your economic value a yearyou're losing 20 to 25 to 30 to 40. sothat's like i send some dude to the dojoto bleed you every weekand then at some point i'm sendingsomeone to bleed you every day andthat's the weimar republic righthyperinflationwhennot another metaphor the currencyis to the economywhat your blood is to your bodyand economic energy or money is to thecurrency what oxygen is to your bloodsocommon sense says if i keep sucking theoxygen out of the room if i suck theoxygen out of the room you're going toeither suffocate or freeze to deathand if i keep sucking the economicenergy out of the currency the economycollapses in the extremeyou get ripped back to stone age borderright when the money doesn't workanymore i have to trade you cigarettesfor bullets rightand the problem with that isis the economy becomes a million timesless efficient right if you don't havemoneynow how many countries in the world havea collapsed currency66 are dollarized there's 180 aboutcountries there's 130 floatingcurrenciesall of them are weaker than the dollarthe us dollar is the world's reservecurrency the u.s dollar is expanding itwas expanding 10 percent a year for adecade now expanding at 14 a year itexpanded 34 over the past 12 months thedollar is weakeningokay it's like the auctions gettingsucked out of the room so tucker if itold you the auction is getting suckedout of the room and there's an oxygenmask drops out of the ceiling over therewhat would you dorun for it yeah put the auction mask onbitcoin is the oxygen maskthe idea of bitcoin let's let's move tothe third place and say you've made themost compelling case i've ever heard forthe need for something like bitcoinso you're saying just to make sure thateveryone's following this the wholepoint of bitcoinis to escapethe inflation vortex that has consumedall these previous empiresthe point of bitcoin is to fix the moneyand money is energy and energy is lifeand if i keep sucking the energy out ofthe economy i'm sucking the oxygen outof your system either under the bestcase you perform poorly under the worstcase i suffocate you to death or freezeyou to death that's the problem that'swhy that's why empires collapsethat's why economies collapse and theproblem it's not just a problem for anindividual it's not just a problem for afamily it's a problem for everyinstitution it's problem for everycompany it's a problem for every cityevery municipality every governmentevery civilization they all have thisproblem and you can generally trace theproblem toi i fought a war i couldn't afford tofightand i paid for it with money i didn'thaveyeah rightif youyou declare war on covid you've got awar you declare war in vietnam youdeclare a war on fill in the blank everyhistory is full of warsif i had to fight them with taxesthen eventually my population would sayno more we don't want to pay the tax ifi fight them by inflating the coinagethen i get a couple years two three fouryears before people realize iteventually i just collapsed the currencysomoney is essential to civilizationthe problem is inflation and why does ithappen it's a natural human conditionbecause as you have an authority thatcontrols the money the temptation toinflate the money supply isis omnipresent and and inescapable andevery civilization has suffered from itat one point in time what is bitcoinwell bitcoin is the world's firstengineered monetary system and whathappened is a set of engineers namelessengineersrecoiled in horrorafter the great financial crisis withall the bank bailouts and they lookedand they said this just isn't fair itisn't rightwe want to create a better money andthey used two technologies they use theinternetthe idea that i could internet i couldnetwork hundreds of thousands ormillions of computersand they used cryptography the idea thati could cryptographically sign somethingso that it could not be tampered withwith anyone friend or foeand using those two technologies theyconceptualizedthe idea of an immutable ledgerif you will a bank in cyberspacewhat if a hundred people got together ahundred people with money got togetherand they said we're going to create abank in cyberspaceand umwe want to put our money there and wedon't trust each otherwe don't trust the government we don'ttrust anycorporation we don't even trust any onecomputerso we create a program that keeps trackof a ledger21 million coinsor shares in the bank divided divisibleby a hundred million called this down toa satoshi so 2.1 quadrillion satoshi'syou don't have to know that all you needto know is there's 21 million coin unitsyou can't make any more and they wantedto create a credit so that they could umthey could send their money to eachother to anybody in the networkthey could store it for a thousand years10 000 years a million years foreverand they don't have to trust anybodysothey created this idea of of um bitcoinit's an assetthat's protected by cryptographyand it's stored on a ledgersoftware the software administers theledgerthe twist iswe distributed the software on thousandsand thousands of separate computersevery com every bitcoin node is runninga copy of the ledger so everybody in theworld that that has their money in thebank has a copy of all of uh the moneyin the bank and all the transactionssince the beginning of timeso it's the immutable truthevery 10 minutes the systemtakes a batches a set of contra oftransactions and then redistributes themoney based uponupon the instructions of the owners if iwant to send you my bitcoin i send itand it goes to you and every singlecomputer in the network updates that andthey all check it cryptographicallyusing using uh modern encryptionnow how do we defend the networkthere there'sthere's really three nodes of interestto make this uh compelling the firstnode is that bitcoin node that keepstrack of that ledger it's the mostsecure uh database in the world and it'sa database of immutable truth it's ait's the ledger of money the second nodeis a minor it's uh it's uma sha-256 or it's an encrypting minerthat's generating hash functions toprotect the network and there aremillions of them and they're allcompeting with each other to build thenext blockthere's only one out of two millioninvolved in this network it's like everyevery miner gives you a lottery ticketand one of the two million will get tobuild an xbox and we'll get paid a lotof money like three hundred thousanddollars and you don't know which oneso the miners are a wall of encryptedenergythey're converting electricity intohashes and then inside that wall ofelectricity or wall of energyis the bitcoin ledger which isdistributed in a decentralized fashionand there's one other interesting nodecalled a lightning node this is a layer2 decentralized system this isdecentralized payments it'll move smallamounts of bitcoin at the speed of lightprogrammatically almost for free okaysobitcoin is a decentralizedit's a decentralized piece of softwarethe brilliance of it is it's a bank andcyberspace that nobody controlsnobody can corruptit's it it's a bank run by incorruptablesoftware offering a globalaffordable simplesecuresavings accountfor everybody on earththat has neither the means nor theinclination to run their own hedge fundyou have some money you have lifesavings you simply don't want to lose ityou want to put it in a bankso bitcoin is that bank and cyber spacethese engineers came up with this ideawhat are the engineers well we don'tknow we know some of them they're thecypherpunks they were they were intocryptographyuh the most important of them wassatoshi who we don't know who it wassatoshi wrote the white paper createdthe first version of bitcoin gave it tothe restand initially there wasn't any money inthe network they just ran it for a yearas a hobbyright umand then over time there was a famousfamous transaction where somebody boughtuh a pizzaright for like 10 000 bitcoinone pizza and uh and that was the firsttransaction and then the networkgradually began to monetize as peoplebought into the networkand soit was it's like a fire in cyber spaceshould we be nervous that we don't knowthe identity of the founderno i don't think we should be nervous weshould be joyful becausefor bitcoin to work it needs to be moneyof the people it needs to be notcontrolled by any individual it needs tobe not under the thumb of a founder orcorporation or one strong holder themost important thing satoshi did was hecreated this gift he gave it to theworldi assume he some people think she somepeople think it's multiple peoplebut satoshi gave this gift to the walland disappeared and uh and satoshi minedabout a million coins getting it startedbut they never those coins never movednever they've never been moved satoshi'snever appeared again and then thenetwork was was in essence a communitydevelopment all around the world for thenext decade and it's simply grown froma million dollars in the bank to 10million to 100 million to a billion to10 billionto 100 billionin march of uh our second quarter of2020 was about 180 billion dollars inthis network and that's where i gotinvolved i was latebut when i got involved what i saw wasuh i sawan engineered monetary asset a digitalgold if you will sitting on an open bigtech monetary network and i saidthis is an economic imperative becausethis solves the problem of inflation fora corporation with lots of cashi had a lot of cash and it was i thoughti was going to lose all of it if ididn't invest in something and i said itis alsoa moral imperativethis is a technology to give propertyrights to 8 billion people on the planetthat don't have property rights rightbitcoin is the highest form of propertythe human race has has ever invented andi'll explain why in a secondthere's two billion people don't have abankright you can give everybody on theplanet a bank and property rights thatthat cannot be corrupted and cannot beinflated and confiscated you can give itto them for the price of a free downloadon androidon if you've got a 50 phone and you candownload some software you can have yourown bank your own property rights yourown economic freedom and economicempowerment so it's a moral imperativeand then finally it's a technicalimperativeyou're talking about the digitaltransformation of everything else thedigital transformation of property ofgold of banks the digital transformationof war the digital transformation ofgovernment of security it's a it's adeep ideabut in essence what we'reif the economy's got500 trillion dollars worth of propertyand corporations and stuff in itwell digital digital property is capitalis money is worth that amount it's worthhalf of everything right and sowe never figured out how to digitallytransform money or digitally transformcapitalwe did digitally transform photos andvideos in education and booksand relationships and communicationsrightand you know the secret to success ofgoogle and amazon and apple and facebookis the digital transformation ofentertainment and education andcommunications but think about what itmeans to digitally transform 10 trilliondollars of gold or a hundred trilliondollars of propertyor a hundred trillion dollars ofcurrencysothese engineers they wanted to solvethat problem and of coursehere's the big there's so many big ideasone isit was engineered to be a digital goalwith none of gold's defects21 million coins but you can't make anymore the problem with gold is goldminers inflate the gold supplyand gold bankers inflate the gold papersupply they dump gold derivatives on themarketwith every other asset on earth anythingelse you can own houses gold silvercommodities stocks bondswhen the price goes upthe supply increasesif i increase the supply the price of ofany stock by a factor of 10 the companyissues more stock of courseif i buy all the bonds all the municipalbondsthe price of bonds go up people issuemore bondsright if i drive up the price of gold bya factor of 10 people print more gold ormine more goldbitcoin's the only thing in the worldthat's inelastic to price if the priceof bitcoin triples you can't make anymore if the price goes up by a factor ofa million you can't make any more now solet me get tucker let me just give youone more engineering insightin engineeringthere's something called conservation ofenergy yes and the whole point ofconservation of energy is is energy caneither be made or destroyed there mustbe conservation of itthe mathematicalmetaphor the mathematical analogy tothat is proper math 10 plus 10 equals20. 2 plus 2 equals 4.if 10 plus 10 ever starts to equal 18starts equaling 18you've got a problem yeah if you have abathtub and there's a leak if you have aswimming pool with a leak if i haveelectric system with a short circuitif i have if i have a leak in myengineering system nothing works nothingin the world of ocean engineeringaeronautical engineering electricalengineering nothing works lest youunless you respect conservation ofenergythe problem with inflation is inflationdoes not respect conservation of energyi'm i've got a leak in the system i'vedesigned a currency which is notconservativeso properly understood if you said iwant a conservative money supplya conservative money supply would bethere's a10 billion dollars in the economy andnobody prints anymore right and if youand that's the austrian economic soundmoney principlebitcoin is a conservative monetarysystem it's the first system thatrespects the laws of thermodynamics andthe laws of physics and the laws of mathwhich means it is trueand pureright it has integrityif you have integrityif you have something which is true andpure and you have durabilitythenyou can build a family around it a lifearound it a company around itor civilization around itsteel is concentrated energy andmetallic form you ever walk in a steelpower steel plant and you look at theenergy going into steel refiningit's concentrated energythe history ofthe human race is the civilization thatchannels energy most effectively alwayswins steel trumps iron iron trumpsbronze bronze trumpsrocksbows and arrows trump the guy with thespear the guy with the

energy if you're maybe99.5you put in gold gold supply doublesevery 30 years the gold bankers keepinflating the gold maybe you lose 90 ofyour economic energy but that would be alucky happenstance becausejust about every country on earth seesthe goal from their citizens the lasthundred years everybody even the u.sthey take your goal yeah so you want tosave money for 100 years you can't do

simplypure economic energy these engineerssatoshi and all of satoshi's compatriotswhat they did is created uh anengineered monetary asset on an openpermissionless networkthat anybody could participate inany countryany company any individualyou don't need a bank you don't need toask permissionright it is it is the ultimateegalitariansystemif you want to give property rights toeverybody in africa and south americaeven in the face of a hostile regime youcan do it with a fifty dollar androidphone and a simple downloadwhat's your next best ideago to zimbabweokay you have a hundred buckshow are you gonna store the hundreddollars one more metaphorif you can't store property if you haveno property rights that means you can'tstore economic energy if i took awayevery dime from your familyand you got up tomorrow you'd be worriedyou'd lose your job you're going to gohungry right you need money you've got abank you're in the western world youhave western privilege lucky you youhave stocksif you have stocks they go up 34 a yearmaybe you're keeping ahead of theinflation rate if i take away yourstocks and you have to store in incurrency well now you can't stay aheadif i take away your bank you can't evenhave the currency what if the dollar isnot the worst currency the dollar is thebest currency if i put you in zimbabweyou knowit's much worse if you're in argentinayou lost 40 to 60 percent of yourpurchasing power this yearif you're in if you're in venezuela muchworse so what does it meanuh to not have property rights and didnot have a strong currency it's likebeing a type 1 diabeticif

weeks after you lose your jobyou can't feed your family you can'tfeed yourself you can't plan for thefutureso now we're back to what's the basis ofcivilization and what's the basis ofof virtue in a societyyou've got to be able to plan for thefuture you've got to look out 10 yearsand believe that you can provide foryour family what's the point ofinvesting in something if you think thateverything's going to hell in five yearsor 10 yearshow did i get into bitcoin i had acompany with 500 million dollars in cashearning zero percent interest i heardthe banker say we're not even thinkingabout thinking about raising interestrates i saw a k-shaped recovery whereeverybody on wall street got 30 percentricher doing nothing in a year whereeverybody on main street had to work 30harder to stay stillthat's what i saw last year if you're onwall street with a billion dollars youended the year with a billion threeif you're on main street working for aliving selling something by the sweat ofyour brow you had to raise your prices30 percent working harder in order togenerate 30 more money to buy the samething you could have bought before thecrisiswhat i saw wastwo thousand people in my companyworking hard doing a hundred thousandthings right every year could make fiftymillion dollarsand the money in the bank was going tolose 100 million dollars a year in valuedoing nothingandwe were running as hard as we could andgoing backwardsrightthat's the problem it's like uhyou're in a boatyou're rowing across you're in a rowboatyou're going across the water and thewind starts blowing in your faceand now you're getting blown backwardsyou're going to row harder the wind isthe monetary inflation rate right rightwhen it at ten percent wind is hard whenit got to twenty percent when who cangrow their cash flows twenty fivepercent a yearwho can do it a monopoly a digital techmonopoly might but i mean nobody elsecan dentists can't doctor can'tnormal people can't normal company can'tso the wind starts blowing double andtriple in your face you're rowing you'renot going to get across the atlanticyou're going to die on that row boat sowhat do you doturn the boat aroundput up a salesale with the winyeah that's what i did so make a let megive you an economic short story herethe company's worth a billion dollarsthis is a micro strategy we've got a 500million dollar software company thatgenerates 50 75 million a year in cashflowwe have 500 million dollars in the bankwe're valued at one times revenue plusthe cashand the cash is going to lose 20 30percent of its value so i'm looking atlosing a hundred million dollars a year150 million i'm doing nothing justsitting there just sitting there doingnothingwell so what do i do i said well i'mgoing to buy something so i went and ibought bitcoin i bought 250 milliondollars worth of itand then i did it i i offered to buyback 250 million dollars in my stockbecause if my shareholders didn't likethe idea i figured i'd buy them out at apremiumafter the buyback i had another 175million dollars left i bought morebitcoin we had 425 million dollars ofbitcoinwhen i started this journey tucker thestock was 120 a sharewe bought out our our limited partnerswe bought our shareholders 140 a sharethat didn't like the ideaumthe stock traded up bitcoin traded up wedoubled our initial uh our initialinvestment the stock kept going up andthen i looked and i said i'm just goingto borrow money i went and i borrowed650 million dollarsat 75 basis points in the capital marketi issued a convertible bondi bought the bitcoin19 000.the stock kept trading up bitcoin kepttrading up we madebillions at that pointi went back to the market i borrowed abillion dollars at zero percent interestbecause why wouldn't youand iif the if the money supply is expandingat 25 a year and you can borrow money atzero percent interest all you got to dois buy something which is scarceright so i bought a billion dollars ofbitcoin i issued a billion dollars abond to make a long story short we endedup borrowing 2.2 billion dollars at oneand a half percent interest we boughtthe bitcoinuh bitcoin has hit an all-time high wenow have about seven and a half billiondollars worth of bitcoinwe've made about a four billion dollarinvestment profit on it the stock wentfrom 120 to 850.we generated about 8 billion dollars inshareholder value in 12 months have youtalked to your limited partners who gotout earlyit's complicated when you're publictraded you can't even admitbut you know so now what are we we'relike uh we're a 500 million dollarsoftware company generating maybe 80 to100 million dollars a year in cash flowgrowing zero to 10 a year right witha seven and a half to eight billiondollarendowment that's growing 170 a yearbut you know it's likewhy not like so now you know if you're auniversity you want an endowment and nowi can we can do what we want sosomebody gets it first of all that washow long have we gone how long is thiswould that you spoke uninterrupted forabout 50 minutes you can cut that no noi know that was amazing that was likeone of the most little things i've everheard i have two two questions okayumall of this is predicatedthe the remarkable case you just made onbehalf of bitcoin is predicated on theidea that bitcoin is safe andfundamentally as a software matter theycan't be hacked you said that thedatabase that undergirds it is the mostsecure in the worldyou're why are we so positive that whenthe caa can be hackedthat this can't beyeahwhen wewhen we started down this journeywe were looking fordigital goal we're looking forengineered perfect goldthat you can move at the speed of lightand program on a computer yes and thetheoretical answer to that is a cryptoasset that's got a fixed supplythat's secure yes sowe went on on this search and there are10 000 cryptos tuckerright we had to look is it bitcoin is itbitcoin cash is it one of the clones isit is it dogecoin is it you know fill inthe blankumwe applied the microstrategy test it's athree-part testwill it be bannedwill it be hackedcan it be copiedrightif you can duplicate it 18 000 timesthen it's not scarce and it's not uniqueit's not the dominant oneokay and and if you if it gets bannedthat's no good for us and if it getshacked that's not good for us so firstof all how can you know the answer tothis from uh from the engineering itselfwell you can'tif the year is 2009 or 2010 you don'treally know whether it'll be bannedcopied or hacked right there's a lot ofuncertaintywe started on our quest in 2020 so in2020 we had 12 years of history so whatdid we see wellby 2020 the system had been attackedthousands and thousands of times but noone had hacked itso we had we had a hundred and eightybillion dollars sitting in a networkthat no one could figure out how to hackno one ever hacked it people by the waypeople will hack the banks around it orthe wallets around it but not theunderlying network so we had 12 years ofof no hacking incident noand and very good reason to believe itwon't be hacked because it is the mostsecure database in the world and why isit the most securebecause the way it works is you have toyou have to run a sha 256 asic minerit's a very special purpose computerthat computer only does one thing itprotects bitcoin that's all it can do itcan't it can't stream video it can'tprocess for awsthat that network is million or thatcomputer is millions of times moreefficient atgenerating uh crypto hashes that defendthe bitcoin network that's just it's aspecial purpose thing seven generationsif you turned all of the aws network orthe azure network against it it wouldn'tmake a dentbecause this is a very special purposepiece of hardware so the technologythat's used to secure the network iscalled proof of workand proof of work isis i pour a lot of energy into thenetwork and i run it throughan encryption algorithm and that's ashaw 256 hash generator and thecombination of those two things with theprotocol means that the dominantcrypto asset proof of work network willalways be the most secure one andeveryone will always defect from theweaker one to the stronger one sowe saw that it hadn't been hackedthere's no way to there's no way tofinesse itno matter what you do because it reallyis ait's a brute forcecrypt wall of encrypted energyif you want to attack the network andeven try to meddle with one block you'dhave to throw 10 billion dollars ofcapital equipment at it and it'llprobably take you two to four years toget ready to do that okay so that leadsexactly to my next question so thatthat's reallytheonly government would do that and thatthat leads to next question which isrightum so like what's the government ofgovernment is an organization thatcontrols a discrete territory hasbordersand mints the coins issues the currencysothis is seems to me like an existentialthreat no overstatement to the the ideaof a nation state an independentinternational currencywhy would governmentsallow thisyeah so that gets to the question ofwill it be banneduhby the way can't be hacked for what isaid it can't be copied because you gotto come up with the same 10 billionworth of energy and special purposehardware andif you had that much energy and hardwareyou'd be getting paid 10 billion dollarsa year to use it to protect bitcoin orget paid zero to try to copy it so rightso it doesn't make any sense to try tocopy it it's like the dominant monetarynetwork like google and facebook arealso dominant networks once you get tothat dominant positionit it's obscenely difficultcoming back to the banning umthere's a there's a kind of misnomerpeople often call it crypto currenciescurrencies but it's not a currency it'san asset it's a crypto asset so you'reright tucker if the government thoughtit was a currency and if it competedwith the us dollar or other currenciesthen they would take offense and theywill suppress itbut on the other hand if it's viewed asan asset which competes with gold orwith index funds or with bonds orproperty or real estate just a store ofvalue or silverthenyou know you can holdsp s p index funds and bonds and you canown land and you can own property thegovernment would simply like you todisclose when you sell it to someoneelse at a profit and pay your taxes onit a capital gains tax and if you wantedto wire a hundred million dollars worthof property to someone else theyprobably want you to disclose that perthe aml kycyou know anti-money it will be earnedenough honestlyit can be owned anonymously exceptas a practical matter if you want toacquire large sums of ityou have to acquire them on registeredexchanges so you'd be going to aninstitutional grade custodian which islicensed so what you seemaybe you get to a very important pointthe government is regulatedwhere it is allowed and it's allowedeverywhere except there's some there'ssome noise in china china is a differentsituation in the western worldthe regulations are you can hold this aslong as you uh disclose it via aregulated entity so you're buying itthroughthrough a registered exchange and thenwhen you transfer it you're subject toirs taxyou have to pay capital gains tax couldyou conduct anonymousexchangeswith it i mean i i'm just thinkingthrough ways that it would undermine theauthority of the government which by theway i'm not against necessarily butthat's actually uh the primarythe primary issues before congress andthe senate right now right treasuryif you look at the past week thetreasury the sec the cftc congress andthe center are engaged in ain aenthusiastic dialogue about what kind ofregulations will be applied to thetransferand uh and to the utilization of cryptoassetsbut the most important for exampleuhif you issue a crypto asset which lookslike a security like mikey coinyeahif i create mikey coin and i keep halfof it and i i issue the rest and imarket it it looks more like a securityor a stockright that's going to fall under thejurisdiction of the sec most likelyright if it looks like there's a there'sa set of crypto assets called stablecoinsthat look like u.s dollarsuh the the president's working committeeabout a week ago suggested that onlyfdic approved banks should issue stablecoins they want anybody issuing stablecoins to be fdicapproved insured licensed sothere is regulation coming into thespaceultimatelyi think that the security tokens will beunder pressure the stable coins will betreated like money markets in cyberspaceand probablyit'swe're rotating from the cryptoentrepreneurs to the institutionalpublicly traded institutions large banksetcbitcoinwhat it was going to be was a questionuntil 2014 when the irs designated hispropertyyou're either property or your currencyin an inflationary environment moneydecomposes into currency and into anasset component uh or property come onif you will the currency is a medium ofexchange that you can transmit withoutincurring a tax obligation rightright i give you a million dollars worthof dollars you hold it for a year yougive it to her there's no tax billit's just it's a stable coin stablemedium of exchange on the other hand igive you a million dollars of bitcoinyou hold it for a yearyou give a million dollars a bitcoin toher and if the price doubledthen you owe a five hundred thousanddollar you're a tax on five hundredthousand dollars of capital gainsee or actually maybe yeah in that caseright you transferred a million dollarsof bitcoin with a basis of 500 000 acapital gain of 500 000 you owe capitalgains when you transfer could i makethat and not that i'm a criminal oranything but i i don't know i don'tthink everything needs to be monitoredby the government could iunder the current system transfer thatbitcoin to someone else without thegovernment knowing i think right now inthe u.s and all the institutionalcustodians i know of if you go above tenthousand dollars the which is the amllimit for most banks they're required todisclose thatright so that so we're moving to thepoint where if you're transferringproperty like if you wired me a milliondollars with apple stock right rightyour bank you know there'd be a tax billon that for sure if you wire me amillion dollars of bitcoin through anykind of institutional exchange there's aa tax it's impossible tobuy and sell bitcoin outside ofinstitutional exchangesthere are peer-to-peer networks and andthere's a lot of back and forth overwhether or not those are allowed or notallowed and it varies by jurisdiction soi think that that's going to getregulated and is regulated differentlyin every jurisdiction generally thescurrying iswhat's what's the regulation around taxtransfer disclosure anti-moneylaundering counter-terrorism disclosuresrightis the disclosure none at all is thedisclosure above 10 000 is thedisclosure at 600and so all of the sparksare around how much economic freedomright and they have different impact forexample by the way could you when youuse the termsterrorism and money laundering can youuse air quotes do you mindyeahsoit's above my pay gradehere's my key point rightyou're a family you're an institutionalinvestor you're a corporation you seeinflationyou either buy some land yes you buysome stocks you buy a bunch of gold oryou buy bitcoinwhy would you buy the bitcoin becauseyou want the apex assets exactly you youdon't want the dilution of gold youdon't want the dilution of stocks youdon't want the property tax on propertyyou don't want the maintenance headacheof propertyall other forms of property can beimpaired confiscated inflated awayall other forms of property right youhave rentalbuildings in new york city and there's arent control and you can't evict yourtenants and there's a property taxit's hard to sell itand you've got to maintain it and soall other properties that come with themaintenance costs they come with therisk the idea of bitcoin isdigitalpropertyit's it'sit's digital gold is digital propertiesdigital money is digital energy the ideais let's create something pureit's better gold than gold because abillion dollars of it is weightlessmoves at the speed of light for free andi can hold it in my headit's better property than propertybecause there's no maintenance costs andi can't seize it from youit's better money because for the samereason it moves at the speed of lightit's programmabletry to send money on a saturdayafternoon if try to send a currency on asaturday afternoon from a bank here to abank in france or a bank in nigeriacan't do it you know just can't do it soit's notspoils of war it's spoils of peacethis is another big idea i want to makewith everything else if we monetize ifwe have a bunch of money if i give you amillion dollars and i tell you go buystuff with it and you buy gold jewelryin a house and a car and whatever and iwant iti put a gun to your head give me yourstuff tucker and you say no i shoot youand take your stuffthere's nothingin this world that you can own that ican't take with forceexcept bitcoin okay if you take themillion dollars and you buy bitcoin andyou take personal custody of it and youown the keys the keys password is inyour head i hold the gun to your headgive me your bitcoin you can say no nowi can still shoot you in the headbut i don't get the propertyyou seeyou can take it this is the only properin the history of mankind tucker you cantake to the gravethe pharaohs wanted to take their goalwith them to the grave they createdthese pyramids to bury themselves withgold but grave diggers engraved robberssteal the goldyou can't take anything else with youbut you can takethe password in your head why is thatsignificant well you study the historyof the jews in the 30s in nazi germanyand and most of them left with if theywere lucky 10 of their assetsthey would have left with all theirassets if their assets were in bitcointhey couldn't move their house theycan't move a

and whatever 14 1500 you knowduring the inquisitionit was all over property right they'restealing their propertyso what are property rightsproperty rights is you can own stuff andno one can take it away from youi had a million dollars in a bank inargentina 20 years ago it was in u.sdollars the peso was one to the dollarthe argentine government sent a memo tothe banks forcibly converted everybody'sdollars to pesos and then forciblydevalued the peso 10 for one and i wokeup the next morning and a hundredthousand dollars i had a million dollarsa day beforethey stole 90 percent of all thecurrency from everybody in the countryovernight on a faxwithout a law without an armynow how hard would it be to takeall of the property or of everybody inthe country with bitcoin you have to goarrest 60 million people sweat them allinto jail for 90 days how do you arrest60 million people sweat them in jail for90 daysit's like a billion times hardersobitcoin is property rights properlyunderstoodand that is an impor important economicempowerment it's a protection ofindividual liberties it's john locke'sdreamlife liberty and propertyyou knowgo west young man why people come

time we kind of solvethe problemsoyou know it doesn't make sense as longas it's it's secure and can't be copiedand we had to wait 12 years 10 000 timespeople tried to copy it they all failedright was it hacked no will it be bannedwell here's the thing that's happened inthe last 12 months tucker the irs saidits propertyit's important for it to be property notcurrency currency is the provenance ofthe government right every gov everypowerful government will have a currencyevery week government will have acollapsing currency and every failedgovernment will lose their currencyprivileges hence 66 countries dollarizethere's going to be collapse 100countries will probably lose theircurrency privileges eventually you gotthe cny the usda few powerful second level currenciesand then name one currency in africathat you would rather hold in the dollarthere's just one name one currency insouth america you'd rather hold in thedollar there isn't one why hasn't thedollar spread to everybody's iphone andandroid phonethey're rating they're waiting for thecrypto railsright at the point that i can download amobile app load it up with 87every other currency in the world startsto collapse into the us dollar assumingthe united states embraces it so why hasthe united states embraced itthe united states has embraced itwhy why has the chinese nation been abit skittish about it well china's got awall and behind that wall they havecapital controls they don't want capitalto flow freely a chinese citizen can'ttake a million dollars out of china theyjust can't that behind that wall theyblock google they block facebook theybought twitter they block the free flowof capital that's that's how theycontrol their system they print chinesecurrency if there was a free flow ofcapital all the current capital wouldleave chinathey'd have a problem so they've gottheir systemand in the west we've got a westernsystem where we allow google and twitterand facebook and the and the westernsystem is based on the english languagewestern valuesgenerally western lawus dollarbitcoinrightthe in the last year the u.s hasembraced bitcoin the chinese haverejected bitcoin at this point you havejerome powell saying this is an assetit's not a currency it's an asset youhave gary gensler the head of the secsaying this is an asset it's a scarcespeculative asset they say it'sspeculative of course it's speculativeright if it wasn't speculativethen 100 trillion dollars would flowinto it it would be it would have grownby a factor of 100 by now i mean therehas to be some risk it's a speculativestore of value christina legard saysit's an asset even the bankers whenthey're criticizing quote unquote theysay it's not a currency it's not amedium of exchangeyeah you're right it doesn't need to bea medium of exchangeyou don't need it you don't need toreplace the us dollar in the westernworld to fix things what you need to dois give people a savings accounti want to hold one month of my salary indollars i want to store everything elsefor the next 10 years or 100 years in anasset which is going up in valuesoif you lookif you look at what's happenedthe white the administration's in favorof this this is a broadly bipartisanthing sent the alumnus stood up on onthe floor of the senate and said thankgod for bitcoinbitcoin is sound moneyit's sell money to the right it's soundmoney to the left who doesn't want toeconomically empower everybody on earthright it's it's good for everybody inthe worldthere's there's broad support in thesenate there's bipartisan support in thesenate and broad support in the housethere's broad support in theadministrationpeople were a bit confused that it mightbe a currency and it's going to replacethe dollar and if so then that's uh anexistential problem but once once youtake that turn you saythis is not a problem for the dollarthis is us replacing the foundation ofthe economy that currently rests onuhother fiat assets which are in in uhimperfect and efficientright the first thing that collapses isgoldgold has been collapsing for a decadegoes down four percent in the mostinflationary year of our business careerit's down four percent bitcoin's up 340percent tucker what's bitcoin tradingout right now66 000 67 thousandlast question last question if you hadto call it how high do you think in thenext five years bitcoin could getthis is per coin but you knowbitcoin's going up forever because it'sa cap supply of 21 million and it'sgoing to go upbecause of inflation right we're goingto increase the supply of dollars andbitcoin is going to be fixed so indollars it goes up it's going to go upbecause of technical utility we're goingto build it into iphones and androidphones and put it into every computerand move it at the speed of light andbuild it into twitter and square andpaypal and thenand the like so that'll cause it to goup it's going to go up for adoptionbecause of adoption more and more peopleare gonna bring their money andit's not like facebook it's not like uhwhen rupert murdoch showed up atfacebook he didn't bring a billionfriendswhen a billionaire joins a monetarynetwork they bring a billion dollarsso when a hundred billionaires show upthey bring hundreds of billions ofdollars when companies wheninstitutional investors show up theybring massive amounts of capital so itwill keep going up with adoption utilityand inflation and eventuallyyou know it will replace gold which is10 trillion dollar asset bitcoins like a1.2 it'll go by a factor of 10. and inin three to five years it'll certainlyreplace goldthen it will replace indexes right the sp index or bond indexes it'll start todemonetizefixed income and equity indexes that areused as a store of valueright because that's right now peoplethey want to save their money for a longperiod of time they use that andgradually it'll demonetize property likeyou know in canada they got a housingshortage because foreigners go and theybuy the houses you know as an investmentand the locals can't afford a house yeahi've noticed same problem in the u.s yeswe're monetizinghouses that is to say if i printinfinite moneythe price of all i go and i buysomething tangible with the money beforeit devalues the problem is people thatare starting their career that need tobuy a house can't afford to buy yesso you don't want to monetize somethingwith utility exactly you know youmonetize food everybody starves youmonetize houses everybody's on thestreet right so what bitcoin is doing isit's demonetizingcommercial andreasons decided no more bitcoindown if the residentiali mean what would happen in residentialreal estate marketswell i mean if if bitcoin went away thenthen the other monetary assets wouldmonetize a bit more right but bitcoin is1 trillion out of 500 trillion in stuffout there so it's stillit's still less than one percent but youknow gold would get a slight boostgold is is really being uh why is itgold didn't go up 34 gold underperformedthe s p index in a year of politicalunrest and massive rampant inflationit's it's the one year in 40 years goldshould have gone up in price why becauseeveryone looking for a non-sovereignstore of value grabbed the crypto goldright they they occupy the same nichenon-sovereign sound money store of valuenot related to cash flows can't bemocked with but the problem is gold canbe corruptedgold is corrupted by gold miners andgold brokers and gold dealers bitcoincan't be corrupted in that way becauseyou can take possession of your ownbitcoin and the gold mine the bitcoinminers can't make anymoresopeople say bitcoin is fixing thingsright fix the money fix the worldbitcoin is is gradually demonetizingthese other assets and the idea is toreturn rationalityto make things more rationalright if people start buying bitcoininstead of buying a second investmentpropertythat price of property will go down forpeople that want a first home yesthat's the idea if people start buyingbitcoin instead of bonds the price ofbonds will come down the yield will comeup exactly and if you want risk-freeyield you'll be able to buy that yieldit used to be a million dollars got youa bond to paid you 50 000 a year now youneed 20 million dollars or 10 milliondollars to get a bond that pays 50 000 ayearyour retirement just went from costingyou a million it costing you 10 millionsobitcoin is is demonetizing some of theseother assets and the stock market allthese meme stocks these are all symptomsof too much moneyright and and the the sky high p to eratiossothe big picture the big idea heretucker isthe average american the average theaverage wage earner is forced to taketheir life savings and gamble it in thestock market in order to avoid losingtheir life savings my 83 year old fatherhas to guess which stock is going to goup this weekand whether it's exxon is better thanbritish petroleum or better than appleor not so good as google in order to notlose his life savings because if he putsit into the bank he gets paid 0.1percent interestand it loses 25 of its purchasing powera year and people aren't stupid theyknow that things are going up fasterthan two percent a year or four percenta year or five percent a year so we'restampeding an entire generation intoeither at best investing in in stocks orat worst gambling with meme stocks andgambling with crypto random dog coinsbecause no one has a savings accountthey trust bitcoin is a bank incyberspace offering a savings accountyou're not gambling on the next productrelease of apple versus google andwhether amazon will get unionized andwhether you know this pipeline will getapproved and it's that's not right andif you put all your money in the s pindex all the ceos print more stock anddilute
