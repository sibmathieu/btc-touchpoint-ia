  "text": "Preston Pysh (00:01:13):Hey, everyone. Welcome to the show, I’m here with \nShaun. Shaun, I saw some clips of you talking  on the internet and I was like, “Oh, my God. I \ngot to get this guy on the show immediately,”  because you were just spitting fire, man. Absolute \nfire. Welcome to the show. Great to have you here.Shaun Connell (00:01:31):Cool. I appreciate it. Thanks for having me  on. I’ve been a big time fan \nfor a long time. Fantastic.Preston Pysh (00:01:35):Awesome. Well, I’m very excited to have you \nhere. Let’s start off with just your background,  because what I like about your background \nis you started off in energy. Correct?Shaun Connell (00:01:45):Yeah, that’s right. Yep.Preston Pysh (00:01:47):I love this because this not the normal \npath. Talk to us about that background  and then talk to us about how Bitcoin \njust popped up into your everyday life.Shaun Connell (00:02:00):Yeah. Sure. My background is that I came into \nenergy in 2002. I’m from the East Coast of Canada.  I got a one way plane ticket for graduation \ngift, and I moved out to Calgary, Alberta,  and I was essentially looking for anything \nand everything, any job opportunities here.  I’d had like a real fascination around trading \nfor a long time and a real interest in it.  One of the places that I put a resume to was \ncalled TransAlta and it was energy marketing.  I just finished a business degree and I \nthought that marketing was traditional  marketing. I didn’t realize that it was \nthe energy marketing of marketing power.  This was right at the time in 2002 that \npower markets were just deregulating. Right?Shaun Connell (00:02:42):What that meant was is that companies that used to \nhave customers that were really just rate payers,  right? They didn’t have a say in anything. \nEssentially, markets were deregulated where they  separated the generation from the transmission, \nfrom the person that sends you the retail bill.  In this process, a lot of these generation \ncompanies found themselves in a position where  they had a lot of generation that they now need \nto find a home to. That was kind of the genesis  of trade floors coming around, around the year \n2000. I started in 2002 where I found a company  here that was energy marketing, got a interview \nand took them for a tour at the trade floor,  and I fell in love with it and was super \nexcited and said everything I could to get a job  and then spent the next pretty much 20 \nyears with that company where essentially  starting on a narrowly desk and a real \ntime desk, and then growing up and helping  build this desk and leading this desk that was \nresponsible for optimizing a fleet of natural gas  generation assets in Ontario and some \nother assets in different markets.Shaun Connell (00:03:41):What was really neat about it and \nhas this overlay with Bitcoin is that  when markets were just deregulating at this time, \nso 2002, there was no books on how to trade power,  right? It was kind of like the Wild Wild West, and \nyou’re trying to figure out how to make this work.  Right? The people that figured out fastest and \nearliest were the ones that really did well in  the company that did well. It has an overlay with \nmining right now, right? Because it’s like this  place where there’s no books on how to do mining. \nThere’s no agreed to commodity of saying that the…  I believe that there’s a megawatt of power \nand MMBtu of gas, and I think in the future,  we’ll talk about exahashes, which I \nbelieve is like a billion, billion hashes.Shaun Connell (00:04:21):I think that’s going to be the commodity. There’s \nno playbooks on how do we value the exahashes or  Ford market for exahashes? What does that mean? \nIt really ties into minors, because miners have  efficiencies that how many exahash per megawatt \nhour they can produce based on different miners?  Really, it’s a perfect overlay with power \nplants, right? Because there’s natural gas plants  and they have something called a heat rate, right? \nA seven heat rate plant uses seven years of gas,  produce one megawatt. A gas peaker will \ndo something like a 13 heat rate, but it’s  really this perfect overlay where you see what \nhappened in power markets and how that evolved  over time and really matured. Then, you see this \nkind of thing at the start of Bitcoin. Right?Shaun Connell (00:05:00):My introduction to Bitcoin was a friend of mine \ngave me a call in 2017 and long time friend  respect his opinions. He was telling me about, \n“Had I heard of Bitcoin?” I was like, “Yeah. I’ve  heard about it.” He gave me the digital gold \nnarrative and I bought into it quite quickly.  Then, the question was, I said, “Okay. Well, \nhow much does it cost?” Right? At the time,  it was 10,000. I said, “Well, how much does it \ncost to make? How else can you get?” He said,  “Well, you can buy it or you can mine it.” I \nsaid, “Okay. What’s the price?” He’s like, “10,000  to buy, and it was like 200 to make.” Right? \nComing from a background in commodities is just  over time, commodity prices always \nconverge. They arbitrage the way the spread.Preston Pysh (00:05:40):\nYeah.Shaun Connell (00:05:41):Right? There’s this mining industry \nwhere it’s just this hype happening,  this excitement and you see this pulling \napart and you say, “$10,000 of Bitcoin  can make it for 200.” Something’s got to \ngive, right? It’s going to be, “What’s the  correction?” That’s where I really fell in love \nwith understanding mining for… Because for me, to  invest a meaningful amount of time or money in \nsomething, you really got to understand it. For  me, that started the journey or ran down this \nrabbit hole of understanding the fundamentals  of mining and the polls on those. Over time then, \nI was at my company there at TransAlta and then,  we’re considering, “Should we do mining?” We’re \nlooking at what’s the opportunity to do that  and realize just how much of a tremendous \nopportunity this was going to be.Shaun Connell (00:06:32):You think about just this new technology where \nwhen I was first introduced to the company  that I’m with right now, it’s called Lancium, and \nwhat they do is they essentially take these large  Bitcoin mining facilities and they turn \nthem into a power plant, but in reverse.  Right? What that means is you can dispatch down \nthese facilities the same way as you can with a  natural gas plant or a coal plant or whatnot. You \nprovide all the ancillary services that are like  backup power for a grid. For me, at that time, \nI realized how big of a role this could play,  and I didn’t think that [inaudible 00:07:09].Preston Pysh (00:07:10):It was more than a light bulb moment. Right?Shaun Connell (00:07:12):\nYeah.Preston Pysh (00:07:13):\nIt was like, “What did I just discover?”Shaun Connell (00:07:15):There were stages of the light bulb, right?Preston Pysh (00:07:19):\nYeah.Shaun Connell (00:07:19):The light bulb goes off and then you find out \nmore, you’re like, “Oh, my goodness. This is a  bigger light bulb.” Then, more and more and more \nso that was a very long winded way of saying  that I started in energy markets, did that for 20 \nyears, realized the comparison of energy markets  and Bitcoin mines, how they’re maturing. The first \n10 years of those energy markets were so exciting  that I wanted to have a repeat of that, and to \ntake the opportunity to say, “I’m going to go  join this new space with this company that’s in \nthis space and have another fun 10 plus years.”Preston Pysh (00:07:48):Well, let me ask you this. When \nyou were understanding this  and you’re explaining it to other executives \nin the energy space, what was the reaction?Shaun Connell (00:07:58):It’s a great question. I go to observation and a \nlittle bit of opinion. If you’re an energy company  that is already involved in fossil fuels, \nlike say you’re an oil and gas company,  you’re probably going to be more receptive to \nit. Right? Because you’re already labeled as  fossil fuels in bed that… Taking on this initial \ninitiative of something like Bitcoin mining,  it’s great because it’s another way \nto monetize an asset at one of your  facilities. Power generation’s different, \nright? Because power generation is  where I’m grateful for being part of… Like in a \ncareer in electricity is it’s every fuel type,  because there’s renewables. There’s \ncoals. There’s natural gas. There’s  oil peakers before. You get to have an exposure \nto all of these and over the past 10 years  as this narrative was developing around \nessentially this energy transition, like moving to  sustainable energy is a lot of these companies are \nvery cautious about being the first mover. Right?Preston Pysh (00:09:00):Yeah.Shaun Connell (00:09:01):If you are a power generation company that’s \ntrying to brand yourself as renewables, what will  the market say? What will the market say if I’ve \ngot renewables and Bitcoin mining? Is that good or  bad? This is now tying into the kind of opinion, \nis that I think it’s going to take a large power  generation company to be the first one. Then, \nonce they take the brunt of kind of, “Was this  deem to be excellent? A good idea?” Based on \nthe outcome of that company going forward,  I think that you’re going to get the companies to \nfollow in behind because it’s a remarkable way to  monetize generation that previously required \nwires. Now, you can do with ethernet cable.Preston Pysh (00:09:47):I would describe what I think I just \nheard you say is they’re open to the idea,  but there’s a massive education gap for \nthe population to fully understand what  it would even mean, and it poses a potential \nbranding issue for them until the population  understands or somebody else goes out before them \nand lays the path that’s a major energy producer  that basically sets the precedence for it not \nbeing a branding issue. Is that correct, or…?Shaun Connell (00:10:24):Yeah. That is correct. I’d put \non one other… A layer to that  is that… In 2017, what I was hearing \naround for other power companies was that  the lack of understanding what Bitcoin was? Is \nit a Ponzi scam? Is this going to be around for  a long time? Because if you think about like the \ntraditional model for power generation companies  is that they’re going to be connected to the grid \nand they’ve got a couple choices to monetize that.  One is they can inject that \npower into the power grid and  you’re going to get paid whatever the spot \nprice of energy is for that injection point.  The second part is that you can have customers \nthat are behind the fence. There’s like industrial  customers where they can take steam electricity \nfor some big industrial processes. Right?Shaun Connell (00:11:11):By being behind the meter where the power plant \nis that you’re avoiding a lot of the costs that  would do with the transmission distribution costs \nand whatnot. That’s the normal playbook is saying,  “We can head behind the fence so we can do the \ngrid.” Now, go back to 2017 again as saying,  “How much of the value chain do we want to \npartake in?” Is it really our time to extend  the value chain of saying, “We’re a power company. \nWe produce megawatts and we sell them to customers  that use those megawatts.” There’s, “Do we \nwant to just have the same model of having  miners co-locate with us the same way \nas these other industrial customers,  or do we think that this is something that we’ve \ndeveloped for competencies over the past 20  years for optimizing assets that we could do a \nbetter job of saying we’re essentially going to  think about this as upgrading our facility to \nrefine local megawatts into global megawatts  and we’re going to take the value side of the \nmining.” Right? Which I think is a natural fit,  but that’s a struggle that I think some companies \nwill have. Just especially back in 2017 of saying,  “Is this thing going to be around in \nfive years? Should we make this CapEx  investment in something that \nmay or may not be here?”Preston Pysh (00:12:16):Let me ask you this. On a scale from one to 10, \none being nobody understands it and it’s nowhere  to be found in the power of space to 10, everybody \nunderstands it. Everybody has spent the CapEx and  has it on board and it’s just part of everyday \noperations for pretty much any energy producer  in the world. Where are we at today? How fast is \nthat trend moving on that scale from one to 10?Shaun Connell (00:12:47):My observation from a few years ago, so two \nyears ago was that we were mostly at about a  one or a two. Right? That means that we \ndon’t understand it. There hasn’t been enough  mining companies going public \nthat we can look at the appendixes  and really understand how do they calculate the \nvalue of mining. Right? Because that’s a black  box. Another thing is just in the past, and \nthis is the comparison of how I think about  mining is what’s the value of an exahash and \nwhat is the revenue per megawatt hour for  that mining? In the mining space, it’s more about \nwhat is the dollar per day per terahash. Right?  That’s not linking to an executive at an energy \ncompany. You really don’t know what that means.Shaun Connell (00:13:30):It wasn’t kind of an apples to apples comparison. \nWe’re transitioning to that. I’d say that two,  three years ago was that one, people didn’t \nknow what it was. They didn’t know how to  value this. Right? I’d say that today, in \nconversations I’ve had with several friends that  work for other power generation companies, it’s \non everybody’s radar. It’s beyond on the radar,  I would say that some feel like they’ve missed the \nboat and they’re frustrated. Right? Then, others  are like, “Well, we’re still nervous about this, \nand we still don’t know what we’re going to do,  but we now feel more confident that \nit’s here to stay though.” Right?Preston Pysh (00:14:08):Yeah. Okay. One of the things that I \nheard Michael Saylor say in one of his  interviews was just the network effect that \nis now being constructed for proof of stake  because of this integration with power companies \nand what it’s going to do for them. Generically,  the first question I got for you on that idea \nis if a power company has a top line of 100 and  a bottom line, I don’t know the margins here. I \nprobably should. Let’s just say the margins are  what? Five, 10% after tax for a power company. \nWe’ll just say it’s 5% for simplicity, but let’s  say the top line is 100 and the bottom line is a \nfive, if that power company would fully embrace  Bitcoin mining as an additional strategy, what \nwould that do to their bottom line of five?  Would it bump it up to a seven or \na 10? What are we talking here?Shaun Connell (00:15:05):This would require you to be looking back in \nhindsight, because hindsight would tell you  what you would’ve made for revenue per megawatt \ngiven certain machines that you have set up. You  assume that we would say like, “Hey, we’re a power \ngeneration company.” We’re going to do a look back  over the past four years, and assuming \nthat we bought the latest gen miners at  that time. Right? In the pay difference \nfor having that upgrade, it’s massive.Preston Pysh (00:15:30):It’s more than doubling the bottom line.Shaun Connell (00:15:32):I would say more than… Multiples of that.Preston Pysh (00:15:34):\nWow.Shaun Connell (00:15:34):Because we’re in this early \ntimeframe though. Right?Preston Pysh (00:15:37):Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\nShaun Connell (00:15:38):We’ll get into more details because I sometimes \nget down to the wage too quick, too fast,  but the punch line of later are saying \nthat the people that are getting this  early are saying like Bitcoin right now is \nthe buyer of first resort. That means that  it’s willing to pay higher than the rest of the \ncustomers on the grid for the majority of hours.  Then, when energy’s scarce and expensive, no \nproblem to turn down. Right? It’s going to be  consuming this and it’s converting those local \nmegawatts into global megawatts and they’re  getting that premium for being a first mover. If \nyou look back at the past four years, you might  have received as a power generator of revenue, \ntop line revenue, $35 per megawatt hour. If you  would’ve purchased these minors, you would’ve \nhad something in the neighborhood of 300, right?Preston Pysh (00:16:25):Wow.\nShaun Connell (00:16:26):But here’s the other catch on this, and this is \nreally important is that you’ve got this CapEx  depreciation schedule. Usually, a power generation \nis depreciate over 25, 50 years. Miners are  depreciating four years. Right? On a new gen miner \nthat costs like say one megawatt, $3 million-ish,  that means you have to recover $100 per hour every \nhour of the year for four years just to recover  your CapEx, but you’re still multiples above. \nNow, I’d layer on the second part of saying,  “You don’t always have to buy new gen minors.” \nRight? Now, think about you’re ignoring the base  load, natural gas plant or whatnot. Let’s go to \na wind farm. You can look at this wind farm and  you can say in 2020, Bitcoin price was, I think \nit was like six or 7,000 and hash rate was high.Shaun Connell (00:17:16):The revenue for megawatt hour for an S9 miner was \n$30 and people were giving these away for free.  They say like if you pick it up, you can take \nit or there were $20 a piece. What that works  out to is you could have bought one megawatt \nof S9 miners for about $15,000. Compare that  to the new gen miner of $2 million for megawatt, \nthis is those peanuts. You could then take these  S9 miners and you’re on some type of wind farm \nor solar asset, and you say, “On hours when  the price is too low, I now have an option of \nsaying I can sell to the grid or I can sell  the Bitcoin mining. Because the flexibility of my \nCapEx was so low, I don’t have to try and I’m not  chasing to try and recover that CapEx spend.” \nIt’s a one time spent for infrastructure. Then,  it’s almost like free for those minors. I would \nsay the economics are significantly higher too on  these intermittent resources that can get paired \nwith an older miner with a lower CapEx cost.Preston Pysh (00:18:21):Yeah. When you just look at the energy expense, \nif it’s truly stranded and there’s just tons of  energy seeping out of wherever, and there’s just \nno demand for really that energy and it’s priced  extremely low, you’re going to find all these old \nrigs just naturally migrate themselves to those  jurisdictions because they can still make money \nplugging them in, even though they’re pigs,  what they’re consuming, but the energy’s spewing \nout anyway. I think that’s something that’s  majorly lost with politicians and policy \nmakers in this space is that idea.  One other thing that I want to just hit on from \na depreciation standpoint, I love accounting, and  I’m just looking at this and you’re talking about \nsome of the multiples that come out of this,  especially for new hardware. I think if today, \nand you might have a better beat on this than me,  but if you’re capturing energy for six cents \nper kilowatt hour, five-cent per kilowatt hour,  and you got a new rig and you’re plugging it \nin, you’re basically doing 100% on that expense  of the rig. If the rigs 10,000, you’re going \nto make 10,000 in Bitcoin in the first year.Preston Pysh (00:19:32):If you can depreciate that over a three to \nfour-year period of time, that hardware expense  over three to four years, that’s a nice \nexpense to be able to write off on the  income statement and it hides a lot of what you’re \nbeing able to retain in profits that I don’t think  a lot of people fully appreciate, especially \nmaybe in the energy sector, they do, but I know  what you’re saying. It’s a lot faster cycle rate \nthan what I think a lot of executives are used to  where they’re seeing 20, 30 years of depreciation \non certain pieces of hardware. The hurts on this  depreciation is a whole lot faster, but the return \nis astronomical compared to what they’re used to  getting from just a regular consumer. \nFascinating. Absolutely fascinating stuff here.Shaun Connell (00:20:23):I’ll chat more about the stranded energy, \nbecause this gets lost on most people. Right?Preston Pysh (00:20:28):\nPlease, yes.Shaun Connell (00:20:29):Is that there’s a belief in the world that \nenergy is scarce everywhere and all energy’s  created equally, right? Like converted \nenergy, biotype energy. You think about  moving energy around is the easiest way to \nmove, something would be like coal. Right?  Put it on a truck, put it on a train, move \nit around. Next is oil, put it in a pipeline.  Next would be natural gas and pipelines as \nwell. The hardest one is electricity, right?  Because the network of electricity, it’s not like \nyou can have an excess amount of wind and some  electricity in one area and say, “Hey, Europe. \nYou need some electricity. We’re just going  to ship it.” Right. It’s in an area that’s \nconstrained by the wires in that area, and  the investment that was made and customers having \na rate base that you’re paying for these wires.Shaun Connell (00:21:13):It’s really kind of… Back to energy is very \ncomplex, is there can be real pockets of excess  electricity. Without having the ability to move \na load to that area, the only option is building  out transmission lines. There are cases like in \nWest Texas where 10% of the hours last year were  negative, which means that the grid operator’s \nsending a price signal that’s so low that you  should turn down. That means that energy’s being \ncurtailed. That’s not going anywhere. You can’t  ship that anywhere else. Without some type of load \nthat’s co-locating right next to it, you really  are going to be spilling wind. You’re just going \nto say, “We can’t do it.” Just an important point  and most understand is that you can have energy \nabundance in certain areas and not in others.Shaun Connell (00:22:02):I think about the idea that I’m from \nAlberta and back in the ’80s, that  people would go buy land for the mineral rights \nor underneath them. All you had to think was,  “Is oil going to be valuable in the future? \nBecause if it is, I got long oil just from  buying some land.” I think about this in \nthe renewable space right now is that,  there’s been these massive deposits of wind and \nsolar in certain areas, given the certain kind of  the geography, the weather and whatnot that you \ncouldn’t tap into before, because there’s no  power lines there. You couldn’t monetize it. For \nthe first time in history now, you can actually  bring a load to this deposit of sunshine and \nwind that couldn’t get tapped into before,  because you couldn’t pull it out of there. \nThat’s a neat concept Bitcoin’s really unlocking.Preston Pysh (00:22:51):It’s almost like the ultimate capacitor that you \ncould stick anywhere with near perfect efficiency.  Would you describe it that \nway or would you describe  it in a simplified kind of way? \nWould you describe it different?Shaun Connell (00:23:06):I’d start with is that power generation provides \ntwo main services. They provide energy to the  grid for realtime supply demand balance, and they \nprovide backup power, which is called ancillary  services in case something unexpected happens and \nyou can come online to make up for that. Right?  Up until now, demand has been perfectly inelastic  because… What’s the price of energy right \nnow for you where you’re at, Preston?Preston Pysh (00:23:34):I would say 11 cents per kilowatt \nhour, 12 cents, something like that.Shaun Connell (00:23:38):You’re guessing with the realtime \nfive-minute prices in your area,  but if it was really, really high, you wouldn’t \nknow and you couldn’t turn down because  you don’t have the required equipment or telemetry \nin your house to respond to prices. Right?Preston Pysh (00:23:53):Yeah. Yeah.Shaun Connell (00:23:55):How much would you really turn down if a \nprice signal went to a certain point is  maybe limited and they’re improving on \nthis and having loads of the response  of the price. I mentioned this on Peter’s \npodcast, but just to zoom out and to say that  I think that when you frame Bitcoin mining as is \nit just or not, everybody’s going to come away  with a different opinion. You’re not going to get \naway on board. That’s a really hard thing to do.  But if you think about what we’ve been \nfortunate about in Bitcoin and mining,  how it relays energy is that for the past several \nyears, countries have been pledging to say  net zero emissions by 2050’s one \nof the main timelines, right?Shaun Connell (00:24:38):It’s a real noble thing to do. It’s the right \nthing to do, but there’s a ton of implications  on that. What it means is that to go to economy \nwhere your net zero emissions means that you need  to electrify everything. Right? That means \nthat cars go from combustion engine, you’re  going to go to EVs. Right? The holdings are going \nto be electric. That means you’re going to have a  lot more electricity demand because you’re going \nto electrify everything. It works out to be about  a 3x, an electricity demand over a 30-year period. \nElectrifying everything at the same time is that  to decarbonize means that you’re going to retire \nfossil fuel generation, which is your natural gas  and fossil fuel plants, not in coal, whatnot. \nWhat are you going to replace that with? Right?  The answer’s been that you can replace it with \nrenewables. Hydrogen’s part of the solution, but  in this example is that you’re going \nto essentially -1x your fossil fuels,  and you need to 15x your wind and solar \ncapacity from current levels, right?Preston Pysh (00:25:33):Yeah. That don’t work on a variance level.Shaun Connell (00:25:35):Right. Right. Zooming out again is like three \ntimes electricity demand, -1x fossil fuels,  15x wind and solar. What that’s going to do \nis going to create a lot more volatility for  intermittency on the grid, right? When is \nthe wind blowing? When is the sun shining?  To balance that, what you need to have \nis you need to have flexible resources,  and new flexible resources that aren’t \nfossil fuels, but resources that can  come to the grid and can balance during \nthose periods. I’ll use an example in  ERCOT, there’s 10 gigawatts of solar right \nnow, and their average demand is approximately  45 gigawatts. Over the next year and a half, \nthey’re going to go from 10 gigawatts to about  20 gigawatts. On this average day, about \nhalf of your generations come from solar.Shaun Connell (00:26:23):What happens when the sun goes down at the end \nof the day is you have this really big two-hour  ramp period where you need to bring on a whole \nlot of resources to make up for the fact that  you’re losing your solar resources and the current \nsolution right now is natural gas, right? It’s  a great load balancing resource phenomenal, but \nwhat happens when you lose these is that you need  to have new resources that can do this. Going back \nto the example is with all this intermittency,  you essentially need to have a \n4x on your flexible resources  that you have available to grid. Currently, 95% \nof flexibility comes from generation right now,  and 1% comes from demand response and batteries. \nThen, the IEA put out this publication  and their forecast, it says that batteries \nand demand response need to do 50%.  You’re going to go from 1% to \n50%. What is Bitcoin mining?Preston Pysh (00:27:22):Yeah.\nShaun Connell (00:27:22):Bitcoin mining is demand response. It’s the \nRolls-Royce of demand response. It’s the pinnacle.  The way why this is that think about the current \nRolls-Royce of demand response for industrial  manufacturing would be the steel plant. The \nreason why is it’s got one single energy intensive  application, which is the arc furnace. There’s \nliterally somebody that’s sitting by a switch  and when they say, “We’re going to come down for \na couple hours,” they hit the button and they  can come down for two hours. They’re going to drop \n95% of their peak electricity demand, but they can  only do it for two hours. The reason is because \nthe steel’s going to harden. It’s going to turn  into ingot. It’s going to cause a whole bunch of \nproblems. You got to turn the arc furnace back on.Shaun Connell (00:28:07):That’s an example of demand response. It’s the \nbest one that there is today until Bitcoin mining.  Now, the way to think about Bitcoin mining is the \narc furnace is like that assembly line. You’re  going through this process and you have the arc \nfurnace, and then it goes to a ladle. I forget  all the other pieces, but it’s like an assembly \nline for a car. They got to go through these  stages. You got to interrupt the process when \nyou do this demand response. Bitcoin mining,  if you think about like 100 terahash per second \nBitcoin miner, that’s the equivalent of saying  you have a machine that can start, finish \nand monetize 100 trillion jobs per second.Preston Pysh (00:28:48):\nRight. It’s unreal.Shaun Connell (00:28:52):There’s no work in progress, \nright? It’s completed jobs,  right? You didn’t have wasted effort \nprior to that. Those throw away.  You were able to stop it immediately and you \nturn it down and as soon as their price changes,  or if you’ve been called on to provide one of \nthese ancillary services, you can go back up,  but you’ve got the ultimate flexible resource \nnow that can do this type of low balancing.Preston Pysh (00:29:16):When I think about all the issues that you’ve \nseen crop up in the last five to 10 years with  the inflexibility of the grid all around the \nworld, I know you guys have had issues in Canada  and the US all over, this solves that problem. \nIt makes the grid robust. When I’m thinking of  it from just a policy standpoint, it just seems \nso obvious that this needs to be embraced by  across both party lines, whether you’re a \nconservative, liberal, whatever. It just  seems like such an obvious solution to a real \nworld problem that both parties would want solve.  Do you think that it’s moving politically? \nMaybe you can only talk on the Canadian side,  do you feel like it’s moving in the right \ndirection politically, that decision makers  are understanding these very strong arguments \nas to why this needs to be built into the grid?Shaun Connell (00:30:14):Yeah. I live in Canada, but the company I work \nfor, Lancium’s a Houston based company and I’m  down there half the time. I’m pretty well versed \nwith ERCOT. That’s where I’ve been spending a lot  of my time. About a month ago, the interim CEO of \nERCOT, his name is Brad Jones was… I was looking  on YouTube and I saw this, it was a CNBC clip and \nit was Brad Jones and it was talking about mining.  I flipped it on and my jaw dropped. ERCOT has been \nthe early adopter of these controllable loads. The  controllable load is what allows you to determine \nthese power generation reverse. They have the  benefit that they are an islanded electricity grid \nwhere they’re not connected to the rest of the US,  which allows them to do things without meeting \nFERC approval, which is a federal approval.Shaun Connell (00:31:02):They can experiment and do things faster than \nothers. They’ve been very kind of… I call it the  entrepreneurial mindset, like down in Texas. These \ncontrollable loads have been coming on in Texas,  and you’ve probably seen the news, some of these \nlarge sites that are coming online. The interview  was with Brad Jones and it was the ultimate \nperfect interview that you would say, “What would  you hope the CEO of the power system that is being \nbombarded with massive amounts of Bitcoin mining,  what is he saying about this?” His message was… \nOne of them, he was saying, “Hey, we’ve got this  amazing wind and solar resource in Texas. We want \nto build that out, and we want to have some type  of load that can soak up that excess renewables, \nbecause you don’t want to turn down that  resource.” One part, he said… He also commented \nabout when there’s a plant that could trip offline  is that there’s been a track record for these \nloads being able to do frequency response.Shaun Connell (00:31:56):What that means is that the heart rate of the \ngrid is at 60 hertz per second. If something trips  offline, the heart rate changes and you can’t wait \nfor a dispatch. You got to automatically sense…  These power jars do, they automatically senses a \nchange in the frequency. Then, they inject more  power or for these controlled loads is they turn \ndown. They do this right away. He made a comment  in his video about how that’s been proven that \nthis is working in the state and then he’s tying  back into that. There’s certain types of flexible \nresources. There’s four categories, right? There’s  power generation. There’s inter ties. That’s \nyour grid connectivity. There’s batteries and  there’s demand response. ERCOT’s an island, \nright? It’s an island that doesn’t have hydro.Shaun Connell (00:32:43):Hydro is a great flexible resource. It’s like \na battery. It’s storage. They don’t have any  batteries. Since they’re an island at grid, they \ncan’t lean on their connections with the rest of  the United States to pull power if there’s \nany type of problem. They really got to be  self-supporting. Brad Jones’ message was saying \nthat they’re really embracing these miners because  they’re offering a lot of flexibility to \ntheir grid operas. It’s essentially like a  grid operator’s Swiss army knife where it’s like, \n“I can use this for backup power. I can use this  for energy,” depending on how the owner of \nthe facilities offered it into their grid,  but it’s this great resource \nfor helping them balance  their grids, especially as they’re \ntransitioning to more renewables.Preston Pysh (00:33:26):Well, they can give them what they \nwant, the miners what they want as well,  because they can give them a sweetheart deal \nin pricing of the energy that they’re consuming  as the homeostasis back to the power generator \nis that flexibility, and having that there to  have that agreement in place to either \nturn them off or leave them on. Right?  I would think that in the negotiation of some \nof these contracts with some of the larger  miners, the incentives align \nfor them to get along. Right?Shaun Connell (00:34:00):Yeah. Zooming back out on power markets is \nthat I hear often the news that said that  a miner got paid by ERCOT to turn down \nright, which is false. Right? Because  there’s different types of… Again, back to the \ncomponents, there’s their wholesale generation.  There’s your wires company, your utility \ncompany, and your retail supply side.  When you go into a market like ERCOT, which \nis deregulated, is that if you go into some  utility company area where it’s an investor owned \nutility, which is approximately I think about two  thirds of Texas, that means that the rate for \nthe transmission is set by the public utility  commission. Right? There’s no negotiating, \nright? It’s just, “This is what the rate is.  It’s great because it’s transparency.” It’s \nnot backdoor deals or something like that.Shaun Connell (00:34:48):You know what you’re going to be getting and \non the energy side is that you’re going to be  purchasing energy from the grid operator who’s… \nERCOT, all they’re doing is they’re a clearing  house. They’re essentially \ntaking all the generation  and they’re saying, “Who’s willing to sell \npower for what price? I’m going to stack it up.  Here’s where the demand is. I’m going to \nset the price at that marginal megawatt.”  If you’re in one of these areas \nwhere it’s an investor own utility,  you’re essentially able to buy at the spot price, \nat this clearing price, and you can also do  hedging for that location, which is \nessentially a contract for differences,  because you’re going to buy your physical power \nfrom the grid operator. Then, you can have this  financial hedge on the side that’s like a \ncontract for differences to hedge that risk.Shaun Connell (00:35:31):In the example where somebody says, for \nexample, winter storm Yuri went through ERCOT,  February 2021, caused very high prices. There \nwere a lot of miners that did very well.  The reason was, is because they turned offline. \nThey weren’t consuming energy during this event.  They had this contract for differences hedge. \nThey’d entered into a contract for differences  hedge where it’s saying, “We bought at $50 per \nmegawatt for X number of years around the clock.”  Then, prices during that time settled, there \nwere several days that settled $9,000. It was  the Black Swan of Black Swans. Right? They got \npaid on this contract for differences, right?  They didn’t get paid by ERCOT. They just did the \nright thing. They did what made sense is saying,  “This price is way too high for me. I can’t \nafford to pay for that. I just need to be  offline,” which is good for everybody else because \nenergy is scarce and had that same miner said,  “Instead of turning down, I’m going to be \nselling ancillary services. I’m going to run  and I’m going to be the best low cost \noption providing ancillary service.”Shaun Connell (00:36:36):Well, ERCOT’s going to pay them for that \nancillary service and the miner’s going to pay  for the energy and you net those two together. \nThat’s the net cost that they would’ve had,  but back to the point of saying, ERCOT’s not \nmaking arrangements with miners on saying,  “Hey, to turn down… It’s what’s great about Texas. \nIt’s very open market and here’s the rules.” Yeah.Preston Pysh (00:36:56):The essence of what you’re getting at is humans \nthat need power at emergency periods of time  or in a more competitive space are going to \nout prioritize Bitcoin mining just naturally  through an open market competitive environment, \nwhich I think people that are hearing this,  that might be a concern that they have. \nAs they’re listening, they’re like, “Well,  these things are going to take over.” If the \nmargins are that fat, they’re just going to  take over and the person who just wants to turn \non the power at their house aren’t going to be  able to do it, but what you just described \nis not that fascinating stuff. My gosh.Shaun Connell (00:37:35):Think about this. For these new gen miners, \ntheir break even right now is about $200  a megawatt and the average price for the past \nfive years or so has been about $50. Right?  They’re well above the average, but whenever \nthere’s price hikes, they turn down. Some of the  education that needs to be shared \nwith folks on this is saying that  they’re always going to be turned down when \nthe price above 200, but imagine the story  of saying this miner only turns online when the \nprice is below $20. Right? This miner is only  going to consume that super excess energy and \nyou can tell it’s excess because it’s so cheap.Preston Pysh (00:38:09):Cheap. Yeah.Shaun Connell (00:38:11):Everybody I think would be saying, “Holy crap. \nThat’s amazing. We can put these facilities next  to these renewables.” Since power’s mostly always \nover $20, they’ll be turning off, but this is the  greatest thing in the world. This is where… \nI get excited about this as well, is that  where the power markets start in 2000 versus \nwhere they are now in 2020 was much different.  Where mining is today and where it’s going to \nbe in 10, 20 years is completely different.  We’re going to have a great experiment in the next \nyear because for a long time, these miners have  had such a high break even point they’re running \n95% of the time, because prices only go above that  certain amount of hours per year. Over \nthe past 16 months, gas prices tripled.Shaun Connell (00:38:56):Over the past four months, it’s more than \ndoubled. Right? In power markets is that  natural gas is your marginal unit. It’s the \none that balances your real time load supply.  Again, back to the past five years is 35, \n$40, the price of power for the balance of  year across the United States now with this \n3x in gas prices is north of $100. Right?  In certain periods like summer, the average \nprice for the… They call them peak hours,  which is Monday to Friday, 7:00 in the morning \nuntil 11:00 at night, that’s priced in at $200.  The off peak, which are the morning hours is \npriced at $100. The average for summer is 150.  Right? What happens if you have an S9 miner in \nERCOT, and your break even right now is $80.  Right? That miner’s coming off a lot. Right?Preston Pysh (00:39:47):\nIt’s coming off. Yeah.Shaun Connell (00:39:49):Some of these other miners that are… \nI talked about that $200 average,  that means that there’s going to be several hours \nabove four or $500 if this materializes. Right?  Because it’s just the average of the month’s \naverages for those peak hours. I think that we’re  going to see for the balance a year, and this \nis where mining has an opportunity to shine is  you’re going to see this evidence of these miners \nturning down because if power prices have tripled,  that means that economics of mining is going down, \nwhich I’ve listened to you in another podcast, and  that you think about the price of mining is the \nfloor for energy. We’ve just tripled the floor.Preston Pysh (00:40:27):\nYeah.Shaun Connell (00:40:29):You’ve now priced out a bunch of these miners. \nIf they do another doubling of hash rate over  the balance of the year, that means that \nit’s twice as more difficult on the mining.  In listening to you in the past, it \nsets up that kind of next push, right?Preston Pysh (00:40:43):\nYes.Shaun Connell (00:40:44):But the real story on this is like, I think \nwe’re going to have evidence at the end of the  year on just how these miners were operating in \nan environment when power prices were very high,  and you’ll see them turning down at different \ntimes that even when there wasn’t scarcity events,  because the power prices were just too high, which \ngoes back to that narrative saying, “In the long  run, Bitcoin will be the buyer of last resort,” \nbut we need to transition there and it’s going  to take time, but with this extreme vault that’s \nhappening right now this year in power markets,  it’s going to foreshadow what that looks like, I \nbelieve. It’d be a pretty neat year to see that.Preston Pysh (00:41:20):I think to your point as well, is those \nrigs that are in a geographic location  that is not turned on because of the prices. \nThey’re going to sell them. They’re going to  sell them to other geographic locations where \nthe energy costs… Hey, maybe they’ve got a  volcano. Maybe they got something else that \nis generating energy at an extremely low cost,  and they’re just going to gobble those things up \nfor pennies on the dollar and plug them back in.  You’re seeing this from a different lens than \nmost people in this space that I’ve talked to,  at least. Is there anything that’s going to \nstop this or slow this down at this point,  or is there so much momentum in \nthe energy space to lean into this?Shaun Connell (00:42:05):I feel very confident that it’s going \nto keep going. Everyone say never on  this stuff. Right? But if you check the \nboxes and say, “What is Bitcoin mining?”  It’s like that rabbit hole of… For me, in \nmy experience was that you go to Bitcoin and  then it takes a three-year rabbit hole of \nwhat is money and what problem’s being solved?  It’s amazing rabbit hole that gets you \ninto all these books that you never  thought you’d read and it’s phenomenal. I \nfeel like we’re now accidentally getting  the benefit of Bitcoin solving another big \nissue and saying, “What is energy?” Right?Preston Pysh (00:42:39):\nAmen to this. I’m with you 100%.Shaun Connell (00:42:44):I think that Nick Carter was early to recognize \nthis. He’s just like, “I think this is  that really important piece of information that \nwe need to really figure out,” so that we can…  Yeah. I shared this on Peter’s podcast \nis that something I think is really  important for everybody to be educated in \nthe space and to understand the value is that  if nuclear generation was invented today, it \nwould be the magic pill. Right? We wouldn’t  have all these perceptions and beliefs about \nthis being bad and that it’s going to be…Preston Pysh (00:43:14):\nYeah.Shaun Connell (00:43:15):Right? It would be like, “We found it.” The \nconcern I have is that we’re at this very  pivotal place for Bitcoin, where it’s hard \nto put the pieces together, but why this is  amazing for energy, amazing for money, and \nhas these great characteristics. But if it  goes down this wrong path, and then too \nmany people start believing a certain thing,  and then it starts… An executive order happens. \nRight? You have to ban mining. That’s a fear word.  I feel like we’re ahead of the narrative now, \nand it’s starting to pick up. My observation  has that been for the past few years is miners are \ntremendously smart folks that know their business  inside and out, but when asked for how’s Bitcoin \nbenefiting renewables? They’re like, “I’m not too  sure, but I just know it is.” Now, it feels like \nthe pieces are coming out where it’s really data  backed and you can see it and you’re like, “Yes. \nNow, I can communicate this and share that.”Preston Pysh (00:44:12):It takes a lot of effort and it takes a lot \nof different voices of people to lay out all  the evidence. There’s a lot of research there to \npiece that together and be able to view it from  that lens, but I think we’re at that point now \nwhere we have enough people and enough sources.  For example, the Saylor and Jack Dorsey response \nto Congress just this past three or four days ago,  responding to… I don’t know how \nmany questions were laid out here.  It looks like eight different questions in \nthis document. They just take it task by task,  laying out why there’s confusion in some of \nthese questions. I’m curious, did you have  a chance to go through that document and see \nhow they responded to some of these things?Shaun Connell (00:45:03):I did. I think Nick Carter might \nhave been on there as well. I think  he might have had an influence on the \nwriting of that document. I think that  our signatures on the back on one of the last \npages, our company. Yeah. It’s great that we  now have the information and they did a \nwonderful job preparing that response.Preston Pysh (00:45:29):I’m going to read one here. I don’t want \nto take away from the questions here,  but I love this response to one of the \nquestions here. I just want to read this  for the people listening. One of the \nquestions, it states we have serious  concerns regarding reports that Bitcoin mining \nfacilities across the country are polluting  communities and having an outsize contribution to \ngreenhouse gas emissions, less energy intensive  cryptocurrency mining technologies, such as proof \nof stake are available and have 99.99% lower  energy demands than proof of work to validate \ntransactions. This was the response in the paper.  This is, once again, misleading. Proof of stake \nis not a mining technology. It is a technique to  determine authority over a distributed ledger, but \nit does not achieve decentralized distribution.Preston Pysh (00:46:19):Moreover, it has a much more limited \ntrack record, is controlled by founders,  has single points of failure, and it \nremains dubious as to whether proof of  state can effectively govern a global apolitical \nmonetary system in a manner like proof of work,  and it goes on and on. Some of these responses \nin here were just absolute fire. It’s nice to  know that we have a community of people that are \ntaking them on blow by blow. Who eats who here? Do  the energy companies eat the mining companies, or \ndo the mining companies eat the energy companies?Shaun Connell (00:46:56):I don’t know if it’s framing of who eats who.  I think it’s more of where does \nthe market share go? Right?Preston Pysh (00:47:04):\nYeah.Shaun Connell (00:47:04):You think about the hash rate market share, and \nI’m making this up and I’m going to be wrong is  that say its public mining companies are 75% and \nthe rest, 25%. In the future, what is the blend of  public mining companies, public or private energy \ncompanies, other mining companies? I think that  the actors in the space on the energy side, \nthey all see this value and they recognize  that the current customer they have, which \nis a grid, sometimes is a great customer, but  if you own a business, wouldn’t you rather have \ntwo customers versus one. Right? You can almost  look at this as like… The way that I was thinking \nabout it when I was with TransAlta is just like,  “What would it cost to buy a strip of put \noptions on power?” Right? It’s just like,  “Well, you can buy the miners for \ncheaper than that. You’re actually  arbing the price of these put options, assuming \nyou’ve got the capacity of doing that. Right?Shaun Connell (00:48:02):It was the same thing with those Bitcoin miners \nwhen they weren’t virtually free in 2020 and  saying, “What is the cost of a strip of call \noptions on Bitcoin price?” It’s like, “Well,  what’s the cost of these Bitcoin miners?” \nBecause there’s an arb there, but you need  the infrastructure to plug it in. I just see \nthese as it’s not like these energy companies  are going to be saying… I believe that these \nenergy companies are going to be all in where  all they’re doing is mining. They’re going to be \nsaying, “Hey, we need to have different options  for monetizing our energy,” and there’s certain \nbenefits that accrue to all by them doing that.  Yeah. I see a future where… Another big reason \nfor education on the mining side here is that  we often frame this back in the \ncategory of it’s a good use of energy.Shaun Connell (00:48:45):One of the common rebuttals is saying that we just \nuse a fraction of the energy of the world. Right?  Which is true right now, but if it does what we \nthink it’s going to do, then that means that the  15 gigawatts today in 10 years from now is more \nlike 300 gigawatts, which is not insignificant.  We probably have to shift away from again of just \nlike, “Is this good use of energy?” Versus saying,  “Do we think of batteries as green or dirty?” \nBecause batteries are withdrawing power from  the grid and then injecting back into the grid. \nAre we assessing who’s getting those megawatts  that are coming out of the battery? It’s \nlike, “No, this is a tool for the transition.”  If you think about in uptime, it’s maybe like \na 50%. Half the time it’s injecting withdraw,  whereas mining can be up 95% of the time. For \nthese miners that are all gen miners, it can be  at the money where they can be 50% up and down, \nbut when you frame it more on saying that this is  a tool that helps with these \ntransitions, you get away from that.  Having to say this, is it just use of energy? \nWe’re just insignificant on the total quantity.Shaun Connell (00:49:52):My prediction in the future \nis that I’ll use 20 years out,  because everything’s possible in 20 \nyears. It’s hard to say that’s wrong  is that the current cost for a megawatt of wind \nand megawatt of solars is roughly a million  dollars and the infrastructure required for a \nracking solution for miners is call it a quarter  million. Now, think about you’re doing this new \nwind project or solar project, Bitcoin’s been  around for 30 years. Right? You’re saying, “Okay. \nI want to go to connect to the grid.” Actually,  you’re probably not saying, “I’m going to \nconnect to the grid.” You say, “How do I monetize  this to your starting point?” It’s going to \nprobably be a blend of mining it and in the grid.Shaun Connell (00:50:24):In the future, I predict that the decisions on \nwhen you’re doing this capital outlay for wind  and solar projects will just naturally have this \nquarter million dollar purchase for your racking  solution, and you’ll have a strategy that after \nevery one of these havings, or just during these  down periods where you have public miners with \nlots of capital that can replace these miners and  essentially retire the old ones, you’re going \nto have these renewables projects just sit on  the side just like a bid. Right? They’ll say, \n“We’ll take whatever you got, because we’re just  going to put this here and this is better than \ngetting paid -10 if we get to the grid.” Right?Preston Pysh (00:50:56):\nYeah. Yeah.Shaun Connell (00:50:58):\nI think it’s going to go part in that decision.Preston Pysh (00:50:59):Wow.Shaun Connell (00:51:00):That’s every energy company will say, “How do \nwe think about pairing this with some type of  racking solution that allows us a non-wires \nalternative for selling our power?”Preston Pysh (00:51:12):How do you think about the centralization of \nmining rigs with all of these mining companies?  Now, anybody who understands the space knows that \nthese miners participate in pools and they can  reallocate their hash rate to whatever pool, if \nthey feel like one pool operator is not doing the  right thing and that it’s becoming too centralized \nor whatever, but what are your thoughts on so much  of the miners being controlled by large companies \nnow? Do you have any thoughts around that idea?Shaun Connell (00:51:45):I think it goes maybe in the category of mining \npools and hash rates and now, there’s a blend of…  I haven’t looked in a long time, but say it’s 10 \nbig pools and 10%, and it’s not a central attack,  but I generally think that again, I bought a Tesla \nin 2014 where I flew out to Vancouver and I drove  it back to Calgary and it was a nightmare because \nthere was no charging stations and it took me  two and a half days. There’s a lot of stories \nbehind that. But that state of 2014 when there’s  no charging stations is much different now in \n2022 where I can go anywhere and charge these  things. Right? Framing the… Centralized the mining \nis just like, we’re now at a 15 gigawatt. There  might be pockets of centralization, but you go to \n300 gigawatts and it’s a global mining operation.  Right? It becomes, I think less of an issue \nbecause it’s not just focused on a region in  the US or in some types of states. It’s gotten \nto some massive adoption level that it’s very  global distributed in the size of the capacity of \nmegawatts or securing the network is much larger.Preston Pysh (00:52:52):\nMassive.Shaun Connell (00:52:52):\nIt’s less significant in the future.Preston Pysh (00:52:54):Yeah, I agree. Here’s one I got for you, \nShaun. When we look at the price action,  call it five years ago, seven years ago of \nBitcoin, and we look at how much hardware  had to come online to capture the spread or the \nmargin that was created out of those price runs,  you could bring quite a bit of hardware \nonline relative to that price jump  and then capture the margin, capture the spread \nand bring it into a production cost. We saw this  in 2018 enough hardware came online. The price \nwas coming in at, I want to say like 8,000 and  then you saw a big capitulation because basically \nall the hardware that came online from that peak  into the following year brought the spreads down \nsignificantly, and there just wasn’t a whole lot  of margin to be made and you went into a miner \ncapitulation and everything kind of reset itself.  That happened fairly quickly.Preston Pysh (00:53:54):I think today, when we look at the spread \nthat currently exists, the margin that exists,  it’s still pretty massive. For all \nintensive purposes, we’ll just call it a 50%  pullback from the all time high that was set at \nclose to 70,000, and the margin is still there.  It doesn’t seem like the hash rate is picking up \nat a pace that would capture that nearly as quick.  When I’m thinking about this dynamic \nthat’s playing out, I’m thinking,  “Well, it requires so much more hardware now to \ncome online to capture that spread. What in the  world would happen if the price went on a real \ntear and let’s say it went to two or 300,000?”  It’s almost as if the price appreciation \ndoing these big jumps, it’s harder for  the physical infrastructure to keep pace to \ncapture those spreads as the price would continue  to potentially run. Are you seeing that way, or am \nI out in crazy land with how I’m looking at this?  It almost seems like it’s not a linear comparison \nas the price would continue to go higher.Shaun Connell (00:55:02):I think that over time, these come \nback and they make sense. Right? Just  something that got me excited \nrecently with this power price move is  it actually made the economics of mining \nnot so good. Right? Because if you had this  miner that was in 2017 that was making $500 \na megawatt hour for some months, and then  in 2020, it was down to 30. Right? Again, \njust like this overlay of power generation is  there’s this kind of similar behaviors where \npower companies will build generation because  even though the market says they don’t need \nit, they think that when they put it online,  it’s going to be there. Right? I come from a \ntrading background. I say there’s a better way  to express that view than to build an asset \nthat’s out of the money on the start. Right?Shaun Connell (00:55:50):You could buy call options on power that could \naccomplish that instead of buying this really big  physical asset and maybe you couldn’t get off \nthe amount of volume that you wanted to do.  I see these behaviors that are happening \nin mining that overlay the same behaviors  to people. There’s just people making decisions.  Right now, we’re at a point where I mentioned that \nsome power across the United States going to be  like 150, $200, which means that these new \ngen miners are going to be out of the money.  In Europe, the price of natural gas in Europe is \nsomething like 25 to $30 on MMBtu. Here in the  United States today, it’s about $8. That means \nthat you can’t do mining in Europe because gas  is three times more expensive there, which \nmeans the power’s way too expensive. Right?  The power prices here, if you would’ve gone back \nin January, margins were fat. Right? It was good  because this big gas move hadn’t happened. \nI think we’re experiencing that right now.Preston Pysh (00:56:47):\nWow.Shaun Connell (00:56:48):Is that these miners that were deep in the money \nare actually… Some are getting out of the money.  Some of these new gen miners might need to turn \noff for some periods during the summer times and  later in the year. I think we’re in \nthat mode right now. I don’t think  the margins are really good \nright now for these miners.  Well, step back, they’re okay right now for \nthe last two months where power plays as a…Preston Pysh (00:57:11):Yeah. They’re not nearly \nas fat as they were before  the big macro energy moves that we’re seeing.Shaun Connell (00:57:17):That’s right. The price of \npower year to date has been  $45, and the price for the balance a year is 120.Preston Pysh (00:57:26):Wow.Shaun Connell (00:57:28):Comparing the economics for the past four months  isn’t the right proxy for what’s coming \nup. Back to again, your narrative where  this mining set in this floor, I think there’s \ngoing to be some hash rate coming offline  at that time because it’s uneconomic \nand you’re going to see some discomfort.Preston Pysh (00:57:43):\nThat is fascinating. That is fascinating to me.Shaun Connell (00:57:46):Yeah. Right?Preston Pysh (00:57:48):I’m looking at it and I’m saying, “Hold \non a second, the infrastructure cannot  keep pace with what I suspect the price is \ngoing to do in the coming five to 10 years,”  but I never thought of it from the perspective \nof the energy cost blowing out in Fiat terms  and how that’s going to cause not issues, \nbut that’s going to help keep everything  much more imbalance and you’re not going to \nsee such a drastic spread because everybody  today is still denominating those expenses for \nthe hardware in Fiat terms. They’re looking at  it in Fiat terms as they’re paying their energy \nbills until we eventually get to a point where  everything’s going to be denominated in \nBitcoin. We’ll see where it goes. Right? Wow.Shaun Connell (00:58:35):\nYou’ve got some dance thinking there, Preston.Preston Pysh (00:58:37):That’s interesting. No, I love \nyour comeback on that because  it combats… Not that it combats, but it \nlessens the burden of it being so obvious to  energy producers because the spread would be \n300% plus, and it’d just be super obvious.Shaun Connell (00:58:58):I think that we’re now maturing in… Again, it’s \nlike reference of power markets when they’re  deregulating 2000 to 2010. I remember trading New \nEngland power market, which was a lot of natural  gas there. There’s expensive natural gas in New \nEngland because there’s not many pipelines. It’s  constrained up in that area. You would see the \nprice of power for the next day at $200 and you  do the math and you say, “Do you know what? Based \non the price of gas, it makes more sense for them  to sell back their gas and to not run their \nplant than to run their plant because that’d  be uneconomic. It’d be a bad decision.” Right? I \ngot burned so many times in the beginning in 2003,  ’04, ’05, because these companies hadn’t developed \nthe capabilities in house or through third parties  to essentially make those changes for how \nthey’re dispatching these generation assets.Shaun Connell (00:59:50):We’re starting to see that now in the mining space \ntoo, because you’ll see some of these miners that  maybe they don’t turn down all the way because \nthey’re just realizing that they’ve got this  facility that can be dispatched up and down and it \nhas this additional flexibility. The takeaway on  this is that the same way power generation \nhad to mature as this deregulation happen,  we’re seeing that maturity happen with these \nmining companies as they get bigger and  more sophisticated in how they’re operating \ntheir sites. It’s a very similar reference.Preston Pysh (01:00:21):What is something that most people \nare misunderstanding or just totally  missing about this particular space right now?Shaun Connell (01:00:29):I would say that…  I was making a presentation to  an independent market monitor about the benefits. \nThis is somebody that would look at ISO, one of  the jurisdictions for the rules and essentially \nmake some suggestions on how could they improve  their market, right? They’re responsible for \nbeing this third party that can look at the  market and then make suggestions to the state \nor the utility commission on how to improve.  I presented to them two years ago and what I was \ntrying to communicate was saying the same way you  think about batteries, that you can put them on \ncertain parts of the grid to relieve congestion,  right? Because they can come up and down \nand they can respond to price signals  is that I would encourage them to think about \nthese controllable loads as the same way.Shaun Connell (01:01:17):The reason is because… And this goes back to how \npower markets are formed over the last 100 years  and load being not responsive, right? Load \ncan’t respond to prices perfectly in elastic.  Generation will get paid at essentially the \nnode they inject in the grid, it’s called the  LMP price, locational marginal price. They get \npaid at that node, whereas a load will take the  volumetric weighted average across all the nodes \nin a certain area, and they’re going to get the  average price. The message I was communicating \nwith this independent market monitor was saying,  “Encourage you to think about these as the \nsame as batteries.” These should get actually  L&P pricing, right? Because they can actually \nrelieve congestion to that point. Also,  you want to send the right price. Right?Shaun Connell (01:02:00):You want to have the right signal. You want to \nhave the right market behavior… Market outcome,  pardon me, that says, “Hey, there’s cheap \nelectricity up here, go locate load here and if  you can have that nodal price.” After winter storm \nYuri, the observation, some reading says that when  power systems get to about 25% renewables, you \nlook back and 25% energy came from wind or solar,  they need to do these market reforms on rules \nand products for managing the grids because  when power markets were deregulated in 2000, \nit’s like there was no wind or solar. Right?  Of course, the market rules, wouldn’t have \ntaken that into consideration. Long way of  saying this is that like, when I was sharing this \ninformation with the market monitor, I was saying,  “The reason why it’s probably not on your radar \nis because on 2017, this is Bitcoin mining.”Shaun Connell (01:02:43):I showed a picture of a two megawatt container \nin some industrial park and a transformer on.  Then, I shared a picture of what the \nRockdale site looks like in Texas, which  Chad puts up there on his Twitter and copy and \npaste out there. You can see this is what it looks  like. Then, I showed a picture and said, “This \nis what it can look like in the future. It has  battery banks and located right by \nsolar and wind, et cetera.” It was  just their jaw dropped. Right? What they’re \nmissing was it’s happened so fast, right?Preston Pysh (01:03:10):\nYes.Shaun Connell (01:03:10):That you went from two megawatt containers to this \nRockdale facility with riot is now coming up along  north of 500 megawatts, got things coming online \nhere soon. What’s happened so fast is not…Preston Pysh (01:03:21):\nIt’s unreal. It’s unreal.Shaun Connell (01:03:22):\nIt’s not surprising. It’s not on the radar. Right?What’s lost on people is just the impact that \nthese facilities can have because of the size  they are and how they can balance these grades \nand provide the same services it generates, but  if you think of these as just like these two \nmegawatt containers, it’s like, “Come on.  There’s not enough scale there.” What’s lost \non people, I think is just how big it is. Yeah.Preston Pysh (01:03:44):It’s unreal. Shaun, I can’t thank you enough. \nWe have got to do this again. You are such a  wealth of information. Give people a hand \noff to your Twitter. When we post this,  people are going to see your account, but man,  you need people following you because you \njust have such a breadth of knowledge. My  gosh, give them a hand off to your Twitter \nand anything else that you want to highlight.Shaun Connell (01:04:06):Awesome. Yeah. Thanks for having me on the show, \nPreston. I was excited that you reached out to  me. Thanks for having me on. People can reach \nme on Twitter. It’s @shaunenergy, so S-H-A-U-N,  and then energy. Most of the stuff that we’ve \nshared here today, I post a lot of pictures and  slides and stuff like that on this. Yeah. Love for \npeople to reach out to me and I think hat’s it.Preston Pysh (01:04:30):One final question for you. If you have \na quick message to any policy makers  that listen to this show, what would \nyour message be to the policy makers  as they’re trying to wrap their \nhead around all this stuff?Shaun Connell (01:04:41):Yeah. I think the first stop, but I’d \nencourage them all to go listen to  Brad Jones’ five-minute CNBC clip. You say as a \npolicy maker saying, “What is the CEO of the grid  that has the most amount of mining that’s had \nsome challenges with some outages in the past  years?” Think about this, right? You couldn’t \nhave somebody promote it any better than him.  Then, I would say just list off four bullet \npoints on saying, “Why is Bitcoin a great  tool for the energy transition?” First, I’d say \nthis is a tool for energy flexibility is you’re  having a lot more intermittent resources. You \nneed to have something for balance in the grid.  This is something that provides \nsecond as ancillary services.Shaun Connell (01:05:18):All the backup generation that’s \nbeen used in the past, this is new  flexibility for these intermittency. You’ve \nnow got a global floor price of energy,  right? Anybody in around the world can \nmonetize the generation asset now with  mining. Then, last is just a cherry on the top \nis you’ve got a new offtaker for renewables  where some of these renewable projects \nthat were stranded in certain areas is  struggling to find a buyer because they were \nbeing curtailed or wouldn’t have a buyer.  You now have somebody that can come to this area \nand support the growth of this renewable space.Preston Pysh (01:05:48):I’m going to have Brad’s clip in the show notes \nif people want to watch that. Shaun Connell, thank  you so much for coming on the show. My goodness, \nyou knocked this one out of the ballpark, sir.Shaun Connell (01:05:57):Thanks, Preston. Thanks for having me.",
