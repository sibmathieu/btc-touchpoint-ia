with the goal of banningproof of work mining because of its highelectricity consumption the underlyinggoal is to blame Bitcoin for damagingthe environment when it's as they claimjust a tool for useless speculationin the following I lay out how Bitcoinenforces seven of the 30 articlesmentioned in the Universal Declarationof Human Rightsit should become clear that Bitcoin isneither useless nor just a tool forspeculation[Music]the universal Declaration of HumanRights the United Nations was founded in1945 by 51 countries committed tomaintaining International Peace andsecurity developing friendly relationsamong nations and promoting socialprogress better living standards andhuman rightsone of the outcomes was the universalDeclaration of Human Rights which wasproclaimed on December 10 in 1948. insucceeding decades it has beenintegrated into many countries laws andcan be seen as a common standard ofachievements for All Peoples and AllNations it sets out for the first timein human history fundamental humanrights to be universally protected andit has been translated into over 500languagesand un committee chaired by EleanorRoosevelt drafted 30 articles theuniversal Declaration of Human Rightsserved as a recommendation for a numberof laws laws can be enforced or not lawsin themselves are no guarantee thatanyone is treated equally or is notbeing discriminated against or free fromsuffering under Financial oppressioncontrary to human enforced laws aprotocol that is enforced bymathematical rules built in consensuswith all its users will always benon-discriminatory and

look at the state of theworld today and how this Globalregulatory regime came into place thatis defining who has possibilities andwho hasn't 54 of the global populationlives in authoritarian or hybrid regimesthey don't enjoy the privilege of livingin full democraciesonly 6.4 percent of all people live incountries of full democracy like GermanyFrance Austria and so on or in the U.Sall of the others around the world areliving in either flawed democracies orthey are in full dictatorships orauthoritarian regimesplace where you were born largelydefines the chances you'll have in lifeexceptions are reala look at the map of the Democracy indexshows a pattern to rememberthe dark red areas are in the countrieswhere life is the worst their peopleshave the least Freedom a look on the mapof political corruption shows a similarpattern the dark red areas are stretchedfrom the Northeast starting in Russiaand China going over Africa and intoSouth Americathere seems to be some sort ofcorrelation between corruption andfailing democracies that is corruptionenables both human rights abuses andDemocratic decline in turn these factorslead to higher levels of corruptionsetting off a vicious cyclefinally let's look at the world wealthmap the same pattern is visible incountries with dictators andauthoritarian leaders people are onaverage poorer with the poorestcountries being in Africa and the MiddleEast the worldwide map demonstrates anastonishing level of inequality betweenthe Haves and the have-nots a history ofmonetary powerthe reasons for the huge inequality aremanifold colonialism has definitely beenone of themthis map shows the British Empire in1910 this politically and economicalcontrol enabled the United Kingdom tobecome the first monetary hegemonhegemony refers to a single state thathas decisive influence over thefunctions of the international monetarysystemin 1910 the British pound was stillbacked by gold the gold standard meantthat all circulating money was packedone to one by gold in the treasuries ofBanks and everyone used the Britishpound for trade after the first worldwar this British power faded the secondworld war created a new hegemon the U.Shad won the war had the most powerfuleconomy and controlled basically all ofthe world's gold reservesduring the war many European countriessent their gold reserves to the U.S toprotect them from being stolen by theNazis as financial analyst Lynn Aldendescribeswith the Bretton Woods system and thefollowing petrodollar system the UnitedStates obtained a near Global lock onthe international money system previousEmpire currencies never obtained thatcomplete of a financial lock on theworld and thus were never true GlobalReserve currencies but instead were justwidely recognized and dominantcurrencieshowever after only a decade the BrettonWoods system began to fray the UnitedStates began running large fiscaldeficits and experiencing mildly Risinginflation levels first for the late1960s domestic programs and then for theVietnam Warthe United States began to see its goldreserves shrink as other countries beganto doubt the backing of the dollar andtherefore redeemed dollars for goldinstead of comfortably holding dollarsthe system had an underlying flaw thatwhen left unaddressed brought the systemdown it was never truly sustainable asdesigned there was no way that the U.Scould maintain enough gold to back allof its currency for domestic use andsimultaneously back enough currency forexpanding Global use as well which wasthe part that was redeemable the birthof the Fiat systemas Lynn Alden continueseventually in 1971 Mars came back with avennigans on the Bretton Woods systemand Richard Nixon ended theconvertibility of dollars to gold andthus ended the Bretton Woods systemthe closing of gold convertibility wasproposed to be temporary at the time butIt ultimately became permanentrather than shifting to another countrythough the United States was able toreorder the global monetary system withitself still in the center in the nextsystemwhen Richard Nixon abolished the goldstandard in 1971 he basically renderedall currencies in the world as FiatmoneyFiat is a Latin word that means let itbe donesince 1971 our currencies aren't backedby gold anymore and only have valuebecause they are legal tenderthe economical consequences have beenimmenseit was the first time in history thatonly Fiat currencies existed this canlead to serious problems for instancewhen one tries to use printed paper inanother country why should businessesand governments in other countriesaccept pieces of paper which can beprinted endlessly by a foreigngovernment and have no firm backing as aform of payment for the valuable goodsand servicesthe Fiat system had a problem the petroldollarin 1974 following a variety ofgeopolitical conflicts including the YomKippur War and the OPEC oil embargo theUnited States and Saudi Arabia reachedan agreement to sell their oilexclusively in U.S dollars in exchangefor U.S protection and cooperation fromthere the world was set on thepetrodollar system a clever way to makea global fiat currency system workdecently enough the Petro dollar since1974 but the system is cracking here andthere in August 2017 for instanceVenezuela declared that it would ceasepricing its oil in U.S dollars andinstead use euros Joanne and othercurrencies in March 2022 media reportssuggested that Saudi Arabia wasconsidering pricing some of its oilsales to China in the Chinese Yuanrather than the US dollaron March 23 2022 Vladimir Putinannounced an order for biddingnon-friendly countries includingEuropean Union countries the US andJapan from buying Russian gas in anyother currency besides the Russian Rublealthough the Russian finance ministryreportedly said it would also acceptgold or Bitcoin a decentralized globalmonetary systemLynn alden's base case going forward isthatover the next several years the globaleconomy will more likely than notencounter a bear cycle of the currentpetrodollar system if so assets such asGlobal equities quality residential realestate precious metals industrialCommodities and Alternatives such asBitcoin are likely to do well from therethe global monetary system willgradually become more decentralized inthat sense that alternate paymentsystems and Alternate currencysettlements among trading partners aregrowing in usethis will indeed be a more structuralshift towards a new system it couldhappen slowly as it already is or itcould accelerate if the US itself alsoshifts out of the fraying systemconsequences of monetary hegemonyfor at least the past 78 years marked bythe end of World War II the globaleconomy has more or less revolved aroundthe US dollarthe Bretton Wood system was also thestart of global financial institutionslike the international monetary fund andthe World Banksince then a lot of additionalorganizations like the bank forinternational settlements the bis thefinancial action task force fatf and ofcoffic well launchedunelected representatives are inventingrules to fight money laundering taxevasion and in recent decades terrorismI haven't heard of any Financialregulation that was voted on by thepopulationbut every country in the world has toregulate its banks in parts for goodreasons but despite the overarchingregulations The World Is Still riddledwith fraud banking failures and moneylaundering and now also cryptocurrencyfraud in cases such as FTX Luna and soonit's just that the small fish get caughtwhile the big fish in most cases simplypay a fine Which is less than theirprofits and move on there is alreadyenough regulation and laws aroundtraditional finance and thecryptocurrency industrythe fall of FTX was caused by fraud notbecause Bitcoin is a tool to rip offpeople the opposite is true if allactors in the industry were to stay trueto the Bitcoin principles oftransparency and not building on debtthen these things wouldn't have happenedits centralized actors and their secrecythat allow fraud like that to happenfraud has always been a crime there arelaws to deal with it it's not lack ofRegulation its lack of oversightaccepting 2 billion excluded people ascollateral damagethe effects on people in these countriesare huge sanctions always hurt the poorand vulnerable the most the powerfulfind their ways out the US was attackedin 2001 and in the following years itstrengthened regulations to combatterrorism which trickled down to almostall jurisdictions in the worldconsequently excluding billions ofunregistered and stateless people fromestablishing bank accounts getting jobspurchase homes or start businesses inaddition these people are impoverishedmarginalized discriminated againstdisenfranchised and politically excludedfor instance there is vinette taminiaged 33 and a grandmothershe is one of three hundred thousandzimbabweans who will never have accessto a bank account because of her lack ofidentification papers as she told theguardian I have never had a birthcertificate or an ID my father wasmalarian and settled here in the 70swhen we were born we never had anopportunity to get birth certificates mymother who was Zimbabwean died my fatherjust disappeared my husband left mebecause I do not own any particulars mysister got married and bought fourchildren but the husband chased her awaybecause she has no idea I cannot evenbuy a SIM card I cannot get a job Isurvive on doing laundry but we getexploited because there is no choicethese organizations are forcing everyoneinto overarching regulations andbureaucracy which enable control on thelevel of the individual leading tofinancial exclusion and oppression ofbillions of peoplethe data collected by authorities is aHoneypot for hackers online crimes andextortion and this all to find the fewwho are really money laundering orfinancing terrorism instead of Generalsurveillance why not focus and Targetthe few it's a vicious circle sanctionsoverarching regulations and financialcontrol are the reasons why people needBitcoin now let's take a look at theuniversal Declaration of Human Rights aglobal regulatory regime is excluding anestimated 1.7 billion adultsperhaps it's 3 billion people if weinclude an estimated two children peradult these three billion people can'thave access to a bank account whichleads us to the universal Declaration ofHuman Rights and its 30 articles I'llrefer to seven of these articles todemonstrate how Bitcoin is supportingHuman Rights Article 1 the right toequalityall human beings are born free and equalin dignity and rights they are in doubtwith reason and conscience and shouldact towards one another in a spirit ofBrotherhood this human right wouldsuggest we are all born free to enjoydignity and rights but this isdefinitely not the case financiallybillions of people being too poor orwithout IDs are excluded from FinancialServices of the 1.7 billion unbanked 980million are women unbanked people can'tstore their cash safely because ofpotential damage from animals like ratsor because it makes them a target for arobbery and they can't borrow money orelse they fall prey to loan sharksas a Nigerian loan shark victim has saidtowards the last days of February 2022 Iborrowed 18 000 naira that's around 43US dollars from the Soco loan app whichI saw on Facebook during the applicationthe app displayed 92 days as the minimumloan tenure but after I had submitted mydata I saw an interest rate of about 45for 14 days the solution is not moreregulation but open access to securedecentralized money Financial illiteracyand lack of wealth cause exclusionif you do manage to have an idea andaccess to a bank account or mobile moneyservice in Africa it still doesn't meanthat you can access it easily or sendmoney to someone in your own country orabroad red tape unfunctional ornon-existent I.T infrastructure and highfees make this so hard that many peopleeven though they own bank accounts juststop using them the fee structure ofSouth African banks for instance is upto four times higher than in countriessuch as Germany Australia and even Indiamany people are willing to run the riskof loss and theft associated with cashto avoid the fees and the red tapepeople on low incomes have a deepmistrust of the formal financial sectorwhich is rooted in fears of exploitationAfrica's poor are particularlyvulnerable due to widespread Financialilliteracy exacerbating the sense ofmistrust and levels of exploitationfostered by these practicesunfortunately this is a systemiceducation problem within Africa thatcannot be addressed in the short termthis is also a problem with all thecrypto tokens and outright scams as wellBitcoin Educators must make thedifference between centralizedinstitutions and the Internet Protocolof money clear to the people educationis key especially when the existingsystem must not be copied into thefuture which was the goal of Bitcoin andSatoshi Nakamoto in the first place asSatoshi Nakamoto said the root problemwith conventional currency is all thetrust that's required to make it workthe Central Bank must be trusted not todebase the currency but the history ofFiat currencies is full of breaches ofthat TrustBanks must be trusted to hold our moneyand to transfer it electronically butthey lend it out in waves of creditbubbles with barely a fraction inreserve we have to trust them with ourprivacy trust them not to let identitythieves drain our accounts14 African countries which werecolonized by France with about 200million inhabitants are still obliged touse the Central African fraud and theWest African from collectively known asthe CFA Franc the CFA Franc is littletender and is packed to the euro thesecountries must deposit half of theirforeign exchange with the Frenchtreasury although these countries havebeen independent for decades they don'thave Financial sovereignty that's notIndependence that's monetary colonialisminflation is hidden tax for the firsttime since the 1920s austrians andGermans are feeling the impact ofinflation 10 percent was the peak inNovember 2022 Energy prices in Europeare skyrocketing friends in Austria aretelling me that they won't hit theirflats this winter and are buying cheapfood they have middle class shops theyare well educated 10 to 20 years ago theshops they are doing today we are payingenough to buy an apartment on credit ona car and go on a holiday trip with thefamily those days are overcompared to countries like Zimbabwe with500 percent inflation or Cuba with 135turkey with 73.5 and so on this is stillbearablebeing in Zimbabwe I always wonder howpeople survive these difficultiesthe current inflation is only topped bythe hyperinflation in Zimbabwe around2008 when the highest denominatedbanknote was worth a hundred trillionZimbabwe dollar just imagine that thevalue of your money is decreasing by 500percent per month the salaries of civilservants doctors and teachers inZimbabwe are around 300 US dollar permonth and they get paid in the Zimbabwedollarsaving money is completely impossibleeither you spend it immediately or youtry to find someone who wants toexchange it to US Dollars what is therate today might be the most usedquestion after hello how are you inZimbabwe followed by the decision of inwhich currency am I going to payone of the reasons for the highinflation in Zimbabwe is excessive moneyprintingduring my first visit to Zimbabwe in2020 I put together a podcast Serieswhere I documented the financialsituation of people and if and howBitcoin can be used to fight inflationand Corruption my conclusion was thatZimbabwe sadly is a kleptocracy theelites are corrupt and loot all moneyfrom the peoplehow Bitcoin fixes inflation from moneyprintingthere will only ever be 21 millionBitcoin when I mentioned that in mytalks in Zimbabwe people immediatelyunderstand the use casethere will be no monetary inflationwhich would render Bitcoin to have lessvalue yes bitcoin's value is volatilethat's because its price is determinedby supply and demand and there is simplynot enough Demand yet to stabilize thevalue but nobody can inflate the maximumamount of Bitcoin that will be availableBitcoin can also not be forged like cashor goldcorruptionspeaking of corruption and goldcorruption is abuse of entrusted powerfor private gain in Zimbabwe the rulingElites are behind its disappearing goldevery year gold worth 1.5 billion USdollars is being looted at the same timeZimbabwe's wants enviable Health Caresector is collapsing under the weight ofdilapidated infrastructure a lack ofdrugs and poorly paid stuff going onfrequent strike pregnant women are beingforced

government andministers are rewarding themselves withnew luxury carsnot only in Zimbabwe corruption is ahuge problem almost everyauthoritarian-led country has a highlevel of corruptioncorruption erodes trust weaknessdemocracy hampers Economic Developmentand further exacerbates inequalitypoverty social Division and theenvironmental crisishow Bitcoin fixes corruptionthe Bitcoin blockchain is a transparentLedger of all transactions that tookplace since Bitcoin started publicly onJanuary 3rd 2009.that means that budgets for Ministriesor projects can be audited withmulti-signature wallets the possibilityto steal funds shrinks this would onlybe possible if all signers were tocolludebut this doesn't contradict the Privacypreserving properties of Bitcoin if youchoose to make a budget auditable youcan the private Keys give you thepossibility to stay private or to revealdataand if you self-custody your Bitcoin youcan do that you decide this is howBitcoin empowers individuals and keepsauthorities in checkhow Bitcoin fixes the right to equalityBitcoin is a neutral Global borderlessmoney as an open protocol it can be usedby anyone no one can be excluded andeveryone is treated the sameBitcoin gives self sovereignty on apersonal and a national levelBitcoin doesn't care where you were bornsuffering a high amount of inflation andCorruption is a result of The Misfortuneof your birth locationarticle 12 the right to privacyno one shall be subjected to arbitraryinterference with his privacy familyhome or correspondence not to attacksupon his honor and reputation everyonehas the right to the protection of thelaw against such interference or attacksYes you heard that correctly privacy isone of the human rights mentioned in theDeclarationhow can it be that our privacy is highlyinfringed not only by companies likeFacebook or Google but also by theregulatory authorities in the name ofpreventing money laundering and childabuse we are all under constantsurveillanceFinancial surveillance and control seemto be the goals of Institutions like thepeace in 2021 its general managerAugustine Carstens said in regards toCentral Bank digital currencies thefollowing we don't know for examplewho's using a 100 bill today we don'tknow who is using the 1000 peso billtodaya key difference in with the cbdc isthat Central Bank will have absolutecontrol on the rules and regulationsthat will determine the use of thatexpression of central event liabilityand also we will have the technology toenforce that yet people argue with mesaying things like but I've got nothingto hide it's okay we need this controlto fight criminalswell my answer is this it's not abouthaving nothing to hide alone this ideais pushing human rights activistslesbians and gays opposition members andso on under the suspicion that they havesomething to hide no they don't haveanything to hide nonetheless they aretargets of violence intimidation andprison and are facing death in manycountriesthat's the reason why privacy isimportanteven more so it's important thateveryone is using privacy protection themore people who care about privacy thebetter protected Freedom Fighters andvulnerable groups arethis means that more privacy protectionneeds to be included in Bitcoin at theblockchain level less wealthy peoplecan't afford a VPN service that coststen dollars per month they use what theyget for freemany millions are on Facebook andWhatsApp in Africa whybecause it's the only option they havethe cheapest option that telecomproviders offer are so-called socialmedia bundlesthat's why thousands of people believethat Facebook is the internetwe shouldn't repeat that mistake but weare on the brink luno Finance coinbaseare well-known brands in Africa mostpeople believe that one needs to use anexchange or a bank to be able to useBitcoin and not only in Africa I'veheard that several times from peoplefrom all over the worldprivacy is a luxury for most Africansthey are even more prone to datacollection and abuse how Bitcoin fixesthe right to privacybitcoin's privacy isn't perfect yet newtechnologies like pay joints orconfidential transactions will hopefullybe implemented in the coming yearspayments on the lightning Network aremore private alreadywrapped lightning invoices protect therecipient from being identified bycustodians with coin joints you canalready achieve a high level of privacyin the future this kind of protectionneeds to be the standard still sinceBitcoin is pseudonymous and many peoplein African countries use it peer-to-peerwithout knowing your customeridentification it gives them moreprivacy than their bank or mobile moneyprovider in Zimbabwe All Digitaltransactions are automatically taxed atfour percentevery payment is traceable by thegovernment since mobile moneytransactions are moving from one simcard to the other and Sim users areregistered privacy is never zero to oneit's on a scale the Privacy possiblewhile using Bitcoin is higher than thatof your credit card but lower than thatof using cashthere is definitely a lot of work to bedone and it's important to make Bitcoinon the base chain more private butBitcoin gives you plausible deniabilityalready now it protects us from being aneasy target Article 19 freedom of speecheveryone has the right to freedom ofopinion and expression this rightincludes freedom to hold opinionswithout interference and to seek receiveand impact information and ideas throughany media and regardless of Frontiersfunding the opposition in Zimbabwesupporting to a gay rights group inSaudi Arabia protesting against China inHong Kong donating toward Ukrainianrefugeesthen you are sharing your opinion withthe world through your financialtransactions if you can't send money toan abortion clinic in the U.S for fearof being prosecuted then your freedom ofspeech has been taken awaysimilar cases as the following are notunique to Zimbabwe but that's just thecountry I visited for the longest periodthe young man pictured on the left wasbrutally murdered because he was anactivistthe man on the right was arrestedbecause he was wearing a yellow t-shirtyellow is the color of the oppositionand wearing yellow was forbidden by thegovernment[Music]even school children have not beenspared with reports suggesting thatschools with yellow uniforms have beendirected to abandon them and pickdifferent colors Sim I reported howBitcoin fixes freedom of speechBitcoin transactions are uncensorableused the right way Bitcoin gives youenough privacy to express your opinionarticle 20 freedom of Associationone everyone has the right to freedom ofpeaceful assembly and Associationtwo no one may be compelled to belong toan association freedom of speech goeshand in hand with freedom of Associationif you can't express your politicalopinion if you can't meet with yourfellow demonstrators or Freedom Fightersbecause of financial surveillance thenyou are stripped from political powerif your activism endangers theauthoritarian Powers then they cut youoff from your bank account this happenedin Nigeria during the ensas movementwhich started in October 2020 thedemonstrations against police brutalitywere supported by the Nigerian feministCoalition they collected donations viatheir bank account and gave food drinksand other needed support to thedemonstrators but not for long thecountry's Central Bank cut off theirbank account but the women rememberedBitcoin the technology that workswithout banks tech savvy as they werethey set up a BTC pay server instanceand started collecting donations inBitcoin from all over the world yeahthis is the real use case becauseespecially myself and my co-founders wehad previously spoken about how OkayBitcoin is really good because you knowyour government might shut you down orthings like that but before it was allsort of theoretical and it was onlywithin like the last month they werelike oh we're actually living throughthis this all this stuff that we've beensaying is actually true and yeah weshould actually be putting a lot of ourmoney or at least enough that you cansurvive or something in something likethis where you can control ithow Bitcoin fixes freedom of Associationbitcoin's privacy and uncensorabilityenables people to cooperate againstdictatorships you simply can't freeze aBitcoin account because there are noaccounts as long as you self-custodyyour keys no one can take your moneyaway from youArticle 2 freedom from discriminationeveryone is entitled to all the rightsand freedoms set forth in thisdeclaration without distinction of anykind such as race color sex languagereligion political or other opinionNational or social origin Property birthor other statusfurthermore no distinction shall be madeon the basis of the politicaljurisdictional or International statusof the country or territory to which aperson belongs whether it be independenttrustnon-self-governing or under any otherlimitation of sovereigntyfor this purpose let's talk a little bitabout foreign exchange controlsforeign exchange controls are imposed bya government on the purchase or sale offoreign currencies by residents on thepurchase or sale of local currency bynon-residents or the transfers of anycurrency across National borderscountries with weak and or developingeconomies generally use foreign exchangecontrols to limit speculation againsttheir currencies they may also introduceCapital controls which limit foreigninvestment in the country 31 countriesglobally are imposing foreign exchangecontrols such as Argentina EthiopiaGhana Nigeria Russia Ukraine Venezuelaand Zimbabwe just to name a fewthis discriminatory restrictions areFinancial oppression in Zimbabwe forinstance online banking transactions arelimited to 600 US dollars per monthper transaction you can only transfer 37dollarsbasically impossible to run a businesslike thatanother form of financial discriminationis the war on cashin 2016 the Indian government andCentral Bank withdrew the highestdenominated banknotes from one day tothe other to fight money laundering andthe black market hundreds of thousandsof cash dependent people stormed Banksand ATMs to exchange their banknotes butof course ATMs were empty and it was aweekend the result was that 82 peopledied and millions lost their money andthis overreach had seemingly zeropositive effect because two years laterthe black market money problem stillexisted how Bitcoin fixes freedom fromdiscriminationBitcoin is permissionless anyone can useit regardless of race gender status orwealth nobody can take it away from yousince it's a protocol controlled by codeand machines there can be nodiscrimination based on human prejudicesArticle 13 the freedom of movement1. everyone has the right to freedom ofmovement and residence within theborders of each state2. everyone has the right to leave anycountry including his own and to returnto his countrymost people don't have the right to freemovement at least they aren't welcome toarrive in many countries if if one isallowed to move freely one can't takeall of their wealth with themselvesimagine you need to flee your homebecause of war or discrimination andpersecution you can't just go to thebank and ask for all of your money andtransfer it abroad foreign exchangecontrols and regulations banned theimport of a stash of money higher than afew thousand US dollars if you own ahouse or land you need to sell it andsee how you can transfer it from onejurisdiction to the otherhow Bitcoin fixes the freedom ofmovementBitcoin is borderless it enables freemovement without losing all your wealthand Ukrainian Refugee was able to fleethe war zone because they could taketheir Bitcoin with them this individualhad its Bitcoin on a USB stick or ahardware wallet some sort of device andcould carry it with himbut you don't even need that in fact youdon't need a device to take all yourwealth with you memorize the 12 seedwords to your Bitcoin wallet throw awayyour smartphone or computer and moveover borders on the other side getyourself a phone install a wallet andimport the seed words you'll have accessto your money againarticle 17 the right to own property oneeveryone has the right to own propertyalone as well as in association withotherstwo no one shall be arbitrarily deprivedof his property75 economies globally still limitwomen's rights to manage assetsthere are countries in which women arenot allowed to own property or inheritit they never will be owners of landthat could be used as a security toapply for a loan or support theirinformal businesses this is occurringmostly in countries in the Middle EastNorth Africa south Asia sub-SaharanAfrica East Asia and the Pacific Bitcoinempowers women and vulnerable groupsbecause one can own it secretly no oneneeds to know this lowers the danger ofmoney being taken away by partners andfamily members how Bitcoin fixes theright to propertyBitcoin is not only digital money it'sdigital property Thereforeself-custodying your Bitcoin makes youan owner of property since Bitcoin ispermissionless the right to own propertyis granted to anyone Bitcoin is a silentrevolution in authoritarian contextswhere control rests with a few socialmovements are the last remaining checkon power it is the collective power heldby ordinary people from all walks oflife that will ultimately deliveraccountabilitythis quote is from Daniel Erickson theCEO of Transparency InternationalBitcoin is carried by a social movementit's a silent Revolutionby being in charge of our private Keyseach one of us is part of a collectivewith the power to force governments tobe held accountablewith the help of Bitcoin dictators canbe toppledself-custody your Bitcoinincapacitate them from the power tocreate and seize money and their fundswill dry outhold them accountable by pressuring themto audit public fundsit may sound illogical but by usingBitcoin you are supporting FreedomFighters globally and helping make theworld more inclusivethis is why my non-profit initiative iscalled Bitcoin for fairness ultimatelyBitcoin does not fix everything therewill always be rich in poor people butBitcoin definitely fixes one huge thingit enables Fair access to a borderlessneutral money that can't be altered tothe advantage of any single entity byusing Bitcoin you support FreedomFighters globally and help to make theworld more fair Bitcoin delivers theopportunity for historical reparationfrom the effects of colonialismit can make the gap between rich andpoor smaller that's why I put so mucheffort into sharing Bitcoin self-custodyknowledge in African countries and theglobal self the peer-to-peer non-kycRevolution will take place here wherepeople are used not to using Banks mymotto is keep the unbanked and bankedand support them in their fight forFinancial FreedomI'm just an ally visiting and sharingknowledge the local people are key theopportunity is there I trust they'lltake it and runBitcoin isn't useless it's Pricelessanyone who is lobbying for a Bitcoin banor
