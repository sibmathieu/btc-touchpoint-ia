  "text": "about doing an lsd i i really enjoydoing lsd and kind of [ __ ] up placeslike some of my favorite places areairports and casinos and it'si feel like i'm yeah i feel like i'm onthe journey through dante's inferno andvirginiaand all this twisted [ __ ] up [ __ ] andi'm like yeah virgil like what's deepermanby the way just so you knowwhen i was like 16 or 17 i took shroomsand i went to caesars palace and uhback i don't know if they still have itbut back then they had this this showwhere they have these fountains withthese greek god statues and they comeout they're animatronics so they comeout of nowhere and move and talk andlikezeus is yelling at athena and i thoughti was hallucinating the entire thing youknow what i mean and it was like one ofthe scariest moments of my life like ihad entered like greek mythological helllike i was in the underworld orsomething like it was i mean i guess itdepends what you're after butso if you're if you're after like acrazy [ __ ] up fear and loading type ofthing then sure go to like a superstimulating environment and justtry to keep your [ __ ] together i guessbut that's that's never beenwhat i've been after on the psychedelicside of things you know like i go forcomplete isolationmost likely in nature and like allall non-natural stimulation to a minimumbecausewell one i mean i think the primaryreason is because i'm trying to see whatthe experience is like absentstimulation not piling it on and justlikebeing over overloaded um yeah but toeach their own eric i guess you'reat leasti like both likei was just going to ask like do you liketo party on it because like i'mi really like to have my deep spiritualindividual in the forest quiet but ialso love to just you know go to crazy sfestivals and like have the bass blaringin my face you know vibrating me out ofexistencei i used to party on it a lot when i wasyounger and uhit was fun at first until it juststarted being bad trip after bad tripafter bad trip so i had to i had to stopeventually you know yeah my firstthe answer to your question for me ericis no i don't like partying on it at alluh there's too manythere's too many unknownsbut but the first time like i reallycame to psychedelics was as a result ofnot necessarily a party it was just meand a few of the guys hanging out wewere like being silly you know but welike i i overdosed us that's the wrongterm i like double dosed us and we had away more powerful trip than we wereanticipating and it just brought me tolikethe weird dark place and i was like[ __ ] what like what is going on what isthisthis ain't so funand that that's what started my journeyof like figuring out what thatexperience was all about and how to useit properly butuhyeah there's just too many unknowns andtoo many weird things can happen tothrow you off kilter inenvironments like thatand i'm like i'm also not ai'm not a partier really anymore as lameas that soundsi don'tlike i don't rave or any [ __ ] like thati barely drinkkind of boring i guessno i meani i only do it in a specific and focusedcontext when you know i know there'sgoing to be excellent djs i can commitmyself to it my kids are taken care ofso it happens every every few years some and ashley went to a really greatfestival a couple weeks ago and it'sexactly what i needed for life so yeahthat was also nice because i just forgotuhi just forgot like how much i can reallyenjoy that vibe and just listening tothe music and just reallyenjoy existing yeah it's an interestingdynamic of itit's a very similar to like the the deepspiritual stuff but like kind of on thislike fun playful sideyeah that makesmakes perfect senseum i guess the last time i partied likethat was in tomorrowland in 2018.we didn't uh we didn't do psychedelicswe did a littlemolly but uhthat was the last time i i guess ireally partied like it's wonderfulbutyeah do you consider molly psychedelicnot really not a classic psychedelicbecause it's more of a likeit's more like a embodied sensation thanapsycho spiritual sort of thingat least as far as my experience with ithas beenumthe only time i ever did molly i i mixedit with shrooms so i have no idea whatit even feels like uh but i know whenyou mix it with shrooms [ __ ] gets weirdas [ __ ] i bet i betno i mean likewith mollyso much canlike you have to make sure that thesource is good right because you can youcan have garbage and you don't want tobe putting garbage in your system andtaking all that risk but if it's likepureit's awonderful loving experience and which isi guess part of the reason why there'sso muchyou know maps has been doing all thatwork and trying to get it umavailable fori think initially uhyeah ptsdyeah so but mdma assisted psychotherapyfor ptsdand i think this might even be the yearthatthey get past stage three clinicaltrials and get it into like availabletreatmentsi'm not sure what the current status isbut i think that was athat was the last i heard of it umdoes that mean it'll be available forprescriptioni think so well it may not be like rightbutyeah like a like i think it has to bedone in a therapeutic contextyeah and presuming that the propertherapists are available in your areaand all that kind of stuff but i dothink that's the idea like you'll beable tolike some sort like a primary carephysician or someone to be able to writea treatment formdma assisted psychotherapywhich is great because you know thei know eric you're somewhat i think uhcritical of the medicalization of allthis stuff and i think iwe can have a chat about that butjust as a baseline that that first ofall has been so successful i mean it gotfast-trackedit got whatwhat's the designation that the fdagivesbreakthrough therapy status is what theygave it because it was so effective attreating ptsd and i think also treatmentresistant depression was the other onethat they had done the trials on and ithad like insane results and so that'swhy they gave it that status andbut even so it's been like i think mapshas been working on it for 20 years sofast tracking through the fda is likeyou know not that not all that fastbut yeah i mean it seems like it'stremendouslyuh beneficial for those sorts of peopleand i once you do it in the rightsetting you can understand why becauseit's you know such a likeheart opening uhexperience andi guess in conjunction with acapable psychotherapist you can reallywork through some stuff that otherwiseyou might have somelike pretty severe blockages to accessityeah i mean my experience with it isthat like you'relike all of the defenses even if youwant them like they go away and and i iconsider like out of all the differentuh things i've experimented with like ithink molly's like the most quoteunquote dangerous just becauseuh like if you're if you're with thewrong people and that barrier is downlike it's really easy to bond to themwhen they shouldn't beit just presents a lot ofyou have to be very critical about yourapproach to it and if you're sloppyabout that you can cause for a lot ofproblems but i mean i think it's greatthat more people get to experience thesethingstotally i think it's also dangerousbecause it's exclusivelypositive pretty much or at least likethe the sensation is so positive whereaspsychedelics i mean you kind of have towork for it like you know you don't justtake it it's likelike blissful like you take it and youencounterthe reality of of who you are and thereality of reality in many senses andlike that can be terrifying so you knowit's not something that as soon as youcome out you're like yeah let's diveback in right away next weekend becausethat was just purely positive it's likeit's a far more uhfar more of like a hero's journey sortof experience than just you know takingsomething and being delivered to apositiveexperiencerob i'm just me reading your messagehere you're chopping out every five orseven secondsi guessyeah i don't know what it's like if youguys can hear me buti didthe other day with a couple of guyssvetsky and moss we had to switch toriverside becausei have 50 megabytes per second up anddown but for some reason at thisi don't knowweirdyeah you you're coming throughrelatively clear we're just hearing likea few gaps yeahokayum i'm just yeah so just know that imight miss a few important things youdid saywhat's new with you you've been pumpingout content like crazyyes yeah working on the showumtwo and then i've been traveling alittle bit but i'm headed towardsnashvillesoi'm kind of moving back there on asemi-permanent basiswhich i'm from tennessee so it's likegoing back home for megoing to little bitcoinmecca as wellit's going to be exciting what's upyou going to a bitcoin meccayeah one of the one of the things uhyeah that's that's anotheraspect of it and um i'mback in the southpeople are saying there so that'll begoodgood to plug into a culture thatdoesn't complainalthough i saw you i saw you just umturn your sailor series into a bookthat's pretty cool yeahyeah it's just it's essentially atranscript of the conversation with justsome somebut yeahmaterialfor people that prefer to read like meyeahyour uhaudio is a little bit shittier nowi yeah i don't think this is gonna getbetter guys can we dotwitter space i don't know what otheroptions are therei have no idea i always use this doesriverside uh allow you to streami don't know the thing about riversidethat works is that it recorded locallyso when there were gapsyou could still catch your audio yeahwhat's that other one you've used beforejohn like restreamerno restream is just what i use tolive stream this i use zencaster forthe ct pod because that's just we don'tlive stream it and it just recordslocally butthat's kind of not fun anyway i can tryand take me afterwardssomewhereto a starbucks or something i could tryto take my phone down to a starbucks orsomething and then dial inyeah do that [ __ ] see if it works allright i'll see you guys in a few yearspeople like get all angry at starbucksyeah it'll be greatif you had background noise it would befine as long as we could like hear youcoming throughwe wanna see rob fly off the handle instarbucks and have like people behindhim being like who's this weirdoi can't imagine rob flying off thehandle about much you know i mean likecould you imagine rob like reallyvolatile like emotionally volatileprobably not no but i kind of want tosee it because he probably wreck houseyou know he's alarge thor [ __ ] you know so hecould probably[ __ ] some people up yo so how are youguys handling the bear market you doinggood bear market check in everyone'ssayingeverything okaynever better man never bettermy [ __ ] contractor i orange billedhim which is awesome but like the marketcrashed he's like yeah like pay meeverything like in bitcoin and i'm likeuhokay you sure you don't want cashit's like no no i want bitcoinokayhere you goi uhi i orange killed my therapist and thenthe market crashed so uh i haven't beenback to therapy you knowreach out to him he'll be like [ __ ] youhow about that how's that for some helpgo get [ __ ]i'm sorry sorry i mean bear market'sgood for me like i i always like thebear market becauseone it [ __ ] all the morons um yeahwhich like there are a lot more thatneeds to happen um but like this tornadocache thing's been hilarious to watchfor for east to like immediately becomelike compliant chainumyeah i don't know i always like bearmarkets because everybody shuts up andgets back to work and it makes lifeeasier have i told you my theory aboutyou know what you just said about itbeing compliant chain i think basicallythat the amount of downward pressure onethereum in particular and basically allof the [ __ ] coins that are actuallysecuritiesis going to be to add an aml kyc layerand i think that ethereum is going tohave no problem adding that because theyhave no defensibility like they can'ttell regulators to pound sand becauseit's very easy to capture ethereum rightso basically they have to add it and ithink the way they're going to do it isthey're going to spin it to the publicin this way that's like we've createddecentralized identity solutions forblah blah blah and it's the next bigbubble i think in [ __ ] coin land isgoing to be this identity bubble becausethey're going to spin this negative intoa positive in order to sell [ __ ] pointsto the public this is sort of like myworking thesis at the moment i thinkwe're going to see it develop over thenext couple of years and this tornadocatch is justsort of the beginning of it in myopinion wait say that again how do theymake it a positiveso yeah basically like regulators aregoing to force them to have an aml kyclayer like if you listen to like sailortalk i think he has a very sober take onthis which is that regulators don't wantto ban bitcoin or crypto assets whatthey want to do is they want to doxeverybody and they want to tax everybodyand you can't tax everybody unless youdox everybody so step one is doxeverybody right and in bitcoin there'snobody that you can like subpoena butyou can easily subpoena like high-levelethereum leadership and also like mostof ethereum's uh infra is run in thecloud and like if you see you know whenparlor got the platform photographer andwas on twitter being like uh you knowthis is terrible this is censorship yadayada because he knows it can happen tohim right and so they're going to beforced to add this layerand they're going to spin it to thepublic as a positive why they're addingitthey're so it's basically going to beall these decentralized identitysolutions it'll be like socialcapitalism they'll say they're investingin each other i don't know the exactshape of how it's going to take placebecause i can't get inside the mind of a[ __ ] but i know that this is comingyou knowyeahclose tocbdcterritory tooabsolutelywell this is how you also frame it up tobe like we're like regulated safeethereum who like loves you and wants tomake sure terrorism doesn't happen andthat the environment isn't destroyedunlike the bitcoiners who want to fundterrorism and want to destroy theenvironment you pieces of [ __ ]so that's that's absolutely rightbecause here's what i never anticipatedwhen i first looked at ethereum duringthe pre-sales like this thing has nodefensibilityobviously like it can totally becaptured and theni i didn't even realize they want to becaptured by the state that's what theywant that's what their end goal isand once that came into focus for me iwas like oh [ __ ] now it all makes sensethe proof of stake attack the reason theethereum people areeverybody hear hollowno i can't hear him at alli love that he's like going through allof his reasonsand he's going to get to the end andhe's going to be like and that's why mythesis worksthat was a great huddle but we lost mostof it sodid you mute yourself oryeah you seem like you muted yourselfit's all right i still love youjust lastohwe're doing good here todaythe tech tech support hall hangthe internet major american citiessharing what it used to be yeaheverything's fine i'm like out here inthe middle of [ __ ] nowhere and likei'm actually doing pretty okayso yeah you're coming are you on the umthe star link right nowyeah yeah it's it's the same spot i justhad a new dish becausemy contractor finally get up that treeor get somebody up that treeno no same pole it's just a new dishthat that works betterright but i'll climb the tree eventuallyi just like want to climb the tree atthis point thank you john you look goodtoo i miss you johni miss your smell the rich mahoganyi miss i miss all you guysthat's why we do this paddle you backcan we hear you now dude dad where did icut out i cut out like when you startedin your ring you're like number onei was on such a good rantgod damn itdo you want to have to point out howfunny is it the thing called tornadocash literally became a tornado that wasthrowing cash at people to try to i meanlike this stuff keeps happening and likethis this to me is how like god's likehis like slapstick humor he's like let'shave all this crazy [ __ ] happen whereit's obvious by the name how this isgonna faildudesafe moon that that currency took offbecause people were like well like it'ssafeand it goesto the moonthat was the whole thought processbrando has electrolytesyeah exactlyyeah i justevery it's like everyone has to beconstantly reminded whybitcoin exists and why it exists in theform it exists and you can'tlike even in bitcoin within bitcoin landand you know everyone's waiting on aspot etf and all this you know hooplaaround blackrock whatever the [ __ ] it islikeare you it's gonna the same shit's gonnahappen eventually those people getrubbed you tell me if you put 10 billion50 billion dollars into a spot etf youthink that's what bitcoin's about youdon't think that that's a honey pot fora regulator for the the custodian or forwhomever likeyou're getting all these people excitedabout having bitcoin exposureand then you're justit's a big rug pull eventually you likedo you think that's not gonna eventuallybe a rug pull do you think everyone'sgonna like wise up over time but welljust get spottyetf exposure nowand eventually i'll learn how to takecustody and i'll do that whole thing andi'll become a full-fledged bitcoiner noyou're justyou're making it seem as though peoplecan own bitcoin without actually owningbitcoin without actually takingadvantage of of the advantages thebitcoin and the value of bitcoinrepresentsand you're just recreating the same [ __ ]like what's the difference between aspot etf and and gold certificatesnot much rightthis is i mean this is [ __ ]hysterical that it's like check it outyou have this like self-sovereign pieceof software that can allow for youindependent wealth sovereignty andpeople are [ __ ] dumb enough to go putthat with an institution that like allthroughout human history they haveprovenly robbed peopleand then like people go and [ __ ] doit again i mean like celsius is theperfect people wow like eight percentinterest like that's great like oh [ __ ]i like lost all my money how could havei ever knownand it's like oh well if we likereferenced any of the [ __ ] dozens ofbank failures throughout all of humanhistorymaybe we'd have some ideaand it's just i don't know like i lovehowi love how like this word crypto hasliterally lost all meaning and it comesto represent this total vacancy that hasnothing to do with cryptography it's[ __ ] funnywell you know it's it's weird i mean onething i don't worry about this becauseuh i think one of satoshi's uh likemoments of brilliance is the speed ofthe supply issuance so there's already19 million bitcoin out there most of itis in the hands of people who do takeself-custody very seriously right and soi don't i don't like worry about it froma systemic point of view but i think itis interesting that like you know we'veseen throughout gold's history thatpeople will continually offload the riskto others whether it's for the promiseof uh you know financial gain or whetherit's because they're scared of losing ontheir own or you know it's just toocumbersome or they getbrow beaten into it or gasoline into ituh you know be a bad law or thegovernment steal whatever like there'sall these things that happenand uh i think like you know the thehuddle culture that we that we areinstilling we do instill in ourselvesand in our children and the people thatcome later is basically like no younever give this up here's what hodlersdo like there's been all this talk aboutbitcoin maximalism and all this [ __ ]right okay this is what hodlers do wejust say noyou know hey give me your bitcoin no heydo this no i don't have to do anythingsell me your bitcoin for 23 000 no i'mnot no no it's all no just no we justsay no forever that's what we do okaythis is the root word of sovereigntylike if you can say no you're sovereignyou can't say nothen you're non-sovereignand the crazy thing to me is that youknow you hear a lotof talk and you know well-meaning peopleare trying to develop solutions foryou know making bitcoin more accessibleto people you know like what brings onthe next billion toddlers and how do wemake this easier for people and like theproposition is12 wordsfor your freedomand 12 words to contribute to thefreedom of the world right as we knowlike let's say if in a hypotheticalif everyone's wealth is completelysovereign unto themselves and can't beaccessed by anybody else then the worldbecomes voluntary and the state shrinksmassively if it even you know continuesto exist at all in its current form andyou know we all know that storybut like all of that is on the otherhalf of 12 on the other side ofremembering and being able to secure 12worldsand still people are like no people arenever going to do that so we have tolike make concessions here or there it'slike you [ __ ]what like we we have this insane neverbeforeproposed opportunity to people to toto gain access to a degree ofsovereignty that no human alive nor anyhuman as a part of a society or acommunity or whateverhas ever had access to and all itrequires of you is to remember 12 wordsand they're like whoa no no no we got tofigure out a way around this that's notgonna work remembering 12 words is notworthor all that freedom is not worthremembering 12 words and whatever i haveto do to make it redundant and all thatkind of [ __ ] it's likeit's going to be seen so absurd in thefuture that like people were trying towork around that and you know eric ithink you've talked about this beforebut i think in the futureultimately and we'll make all themistakes and all the custodians and allthe work arounds uh that are currentlytaking shape like all the hard lessonswill be learnedbut eventually we'll just like we'llhave a culture that prioritizesthe means of securing and maintainingyour sovereignty and it seems to be thecase that it's going to beuh being able to custodyyour own information in some degreewhether it's always 12 words or whetherthat information is encoded in adifferent way in the future but it'slikethat will be one of the fundamentalrights of passage or things that youlearn as someone that grows up in theworld it's like hey you know like youlearn how totake care of yourself you learn how toi don't know like uh you learn certainthings regarding physical fitness youknow like there are things that we haveculturally ingrained that like we teachyoung people or at least we want to imean everything's kind of going off therails these days uh but that'llpresumably be one of them one of themost important and it won't be seen aslike this big hurdle to overcome it'sjust like yeah sure 12 words for myfreedom it's like the [ __ ] best dealever proposed to anyone so sure likelet's figure out how to do thatinstead of of all these worker boundsthat seem to be emerging today it's likelook i get it like not everyone's readyto take that degree of responsibilitythat doesn't mean you shouldwater downlike what's available to them it's justmaybe it happens slower than you want itto happen maybe you know people takethat responsibilityless people take that responsibility ona longer or on a different time horizonthat you're hoping for butyou knowthere there's let's just say thisthere's nothere's no alternative right you'reeither taking full sovereignty or you'renot and i think a lot of people thesedaysare being uhconvinced that there's likeyou can go halfway or you can water itdown and i feel like that's a recipe forultimatewreckageit's pretty embarrassing too i mean likelike i can't underline that like peoplelike 12 words like this is impossiblelikewe just got to move on with the the warmachine that kills hundreds of thousandsof people and it exploits the entireworld's population that's just justeasier than remembering your 12 wordsand i mean like it well like i hope likeit's funny now but like i actually feela very deep sense of anger like how[ __ ] dare you like like you weresaying john like we have this extremelyradical tooland it's funny as i read more heideggerlike i'm becoming more and moreconvinced that likethis is the fundamental human event ofyou knowhumanity at this point in time becauseit moves us from my daughter's streamfrom analog to a digital world and likein that conversion a new form ofsovereignty that's totally provablethat's never existed beforebecomes accessibleand it's all predicated upon a form ofknowledge that we can all accessi mean like thatthat's [ __ ] extraordinaryisn't it just doesn't it seem on itsface so absurd that likethe narrative that at least some peopleare being told it's likelike you're not capable of that all ofthat good stuff that you just mentionedand the simplefact that it's you know it's accessibleby remembering and you knowcustodian custodying 12 wordsyou're not capable of that so we'regonna have to find another way around itlike it's just it's so yeahcrazy i i don't like the seriousness ohi'll go ahead andi'm just going to say like it's crazybut like take a step back like there'san 80 year old geriatric man who hasalzheimer's who's like running the mostpowerful country in the world likethey'rethere are children that are likerepeatedly bombed for no reason otherthan like they're in the wrong [ __ ]location and we refuse to pull it likewhen you look at how absurd everythingis like why the [ __ ] shouldn't sovereigninternet money come to run the worldbecause like the rest of this otherstuff is so bad [ __ ] crazy so like whynot like let's just go deeper into the[ __ ] craziness rightexcept let's not go so crazy that maybedoggy money runs the showi uh i i do think that there are thesepeople you know i mean 19 millionbitcoin have been mined right so likethe people who end up acquiring the last2 million bitcoin um they've been aliveon the planet for quite some timebecause these bitcoin are expensive nowright but they're just not capable ofsell sovereignty so i'm going to referto them as baby coiners and i think forthe baby coiners you basically needshared risk models like i thinkvetements are a good example of that andthere will be more uh different types ofshared risk models and i'm notnecessarily like i agree with you eric iit's like it is kind of pathetic thatyou need that but like alsosome people need it so [ __ ] it likethere will exist this small slice in themarket that has these shared risk modelsand i think they're some of them aregood trade-offs and some of them are badtrade-offs andpeople are gonna learn what is and isnot a good shared risk model right likeblock finot a good model right like that one'sobvious right celsius not a good modeluh you know what was the other one lunaluna i can't remember them anymore theycome and go[ __ ] fastthere's a bunch of other ones thoughdo we lose eric it's eric's turnlike rotating internet right at thebeginning of this point toonumber onehe's deep into like the [ __ ]heidegger haszoom is like cancelling you guys everytime you get on a rolli know like that well the the nsa islike we got to stop we got to stop thesehuddle hang guys they're they're puttingtoo much crazy [ __ ] out there so likeget get on the zoom and make sure thatthey cut out a whole bunchbut hollow like isn't it like you saidnot everyone's capable ofself-custodying isn't it just crazy thatwe're at a point wherewe've inculcated in people in thisculture or civilizationthe delegation of so much responsibilitythat the idea of being of you being thesole person responsible for 12 wordsthat gives you access to all of yourwealth and as a result most of yoursovereignty and most your capability tomove through the world construct thelife you want whatever we you knowwhatever money actually doesthat that's like just pre-presumed to beoff limits to a pretty big portion ofthe population just by virtue of thefact that they're incapable of takingthat degree of responsibilitydude i i've talked about this before butwhen i made my very first bitcointransaction on chain i had this likesense of panic and like fear that cameover me like i was like oh yeah this isall on me i'm responsible for this rightlike if i send this off into cyberspaceand it goes to the wrong place it's notcoming back to meand then when i sent it and it arrivedwhere it was supposed to arrive and ihad gone through the procedure correctlythat feeling of fear flipped to afeeling of empowerment and i was like oh[ __ ] i can do this this is me baby let'sgo and then then it was like the lightbulb was on in my head you knowyeah like exactly like everyevery [ __ ] day that i worked atcoinbase i had to like resolve accountswhere like i'd like send money to peopleand it was like that over and over andover like and sometimes these were likereally large amounts of money too soit's like you sling the transactionyou're like okay like [ __ ] confirmand then there's like a there was onetime there was like a two-hour blockdrought and it was i was just like[ __ ] i was like there's so muchbitcoin writing hereplease [ __ ] confirmand then it did and you're like thank[ __ ] god and like we always hadpeople like double check us but it wasalways likei was always just afraid that i wasreally gonna [ __ ] myself but thankfullyi've only destroyed like a tenth of abitcoin and that was like quite a whileago and that was right after uh theblock wars with like the be cash [ __ ]yeahi i uh i analogized this to driving acar there was a time when we were allscared teenagers who didn't know how tooperate a motor vehicle and you were inthe parking lot with like your parent orsomebody and you were just like oh [ __ ]you're a girlyou know whatever right that's what it'slike to operate bitcoinbut it's still goodand further more like now that you candrop like you can you know like lookpretty tired and go drive and like not[ __ ] destroy yourself you're eating acheeseburger you're texting you're likea little drunk you're like i'm fine[Laughter]umthe 12 words this thing is reallyinteresting because you guys obviouslysuper focused on the brain walleti think the brain wall that's importantbut don't you think we need multi-sig wedo needwe do need these distributed risk modelsfor succession planning and all thatwell what do i say sogood jobwhen i say 12 i mean like i mean yourresponsibility to either remember themor make sure you always have access tothem by making them redundant in somewayuh okay you put all that into the 12wordsyeah although like i mean sureyou know brain walls don't work for ifanything happens to you like if that'sthe exclusive place it is you know sothat's probably for most peopleuh ill-advised but i think just like thephilip like the main philosophical pointmaybe it's just that likethat's allit boils down to that likeyou can haveyou know complete financial sovereigntyand all the other sovereignty thatenables just by remembering 12 words andyou take and like the responsibility forthat is not only just remember themremembering them but like you said likefiguring out a way tomake sure that if you forget them youstill have access to them but likethink about how justit just seems i can't get over it it's12 words it's 12 little bits ofinformation you're notlike you don't have to dedicate yourlife to something you don't have to likebuild something massive you don't haveto continually do something likeit's 12 wordsfor sovereignty for the rest of yourlife and people are likei can't can't do it like you know i'mjust i can't take thatresponsibility i take it a step furtherand sayyeah it's sovereignty over your own lifeand it can be all of your wealthbut it's also thisuncompromisable intergenerational wealthyeah because now you can take thatinformation and pass it on right and itcan be passed on forever really if youdo it rightand it's not so in that way it's notjustyour wealth because bitcoin then becomesa slice of global purchasing powerforeverso it's like you're you know in out of21 million slice of all globalproductivity intergenerationally foreveryeah it's umit's crazy it's unbelievable and theprice you pay what's the price 12 wordsyou can literally put 12 words in yourmind that's a pretty low barit's insanely low and then the fact thatlike we're this big ongoing discussionand trying to figure out how tomake it lower but you know in making itlower you youundo the benefit right like you havinguh bitcoin with blackrock or spot etfdoesn't deliver what you just describedat alland this isi think it's kind of ironic in a waybecauseso i always call this inviolableproperty but you could also call it theperfection of ownership right find thefirst time you can own something that'sindependent of everyone else's opinionsabout you owning the thing and um that'sironic to me because that's whygovernments exist really it's like tomake ownership a thingright the fact that you havea title to your car and a deed to yourhouse and even like youreven your birth records and whatnotwhich are used to taxi but sothat's the purpose of government itselfis to just makeumthis idea of property or ownershipitself actually work in the real worldand this thing emerges that isi guess just just the ultimate form ofownership that undermines that wholestructure in a wayso we move from this world whereit's all promises it's allcounterparties it's all opportunitiesfor arbitrage for fraudand you just you close that whole gapbecausethere's no more dependency onpaper [ __ ] promises to your wealthyou just have direct and totalintegrated access to it if you custodyor right it's crazyas as somebody who's who's a bitcoinerand who thinks like you know we think uhyou know and is comfortable with likecryptographic primitives like when i'moperating the world and you know doing areal estate transaction or something andthey're like sign these papers andattest to the fact that you're not lyingit's like whatthat makes no sense i'm just supposed towrite down that i'm not lying and that'senough for you that's nothing that'snothing that's zero you know likeuhto quote jay-z men lie women lie numbersdon't you know it's like bitcoin doesn'tlie every bitcoinso good the whole fiat complex like thewhole thingi think was built on this is alwaystrying to go back to gold it's just hardto self custody gold so we had to put abunch of paper promises on top of thiswhole [ __ ] system and it's infectedeverything in the world now the wholeworld isyou know like i said this counterpartycomplexyeah and when this thing starts to blowupyou know i've been reading thisbook recently about the bank of englandand when they would have blow ups firstthing they do is to spend convertibilityof goldthen they would go in and jack upinterest rates just artificiallyincrease interest rates to draw in golddeposits so basically pulling thecelsius tactic offering your customersyield withdrawing depositsand soi've been thinking a little bit aboutthat like what whatwho's going to start doing that likeit's going to be central banks trying totake custody of bitcoin at some oh yeahthere's some other organization like ohwe'll give you 10 on your bitcoinforever and we're the government yeahwhatever perpetual promise they're goingto try to use these promises that we arebuilt on right noweveryone's going to try to use thesedifferent structures of promises for totry to get your bitcoin which is anotherway of saying everyone's a scammer soyou have to have the 12 wordsi want to [ __ ] scream because likethe [ __ ] motto don't trust verifyit's like a real goddamn thing and it'slike [ __ ] important and i mean likei was thinking about you know like themost natural thing is as as sovereignindividuals we like own our body butlike the state has created this entire[ __ ] ridiculous idea that like weneed birth certificates and other thingsand we don't actually own ourselvesand so bitcoins just like returning usall the way to the beginning ofacknowledging that actually there isnothing at all except for usand through the knowledge form that wecan access vis-a-vis bitcoin and thecryptography it gives us access tolikewe're atwe're at a total end game because likeif cryptography continues to operate theway that we believe it does you knowlike this thing's [ __ ] unbreakablefor the rest of human history and soit'sso profound to get to participate inthis and i just i can't wait to be likean old [ __ ] geezer andi'll be likeearly 2020s and i'll be like oh likeeverybody was [ __ ] [ __ ] they werelike telling us that that they likeloved us and they're like printing outmoney to like make everybody rich andlike all these [ __ ] morons believedit you know and then gas went to fiftydollars and eggs were three hundreddollars a carton and blah blah blah blahblahi think if you look at uh you know whatrob was talking about like the risk ofconfiscation basically um it reminds meof like you know uh plato diploma likesilver or lead and i think that's theapproach that uhyou know elite institutions are going totake is the carrot or stick approach sobasically they're going to offer you youknow incentives uh if you give up yourbitcoin willingly like and those will bein the short term actually rather goodfinancial incentives uh or they're goingto you know take the stick approachwhich is like uh hey john we saw youmade a transaction on the silk road in2013 and you didn't pay your taxes andnow we're going back and auditing youand we have 87 000 new irs agents so go[ __ ] yourself uh you can either takethis deal or you can jump off a bridgeright and so i think likeit will be important tosort of attempt to walk the middle pathuh as we enter into that world and makeit through thatrelatively unscathed with your bitcoinon the other side and i mean how do youdo that anyone's guessas a bitcoin or walk the middle path isthat what you're saying yeah as abitcoineras a hodler you know you want to stillbe hobbling at the end of it all rightpeople come to you with promises peoplecome to you with this people come to mewith that your job as a sovereign personis just say nonoi just yeah i meani mean that's why everyone everyone's ascammer was so so brilliant you knowshout out to bistine but uh this is thething likewhat's the end game for all of theseinstitutions you know they're basic ithink and many people have said thisbefore but i think it's best to justpresume their proxies forall you know ultimate state confiscationlikeif this plays out the way we think it'sgoing to play out and it can you knowbitcoin and people being under custodytheir own wealthit ultimately starves the state of itsmeans of its own survival of executingon its own imperatives let's say thenit's only natural that they'll go to allareas where wealthis concentrated so that they can youknow in desperate attempts to continueto fund themselves and you know aninstitution is the easiest like you knowpick up the phone andcall your buddy larry fink or whomeverand be likeyouh do you want to go to jail or you wantto give up all that coinso and i've been thinking a lot aboutthis and i think this is one of the handwavy things that bitcoiners do often andi've certainly been guilty of it myselfin the past which is uhyou know we we're like and then bitcoinit fixes all the things right and one ofthe things i have to ask myself is likehow does bitcoin prevent a governmentfrom printing money especially agovernment that has its hands on a lotof bitcoin and unfortunately the answeryou come to is that it doesn'tit can slow the printing to some degreebut it can't prevent a sovereign fromissuing their own fiat currency againstbitcoinrightand so i do have to wonder if and andalso here's the thing when you talkabout likethe state dissolving right or like usmoving into a new type of state like youknow bellagio's friend of austin callsit the network state or whatever i don'treally know what that means i don'tthink anybody knows what it means idon't think bellagio knows what it meansbut certainly there's this idea thatwe're directionally heading in this inthis path towards more individualsovereigntysmaller state most likelyuh but you know at the end of the daynuclear warheads don't go away andwhoever has control of the nuclearwarheads guess what they're the newstate right so i think you you arrive atlike minarchism in your like best casescenario but some of the bitcoiners whoare like it's all going away man to zeroman i i don't see that realityi i actually foresee the potential oflarge amounts of uhdeconstructing of the nuclear weapons toactually serve as components to newnuclear reactorsum i mean that's part of my own fantasyabout it uhtruth is i think that's all maybe that'swhat trump was doing with the maybethat's what trump was doing with thenuclear secrethe's obviously a nuclear scientist bynight you knowit's uhwell i mean like i think this all getssuper bad because like i think i thinkreally what happens is that bitcoinersare labeled as like the whitenationalist racists who want to usetheir money to destroy the environmenti think we'll get 61.02 i think thegovernment will demand all transactionsthroughout all history from usuh and i honestly think we'll be forcedback into a corner wherei really hope we'll look at each otherand be like [ __ ] it like time to gototally fully political because at theend of the day like i think at thebottom this is allthe most political thing that's everhappened and we're so deep in the clownworld that we're like yeah look paynepaying half my income to a governmentthat [ __ ] hates me and wants to giveall that money to a bunch of people whodon't want to work and want to use thatmoney to create missiles to kill brownpeople who just want to be left alonelike it's so [ __ ] wacky and insaneand upsettingand like ii don't even know what to dobecausewe we you know i i get that we can starttrying to organize and stuff but i ithink this all ends really poorly for atleast for me personally but i don't knowi ii feel like i really put myself in thetarget well this is this is why youcan't wait to let yourself be backedinto a corner by people who hate you whohave their knives sharpened you know whoare out to get you right like in americahere's one of the great things aboutamerica in america money is speech andbitcoin is money okay so like peoplethat have money they get their voiceslistened to and the government betterreflects their views and theirideologies and what they want to seehappen in the world so the time to getpolitically active is is now right likei get when people go i don't know broi'm moving to salutia man i'm just gonna[ __ ] drink coconuts and then dieearly or whateverthat's fine for youdude but uhi'm very you know interested in whathappens in america over the next hundredyears like very interested so now iwouldn't be here for itthe stacking stats is actually gettinginvolved in politicsbecause you're accumulating more energyfor your political voice at this momentof ultimate face-off that may or may notcome to passumit's interesting you know i i don't knowi think we maybe underestimatethe associated enlightenment maybe someof us overestimate it like myself maybejohnbut umthat book we're readinguh the history of religious ideas thatone thing i texted you about where everytime the text changes there's like thismythological echo behind it and so allthe imaginary structures changeand we you know the most recent one wesaw was like the enlightenment that wasa pretty clear one we hadthe printing press and calculus and allthese like software updates in our inour cognitive structure so ii'm really fascinated to keep watchingthat to see how fast that plays out wesee it play out at the individual levelto some extent i thinkyou know in this group aloneum but to see how fast that manifestedthe collective will be fascinatingthat's like a counter force to thiswhole final judgment day of the statething right you've got thisintransigent minority of bitcoin isgetting moremore and more rich over time which meanstheir political voice is louder andlouder in the u.s as huddle says andit's facing off against this legacystructurethat's much more static much lessadaptive soi mean let me the battle yeahyeslet me yes and this yesuh when the printing press came out theenlightenment swept europe right and inthe endit was a beautiful thing and you know wegot all of modern western culture out ofit and it was necessaryin the space between there everyaristocracy in europe was beheaded andit was very like extremely turbulent andi think we're living in the early partlike the first inning of thatand uh it's kind of terrifying butexciting we'll see what happensthe the new question is like when ithink about a lot i don't know how theworldhandles the existence of like massivenuclear stockpiles becausewhoever controls them when they getdesperate what do they do all that stuffyou know andi just maybe there's what are yousupposed to think about that but to yourpoint rob likeyes we you know we in this group we dotalk a lot about how bitcoinyou know much more than just like a wayto store value ends up becoming like aperceptive lens for how you see yourselfand how you see the world and andyou know your aspirations for it and allthat kind of stuff it's verytransformative and at the end of the daylike there is no government rightthere's just people that are choosing toengage in certain behaviors and otherpeoples that are choosing to engage inothers and the reasons for that areconditioning and incentives and you knowall that stuff and soif that can change theni think all of these structures that wegive like a a reality tocan changerather quicklyand but but again i mean this goes backto the point we're discussing beforeit's likewhy we have to because huddle to yourpoint about like you know the money theycan still print money but yeah but themore the the more people thatdisallow theftfrom farewellthen the you know that you can print allyou want it's less effective right andthis this is the case for the bitcoincircular economy and people cussingtheir own bitcoin becauseyou know if you if you only transact inbitcoinand you custody your bitcoin like you'recreating a little island that you knowis is pretty much impenetrable nowpeople can have pressure be put on andthat kind of stuff which is why it'sgreat that you can cross borders with 12words in your head and your wealth isintact and you know all these thingsthat we we ultimately talk about but thepunch line is is when theft is no longerpossiblewhat happens to the state and the answeris like well how many people havehaveentered that you know no theft zone andright now it's a small amount you knowso this the quote-unquote state stillhas a tremendous amount of power and themoney printer has a tremendous amount ofinfluencebut if more and more people would cometo appreciate theyou know the sacredness and theimportance of those 12 words thenit's not only that they're liberatingtheir own life tovarying degrees both disallowing theftand of course increasing theirpurchasing power over time butcontributing touhyeah the dissolution of the state onmass when enough people do that you knowand of course it's going to bewell not of course i suspect it'll betumultuous and we we always like havethe orange colored glasses on when wehave these conversations and it's allit's going to take many unexpected turnsbutit just seems likethat you know that's a pretty clearpitch if theft is no longer possiblethen the you know rob you talk aboutthis all the time what is the state'sbusiness model i mean it's predicated onon theft and then the redistribution ofof capital and so to the extent thatthat can be negated or limitedpresumably you disempower thatinstitutioni always call it making versus takingright there's only two ways to acquirewealth in the world you can either makeit trade itor you can take it from someoneand so when you increase the cost riskexpense associated with takingyou're creating an incentive structurethat skews everyone towards makingandfrankly the state is in the business ofkillsteal and destroy that's what it doessothe steel part gets much more expensivewhich means the revenue of the statecomes downthe kill and destroy could become lessless of an incentive to uh those endsbutyou know when you talk about that notheft zone like how many people willbe in therebecause that determines a lot of thisa skeptic would sayuh you know people are just too dumbthey're not responsible enough it'snever going to change never going tohappenbut i think a more rationalist way tolook at it isthe number of people moving or migratinginto this no theft zone is driven by thepain they are experiencingright the more you inflate the currencythe more you debase the currency themore you tax them the more you oppressthem regulate them you're creating likean osmotic pressurethrough the membrane it's like you needto leave whatever the regime or the fiatcomplex or whatever system is preyingupon you and you're pushed intointo an untouchable asset like bitcoinby necessity it's notit's not like oh people just get to flipa coin and decide if they're going to beum irresponsible you know follower ortry to like become a sovereignindividual one day it's like no you'reit's darwinian right there's this likethe monsters at your back and if you'renot responding to it you're being takenout anyways and so that's how i see thisplaying i was like there's a pressurethat pushes people into bitcointhe more the state misbehaves basicallywhich is why it kind of necessitatesthattumultuous or you know time becausepeople won't feel that pressure or painunless things get bad enough for them todo sodid you did you guys see the uhthe the guy who held the hostages in thebank in lebanoni mean there were people there werepeople outside right cheering on thehostagethat tells you about what's going on inlebanon rightand there isn't anything reallypreventing that kind of thing fromhappening everywherehe had like 200k in the bank right ithink 200k 230k or something he got awaywith 30. he he robbed the bank for hisown money he had to rob the bank to gethis own he was apprehended well theythey only gave him 30 after all thethreats and everything like i thinkthat's what really drove him right overthe edge was that like they would onlygive him 10 and then like after allthese threats like well how about 30 andhe was like how about i go get my[ __ ] gun mechanic gasoline when icome back [ __ ]that guy was just he got he got pushedto his breaking point and clearly therewere a lot of people in lebanon who weretoo scared to do the same thing but whovehemently supported him in his actionsyou know because they're allexperiencing iti mean but isn't isn't that the truthfor all of us like isn't that why we'rein this whole message we're too [ __ ]scaredlike all of us collectively as ahumanity like we won't stand up and saythese [ __ ] thieving murderingchild raping pieces of [ __ ] [ __ ]steal from us they steal from us andthey call it legal and we allow them todo itand it's so [ __ ] absurd and now thething that i love is that i can say [ __ ]you i have a magic spell where if i have12 magic words you can never guess nomatter how powerful your computation isno matter how much energy you put intoit you can't have my 12 words and youcan't have my money so go [ __ ]yourselvesi don't know i'm just excited becauselike [ __ ] these people [ __ ] the oldpeople who steal from us [ __ ] thisgovernment who steals from me [ __ ] thesepeople that make military and missilethings and say we have to go participatein these foreign forays that lose andkill tens of thousands of people it's[ __ ] absurdyou see uh sorry guys obviously i justlike to like no we it's always good tohave a few good uh eric rants in thehuddle hang uh to be clipped and sharedlater but you know of course i agree buti i thinki mean as we as i alluded to a minuteago like it's almost like because we allhave that capacity right to be thatperson either you know most because mostof these people are blind tothe impacts of their actions theirself-serving behavior their biases theirgreed playing for their incentives youknow they don't see the connectionbetween you know beinga cantillionaire and the bombing of youknow the brown people that you refer toall the time eric like that's not adirect line for them and they wouldprobably refute it to the grave but yousee how the system connects those dotsand you know so likewe all it's almost like the state andall this bad stuff is like a type ofanimus like we all have it withinourselves it just seems like the systemhas almost likehashas steered people in a certaindirection and then calcified that aspectof themselves such that theyhave a very difficult time of seeingoutside of it or extracting themselvesfrom it you know so it's likei share the frustration and the angeryou know in in the direction of thepeople that are doing that stuff but ialso recognize thatyou know it'sit'syeah yeah yeah pretty much like we allhave that capacity that's why you knowthis revolution isa personal one it's a spiritual one it'snot amonetary one i mean and that's alwaysthe case because all we have is ourbehavior how we choose to respond inevery situation that's all there isthat's all there ever will be maybeuntil ai just takes over and thenthere's a whole other kettle of fish butyou know it's acceptabilityyeah and and ii see less and lessi mean i think we we could easily makethings worse for ourselves if we justalways continue to divide it along thoselines and say bad people there we're thegood people we must win over thembecause you know history is litteredwith those sorts ofum those sorts of circumstances and youknow i even you know i've spoken with acouple politicians lately andyou know someone who's decided to be apolitician it's difficult toget them to uhyou know renounce that method ofresolving things let's say but most ofthem feel like the problem is the badguys are in power and i'm the good guyand problems would be resolved if i youknow if the good guy was in power and iwould do all the virtuous things thatthat good guys doandyou know they they all fail to realizethat it's the system itself and thatit's those assumptions themselves thatthat you would presume to determine forother people what's best for them what'svaluable for them what they want youknow all that kind of stuff that'sactually the evil and so umi don't know how useful it is to is toto get angry at you know the the currentsubset of people that are have fallenprey tothat you knowpsycho spiritual systemic sort of traprather than you know i think the onlything we have here isare all each of our own personalrefinement and then engaging in otherpeople that are engaged in the samething that are seeing things in asimilar way that shares similar valuesyeah go going forward i i think um youknow bellagio was on tim ferriss and hewas talking about he said that bitcoinmaximism is the most important ideologythat most people haven't heard of andthat the next 10 years of american lifelook like wokes versus bitcoinmaximalist and bitcoin maximalist willbe a very diverse uh you know and youknowsocioeconomically diverse as well asgender and race uh racially diverseclass of individuals who all want totake personal sovereignty versus peoplewho are woke who want to captureauthoritarian structures and and usethem to enforce uh their idea of how theworld should be onto everybody else andyou can see these two things like branchout from occupy wall street likeeverybody comes together at occupy yousee where the problem is and what needsto be done about it and then they branchand it becomesyou know crypto anarchy if you want tocall it that and then it becomes uh wokeuh identitarian politics right and likejohn when you and robert were on withjordan peterson i read through all thecomments and that was a phenomenalepisode by the wayi read throughout the comments and a lotof the comments were saying this thingthat i totally agreed with uh not justbecause you guys are my friends butbecause i think you're both smart andyou're both right and you did a good joborange filling peterson in that episodeand the comments were saying basicallythese guys sound exactly likethe you know aoc socialist typesexcept forthey havewell thought out pragmatic solutions tothe problemsand i was like yeah that is very similarbecause both people were aligned atoccupywe both branched out and there's goingto be this moment wherethings clash again like when themillennial generation has power rightnow people just have sort of like socialmedia twitter power when people havereal powerthe clash will happenand i think that happens over the next10 years and we're going to seelike how that plays out and obviously ithink the other world view iskind of insane rightbutyou know it's anyone's guess how it howit plays i think this is part of thereason whyyou know the bitcoin culturequote-unquote and you knowmaximalism and that kind of stuff seemsto me to belike the initial stages the emergence ofi don't know if mythology is the rightword rob you can probably correct me onthis but like aa way to conceptualize andunderstand and see by and even embodywhat this thingislike that's what all these conversationsare and that's what all these argumentsare and that's what so that likeso that's an it's an apprehendable thingso that when thesestandoffs occur when people are decidingfor themselves likeyou know what kind of perspective shouldi construct what do i feel about thisand that what should be my highestvalues like how and and how they orientme and all that kind of stufflike i think the what's happening islike thatwhatever bitcoin is fostering somethingthat provides an answer to that questionmore easily and more easily as as daysgo by like maybe it will be a type ofmythology attached to that or maybe asecular type of mythology but like itneeds to be apprehendable right likepeopleneed something to grasp onto to orienttheir perspective andi guess part of my hope is thatyou know the more people that come inand the more people that digest it forthemselves and express it andcommunicatewhat it means or the angle that theythey have a particular degree of clarityonwill like feed that that process so thatso that peoplewell maybei don't know so people have moreoptions or or a broader perspective whenthey come to that fork in the road thatyou're just kind of alluding to whereit's likewhere they think it's a us against themor they think it's a separation i thinkyou knowbitcoin is uh has the capacity to be aunifier in that way ashasyou know formermyths and and heroes and stuff servethat purpose right you know the redeemeror the munifier that kind of thing likei think this is why we're we'renaturally drawn to these analogies withbitcoin and and you know myth andreligion and theology and stuff isbecauseit seems to be emerging you know andit's still so [ __ ] early i mean we're13 years into this it's crazy early andlook how much hashappened with it already and look howmuch meaning has been ascribed to itlook how it's beingunpacked and flourishing in the worldso i mean that gave me a tremendousamount of hope because likeobviously there's a ton of polarizationout there today and you know despite thefact that some loud idiots on twitteruh you know decrythe maximalists as being you know justhorriblepeopleuhi thinkthisalbeit sometimes messy process isplaying out that it'sit's providing people like somethingelse to graft onto that's not sopolarizing as you know asas weird as that may sound because likesome people can often think that thewhole you know that maximus ofmaximalism is very polarizing but as yousaid hollow like those comments in theyoutube video i haven't seen many ofthem but it kind of makes sense thatpeople are looking for something thatsynthesizes all these perspectives intosomething that's productive of ameaningful and a happy life and not justyou knowgetting you frustrated and amped up bybeing on one side and hoping that yourside winswellsynthesis is the key word you had thereand to me like because of what theinternet and how its function like ivery sincerely believe that that bitcoinhas synthesized some of the deepestprinciples of fascism and some of thedeepest principles of communism andsmashed them because like the leadershipof satoshi and the choice of 21 millionunits that was a unilateral decision bysatoshi that no one can change like thatis a purely fascist notion but in thesame way that all addresses all utxosare homogeneous and there is no way todifferentiate between them or the valueof them like that's a very extremecommunist position but when you smashthese two things together and recreateit it's a high gallium synthesis ofa thesis and an antithesis and the waythat they recombine to create somethingtotally newyou know and so it makes sense to methat when we talk we can havewe can say a lot of things that aregoing to appeal to aoc types and andbernie sanders supporters and also topeople that find themselves deeply onthe conservative side and might supporttrump for the ways that that they feltthat he resisted kind of the liberalglobal agendaso i i think what's going on and againthis is why this is all extremelypolitical because it breaks out of theclassicpolitics framework that we're sofamiliar with and delivers us somethingtruly political because it's not aboutthe the oscillation of party politicsanymore but it's aboutradically changing the structure of ourworld to serve us in a better mannerwhich is trulythe most political thing that existsi think it's important to note that wheni agree with you by the way but i thinkit's important to note that uh you knowcurrent politics uh are here and bitcoinexists here at a level above it's it'smetapoliticalyeah and that's that goeslike when john you're saying that we'reall struggling to apprehend this thingand uh you know it's it's rapidlycausing us to adapt ourselves indifferent waysi loveyou know this the idea of trying tounderstand the absolutefrom a position of the relativeand now this is like give me a minute tounpack this but i thinkthis is a deeper point that i've come toisit's almost like god right you have allthese books and wisdom traditions andwords pointing to thishigher ineffable realityumthat's that's words we're using relativewords to try to point to somethingthat's absoluteyou could think of the absolute as likea higher dimensionso the sphere does not exclude thecircle right circle's just 2d spacesomething's relative the sphere doesn'texclude it it transcends it butsimultaneously includes it right this islike getting into the platonic realm offorms right where you can seethis glassbut once you know it's a glass you likeincorporated it into intelligibility andyou can do a million thingssoi think thatyou know bitcoin obviously is anabsolute it's the only absolute we'veever created 21 million so we'veyou know i tried to analogize this tozero a little bit like you almosttouched the void in a way you get youtouchthat integral reality that you're alwaystrying to describe from the perspectiveof the relative but it's actuallyabsolute so the words neverdo it justice sowhat if bitcoin is essentially that likea platonic form of money which that'sbasically what we think it is right it'sthe perfect money can't be disrupted canbe copied can be replicated can't bechangedum and if it is that then like eric wasdescribing this unity of fascism andcommunismwell that would make perfect sensebecause bitcoin's the [ __ ]philosopher's stone it's the unity ofopposites it combines these differentthingsso it and then if that's true so it'sthe platonic form of money or it's thephilosopher's sound or some other crazybig ideaand there's a mythological echo thatemerges behind technological shifts inreality like how substantial is thismythological echo going to be it's goingtoreverberate through everything likesocially politically spirituallyfinancially philosophically maybe evenreligiouslythat thiswe're living in the beginning of thatpotentially yeahso we might be the crazy pioneers intothis new thing where people think ohthese guys have just joined a cult anddrink some weird kool-aid and now theyyou know talk about bitcoin a lotor this could actually be one of themost significanttechnological change in human historyyou know to the point where we would sayit all it was all about thisall right we've been talking about thephilosopher's stone for thousands ofyearsclearly like zero had a big impact onhow we organize ourselves leading toprinting press enlightenment all ofthese things calculussowhat if this is like the it's just thethe fruit of all of that bitcoin hasbeen like thepoint that's been the point i guessabsolutely no i mean like when we lookat that in the chain of historicism likethe development of crypto and how itneeded to have this highly advancedpowerful state to commitall of this research and development andfinally now that we're what i find sointeresting is about the way thatcryptography is functioning today like ii see it as this level thatuh like we're at the last god becauselike the promise of cryptography tonever be broken like it is a deliverableand possible promise and and rob i wouldeven say that that thisthis is really a platonic language likea it's a language of such extremeprecisionthat like we're no longer describingthings but we're actually saying theimmediacy of the proofor the truth that we state and thatcreates a totally different semanticfield where we're not trying to justunderstand the words but we know theimmediacy of the proof of the word whichwhich transforms language itselfentirely so it makes it so highresolution that we're no longer tryingto describe [ __ ] to each other but we'rejust making statements that's a greatpoint so yeah there's a symbol andthere's the referent right but bitcoinbrings them together like the map in theterritory all right i think gg signifiedyeah the sign and the signified by theway and that i don't think in that gapwhere all the [ __ ] occurs right infiat world it's where there's a promiseover here and the thing undelivered hereall the games that are played in betweenlike that's the problemthat's the liveswhich brings me full circle back to myoriginal thesis at crypto sovereigntyit'sauthority not truth creates legitimacyin fiat worldtruth not authority creates legitimacyin the real world what were you going tosayi was just gonna say like i don't thinkit can be overstated umhow important the concept of absolutescarcity is and i think rob's piecenumber zero like does a really good jobtrying to get to the heart of it buteven still that piece like barelyscratches the surface right because it'sjust such a foreign concept to havesomething that's widely distributed butabsolutely scarce it's so foreign itliterally doesn't exist in nature wedon't know about anything else that isthat that's how alien this substrate isand so yeah no no no wonder we lose our[ __ ] minds trying to figure it outevery guyit takes me back to that quote that thegreatest shortcoming of humanity is theinability to understand the exponentialfunctionso it's not only is it absolute but it'sissuance schedule is on exponentialdecay and that's why i just don't thinkwe get our head around how fast andpowerful it could happenthat's also why i think the the primaryfocus of everyone here should be onthemselves right like digesting thishow you you're engaging with this newnotion this new technology and how it'stransforming you because like it's soas you've just said it's so foreign andits impact is going to be so profoundand the exponential effects are going tobe so profoundi mean you can't suppose to impose orgraft ontoanybody else like what an understandingof this should be or the effect itshould have because you know you shouldbe almost fully engulfed by your ownattempt tointegrate it and understand it you knowand so i think that just goes back tothe fact that this is an individualrevolution and the transformations areindividual andwe can certainly mix it up with oneanother as we do because we're all justhere being like yo likewhat about this like did you considerthis and you could do this did this workfor you but ultimately like that'sthat's the rub here is that and likeanother step in theevolution or transformation of theindividual is underway and rob to yourpoint about uh you know like all ofhistory has kind of beenyou know coming to this crescendo as itwere or like this next big step up youknow you could you could say thatthe characteristics of property up untilnow have beennot only the the defining characteristicbut possibly even thethe primary motive for civilizationitself i meanthe earliest known records we have areproperty transactions right like goatsfor figs and all that kind of stuff insumeria and those tablets andbecause once property enters a picturewell now you have relative value and nowyou have something to protect and nowyou need someone to help you protect itand like andcivilization bloom from there once oncebasically we had agricultural surplusand then we had division of labor andthen we had more complex property boomcivilizations off to the races and thefact that property as you said earlierrob you never had like a pristinerelationship to your property it wasalways conditional in some way or italwaysyou know you required trust in order topreserve it in some capacityand to exchange it and all thata civil civilization was born aroundthat fact around that those attributesof property and now if we're suggestingthata form of property has entered thepicture thatis so you know different from anyprevious form of property such that itdoesn't require any of those things thatliterally became predicates forcivilization well what kind ofcivilization what kind of impact oncivilization does that have and that'swhat we're trying to figure out rightand that's what we'rewe're wrapped up in like that's the veryprocess that we're wrapped up in and andyou know the final thing i wanted to sayregarding your pointabout uh mythology anduhyou know eliatti's work is basicallylike wewhatever technological era we'reprimarily inwe don't it's not like it's consciousit seems like an aspect of ourconsciousness and how we relate to theworld is that we itit bubbles up within us to allow us toengage the technological socioeconomiclandscape that the that we're in rightso initially it was hunter-gatherer andthe mythology was about hunting and allthe different things that influencedhunting and then it became agriculturaland the mythology was about fertilityand plants and vegetal you knowmythology and then when we when themetals you know came into the scene thena lot of the mythology was you knowalchemical and had to do with metallurgyand you know that kind of stuffnowand you could make the case that ummaybe we're in an era now whereinformation is the the new frontier andso what kind of mythologyare we in the process of subconsciouslycontributing to or developing right nowand how much does does bitcoin do thatit's like each of these success oftechnological innovationbroadens the the landscape of theenvironment that we have to contend withand we need to graft a quote-unquotemythology a narrative way ofunderstanding that landscape in order tomost fruitfully engage it and ifyou knowi i think the agricultural revolutionand the the metals revolution and theindustrial revolution they were likethey were big step ups in terms of thethe environment that we have to contendwith the landscape of meaning let's saybut the information revolution where wewhere we can actuallycreate digital realmsat infinitumpresumably is the biggestexpansion of our consciousness thatwe've ever had and we are going to neednarrative to engage that landscapeoptimally andthere's a there's a pretty big aversionin the modern secular world to thenotion that mythology is quote unquotereal or narrative is real and necessaryin some waybuti don't see why it would play out anydifferently that this stage in ourtechnological evolution will necessitateandfostera narrative means to engage it mostoptimally whatever form that may take imean we're probably in the middle of itright now so it's very difficult to stepoutside of it and see itbutwhy would it happen any any differentlyi mean to me this is part of why i seethe messiah narrative so perfect likelike it overlays with satoshi and whathe did and how it was created and whatit gives to peopleso perfectly in my opinion towards thethis sort of biblical storyin addition to i get that like it feelscringy and people don't like talkingabout it but like when we make thecomparatives of what was given by bothand the possibility of what thataccesses humanity tolike it seems to [ __ ] lineyou know and likelike what's really important is like mywhole insane philosophical journeyhasn't been like like confirm what ibelieve con confirm you know it's beenlike i don't [ __ ] know but the more iread and the deeper i go the more italigns and likeyou know like this hiker shit's thehardest [ __ ] i've ever read and it's socomplicated and convoluted but god damnso many times the stuff aligns soimmediately and profoundly and the factthat he's talking abouta phenomenological event that he candescribe that aligns so deeply with whatbitcoin islike i'd i'll share some of this stuffwith you guys later but he talks aboutstuff about like how sovereign knowledgeis like the single thingthat once we like totally grasp it andallow for that to come into service forusthat that like transforms all ofhumanity in this really radical waywhich seems to be exactly what's goingon you know andand to me this is so radical andrevolutionary becauseit's humanity coming back into contactwith the truth of what ratio isand why we need that as people and whatthat delivers us to you know and it andit calls us to a higher duty as wellbecause like now now we realize thatlike nihilistic fiat world where nothingmatters isn't realand that that that's actually the falsesthingyou know it's interesting i'll i'll belike debating with people discussingideas with people or whatever and peoplego that's really interesting uhwhere did you get the article for thatit's like uhfrom my brain my dude i don't readarticles i just read the headlines iassume the article says some gibberishinside of it likewe're not doing articles man i don'tneed an articleit's just another person thinking foryou you know what i mean i trust myselfto to think for myself and you know viewreality the way i see fitthat's a hard concept for a lot ofpeople like really hardit is it is you know andi've been reading a [ __ ] ton lately andto your point eric like bitcoin justit's you have this lens you have thisthing in bitcoin and all the thingsyou've been thinking about it and thenyou you read this stuff and if youeither accept or canuh see past thehistoricity arguments of whatever themyth or religion or philosophy might beputting forward like it's so it jumpsoff the page you're like oh this is thisis likeexactly what they're talking about likebitcoin it just lines up perfectly withthis you know and so and i thinkto your almost to your point huddle likeit speaks toyou know we're always just kind ofthinking we're trying to figure out likeyou know what does all this mean i meansome of us other people just don't givea [ __ ] and they go about their their dayand you know they're notthey're not trying to push the bounds ofunderstanding or clarity or perspectiveor whatever butmany people do and if you run thatprogram long enough especially like ifyou you bump it up against likeand this is the other thing that i i'msuper critical of you know today on thesecular crowd it's like they so easilydismiss like so many amazing theologicaland religious thinkers of the past andlike they may bethey may not be perfectly right you knowone of the big thingsthat like the christian faith kind ofhangs her hat on is the historicity ofjesus right and like i my currentperspective on that isthat the myth is hyper real and it'salmost like the historicity of the manand this is like blasphemous to theextreme but it like doesn't matter asmuch as the reality ofof the mythumlost my train of thought well i couldjump in and say i agree with youutterly and totally on the importance ofthe hyper real you know this is this isnumbers right are numbers real or hyperreal right clearly they're very [ __ ]important without calculus we havenothing there's no technology basicallyat all no advanced technology soagain it's that that uhi think they also call this thenominologicalplane where we actually name stuff thedomain of logic rationalityversus empiricism right observation andexperienceso the way those two interact iskey to everything in our entireexistenceumi don't know if you can try to talk noyeah i found i it came back but likethat's kind of the point you run you'rerunning that program and and you come upagainst thesethese like hyper real notions and maybeyou don't have like a great frame ofreference for them in the past right butbitcoin seems to be that things thatthat thing that helps lock them intoplace you know by being almost you knowwe've touched on this before but almostbeing like a realmanifestation of a lot of those hyperreal notions or or philosophies ortruthsum and the comment about you know modernsecular people dismissing all that wasjust like i think there's preventprofound truth in themand as we continue to you know go downthis rabbit hole and try to properlycontextualize bitcoinit it pulls out the hyper reel from allof these stories like rob we're bothreading the history of uh religiousideas right now and that's basicallywhat eliade and neuman and peterson andjung and these guys have done likethey've they've looked for the hyperreal in all the world's you knowdifferent traditions and philosophiesand they tried to tease them outand againyeah yeah exactly or huxley anotherperennial philosophy awesomeum andi think the reason why we're like soenthusiastic here is becausewe're pursuing that we're seeing whatthese guys have said about pulling outthe hyper real from thefrom the mythological or from thenarrativeand we're seeing it representedin its highest form but also in thetangible interpersonalform in her world in the form of bitcoinandlike this is the back and forth betweenlike i think this is why we go to theheidegger's or the eliades and thepetersons or whatever becausewe're trying to see like because theymay very well have figured out a lot ofstuff about the hyper real in the pastthat now can begraphed on to bitcoin that can help usproperly contextualize or understandwhat bitcoin is and i think all of usare realizing or think we're realizingwe could be completely [ __ ]delusional but think we're realizingthat like yeah that's exactly what'shappening there's there's a lot of likehyperlinking going on from the hyperrealinsights of the past tothis currentquote-unquote technological phenomenonand it you know again like how couldthat not be mind-blowing because it'slike they're it's there in the fleshyou've you've seen that map right whereit's uh a brain on on psilocybin and theconnections are cleaner versus the brainwithout suiciding the connections arethe connections are chaotic to me ithink about that often as fiat versusbitcoin all right you know fiatevery dollar that's bouncing around theglobal economy is creating thesedistortions right and it makes it verydifficult to see what's actually goingon things are murky and as bitcoinbounces around the global economy it'spure signal so it sort of forms thislike sacred geometrical pattern whereyou get this like clear orderedhierarchy where things make sense andonce you have that you have anorganizing principle with which to makesense of the world right100that'sthat's iti would just saysorry just to throw in one thing downherepeople make fun of sailor about digitalenergy but i think it's exactly thishe's talking about connecting thedigital domain right the name of theknowing andmath and logic is that now being rootedinto physical realityso i thinkmaybe that term gets misconstrued in alot of different ways but we're sayingkind of the same thing right we'vethere's now a permanent connectionbetween the ideological space andthermodynamic space something like thatyeah yeah likecrazyyeah it's like a rift in space timebetween uh physical reality and digitalthe hyper real and yeah thequote-unquote real the materials well itlinks the the the the temporal spatialand the energy realm together in such awayyou know and and what's so [ __ ] weirdis that like paddle you're sayingearlier that we have a world that hashas no limits on anything and i'd saylike the only exception is subjectivetime we all have limited time and we'reall going to dieand so like with bitcoin being a clockthat's keeping track of time and thenlinking that to energy you know this isone of the other funny ones that i'vewanted to work on is i actually think atthe very bottom there's a reallyinteresting uh marxistanalysis of bitcoin to be made throughthe labor theory of value vis-a-visenergybecause like that's all it is it's justlike taking energy and then making theminto these units that can be distributedand so like it it's also very strangeand fascinating because likeithe the proof of work component i can'ti have such a hard time satoshi forseeing it going out this far andchanging things this radically and thisagain brings me back to like why i thinkthis was a divine revelation becausethere's just likethere's too many things in this that areperfect like thethe the sep 256 curve that was utilizedlike had all of these really interestingdiscretemethods to be able to utilizecryptography that were just unknownbefore it's just itit's really crazy that like it's justlike oh because like he he chose thisspecific curve we can now create thesenewcryptographic algorithms that like wedidn't haveany idea existed before it's [ __ ]crazytalk about mythology too i mean howcrazy is it that we still don't [ __ ]know who satoshi is and we probablynever will that's dude in this day andage with the pervasive surveillancestate there's an invisible fenceeverywhere you go i walk down the streetthere's nine uh [ __ ] doorbell camerasthat pick me upcome on mansatoshi is one of my favorite hide andseek champion of the worldit's amazingwell the fact that he did that in thisgap between you know 2004 where we hadall the technology that went intobitcoin and today we're like doing thisis totally impossibleyou know like it again again i'm justalways really overwhelmed that like thetiming was perfect the way he presentedit was perfect the way he had ran hisyou know forward secrecy was perfect andit's uhyeah it's so reassuring in so many waysyou know and uhbut you can you can easily see how howmythology develops right and how youcould easily project out how mythologywould develop around satoshi even thoughlike you know is satoshi the the kind ofthe character that received revelationanduh you know bitcoin itself is thethe instantiation of the word the logosyou know the messiah the christcharacter like you know i'm sure that'llbe played out many times butlikeit's going to be mythologizing you'regonna you're gonna look at satoshi'ssacrifice you know what what look atwhat he gave up in order to give this tothe world you're also going toinvestigatehis ethics i mean howhe obviouslyhad certain ethics that he held and thatbitcoin wouldn't have been right itwouldn't have been finished if it couldnot carry out these ethics and wediscussed them all the time right theethic of inviolability of truth of inthe incapacity for lying the you know ofand how that grants freedom like allthose things whether he was conscious ofthem or not had to come through him inhis intent when he was formulating thisthing and i mean of course myths aregoing to emerge around that you know ioften think abouti've been studying uh you know the bibleand christ and all that stuff a lotlatelyand i think it's rob you might be ableto correct me on this if i'm wrong but ithink likewell first of all the first image ofchristuhand it's somewhat spurious but let'sjust say the first image of christ was200 years after his supposed lifeyou know and and the recording of likethe the the bible in written formwas long after his his death as well youknow and so likethere's so much room foruh these things to take shape in theculture in response to what people thinkof this person and and how they felt andyou know we're gonna i don't know ithink the point is like we're gonna it'ssoripe for mythologizing because it's somysterious but it's also so powerful inwhat he did both in what he gave to ushis sacrifice what he imbued in hiscreation thatof course given the course of time we'regoing to mythologize about it we alreadydo in many cases when we all this artyou know story about satoshi and it'sonly been 13 years why don't you put 100years on that and see how people thinkabout how special it was that thisperson emerged at this time and get andgifted this thing to the world in theway he gifted it and what that mean andhow it can serve as an example for otherpeople in relation to how they sacrificehow they give their compassion theircommitment to certain ideals and valueslikeduh right it's gonna happenit's it's mind-blowing and iagain justit seems like the mythology could justconnect itself to alchemy it's itselfright so now all of a sudden satoshicould inherit maybe some of thatthat heritage wherethis thing this philosopher's stonewhich probably you guys probably heardme say this but likei'll say it again christianity basicallythought originally that we had finalredemptionin the spirit right christ died for oursins and that's it we're all goodand then a few hundred years go by andpeople looking around like hey there'sstill like poor people that aresuffering and dying and there's a lot ofdisease and terrible things in the worldlikeis this it this is the final redemptionand basicallyalchemy forked right forked and said nowe need to go into the material realmand find redemptionand carl you know peterson says this alot but he calls carl jung describedalchemy as the dream from which sciencewas bornsowhich is a way to say like we have toenact these mythologies that's kind oftheir their purpose in a way is theygive us a code of behaviorum like the example that petersoncommonly uses is how do you get aresearch scientist to look down amicroscope for 10 hours a dayright you can't get an animal to do thatthere has to be this imaginedthis ideal you're moving towards rightit's it's it takes place in theimagination even things like propertyrather we're saying earlier like that'san imaginary thing too right we all hadto pretend that we can't take eachother's [ __ ] to actually start nottaking each other's [ __ ]so there's thisand if you have kids like what do theydo they're constantly playing imaginaryso it's it's how we relate to the worldit's our it's one of our primaryi don't know perceptual structures iguessand so if bitcoin and again thephilosopher's stone was like the apexpursuit of alchemy the incorruptiblesubstance that would save the world fromtyranny it would unify oppositesumand so what you know what if bitcoin isa religionborn from computer science thenmaybe that is the unifier of science andreligion or contributes to it somehowi mean i just find it so interestingthat like everybody's so likethis being religious like we shouldn'tembrace it because i mean like it'sliterally [ __ ] magic like 12 goddamnwords that can like never ever becreated in that same orderand like all i have to do is is like usea random number generator like it's it's[ __ ] wild and i also think that likeas this mythology builds like thethe like looking back at the blockchainas like be like being like this bookthat like keeps information and you knowwhat people put into it like thethe cultural aspect that's gonna playout here is gonna be really exciting andcool umand and and we're already seeingcomponents of it that i'm reallyenjoying i i think we'vealready got a lot of pretty cool art andpretty interesting commentary going onsowell there's that i was going to mentionthis when john was talking aboutsecularism is that i think that tenetthat you were just talking about eric oflike dismissing theology mythologyreligion the the human religious impulsei think that's a tenet of secularism umlike i think secularism needs todiscount that in order for secularistreligion to flourish because if youthink about like simulation theorythat's just intelligent design for asecularist right or like white privilegeis original sin for secularists rightlike they have their own religion it'sjust their religiondemands this conceit in order for theirreligion to bubble to the surfacebecause they have kind of a weakpathetic religion for cucks and it can'tlike stand up to zeus or god or whateveryou know what i mean so they have todismissi love how you said that because it isreligious ultimately so every ism rightfascism communism statism these are allreligions ultimately they they're atleast religious in natureand umpeople you have to accept that but againour culture you know we use the wordmyth to mean falselike we're so out of touch with thatrealitythat um we're out of touch withourselves as a result because we don'tsee the religious impulse in ourselvesand what we attach that to in the worldwell i look i look around at the worldtoday and i see a god-shaped hole ineveryone's heart basically and they fillit they fill it with you know porn andweed and the joe rogan experiencepodcast and disney and the new marvelmovie and [ __ ] uh bitcoin and allsorts of [ __ ] right and like i guesswhat i'm saying is like of all thethings that are on the tableat least bitcoin has a lot ofoptionality for new space and we don'tyet know what it's going to be and it'svery exciting plus it's the onlyreligion that pays you you know all theother ones you have to pay to joinwell also like i look out into the worldand like like it would be different ifthere was like all these really happypeople who were like successful that youknow there was like aburgeoning middle class and likeeverybody on their own home and likepeople were like prettypretty happy and with it but i look outthere and like it's really far from thatyou know and so like i don'ti always find it so interesting thatsecularists are likeno like [ __ ] this idea of like infinitelove and goodness like it's just blackand dark all the way down and like i itotally get it like ilike that's what it looks like on thesurface i just feel lucky enough thatbetween bitcoin and psychedelics likei'vei've seen what i believe to beyou know my higher power and calling andthe way that it summons me and at theend of the day likeagain like i'm i'm a truth maximist i'mreally curiou because like what i seeabout bitcoin is that it offers allthese things and if i'm wrong likeplease tell me what my 12 words are likei want to know if i'm wrong and if youcan like guess them and if you can likecorrupt it or [ __ ] it up because likethat's what it's about for me and likeagain not to bring it back to [ __ ]coining but i see all these [ __ ] coinswho claim the same thing and then whenrubber hits the road it turns out thatlike they're not decentralized orsovereign or any of this other [ __ ]and for me that's part of the thecontentual model that i have witheverything else is thatbitcoin is so fundamentally differentfrom all the other [ __ ] going on andthat's really important for me toemphasize becausethere was no other first cryptocurrencythere is no other satoshi nakamotothere is no other currency thatguarantees and limitsutilizing proof of work and the sunkcost that goes into that as bitcoin theyjust aren't they don't exist and thoseare all very very very [ __ ] importantthings that if you can't speak toodeeply and at length on each one ofthose points you don't [ __ ]understand anything that's going on hereand frankly i believe you're a hucksterthat's trying to sell me some [ __ ]garbage that you can that you canoffload onto me so you can make fiatmoneythat like that's what my truth isyeah i want to comment on rob what yousaid about your daughter and then likethis theme that we've been working onabout like thethe current maybe secular era that we'rein andand the god-shaped pole in people'shearts but like as you say aboutyour daughter she's always imaginingthings she's playing out thesenarratives in her mind and what she'strying to do is see how much thenarrative matches her reality right ohthis this narrative allows me to engagethis well oh it itit failed me here i need to adjust thenarrative a little bit oh it failed mehere it failed me in this circumstanceright and she's constantly justnarrativizing all the the space thatshe's engaged in her environment to tryto figure out the best fit right andwhat the [ __ ] do you think religion isit's the enterprise it's doing that onthemaximum possible way it's saying okaywe're all here trying to figure out thebest fit what is the best fit now thatsays two things it says something aboutourselves but it also says somethingabout the hyper real right so it'salmost like we're drawingwe're always trying to push the map thatwe generatecloser on to the territory both thematerial and observable and theimmaterial and inobservable thatconsciousness is contending with rightand soto maximal fit and i think the thereally interesting part about that thatrelates to what we were saying before iseliatti's point about the agriculturaland the metal and the differenttechnological revolutionsis thatthose engagements with the material andthe innovations that come from them andthen spread dramatically change theenvironment that we're contending withso we have the agricultural revolutionthat emerges a new landscape from thehunter-gatherer and so this map thatwe're constantly using to try to engagein that has to dramatically changebecause nowthe the territory has dramaticallychangedthen when the metallurgical revolutionhappened the map has to change becausethe territory dramatically changed andso the map is the myth the map is thereligion right and so now we have thisdramatic expansion of the territory onceagain and sowe need a newway to fit to it and i think we may bein a period wherethat technological changecall it the industrial slash digitalrevolution which has been happening forlike the last 200 yearsyou have that schism in the early partsof that that transformation where an oldmap was was being used but a newterritory emerged and so you've gotpeople hanging onto the old map andyou've got people that have done awaywith the old map to engage in the newterritory but haven't properlyformulated a new map for the newterritory yet and itseems plausible to methat we're in the era or in the processof be of recognizing that we're in adramatically new territory once againseems to happen well maybe it'shappening more quickly now but you knowagainthe hunter gatherer the agricultural themetallurgical uh you know the printingpress maybe we might say are theindustrial and now now the digitalandwe're in that period where people havenot let go of the old map or they haveand they don't have a new one and sothere's there's all this wandering it'slike well how am i supposed to engage inthis space what are the system of valuesthat allow me to do so optimally whatshould i be pursuing what how do idetermine value in this new territoryand i don't think maybe we've developedthe proper internal map for that yetwhich is why we might be manifesting alot of the things we might be criticalof in thisglobal culture broadly speaking becausewe have this new technology and we'recontending with a new technologicalenvironment and all the possibility thatis represented in that but we don't knowhow to engage it and somaybe part of the way we're engaging itis building nuclear weapons and focusingonthings that ultimately are very littlemeaning but it's because we're kind offlying blind in a new territory andbitcoin seems to beat least part of the impetus orsomething that's allowing usor nudging us or like forcing us togenerate a new map for this newterritoryyeah no it so we as you keep13 years in right extremely earlybasically like the blink of an eye intosomething that could beforever for the rest of human historyum and this is justwe're we've been impacted this much theworld's been impacted this much by justthe emergence of bitcoin but there'sanother effect that occurs herepotentially which is the rug pulling ofthe nation stateright the collapse of the old map or theold imaginal structureand then people are going to be this the40 years in the desert people will justbe lost they won't have thisculturalstability or stable stability ofrelationship let's say to the world andthen you're forced into this what we'regoing through now i would say we'rereestablishing our philosophical anchorpoints that's what the bitcoin rabbithole is it's like hey everything youthought was real well it's all [ __ ]good luck figure it out and so that soyou're almost thrown back into being athree or four year old asking why rightwe're asking why asking why that's whywe're all philosophizing and readingheidegger and all this other crazy [ __ ]and just to like again for the skepticsout there because when i first startedlearning about mythology and narrative imean i'm like a finance accountingbackground i'm much more of a physicsscience math guy i thought it was allhorse [ __ ]butjust as one one example that reallylanded with me these imaginable worldsthat we create this to call it the worldof theoryit shapes how we interpret realityso for instancethe sun has been rising and setting foras long as humans have been on the earthfor a really [ __ ] long time wethought that sun was spinning around usright going around and around the earthand then finallyalong comes copernicus and says hey guysactually there's a perspectival shiftyou have to make here it's the sunthat's in the center and we're goingaround the sunso he introduced a new theorythat causes you to reinterpret all thedata right we've seen sunsets andsunrises forever everyone knew aboutthem it was open source if you willthere was nothing hidden about it butdue to a bad theory we had the oppositeinterpretation of realityso it's these theoretical structures canreally shape how you see the worldwell and when copernicus showed up andhe's like hey check out this new theorythey weren't like oh like great likethank you like let's integrate[ __ ] kill that guy burn his ass to deathand anybody else like [ __ ] burn themtoowell what i think is really cool is alsolike uhyou knowthe cultureyeah well i'm like what's really cool isthat like uh like thomas hobbs forexample he like hung out with like[ __ ] copernicus i think or maybe itwas galileo but like these people wholike were all like the baddies at thatpoint in time who were like on the edgeof all this stuff you know like alchemywas totally forbidden by the the churchto practice it and what i think is coolis that like all these guys wereactually likekind of seeing the same thing andgetting along with each other to likecreate the enlightenment which i thinkispretty similar which is what's happeningto a lot of us as we've all showed upand been like hey this is like thisbitcoin thing's pretty cool i likereally like how like i can't steal fromyou you're like i like that i can'tsteal from you too and i'm like whoalikehey like what else do you do you happento like to like make your own money andthink that like people stealing from yousuck you're like totallywhat maybe you should like uhcollaborate a little you knowyou don't like war eithereric is so right that like when you tieyourself to the masthead of truthuh usually they kill you right likegeorge george carlin has this thingwhere he's like if you're gonna tellpeople the truth you better make themlaugh because otherwise they'll [ __ ]kill youand then like 200 years later they gohey manyou remember that guy we killed and thenpeople were like yeah and it's like hehas some good ideas now that i'mthinking about itlike this this is what i [ __ ] hatewith the state and all their like likeall the martin luther king stampsmalcolm said i'm like you guys reallykilled him iyou know maybe black people should getlike the same opportunities as otherpeople yeah like it's like well why didyou guys kill him in the first place butwoah hang on that wasthat wasn't really us that wasyou knowlet's not talk about this anymore it'snot it doesn't make us feel good butthis you know this is whyi think i mentioned this on one of thesebefore but this is why all ofthese sorts of things are religion likewhat's gonna what may happen to bitcoinor people that are against the bitcoinagainst bitcoin like these are religiouspersecutions in the very way we justdescribed if we're saying thatthe lens through which we generate ourperspective or that map that thatnarrative map that helps us engagereality i mean that's the fundamentalcomponent of our world view right how wesee the world it's how we think wedetermine our behavioret cetera umif thatis it's likeif and so that's religious right that'skind of the idea of a religious story ifyou're saying that heylike i'm operating on a different mapnow from you like your map is shitty andit's creating all these [ __ ] problemsand suffering and all that garbage andi'm done with it and i'm i'm using adifferent map now and i'm seeing thingsdifferently and i'm interactingdifferently and all that kind of stuffwell then i mean again like that's areligious divide and the persecutionagainst you from the people who use thethe the group who use the dominant maplet's say or the map that's most widelyused they're going to have a problemwith that because you're attacking thevery means by which they understand andengagethemselves in the worldyou know and this is the kind of theidea of like the reintroduction of chaoslike you you have all these frameworksthat allow you tomake sense of the infinitude ofinformation and potentiality in theworld and distill it down into yourperspective that allows you toseek and meet your own endsand when much of that becomesdisintegrated or dissolved it'sincrediblylike uh terror it's terrifying right andthe the expectedwe should we shouldn't be surprised thatpart of the response is likeuh to attack the thing that's that'sgenerating that right that's making youfeel that wayalso think aboutoh god sorry i'm just going to say likei think a lot of us in in bitcoin landlike we've all gone through that to somedegree like i know a lot of us were kindofuh counter you knowcultural or or skeptical beforehand butlike you still have to go through thatprocess of and having the the couragelike that's why courage is such animportant component this is kind of theanalogy to psychedelics as well likewhen you have that ego death moment in ayou know like a hardcore psychedelicexperiencethe impulse is to be just freaked the[ __ ] out because who who are you withoutall those different things that youattach to yourself toto be a person in the world and if youyou need at least to some degree in myopinion an element of courage to saylikei don't know who i am anymore in thismoment but i i have like a a seed oftruth that i'm hanging on to whetherit's like you know that your fundamentalenergy or spirit or whether it's youknow this thing in bitcoin that i'musing and i'm reconstructing things fromthere i'm going to reconstruct myconception of myself i'm going toreconstruct my worldview my perceptionwith that brain that i think is a highertruth than what was generating myperspective before andthat takes courage and that takesdedication and commitment and this isthealchemical process right this is thetransformation that we often allude toand bitcoiners are seem to me to be verywell on that journey and what it'sgenerating iswe would assert a a perspective that'smore grounded in truth and also probablyyou know in values that are moreuhvalidlyhierarchically umarrangedbut to anyone who hasn't done that andwho's just still holding on tothe previous world view and i and iwould say one that's far lessconsciously derived or constructedthey're gonna think you're crazy you'rean enemy you're a psychopath you'redangerous all those things which is whywe often kill our heroes right and onlylook back and once that new world viewhas had a chance to sweep through morepeople over the course of hundreds ofyears oftentimes then it's like obviousand you wonder how those people couldhave been so crazy to like you know burncopernicus at the stake likewere were they [ __ ] or somethingit's like no they just they were in acompletely different world view and hewastoo divergent you know he was one of theearly ones and he got caughthe what he didn't make him laughright exactlyhe should have been like hey crazy thingyou guys never gonna believe this[ __ ] the sun's at the center of thesolar system i know i knowyou know that's why i lovejp sears rob who you had open for you inmiami because you knowhe says allgreat stuff and he points out thecraziness and he you know he's clearlyoperating from a perspective that holdsfreedom and truth and very high regardbut he does it in a way that's comicaland so he gets away with you know beingthe joker as as peterson often alludesto where he you know he's the only onethat can go up to the king and be likeyeah you're a crazy [ __ ] and you'redestroying the world and like everybodyhates youbecause you know that's your role as thejoker and what it allows is like thelittle bits of truth to squeak throughwithout being you know completelyhammered out of existenceon how you started how you startedtalking john you said you grasp ontothis seed of truththe idea that's like your bitcoin seedand like that's the form of truth thatyou're like rebuilding logic onthere you gothere you goi uhi sometimes think about you know i iunderstand like people feel like they'rebeing persecuted by bitcoin and i ithink even like us as bitcoin acolyteshave to admit that uhwe have been punished by bitcoineternally for dismissing bitcoin earlywhen we first heard about it you knowwhat i mean like i know that i had heardabout bitcoin in 2011 and i was like ahnerd money for nerds didn't even lookinto it do you know how muchlike i cost myself and futuregenerations by just being kind of anarrogant dicka lot a lot man and luckily i coursecorrected pretty early but like thelonger you go before that i mean bitcoinhas existed in the world for 13 yearsright so the longer you go before thatcourse correction takes placethe more accumulated painright and is that not a form of judgmentis that not yeah the very distillationof truth and freedom judging you for notconforming to it or not understanding itor not engaging it in some waywell you're like the hardest on yourselfabout it too you're like i like knew andi like felt it and people like no it'slike okay and you're like no god damn itit's not okayi would likei'm gonna try to speculate aboutsomething here because i want to try andconnect whypeople lose their [ __ ] mind rightyou're connected into this hierarchyvia your identity but the wholehierarchy isimagined and sowhen someone like copernicus comes alongit's like heyyour [ __ ] hierarchy's wrongall the ego self-defense goes intoengagement and there's too much of thatyou get burned at stake right soandthat's connected to the changes intechnology clearlyso what i'm trying to do is tease outthe connection betweenthat the height the hierarchy why is itwe have these mythological echoes behindtechnological revolutions and i thinkit's it's allcomes down to powerin the sense of the physics sense ofenergy across time right all of thesetechnologies are changing the way wemove energy across timeand we know too that the more power thisis like the lowry thesis to some extentbut the power projection thesis rightit's also the kardashev scale the moreenergy a civilization harnesses the morecivilized it becomesso and that's another way of saying themore energy we can harness that's wealthright it's equivalent to wealth becauseif you have cheap energy you can doanything create goods and services etcetcso what weare trying to do in this humanenterprise from a physics perspective isto create systemsthat can tolerate more powerprojection or or power storage perhapsyou know to harness more energyultimatelyandthe systems historically like thatphysical powergets translated into political powerobviously whoever's pulling the theleversand there's corrupt you knowcorruption's always been a problem therebecause once you have a lot of politicalpoweryou'reyou're incentivized to behave in yourown interests at the expense of othersand you know central banks and all thisthat's basically what it issothe way i think about this is like okaywhat's the common thread there iswe need systems with really strongstructural integrityso this even at the individual levellike to be really moral right to bemarcus aurelius he has structuralintegrity and that you could vest a lotof political power in one individual andhe wouldn't be corrupt or he wouldn'tbend been things in his own favor forinstancechristianity right like again related tomorality that there's if you geteveryone behaving and ispulling in one direction that there's astructural integrity or unity amongstthe groupsteel right steel has strong structuralintegrity you can put a lot of weight onit build skyscrapersthe skyscrapers have to be built onbedrock which has a lot of structuralintegritygold had a structural integrity and thatwas predictable across time so we couldstore a lot of wealth and energy in itand then bitcoin would be like theultimatethe most structurally integratedhuman construct eversomething like that andthe like cinematic thing i have if youif you guys have seen guardian of thegalaxyyou know where at the end the first onewherethe main character star-lord i thinkgrabs the purple stone and it's likeoverwhelming him it's about to destroyhis body and then he getshe holds hands with one of the otherguardians of the galaxy and she takessome of the burdenand then the other one joins hands andfinally they all four join hands andthey get tolerated togetherso like inin concert they had more structuralintegrity as a group to harness morepowerand it seems like that's what we've beentrying to create in all of our systemsit's like how do we get the multiplicityinside of one unityin a very structurally integrated waythat we can just harness as much energyas possible and become as wealthy aspossibleand the best one we've had so far wasamerica right we had the decentralizedgovernmentgold standard all these things grantedit's avery messed up and corrupt humanenterprise and experience stillbut bitcoin might be you know the nextstep change in that direction somethingthat you know is more american in spiritthan than even the us constitution bythe way and there's like there's a truthand a lie there where like the truth isthat we're structurally uhinterdependent on one another true thelie is that we need intermittentintermediaries between us to determinethe nature of that relationship rightand so the more you can strip that awaythe closer you get to the truism of thestructurewell to like beto be fair like up until the internetlike and it's like yeah like you need tohave these third-party institutions it'simportant which i think is one of thebig schisms we have with whyuh like digital immigrants with us beingdigital natives will always be foreignhere and why we're coming to this sharppoliticaldemarcation that is essentially betweenlike the old who don't understand theinternet and the first generation ofdigital natives who understand that likethis is the grounding foundation for atotally new and more civilizedcivilizationand that the internet now allows for usto interact in a peer-to-peer way usingadvanced cryptography in order to ensureand prove the privacy and secrecy of itlike i'm always amazed at how often uhlike i end up doing tech support forolder people around meand how much they literally don'tunderstand the logical functions of acomputeror or that it can be trusted to followthose logical functionsthey don't have the appropriate mentalmodel we used to have to my grandfatherwas a navigator during world war iiuh flew combat missions and everythinghe had a checklist for his computer likelike you would for a flight protocolright and he was like first this thenthis then this but he never could wraphis uh brain around the graphical userinterface right like it just didn't makeany sense to him because he had comefrom a different world and that's theother thing is like we have so manyoctogenarians running oursociety um you know in large degree thatwas the covid responses because theywere the most susceptible population andthey had the most powerand so they forced us onto this onetop-down centralized solution that likedidn't make sense for the vast majorityof us but it did make sense if you werethemand so yeah i think a lot of thattension comes from you know the thepeople who want to shake their fist atthe internet basicallyyou know that's a great example actuallybecause a lot of what we're seeing hereis what we've tried to say a lot ofthings is humans sort of reflect theirtechnological realities and like thatwhat you just said that's an example ofthat in your own life like you can see aguy that's from a differentmythological echo from a differenttechnological realmright trying to cope with the new onethat we're just we're native towell one other thing i think it's sointeresting isthe egotistical aspect is that likelike when something's not working on thecomputer i get like it's [ __ ] brokenthere's but like i can i can work my waythrough it and it's not like a personalthing towards mewhereas so often i'll run into theseolder people that they get like really[ __ ] mad they're like no like i ityped my password in with no caps andit's like look i get you feel that waythey're like no it's it's the [ __ ]truth and it's likeyeah well anyways the computer believesthat there is a capitalized word inthere so let's just do that to like moveforward and meanwhile they're likescreening about the whole thing and ithink part of it is is you can't humbleyourself before the technology whichlike is kind of a prerequisite ofbitcoin to be able to say hey i don'tnecessarily understand this and i needtoallow for myself to be humbled enough tolook at it andbe able to move forward with it fromthat by the way that that sameinteraction with my grandfather he gaveme one of the greatest compliments andgreatest insults of my life back to backhe was like you know what during worldwar ii you would have been a hell of afighter pilot back when it was all gutsand glory i was like what about nowgrandpa and he was like now it's allcomputers and math you gotta be smartyou gotta be smart nowbut you know the rob the the point youmade there aboutdifferent people like differentgenerations basically engaging indifferent reality and that being soultimately divisive because it's noteven like they're wrong like we wouldall be super critical about what thoseoctogenarians have done and continue todobut like the more you know in thesecases where you spend time with maybeyour grandfather or whomever like youyou can kind of appreciate theperspective they're coming from i thinkthis somewhat speaks tothe importance that that has been placedon the unifying power of the broadestmapright so like if we can agree on thebroadest map then we create lessdivision based on our circumstances ourage you know the environments we'regauging and engaging in uh you know andthat sort of thing and i thinkthat's been that's part of the problemwe have today is is and and one of thethings i wanted to follow up on rob onyour analogy to umguardians of the galaxy first of allgreat analogy i love how you used uhstar-lord as his name but uhyou knowthe the fact that it's almost likemany many philosophers and historianshave said something to the effect thatwe've reached the height of technologyin the modern world without the likemoral capacity to deal with itresponsibly right and that's kind ofwhat you're saying it's like if you'regoing if you're if your materialinnovation is going to conjure up ordevelop increasinglyit's going to increase your ability togenerate andand harness poweryour the the thing that determineswhether or not that's going to destroyyou or or lift you upisthe moral refinement of each individualright and so in the movie it's like youknow those were all the good guys andthey were friends and they had eachother's backs and like them joininghands allowed them to you know harnessthat that power productivelyand i again i think this is why thethe myths or the stories that that helpus engage in the moral dimension of lifeare indispensable because absent them welack not only the the individualintegrity as we're saying about like youknow each of our actions determining howto use thatbutin conjunction with one another beingable tofigure out what we're going to do withit which way we're going to go like andi i see this today you know like one ofthe things that i think about a lot isthe idea of progress and and we all justthink like well progress is like starbases on mars right like obviously likethat's the height of technologicalinnovation that's what we're all goingforit's like well why is that de facto kindof like the the understood to be secularprogress like what iflike again this goes back to ourperspective like what if our perspectivewas better grounded in what is moremeaningful and more true and itgenerated a different aspiration interms of progress or what we might bedevoting our scarceresources and energy to you know and asit becomes more abundant what are wegoing to try to amplify we're going tojust just try to amplify the complexcomplexification of the material worldand push out that aspect of ourselves ormight there be other means of harnessingor directing our ability to harnessenergy toward something else and youknow it might be the case thatwe're off track today and all thisenergy that we're able to harnessnotwithstanding that would you knowthere seems to be like alittle war against energy at the momentbut by and large you know like ourincreasing innovation and ability togenerate and harness energywhat if we're devoting it to things thatultimately lead to our own demise ratherthan our own flourishing and the finalthing i wanted to ask you robin your i didn't catch it all the timebut your thing with peterson in miamihe actually you're talking about storeof value and he said somethinginteresting and he said something to theeffect that you know your character isyour primary store of value and what youwere saying about being able to harnesspower and you know marcus aurelius beingyou knowso integrated that he was capable ofharnessing and holding and not abusingthat powermade me think of it um but i'm wonderingwhat what your thoughts on thatstatement from him are or were whetheryou picked it up at the time or havethought about it sinceyeah i mean i i wasinspired to say that by something he hadmentioned a long time ago one of hispodcasts which was he said thatreputation was the original store ofvalue so when we're we're hunters andgatherersone day i kill a mammoth you know youdon'ti can't eat the mammoth so i share thefood with you and then in the hopes thatnext time you'll reciprocateso that was like the this original kindof credit transaction wasyou know an original store valueand i mean there's something to thatit's maybe the analogy's a little loosebecause even store of valuei'm starting to not like that term somuch because how can you you can'treally storevaluevalue's a whole rabbit hole i think wecould just you knowlet's skip so what i would like to saythough isthe[Music]this idea that connection points matterto structural integrity so if we arethisanimal that's trying to project moreenergy across time which is the samething as harnessing more poweri don't like how this term power getspolluted with the political all the timei think peterson uses it that way almostexclusivelyumthe stronger those connections becomeright between theconstituent elements of whatever it isyour moral framework your your steelbeam that's what gives it structuralintegrity it's the strength ofconnectionand so we if we're talking about theimaginal space that humans operate init's what you just said john it's thecommon map right the more common our mapthe stronger our bonds arewhich is another way of saying maybe thelowerthe more cheap it is to establish trustright if we're both christians and ourparents have known each other for a longtime like we have very common maps so bevery easy for us to do business togetheror whatever and it's not justchristianity that does that but anycommon map any common cultural valuesystemand soyou know we're in this weirdsituation as humans that thatthere seems like we're constantly againstretching out that imaginal structureand then it's breaking down right theretends to be corruption or failure insome respects we break downthe technology is also changing underfoot all the time so there's this likereally dynamicthing happening that we're likebootstrapping ourselves intocivilizationand so we end up with this weird there'sthis great quotethat says the main problem withhumans today is that we have paleolithicemotionsprimeval institutions and god-liketechnologyso we likewe really are like we're changing sorapidly as a result of both the imaginalchanges and the technological changesand thenyou know but but the i think i get thepoint i guess i was trying to sayearlier is that you can't stop thati think nietzsche was right about a willto powerbut you have to understand power in thestrictly physical sense like you to evenbe alive is to move energy across timeright my metabolism is operating rightnow i'm thinking i i am power like poweris coursing through you to be aliveso the organism itself does have a willto power it's trying to live it's thesame thing as saying like a will tovitality or something like thatand so we understand that that is thefundamental pattern of natureand that it's structural integrity thatgives us the greatest capacity toharness the most power possible which isto be as wealthy as possiblethen we should really focus on makingthe connections strongand there's nothing like again back tobitcoin being this rip through space andtime that's connecting time and energyin some perfect platonic formphilosopher's stone waythat's what it is it's like the ultimateconnection betweenasingle unifying form with a multiplicityof peopleyeah i mean that map is language rightlikeand that's why we needed a new languagein order to establish value around sothat like we have such a high focusedand pristine mapthat when we're trying totalk it with each other that there is nodoubt at all about what is beingexchanged between each other yesyeah there's a norbert weiner thecybernetics guy this one's been hauntingme lately he describedorganisms as messagesso if you start to think about it thatway thatthe information that moves throughbitcoin is true right and then it movesthrough you you're a message your dnayou're you have this organic block chainstretching back into the dim mist ofhistory like that could be theexperience thethe veracity of the messaging systemthat is bitcoin propagating through themessaging system that is societyhave you guys ever seen the way that uhants cross a narrow stream of waterthey create a bridgethat's made out of the dead bodies ofother antsright so likein a sense like all human innovationtracks this sort of parallel where likemost of it is just pure failure andnobody's finding successful adaptationsand those so those are the dead bodiesof all the ants and that's the mask thatmakes up humanity and most people areyou know one of the ants that getstrampled underfoot and then eventuallyyou get a copernicus or satoshi orsomebody who gets to walk across thebridge because there's been enoughaccumulated bodies basically you haveenough evidence of what doesn't does anddoesn't work so it's like eachindividual life is a message you knowdarwinian selectionor variation in selection right throwingspaghetti at the wall to see what stickswas was the point you were just makingthattheintegrity or strength of thoseconnective dots that connect the tissuebetweeneither ideas or people or constituentparts of a systemis what determinespower in a sensewell i think the strongerthe stronger the so i just take it backto propertyright property is the the integrity ofmy the relationship between me and thethings that i create right or justlyacquireif i have a really strong bond right itcan't be taxed can't be confiscatedthen that lets the system hold morecollective power right which is anotherway ofshifting away from taking it towardsmaking rightthis isuh stronger property rights let usgenerate more wealthso i guess i'm just trying to put aphysics lens on basically the divisionof labor right we know if you havestrong property rights we get morewealthywell what does that mean that means thewhole system is harnessing more energyright we're moving more energy acrossspace and time to produce more goods andservicesdue to the structural integrity of theconnections right which are rightproperties between man and naturebasically yeah and and that idea of thestructural integrity between connectionsyou know made me think of like wellyou know what is the the strongestconnection and if wego out of the physical realm for amoment and go into like thephilosophical orreligious or emotional i think it'soften been asserted that love is thestrongest connection right it's thething that doesn't necessarilydistinguish it's such a strongconnection that it doesn't distinguishbetween the two constituent parts of theconnection and considers them a wholelet's say it's a recognition of a lackof separation and you know you see it ina religious story love god or jesus orwhomever with all thy heartuh and i thinkand and and love being the highest poweras well love being represent likesomehow in a way that we we can onlypartially perhaps understand that thatbeing the highest power and that's whywhat you said regarding power and thestrength of connectionsmade me think of it but i have alsobefore you know thought about bitcoin inthe same way before and that the theparts that make up bitcoin allow forthese connections between the differentpoints in its matrix the different nodesthe different you know users hobblers inthe system and by virtue of treatingeveryone the same and not distinguishingor not advantaging one versus another inbothhow the system operates for them or inthe way that their messages are aretransmitted it would seem to establishrelationshipsthatthat almost don't uhrecognize a separation in a certainsense at least a separation in value oror idealum and imaybe there's some relation there ofwhy that allows the system toretain or harness or or useso much quote-unquote power in a sensebut maybe both in the physical and inthe uh metaphysicallove is such a strange one to me and istruggle with it still butlike i listen to your conversations withbraveheart when he describes it i thinkhe describes as like right relation orproper relationumandyou know it'slike you almost think like everythingwe're describinguma couple of ways to say it maybe it'sall darwinian right so everything isvariation and selectioneverything's affecting everything elseanother when i visualize it's hard toarticulate but when i see this visuallyit's like everything is liquidright everything influences everythingelse uh to some extent solove seems to be like establishing theproper relationin thatthat'sthat space i supposeumbut it's also the unifier of oppositeswhich i think is like again back to thephilosopher's stonelove is what brings together masculineand feminine energy for instancelike men and womenprobably wouldn't want much to do witheach other if it weren't for loveit's also maybe treating the other asyourself too right like that emerges inrightthatromantic love fruits up into agape rightselfless loveand then that is like we seem tochristianity wanted to take that form oflove the highest form of love the parentthe love that a parent has for theirchildand almost try to incorporate that intothe mythological structure rightlove your neighbor treat your neighboras yourself do not lie all these thingschrist saidit was again trying to create pretendinto existence a mythological systemthat has high structural integrityby virtue of honesty and love right likeright relationhonest propagation of messageumyeahand i thinkyou can say that the reason why that wassticky and the reason why bitcoin issticky and works to a certain degreeis because not those aren't just niceideas that would be great if we couldorganize ourselvesaround them but they're actually true inthis metaphysical sense that we've beenjust you know exploring becauseotherwise they wouldn't work otherwisethat wouldn't be the optimal means onwhich toorganize ourselves and we wouldn't evenbe able to determinehow optimal they are right but the factthat they've proven to beover and over and over again as it'sbeen recapitulated you know inprehistory for sure but certainly sincerecorded historyit's saying something aboutall of this that we're engaging in yesandyou know perhaps even more instructiveis the 20th century when we deviate fromthose principles rightwe don't need god anymore throw out godput in gov we don't need property likewhat happens to the system thenutter like you can't imagine more evilthan in the 20th century like it'spretty hard yeah it's the ultimate it'sthe ultimate disintegration like we'vebeen exploring this concept ofintegration it's the ultimatedisintegrating ofthe values or principles that are mostconducive to propagating a flourishing aloving a trustinga prosperousculture community individual et ceterawell and the 20th century wasn't justlike it wasn't just like oh like we likelost these things that unified like thethe abandonment of those things createdso many more magnitudes of thepossibilities of horrors that like justweren'taccessible before you know like the kindof total war that was demonstrated inworld war one world war ii was so muchmore extreme than anything before andthat [ __ ] only gets produced when we hadthese full abandonment of values andstarted to replace the institutions ofyou know as you said god with govand and i think that underlines howextreme it is that we need theseprinciples of love and care and helpingeach other because if we don't have thatwe like get this other thing that'sreally nastyi've been thinking a lot about the 20thcentury and some you know sort of thenietzschean prediction of chaos thatcame to fruition like rob was talkingabout but then also likeour childhoods in the 90s like that thatwas thethat was the culmination that was thezenith of that mental model and we weresort of born into it and so it allseemed normal to us and thenit like 9 11 happens and basically likeit just slowly disintegrates and i thinkwe have just kind ofthat was the peak right and uh i don'tknow where we are now but certainlywe're in a much more degraded state thanwhat it was in the 90s because it justcouldn't sustainfor whatever reasonlike berlinthe 90s were so [ __ ] awesome but it'sprobably just because i was like a 10year old and there was because ofgunshots super soakers and gushingushers made it awesomesuper nintendo i meani think the soviet union collapsed thenwas pretty importantright i think we have to recognize toolike you know anyone listening to thisis going to say the same and i totallyagree thati mean we had an abundance ofsupposedly religion and god all up tothe 19th century let's say and a lot of[ __ ] up [ __ ] happened even a lot of[ __ ] up [ __ ] in the name of right soclearlythere was some like it's not all roseswe're not just trying to say hey let'sbring back the same thing that we hadgoing on then and everything will befine likethings were majorly [ __ ] up even ifthey wereinitiated or predicated ona good idea or good principles orengaging a necessary component of ourconsciousnessin a otherwisein the best way possible let's say imeanit has it seemingly has been corruptedand hasbrought about a lot of things that ithink we'd all be fairly critical of youknow so i think part of our task inthese conversations and being alive inwhatever era we might however we mightdescribe this era that we're inand i don't want to like you knowpresume too much importance on any ofour contributions here butcollectively we are kind oftrying to determine a newi don'tmythology is the wrong word because ithink that's it's got a lot of baggageand uhit may not be proper but we're we'retrying toformulatea more pristine or more high fidelitymaplike that's that's our task and the thefaith is that if we can do thatwe will minimize the suffering thatpeople have to experience and we willmaximize the meaning and the flourishingthat we have available to us that's theenterprise andwho knows if we're on the right trackmaybe we're headed towards you know thethe edge of the waterfall we're goingover but it certainly seemsand and maybe you know who how do weknow that it wasn't the case in the pastthatthe these ideas coming together in theform of the mythological hero beingchrist or any other one wassimilarly revelatory perhaps not as muchbecause as we've discussed already likebitcoin has bridged the gap from themetaphysical to the physical in amind-blowing and possibly you knowunprecedented waybut it could still be the case thatthoserelprimitives not the right word butthose people that were contending with adifferent environment when a certain setof values and principles and ideas cameto coalesce and they felt that it mappedon to the metaphysical better thananything that they've everhad held in their consciousnessi'm sure you know i could i couldappreciate if it was revelatory theywere like super excited about it becauselike wow we hacked reality a little bitwe figuredmaybe we figured something a grandertruth out and that's going to enable usto live these more prosperous andmeaningful lives that that we wantum that could very well be the case butit went off the rails obviously to somedegree at leastuheven though we might we might assertthat for all of its faults it would bemaybe we'd be better off if we still hada more religious rather than secularsociety you know in parts of the worldtoday but anyways point being thatumbitcoin just seems tobe the likethat's the thing that's going tocapitulate or contribute to theconstructionof the next map that allows us to saveourselves allows us to not destroyourselves and lead us in a directionwhere we were able to you know to thepoint eric we were discussing earlierlike we both havethe good and evil right runs downthrough all of our hearts it'll tilt ustoward the good it'll allow us toextract more of the good than the eviland that might be ourour redemption that might allow us tosurvive rather than kill ourselves andthat's you know that's the eternal gamethat we play perhapsyeah the um just to maybe tie this into what we just said about the 90s likeall right so we knowprinting money is the violation ofproperty right so it's if we're printingmoney we're corroding the structuralintegrity that property gives us incivilizationbut we also know that it's stimulativeearly on right you kind of you're kindof like eating the seed corn so to speakwhen you prep money so you can it cancreate these economic booms in the shortrun but it causes misallocation ofcapital in the long run so it'sself-defeating so what if like just this1970 to 2001 periodwas just the going off gold boom rightwe finallyuntethered ourselves from hard money wehad a 30-year party and the firstsnap of that artificial bubble was 2001we saw another one in 2008 now we hadone in 2020um so you have that force that's sort ofdisunifying or disintegratingthe structural integrityof the world and the us morespecificallyuh and i guess there the other elementthere would bei think christianity is like helpinghold it togetherright when i see when i look at the usthe same placesare more traditional value basically sothere's more integrity there and i thinkthey lend that integrity to the whole ofthe nation's seedso there's these different forces righttrying to disintegrate and unify at thesame timeand yeah you throw bitcoin in the middleof it it's just like the ultimateeconomic singularity andwho knows what happens and i thinkthat's part of the function oftraditional values however they'recultivated or maintained it's like whenchaos emergesyou retreat to the things that are timetested for the longest right like allthis new progressive social justicephilosophywhatever merit it might have it hasn'tbeen around very long right so like whenwhen thewhen chaos reemerges you go back tobeing like well what are the things thatare more in my control what are thethings that have encountered chaos timeand time again and have seen peoplethrough it you know and and maybe it'snotit's not the total answer to the nextstage but it would certainly seem to bethe case and i see this a lot amongstbitcoiners andyou know as you mentioned likechristians in the us and stuff thatyou're kind of retreatingthere's there's too much chaos so you'reretreating back to those things that youcan have a far higher degree ofcertainty and confidence in and you'relikeyou're figuring that out you're you'rehanging out there while you figure outhow to recapitulate and rebuild andperhaps more capably confrontthe new form of chaos that is on thehorizon but i think that's part of thefunction of oftraditional ways of life and traditiongenerally it's likewe've been here beforethese thingshelp you get through those times whenyou know the monster of the dragon ofchaos reemergesandthe people thatrecognize that and do that i think arethe you know have a far better chance ofseeing themselves through it you knowproductively and then the onesultimately disintegrated like badly andwe're seeing that all over the [ __ ]place todayand i think this is again intrinsic tonature it's how a slime mold grows rightit kind of shoots these little offshootsat the edgesthe ones that succeed succeed the onesthat die die if there's a time ofparticular bad or starvation it'llretreat back to its core to its olderfoundations you do that when you fastright you stop eating your body likegets rid of all the detritus anythingthateverything is jettisoned off the ship soto speakso that'si mean it makes sense that it would itwould play out like thatyeah well even in a in a broader scale imeani can't think of anything thatexclusively grows without consolidationyou know like if you look at like plantsand fungi and on time lapses and stuffthere's always this likebeat you know unstable consolidationundulationyeah yeah and so you know maybe all thethings we complain about i don't thinkyou want to give up on the enterprise inin consolidating properly and shorteningmaybe the consolidation time becausemaybe consolidation as it's felt byhuman beings is is turmoil and isdifficult but you know we shouldn't wantto not we shouldn't be hoping that itdoesn't exist right because perhaps it'sthe case thatthat's how that's how things get builtright foundations getolder foundations get further firmed upthrough each successive round ofconsolidation and this is the enterpriseofbecoming whatever it is our potential isuhimpelling us to become or or what we'reaspiring to beand that's where i think maybe thepurpose of evil lives actually it's kindof a weird term but it's kind of likequality assurance testing for the goodright like we're trying to create goodthings but then you enable inevitablycreate something that does can'twithstand one evil guy or girl or guysand girls and so they try to attackthe structure right and the structurehas to prove itself across time tobecome one of theseyou know time-testedtimeless uh lindyeffect approvedthings to fall back onyeah andone of the things you know this is oneof the things i've been grappling withlately becauseyou know and again this will trigger alot of people butchristianity's had like a good run rightlet's sayalmost 2 000 years but as we've beenexploring if thesemythological maps or these metaphysicalmaps really aredetermined by theimperatives of our the environment thatwe're engaging in and the innovationtaking place and the possibilities thatit representswe've kind of been dancing around thisidea that a new new map is required oris currently being uh capitulated orformed in some waybut still like that that notion ofthe hero is the one thatit balances the stultification of formerorder with theboth threat and potential of chaos rightthis is like classic peterson and thatseems to beeternally trueright so the question in my mind ishow is that being recapitulated in thisenvironment i mean i think we would allagree that bitcoin has a lot of thecharacteristics to provide an answer tothat questionbutyou know when we when we discuss likehow this evolution takes place like thatone seems to nail ityou need order you need order toconfront the chaos but and order allowsyou to do that it allows you to be safeit allows you to be comfortable butthere's a there's a enticement tooveremphasize the order and allow it tobecome pathological or to stultify insome way and so you need a revivifyingforce that balancesthe necessity for the orderbut the potential that lies within thechaos but of coursenext to the potential in the chaos isthreat ever present and so the the mostimportantidea is the thing that properly mediatesbetween the two and part of the functionof mythological or religious storyis not just giving you a set of you knowan articulated value hierarchy to sayhey likethat you know truth and freedom and loveand these things meditate on them andmaybe you'll come to an answer it'sit's kind of showing it's an embodiedversion of of how that mediating forcecan act in the worldand i think that's at least partiallythe power ofof uh christ in in the christiantraditionand i you know like iit seems like things need updatingbutthat that aspect of everything seemsstill extremelyrelevant andyeah i'm notwondering what you like well it's likeyou said earlier ifi meanthat bitcoin is going to last as long aswe think it isand the bible is a living documentwho knows likepeterson talks about paradise loss thatmilton milton wrotethat it'seffectively become part of the biblicalcorpus right like we don't call it partof the bible today it's a separate bookbut there'syou see these books coming togetherbecause it's really what bible means itmeans a library so it's this collectionof books it's not any one book so maybeover these longer spans of timeyou know likehodl said earlier remember that guy wekilled 200 years ago like he had somereally good ideasmaybe we start stuffing some of thatinto the biblical corpus over a longenough time for him i don't what whatdoes that mean does the white paper getincluded at some pointi don't knowthat'd be a tripor we're all just crazy cultists that'sthe alternativetime will tell we will definitelyi you know sometimes when i'm listeningto these conversations and i'mparticipating them you know i'm thinkingto myselfeitherpeople will be studying this podcast 500years from nowor people will be looking back at usfive years from now being like look atthese [ __ ] pseudo-intellectualgrifters likei don't know which one a lot of peoplethink about us that way right now youdon't have to wait five years but theydo well certainly they do but i thinki think they're wrong they're eitherwrong or we've stumbled intoyou know it's kind of like in some sensei think that when the history books arewritten on covet if they're accuratethey'll they'll detail it asthe first uh social media masters areabecause you talk about like baby boomersnot being able to like deal withtechnological changes well everybody hada device that beamed fear directly intotheir pocket that was first time that itever happened right it correspondsdirectly with covet that didn't happenduring swine flu soros whatever right solikei'm thinking to myself okay if you knowhistorically they're going to say thatabout kovidmaybe if bitcoin fails they'll say thatthis wasthe first mass delusion of the internetage or something like that and uh listeni'm prepared for whatever outcome whenyou get into bitcoin you have to beprepared for billionaire status orhomelessness like you you'll be sleepingon a beach but you don't know in amansion or in a sleeping bagthat's just the journey baby and youdon't know how your reputation is goingto be upheld whether you're going to beseen as a visionary genius uh iconoclastor as a crazy homeless guy sleeping on abeachone of the two you knowbuy the ticket take the rightyeahtaking a roll of the dice is better thanuh for for going the game right at leastwe're going out withwe're not the cold and timid spiritsthat hold themselves aside at the tablethey know yeah [ __ ]yeah it's like the teddy uh rooseveltquote about uhyeah yeah yeahbut maybe at a minimum like as i wasgoing to say something to the effectthat yeah but our hearts were in theright places right and we were trying toyou know we're trying to contribute tothe good let's say but maybe even ifthat's not the case like maybe there'sat least something endearing about usyou know that we're having these typesof conversation and we're not justtalking about lambos and [ __ ] yachtsand [ __ ] and that kind of stuff likemaybe historians will at least be likeyou know what they were totally insaneand wrong but yeah they were nice guysyou know they weren't so bad there wasway worse in the fiat erado you guys think take a look at thelonely islandthings go quiet soon i've been kind ofwrestling with this lately partiallybecause of it kind of welling up insideof me but likedo you think umi don't know do you think things quietdown in bitcoin land and just i guess interms of twitter andcontent and stuff or is this just atrain that keeps on gatheringspeedum i i personallydon't feel the call i can only speakabout myself but like i just don't feelthe call to engage with as much bitcoincontent anymore because yeah i'm prettysolidified in my you know thoughtsopinions views a hundred percent of mynet worth is in bitcoin i think a lot ofyeahyeah i think a lot of me there was atime period from like uh 2018 to like20early part of 2020 where i was listeningto like seven bitcoin podcasts and ionly inhaled bitcoin content and thatwas all i read and i blocked out allother you know everything else about theworld and all my social relationshipswith bitcoin and now it's not quite thatway and i think i think i was gainingcourage to have 100 allocation tobitcoin and that's why i was souh enmeshed in bitcoin content podcastand everything but you know thefundamentals of bitcoin don't change andthe big questions are left unanswered solikei don't know man maybe it's like i'vejust been here so long but a lot oftheseconversations are repetitious for me atthis point so i just i don't feel theneed to engage as often you knowthat's just me though i don't know howit is for everybody else that's exactlywhy i ask you know i listen to way lesscontent than i used to and i am moreserious about asking myself the questionlike what is the more valuable use of mytime here is it right engaging ontwitter is it having anotherconversation that people have heard amillion times before is it like actuallysomethingthat i value that it would be aproductive use of the time to movetowards that or somethingumand that's why i asked it quite likebecause i thinki mean it depends when you got into thespace and the learning curve and allthat kind of stuff butif you are all in you get the thesis youride or die you're going down with theshiplikeit's like how does that change thenature of all thestuff that's being said i mean newpeople come into space you start apodcast you write a book there's maybethere's some like novel stuff beinggenerated and that would be the signaland i think thatthat getsjustified attention but a lot of it'slike you know you're hearing from thesame people and the same conversationsand all this stuff and rob like i kindof single you out a little bit herebecause you seem to finduh a lot of guests for your show thatdon't pop up anywhere they're prettynovel and i'd actually likei want to one of the questions i want toask you is like how you how you find allthese people but but still like uhi think for those of us who who get itare or my mind is being tuned towardlike well what's the next step likewe've we went through the step of likeas you said huddle confirming your yourthesis and you know gaining theconfidence to go all in and like adjustyour perspective in that way what's thenext step and i i do think a part of itat least for me is this type of aconversation because for mea big part of the next step is likereally pushing the bounds on what kindof meaning this thing contains you knowand because i wantthat extra clarity to help me determinewhat my actions should be so i find likeyou know some of these the conversationsthat i have with people beneficial to mefor that reason but i canbut i i just i find myselfless interested in all the goings-onin the space let's sayand you know not not not criticizinganybody because i love like so many ofthe people that are doing stuff in thespace buti was just curious about your guysattention and where you found itdrifting these daysumi feeli guess maybe just to describe thepathway common pathway that i see islike you get you hear about bitcoinif you pay enough attention tounderstand that it's like actuallysomething usefulthenyou might start to go down the rabbithole but then a lot of people hit thesticking point government will neverallow it right and they still kind ofhavegovernment either ator near the top of their ownworldview their hierarchical worldviewand so that can cause a lot of people tojust stop there right like put it put aray dalio in that bucket he kind of getsreally stuck on that pointbut then once you realize bitcoin'sunstoppable it doesn't matterumwhat government does to stop it there'sno like that'sno one knows how to stop it basicallyyou start to fall really far and fastdown the rabbit hole because theimplicationsthis is like even what peterson sayshe sayshe's thought through it the implicationsare so unbelievably radicalthat he just uses that notion that theprobability is probably lowof it's success in your chat with himlike the reason why he doesn't fully buyinto it is because it's tooit's too good to basically right yeahand umsoclearly i would say we're all wellwe're falling far and fast down thatrabbit holeand for me the content i've never been ahuge audio video guyat all like i listen to maybe onepodcasta week something like that not not a loti prefer to readumso i don'tearly on in bitcoin i did listen to alot of podcasts because there's a lot ofuseful information you're trying tofigure out you know all the thingsbut once you get to this kind ofi guess simplistic maximalist viewpointof just it's all bitcoinand nothing else thatuh i find myself like the book we'rereading like the history of religiousideas who would have thoughtby studying some magic internet moneyyou'd end up readingthe you knowhistory of religious it's not somethingi would have ever thought i would everread in a thousand years soi really enjoy that now like i feel verygrateful to be ableto be falling fast and far down therabbit hole and talking to people that ithink are interestingabout things that i think areinteresting like i'm trying a lot of thethings we talked about today right theseare things that i'm trying to figure outand put into wordsyou kind of have this dim apprehensionof a thing you know where you can sortofmaybe see a pattern but then you have tofigure out how to get that pattern againpull that imaginalstructure down into articulable speechis a really it's a challenge souh i enjoy that a lot and i i just feelreally grateful to be able to do it fora livingit's amazing sowhen i mean i hate to ask butwhen bookspeaking of articulate you knowdistilling this stuff down andarticulating it and how hard it ishow's the book come alongi want to have it out by the end of theyearbut it is honestly it's like i wouldstart to try and say something and thenyou get to a point you get to your ownsticking point where you realize youdon't have a fully formed way to say itorand so a lot of these things i've beenthinking like trying to connectthe technological to the mythologicaldomain you know iliad helps with that alothow it is the natureyou knowi want to ground it in physics right ifi'm going to write about history ofmoney andtransformation of society i want toground it in something that will reallyhopefully resonate with kind of amainstream audienceand for me i just think you know physicsand math areasbest we can do sothat's why i'm trying to disambiguatethis you know where peterson's oftentalking about political power i think heoverlooks the physicalnature of power and how how essential itisagain to be alive is to be expressingenergy across timesoyeah i hopejust a mildly ambitiousattempt to try and umundermine central banking from the firstprinciples ofphysics something like thatyeah i mean likeone of the things i've encounteredmyself is like you think you're ona thread of like articulating thatpoorly definedor not perfectly defined idea in yourhead but then you know through theseconversations and through reading ofthese books and stuff you get such ashift that it shifts the whole threadand all thethis you know not maybe not all of itbut it it requiresreworking things sometimes to a fairlylarge degree and umyou know you you really got to havelike a the right emotionalapproach to the process tonot be thrown off course by that becauseyou know at least for me i'm finding itlikepart a large part of my effort inwriting is trying to calm myself downbasically it's trying tolikestay calm you knowtrust in the process don't don't try torush itbut it's tough man like you think youthink things are so well formed hereright becauseit's how you live right likeit's got to be like well formedand then you try to have it come outthrough your fingertips and you realizeand this is almost what's scary about itbecause you realize likehow conscious are you of yourperspective and your worldview andwhat's guiding you if you can'tarticulate it well and this is part ofpeterson's point about becoming a writerbut if you can't articulate it well likeare you fully conscious of it to whatdegree is your perspective unconsciousand this is a massive thing in the worldtoday i mean betweenyour f your familial and your nation andyour government conditioningand social media and all that kind ofstuff i mean howhow conscious are you of the differentconstituent components of yourperspectiveand andis it not a good thing to bemaximally conscious of them so that youcan be maximallyyou can be maximally in control you canmaximally assert your you know your freeagencyit's a weird thing with the writingbecause you're i feel like i'mconstantly trying to figure outwhat i'm trying to say so it's more oflike an inquiry like a yen right butthen you're trying to say it too so youactually have to like make a pointbut you don't want to you know you haveto reinforce your claims and all that sothis is constant like in and out in andout and it's just a painful process welljust just vomiting the insight is easyright just having the epiphany come andtyping it out not even really thinkingabout it but as you sayputting it in a structure that's goingtoflow and and stay integrated as you movethrough the different parts that's thetricky part and i've tended to failfallen i've fallen short in thatdirection i would just kind of state theinsight and then i get a lot of feedbackwhen people read the workthat get the ideas of like well you knowexpand on this what do you mean by thatand so one sentence that i might haveput out to turn into three paragraphstrying to justify thepoint soyeah it's good to have other eyes on ittoo yeah i mean i i find my writingstyle and my reasons for are prettydifferent from other people like i'm notinterested in trying to contact a wideraudienceand i also think what i'm trying youknow my opinion is what i'm trying toarticulate is one of the most difficultthings to articulate so like it's notit's not going to come in this you knowfun you knowsmall little easy to digest book like imy pursuit of writing like i think i'mdealing with the most difficultand the most essentialaspect of western metaphysics and solike i don't think that this is going tocomeas like an easy explanation and i knowand like there was never like what'slike set out on a project to like makebitcoin the object of westernmetaphysics no like it just [ __ ]happensthat like that seems to be what i'vestumbled uponand i i really wish i didn't feelhaunted by thisneed to try to explain it but i keepcoming back to it i think it was uhkurt vonnegut once said like anybody canwrite a book it's just like trying topump up a hot air balloon with a bicyclepump you know like it's just it justtakes [ __ ] a long time and it's hardyeah but i agree with with your pointabout the audience i mean i think i'vesaid this before too but like it'sit's purely to have a more clear grip onon the thing thatseems to be most influential in myperspective currently like i want toknow morei want to have a better grip on thatbecause like you know a conversationlike this ispretty emblematic that we're all likewe're grasping you know maybe we'vegotten somewhere with it butyou know there's a lot of things to bedetermined andif we are at all right abouthow meaning works in consciousness andhow we ascribe meaning and the thingsthat influence meaning and all thisstuff we've been talking about thengetting a clearer perspective on itwould probably necessitate positiveoutcomes in your life you know that's myprimary purpose i want to have like athing that i cancon go back to andyou know help me recapitulate myperspective as as i go through timei mean the way that you say want likelike i almost to be like wait like yougot you guys are like in control herelike like i don't i don't feel like ihave any power around this like it'slike a it's like a barbed hook in mybrain and like this is just this is justwhat i have to do now like there's notthere's not really like an option aroundit well yeah and just to be clear like idon't enjoy reading a lot of thisphilosophy like i find it really hardand difficult to like learn all of thislike latin and speak and [ __ ] like likethis sucks but like i try to go away andthen i'm like so like what did [ __ ]schmidt say i'm likeyeah the the political as the strongestthe most intense distinction of categorylike this makes sense yeah like more andi'm like yeah but wait like i'm [ __ ]crazyso why is that satisfying why when yougo back to schmidt and you figure outwhat you're saying and you integrate itinto your existing perspective why isthat satisfyingbecause like i think i'm kind of crazyand then like i reconnect the point i'mlike oh i'm not crazy and likeit's this kind of constant oscillationback and forth and then it's hard tolike stop and like objectively be likeoh yeah like you know like internetmoney clearly is like the object ofwestern metaphysics that's gonna likerescue us all from what we need and thenlike when i try to go like well hang onstop eric likeis the is that true like is bitcoinactually this thing that fundamentallychanged your life and made it better andempowered you and helped you and it'slike oh yeah like even though this allsounds absolutely insane it's like trueso like let's continue with trying tofigure out what's going onyeah butaside from like your desire toprove to yourself you're not insane likewhy do you think it is thattriangulating in on a a greater clarityaround the truth is so compelling to youuhand all like i i think it's the samething that's drawn everyone from alldifferent fields to however they come tothat truth too like it's just part ofour own makeup of how we're attracted tocertain things or why we do things youknow like i i think almost a bettercomparative is like people that doextreme sportsthat like you know maybe get insituations where they die like eventhoughthere's a very rattleready knowledge in front of them theycould die doing this thing they're justsoenamored by it like i don't i it's likea math to a flame thing like it it'sit's weird you know and actually that'sa good analogy becausei feel like i turn away and i like lookinto all the darkness i'm like oh godit's like so [ __ ] bad out here and ilike turn back to philosophyand particularly with like heidegger anda few others they help be like yeah likelikecool your jets like it's supposed to bereally really really [ __ ] up right nowlike that's how it worksand i'm like oh okay so i guess like itit helps meremediate the difference betweenthe darkness of the external world andseeing this lightthat's so different and yet it's stillvery small and nascent and so it'salmost like this question of that likeis this truly a light that's saving ornot and like is my pursuit towards itbecause like as i've gone towards itlike i have to say like my own life hasgotten better and more interesting andi'm happier and all this other stuffbut it'svery strange you know buti thinki think in my because i'm a relentlessyou know truth seeker also as we all areand uh i i think for me it's aboutstemming umthe compounding of painbecause when you have lived alive for along time the pain compounds and theexponential goes the wrong directionand when the bill come do comes dueeventually as it always does the pain ismany orders of magnitude greater than itshould have beenand i just personally from my youngeryears cannot stomach thatand i see a lot of people who you knowessentially their entire life is offforce because they refuse to engage withthe truthand i know that for most of themthere's this very very very painful billthat comes through when they're on theirdeathbed and suddenly the crushingrealization that they wasted theirentire lifehits them like a ton of [ __ ] bricksand there's nothing you can do but stareup at the ceiling and slowly die[ __ ] that like so for me it's all aboutjust avoiding that moment uh at the veryendi think that's what's compelling aboutthe truth and why i was you know kind ofdigging into it here becausewe've been operating with that this ideathat they're like there isa reality both physical and metaphysicalto conform toright that kind of determineshow much pain to your point huddle we'regoing to experience the greaterconformity to it the less pain the lessconformity to it the more friction themore mistakes the more painand so truth would seem to be that thingthat allows you tobecome more integrated withthosethose domainsright i think the reason why we we seekit more and more and why it's wrapped upin all the topics we've been discussingtodayis because it fosters that integrationand it resolves the tension or the painto be derived fromnot being congruent with the things thatdetermine outcomes the things thatdetermine emotions the things thatdetermine what you experienceand umand to the point where like the mostprofound truths and again this you knowfind it in poetry and theology etcis likethe thing that resolves everything rightthe thing that allows everything to beperfectly integrated the allresolving power of the truth or love oryou know other synonyms thereand uh i think that's what's so that'swhat makes it so compelling right it'slike you get a little sniff of it andyou and to your point we've allmentioned this like how much bitcoin hasimproved our lives in a number ofdifferent domainsand that's just confirming theenterprise where it's likei gottakeep going like if i if i still have acent on that trail i got to keep goingbecause the results areamazingand i want to see more of them formyself and i want to see more for otherpeople as well but there's somethingjust socompelling or intoxicating orfulfilling meaningful aboutwhat we call what we the word we use todescribe as truth you know and and thekind of the congruence that thatthat if you pursue that properly seemsto foster or if you pursue it inrelation to the right thing becausemaybe you're pursuing in relation to thewrong thing and maybe that takes youeven further off in the wrong directionbut yeah i just uhit seems like everyoneokay sorryumi mean it seems like giventhe choice not that everyone probablysteps back from their lives to make thechoice butif you really think about it i thinkeveryone would choose to live their lifeordered to truthbecause if you chose to live your lifeordered tofaultyou're basically volunteering for thatexponential accumulation of pain thathotel is describing right the longer youlive in a lie the more you're divergingfrom realityand you know there's going to be a dayof reckoning right it's just not that'swhat the truth is it's everywhere youcan't avoid itand soyou know maybe thisis in thatseries coming out soon on platonicphilosophy but they talk about this keyconnection between human reason and lovehow they both seem they both seek rightrelation with realityand i knowjohn when you talk to bravaki he talkedaboutreversing the arrow of relevance rightthat we typically you come into theworld and you're how is the worldrelevant to me you're always trying tolike you're selfish basically you'reyou're immature you'retrying tobecome a fullygrown adult right and in that processthere'sa lot of uh limited let's say myopia youjust you don't understand thethe relevance of yourself to the worldso much but thenin coming into adulthood especially likeif you had kids or something youit's that love again that gothic lovethat reverses the error of relevance nowyou're like how am i relevant to mychildren how am i relevant to others tothe worldandman it's just really again back tobitcoin being the unity of oppositeslikeit's turned to that selfish pursuitfor individual accumulation right walt'saccumulation health preservationto a really selfless outcomeso you knowit'sit seems like it helps us reverse theerror of relevance and that's probablywhat we're kind of all describing hereis the improvement in our lives now forme it's hard to disentangle because igot into bitcoin and had a daughter kindof at the same time so i guess i've beengoing through through both uh influencessimultaneously but it definitely that'sbeen the experience for me going mydarker self was much more self-seekingoverall i was like what's in it for methat kind of mode of being and now itfeels like bitcoin and perhaps being afather as well has really helped mereverse thatand it's a good feeling like it's areally good feeling i highly recommendit to anyone andyou know credit to peterson right pursueresponsibility not happinessthat's happened to thatthat stage of of being that'smuch more what we areevolved to be i thinkyou may have just answered this andwe'll shut it down shortly after thisrob butlike what is itthe other two and myself kind of touchedon this but likewhen you'reputting in the work writing and it'sfrustrating and you just you know youjust push yourself through it oryou have a big schedule and you'retrying to get work done and balance withfamily life and all that kind of stufflike aside from the means to continue onyour life right like income and stuffwhat is itdo you is there something you're hopingto find at the end of you know thispursuit of what is money or what isbitcoinbecause obviously it's it's compelledyou to pursue it right and so is it isit consciouswhat lies at the end of that pursuitlike what's motivating itumyou know the word unity comes to mindreally like aren't we all justit's weird again because like i saidwhen you're writing you're sort of whatare you trying to write about and thenyou're trying to make a point so you'rekind of asking me like what is the bigpoint i'm trying to makeyeah andyeah i guess you could likesayfix the money fix the world rightsomething really simple like that thatwe already have crystallized in thebitcoin communitybut hopefully saying it in my own uniqueway thatresonates with people in a unique wayandumi don't i don't know i i guess the pointwould be fix the money fix the world butthe the delivery and the the form of howi deliver iti hope to do that in a way that's verythoughtful and resonant with a lot ofpeople i i know it's like a super hardquestion to answer because evensomething like fix of money fix theworld is more of a means right and so iguess my question is likewhat is the ultimate end to be seekingyou know and unity is the word that cameto your mind but again like to bring allthis full circlei think this is part ofthe power and the role of metaphysicalnarrative in the human storyis because like ituhit presentsor is a reflection of likethe ultimate ends like yes take care ofyour family and yes you knowlove your neighbor and be part of acommunity and try to execute the valuesthat you think are or propagate thevalues that you think are mostimportant in the world but likehow do you what do you what does thattake into the ultimate extreme what isthe the end that is most worthyof your sacrifice right because as yousaid before every time you take anaction you're always giving away you'realways spending time and energy you'realways exerting powerwhat is the end most worthy of sacrificeandit would seem that these stories likeonce you peel back the onion a littlebitit is something to the effect ofyou know love god with all your heartsort of thing and allow that to beuhallow creation to manifest through youas a result of that orientationsomething like that yesi don't know what that [ __ ] you knowmeans in a day-to-day life we're allfiguring that out butit seems like i mean yeah if whetherthat's the proper articulation of theanswer it seems likethat realm is trying toto suppose one at leastwhen i was a kid themeaning of life was put to me as peoplehelping peopleright like no matter what we're doinglike kind of the way you get the mostmeaning is to justberelevant to someone else's lifeyou knowandthis experience of getting into bitcoinand especially when you go to a bitcoinconference and we get you know we getmobbed with love basically people sayinghow much it helped themthat's a great feeling so you're justkind of like mining value and thencreating value for others hopefully andyeah if i can help people i guess thatwould be the end righti uh for me personally like the the kidthing is huge i mean umwhen i had my daughter my first daughterjust sitting playing her ipad over thereuhi had this like really tough child thati had like pretty traumatic childhood mymother was schizophrenic and things weredifficultand when i had this childi realized to myself like my whole lifecame to like the you know through theeye of a needleand it was like if anything had beendifferent if anything had been out ofplace it would have been a differentchildand i was so clearly meant to have thischildand i don't need to ask myself like themeaning of my life because in thatmoment it's never been more clear andit's been clear every day sincemy job is to fight for her and make theworld right for her and set things inorder and give her more than i was givenand i think collectively like especiallythat's part of the bitcoin story is uhthe baby boomers leveraged our futureand they stole from the future to have aparty in the presence that none of usparticipated in and we're one of thefirst generations where we threw anerrorand in the blockchain of humanity wewere given less thanthan the prior generations you'resupposed to give your children morethat's the natural order of things andsobitcoin writes this the systemand it pushes value into the futurerather than extracting value from thefuture for the present because thefuture is always more valuable than thepresent doseand so to me like that is all wrapped upinwhat we're doing here and i just goforth every day thinking about that anduhyeah manyeah i mean the this for me representsus being able to participate in buildinga systemwhere we canbow to the future ones who come amillennia from now and say we love andrespect you enough that we securedthe wealth of the future for everyoneforeverbecause we know that the this truly is asacred task to make sure that the theftof money and wealth can no longer occurin our world with our technology andthat we were ones to do it you know andto me it's uhit's the realization that in anihilistic world wheregod is deadgod actually needs us more than we needhimand in meeting his request for his needwe can raise ourselves to his task whichis to create a worldthat he wants reflected in his image andi firmly and fundamentally believethat's a world where all people have theself-sovereignty of their wealth forthemselves and only themselves and it'snot because we just want to give thatbut that's the responsibility ofself-love and self-carethat when i give it to you i receive itin kind and that i love you as i lovemyselfand i raised you the other to themetaphysical position that only you cangive me and that's the recovery fromthis placei love that you said in kind becausethat word kenit's in kind it's also in kingdom thekingdom of heavenagain back to the strength of theintegrity of relations right there's nostronger bond between kenand the kingdom of heaven is supposed tobe that right global familylike obviously it's never going to bereal but we canthis is what we do we use ourimagination to create these things andthen we live in themso seems like bitcoinmight be a big step towards the kingdomof heavenindeedseems like a good place to end itah love you guys i miss you all am i isit just gonna be miami next year is thatthat when we all get together againi mean i'll be in austin at the end ofthis month i don't know if you guys
