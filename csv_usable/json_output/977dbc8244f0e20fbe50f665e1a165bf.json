  "text": "all right so we are here uh in the inthe unchained capitalbitcoin common studios with alex epsteinauthorof the new book fossil future um ofcourse uh he had a previous book themoral case for fossil fuels which wasum uh new york times bestseller if i ifi remember yes although it turns out ijust learned it this wasn'tthe first week even thoughi can't give the exact numbers but thereare books it sold 14 of 15 books on thenew york times bestseller listthe national bestseller list so back inthe moral case it was easier to get onthe best seller list in part becausethey had a science bestseller list whichis what i got onuh but anyway this is yeah this is notgoing to be a new york times specialapparently but it's a lot better andit's selling a lot betterthis particular book this one yeah itsold it's obviously 20 000 copies in thefirst week oh my goodness wow that's uhthat's doing pretty well soum before we get to the book andeverything else let's uh let's get alittle bit on your background because ifind your background absolutelyfascinating because you're you're not uhyou know what most people might expectlike maybe a geologist or something likethat you actually come from philosophycan you tell us a little bit more yeah imean i think depending on theirinclination people will think oh youknowyou're pro fossil fuels so it must bethe fossil fuel industry like hunted youdown and said here's a we've got thisguy has all the makings of a of achampion or a lobbyist so we're going topay him a bunch of money to say all ofthese things and i like i wish they didthat not for me but i wish they had thatkind of confidence that they would dothat butyeah my background was i mean it's along story but i was sort of a very techoriented kid like went to the top one ofthe top math science high schools in thecountryuh really loved that stuff but idiscovered i loved even more thinkingabout we've got human action hereright but it was really like i foundhuman action even more interesting thanthinking about math and science and theni realized well there's a subject thatreally studies the fundamentals of thatof course i mean mises was economics butit's like philosophy i think isfundamental to economicsand it's really all about what's the thebasic framework that guides all of ourthinking in action in particular whatare our thinking methods what are ourassumptions and what are our values andi i was in computer science at duke isort of it was very hard for me to gointo the humanities i thought it was forlosersand i like i only admired athletes andbusiness peopleand it was but i was like i loved it somuch i couldn'ti just couldn't deny it when i turned 20so i go to my computer science advisorand say i'm not going to do this anymorei'm never programming againand i said i'm going to become aphilosopherthis is the worst idea ever right nobodyever has a problem and says let's call aphilosopher this kind of thingbut i thought of it as this is the mostpractical field to me because it'sbecause it's like your your thinkingmethods your assumptions values thatthat determines everything about yourlife determines everything about a fieldas we'll see that's really what'sdetermining people's thinking aboutenergy not not almost overwhelmingly notspecific disputes over factsso that i had no i was not pro-fossilfuelsbut i think i had a good way of thinkingand i was aware of thinking methods andassumptions and values underlyingthinking methodsso then when i came tolike when i was 27 so i spent sevenyears as a writerwith almost no interest in energy noknowledge but then i was 27 i realizedwow energy is the industry that powersevery other industryand clearly like fossil fuels inparticularare really really good at providing costeffective energy in a way that nothingelse is including they feed us likewithout modern fossil fuels agriculturediesel-powered machines and natural gasderived fertilizer like eight billionpeople cannot be fed and i notice nobodyis talking about these benefits sothey're making the most basic errorwhich is you're evaluating what to doabout something in this case what to doabout our use of fossil fuels but you'reignoring the benefitsand that anytime i see thatlike anytime i feel like what i'm toldis the truth is is screwed up and i'msomehow being screwed like i becomereally interested in okay what's theactual truth of this and so that startedme on a journey in 2007 and here we arein 2022 and i'm world's biggest advocateof fossil fuels did not intend to beyeah so let's go back a little bitbecause uh the the philosophy andsort of studying things from firstprinciples i i think that gets a lot ofrespect especially in the bitcoincommunity and so on umcan you explain exactly how that relatesto philosophy and where where peoplegenerally go wrong in patterns ofthought so how first principles relatesto philosophy well yeah or how howpeople generally do bad philosophy let'slet's put it that waywhat what what's wrong with how peoplethink todayso there are a lot of levels of this soone thing is justnot being awarethat there is a way that you think andthat you could think differentlyabout things so you take a usual thingaboutlet's just take energy issues sincewe're talking about that and you have abookand i'll give an example that i'm verycritical of a guy named michael mannwho's one of our leading what i calldesignated experts on these issues hehe's the one you know when we hearlisten to the scientists he's a climatescientist he's telling us what to dohe's a whole book on this stuffand it doesn't mention it talks abouthow fossil fuels will allegedly be badfor agriculture but it doesn't mentiononce the benefits of fossil fuels foragriculture even as i said eight billionpeople depend on fossil fuels andattributes of fossil fuels that are veryhard to substitute for it let alonetotally replaceso what's going on with man is is did hebefore he wrote this book did he or hisequivalent because many other people dothis did he think about what's my methodby which i'm going to evaluate thisquestionof what to do about fossil fuels and idon't think when people are evaluatingwhat to do i think they rarely thinkabout what the method is i think whatthey tend to do is they just pick upwhatever method usually bad method isbeing usedand then they go with it so i think inhis case it's the method that's beingused is everyone is already only lookingat the side effects of fossil fuelsnamely climate so you don't even thinkabout the benefitsand then you kind of you think your jobis just to show that fossil fuels arehaving climate impacts and then once youdo that that means fossil fuelsare bad whereas if you step back youwould think that makes no sense at allright becauselike you'd have to show really that theeven one the negative climate impactsthat way the positive but moreimportantly that the negative impactsaren't outweighed by these hugepositives of fossil fuels that arepretty straightforward so it's just anexample ofhe's not thinking about or his equipmaybe he's not being honest but somebodyeven who's honest cannot think about heyhow am i going to evaluate this issueand so one principle i use that's veryhelpful is just i say i want to engagein a full context evaluation which inthis situation means i want to lookcarefully at the benefits and sideeffects of the different alternativesand i want to weigh them but thenthere's other things as well becausethen there'syou know i think one you're interestedin when you're talking about benefitsand side effects there's a question ofwell how do you definewhat's a benefit benefit to whom and forwhat purpose and when we're talkingabout the world if you look at it yousee well some people are are talkingabout it in terms of the goal seems tobe we want to impact the earth as littleas possible so when people say net zerothey're sayingthat's our main goal we want toeliminate co2 emissions at all costs andthat's our goaland i would say was that a valid goallike why are you choosing thisor you even see in covit like some thegoal implicit in a lot of the covetstuff was let's eliminate this virus notto equate co2 emissions of the virus butit's the singular focus and it's notquestionedso there's this question of what is yourprimary moral goal when you're whenyou're evaluating things you're if youif you're talking about benefits itmeans benefits to achieve some goal sowhat is that goal and that's going todetermine that's going to be that'sgoing to mean the standard by which yousay this is good or bad so for me ithink of it as my goal when i'm thinkingabout the world as a whole is advancinghuman flourishing on earth and i thinkof the dominant goal that people don'treally think about but is eliminatinghuman impact on earth and that's i thinkthat explains a lot why people don'tfocus on the benefits of fossil fuelsbecause the goal they've accepteddoesn't regard benefits to humans asimportantand sometimes regards them as negativebecause if humans proliferatethat actually impacts the planet moreright and so if your goal is toeliminate human impact you don't seethatas a benefiteven though it's a benefit to humans buthumans are not what you're optimizingfor and then another thing is isassumptions so we're dealing with a lotof predictions when we're dealing we'redealing with predictions about energybut in particular predictions aboutclimateso there's a question when you're makingpredictions well whatwhat unstated assumptions are in thosepredictions about the future i think onebig unstated assumption is what i callthe delicate nurture assumption which isthe idea that nature existswhen before we impact it it exists inthis delicate nurturing balance so it'sit's stable doesn't change too muchit's uh it's sufficient so it gives uswhat we need as long as we're not toogreedy and it's safe like it you knowlike we think of climate as safeand this is just pure mythology not atall how the world works right but wetreat it that way you hear i i think ofnature's wild potential so it's it'sdynamic changes all the time and on manydifferent levels uh it it umit's deficient doesn't give us nearlywhat we need even when there's a smallnumber of people let alone 8 billionand then it's very dangerous like you'reconstantly threatened by other organismsthat many of which compete with us andthen you're threatened by inanimateforcessuch as climate which are a menace tohuman beings throughout history and onlyrecently have actually becomesomething that's not a daily problemeven though we talk about climate crisisclimate crisis actually the history ofhumanity was just a giant climate crisisuntillike the last hundred years and wefigured out how to master it but if youif you have this idea that nature is adelicate nurture you are going topredict that anytime we impact it on asignificant scale there's going to be acatastrophe nature's going to punish uslike a vengeful gaia vengeful likenatural you know nature god is going topunish us and i think this explainsmany of your viewers listeners areprobably familiar with there thisthere's this history of 50 years ofthese crazy environmental predictionsthat always end up being the oppositeright so we're going to run ourresources and we have more resourcespollution is going to become unbearablewe actually have better environmentalquality and then it's going to becatastrophically colder andcatastrophically warmerand when the temperature is going downor up it's not a catastrophe at allwe're actually safer than everfrom climate so i i believe that it'sthis assumption that nature is adelicate nurturethat leads people to expect this thesedisasters and then it's why we it's partof why we don't invalidate the allegedexperts who predict them like they'restill so you have this guy paul ehrlichwho's been our designated leadingenvironmental expert since the 60s andhe's been wrong on every single thinglike he's been 180 degrees wrong so he'spredicted to get much worse and it gotmuch better but he's still consultedregularlybut it's becausethe the the people consulting him alsobelieve nature is a delicate nurturer sothey think oh well this year okay itdidn't happen for the last 50 years butthis year it's all going to explodebut it's that's the power of anunquestioned assumption it's i thinkpeople can see just with these exampleshowphilosophy is soit affects so much and so you the firstthing is just to be aware ofthat philosophy your methods assumptionsand values areshaping thingsand then you can think about what yoursare and what which ones you've beenaccepting in the by following themainstream way of thinkingwell so you mentioned the delicatenature assumption which uh i i thinkunderlies a lot of this how did thatsneak in to people's psyche because likei think reading your book and thinkingabout it i'm like yeah of course it'snot a delicate nurturer yet that is sortof like the operating assumption that alot of people go on they'relike sort of psychologically orphilosophically how how did people cometo make that assumption and whywhy is that so prevalentinyou know a world that's supposedlyrational or something like thatso one level of explanation that's notentirely satisfying is that the schoolsystempromoted it but i think that'sundoubtedly true so i grew up you know iwas born in 1980 so i grew up in the 80sand 90s in terms of my you knowelementary middle school high schooleducationand we totally got this view right thatthere's this delicate balanceand that we're ruining itandand that we need to stopand and part of what's omit and so it'sit's that and a crucial thing i think iswhat's omitted is what life was likebefore industrialization before people ii call it empowerment so before peoplecould use machines to become productiveand prosperous because if you reallyunderstand how bad life was before wehad machines to amplify and expand ournaturally very meager abilitieslike you're afraid of living in natureright you're not afraid of changingnature primarily you're afraid of of notchanging nature of not being productiveenough to turn the deficient anddangerous planet into an abundant andsafeplanet so the lack of proper educationabout industry is a huge thing and i'lljust the way i got it was you learnedokay the industrial revolution and whatyou learn at least in my curriculum wasworkers got treated badly there waspollutionthe endversuslife expectancy was 30.and it rapidly drove up in this likehockey sorry this uh hockey stickpattern and the same with income and thesame with the number of people on theplanet and then in fact we had this wehad this miraculouslike there's just i call these the thehuman flourishing hockey sticks we havethis miraculous phenomenon of life onearth stagnatesindefinitely in the pastand then suddenly you get the hockeystick of life expectancy the hockeystick of income the hockey stick ofpopulation and it just so happens notjust so happens to correlate with thehockey stick of co2 emissions and fossilfuels and my explanation is well energythe availability of low-cost reliableenergyis a driving force because that allowsus allowed us to use machines and thatvastly expanded and amplified our ourproductive abilities but if you don'tknow thatwhat happens is you grow up in a societythat has mastered naturethrough the use of machines but youthink of that as naturalso then it's then all your fear isaround what if we change this but youdon't realize the thing you should thereal delicate nurture is all themachines and all the freedom like that'sthe delicate nurture like you see whathappened in venezuela right they takeaway the freedom the machines stopworking average person loses somethinglike 25 pounds involuntarily like that'sthe realbut it's a it's like actually what we'vecreated our civilization is in many waysa delicate nurtures it's actually thereverse but it's those are some reasonswhy we don't get it and i think beneaththat there are some badly motivatedpeople who want us to believe in thedelicate nurture because then a will beafraid enough to support their policiesand b will be optimistic that if we livea more natural life it'll get goodwowumand thethe people that are sort of like uhputting this assumption into our headsyou mentioned schools and stuff um inyour book you call them uh synthesizersdisseminators evaluators uh the thepeople that sort of takethe scientific research and essentiallysummarize it in various forms umthey seem to have that assumption aswell and that that that comes through intheir summaries um and sort ofexaggerate whateveryou know morsels that they get from theactual researchers they take facts andput them into this philosophical contextif you will thatessentially makes it catastrophic sothat we areforced to act umin your book you you claim that they'rejust doing their jobs badly and i wasthinking they're not doing it badlythey're doing exactly what they'reintending to dowhich is manipulating other people andwhat i thought wasthis is this is very much propagandait's it's it's a way to get people tobehave differently think differentlyhave different assumptions and sneak intheseassumptions under the hood like yourdelicateuh nurtureassumption about nature umin what ways uh likehow do you combat that as somebodythat's actually likelike reading something like this andactually having some of these ideasthat can potentially challenge some ofthese um assumptions that comein under the guysbacks i guessso there's a lot there i thinklet's see where do we start here theso my goal is to like i always likeshowing what's actually operating inpeople's minds and the logic of itand secondary to that is what's themotivation of it because if you takesomething like delicate nurturewhether people honestly believe it ornot that's shaping our expectationsabout the impacts of fossil fuels ithink that's clear and the same thing istrue with this view that human impact isimmoral and our goal should be toeliminate human impact on earthi don't think most peoplemost of the people advocating that ondifferent levels don't even know whatthey're doingbut they're still doing it and i talk inchapter three about how oftenthere are various ways in which wedisguise the goal so we think oh we'rejust saving the planet we're justprotecting the environment and we thinkthat means we think that means oh thatjust means clean air and clean water sowhen we hear eliminate our impact wejust think oh we're just going toeliminate the human harming impacts butit's not about that it's abouteliminating all the impacts that's whywe get hostility toward not just fossilfuels but nuclearhydro mining washing machines like allof industry all of machines have thishostility but it'sit's disguised so it's really hard evento showi mean what i'm trying to show in thefirst part of the book is our thinkingthere's something wrong about thethinkingthat we're told all the experts thinkand one is it's ignoring the benefitsand two it's what's calledcatastrophizing the side effects andunderlying this is this this goal ofeliminating human impactand this um what i call delicate nurtureand i call this the anti-impactframework and you can summarize it asthe belief that human impact on natureis intrinsically immoral and inevitablyself-destructive and my view is if youlook at energy any form of energy butcertainly fossil fuels you willinevitably conclude that it's immoraland catastrophic even if it's making theworld far better because you'll ignoreall of its benefits because they're theyinvolve impact which you think is badand because you have this delicatenurture view you'll expect a catastropheeven for humans because you haven'tquestioned that and so the view of thebook is we need a new framework we needto get as long as we're on thisframework it's going to be a disasterand so we need what i call the humanflourishing framework where the goal isto advance human flourishing on earthand you recognize that that earth iswild potential not a delicate nurtureand then you need to do the full contextlike benefits and side effects and so myview is that the what i call knowledgesystems you mentioned the synthesizersthe disseminators the evaluators sothere's the first are the researchersthe people who who study the world andthey can be and they can be an rdistorted bythe anti-impact framework too but that'sharder to prove so i can only reallyshow that in the later part of the bookbut yeah the synthesizer so the peopleare synthesizing the researchtheyarebelieving inthey are not sufficiently valuing humanflourishing and they have this beliefthat impact is badand you can see that by the fact thatthe ipcc the intergovernmental pin onclimate change doesn't even mention therapid decline in climate-related deathsparticularly disaster deaths whichthat's how could a climate organizationnot mention that we're far safer fromclimate right that's like a polioorganization mentioning that we're notfar saferfrom polio and then you see i show otherdistortions sobuti i'm not primarily focused onthe motives of everyone except thephilosophical motives that we can seeoperating because i think that's what'snecessary you asked about educating thepublic i think what's necessary thepublic is just to have thelikeyou know have the clarity of here's howour minds are operating here's how ourleading thinkers are operating do youagree with this and my view is mostpeople will not sign on to theanti-impact framework if they know whatit isand they will sign on to the humanflourishing framework if they know whatit is so i like i'm 100 focused on justshowing what's actually operating inpeople's mindsand not much on the psychology of whyalthough i do agree that in many casesit's it's malicious and it can't befully understood without without acertain amount of maliceyeah it's interesting to me because uhwe see something very similar happeningin bitcoin uh oftentimes people needessentially a new framework to evaluateeverything becausethey're operating under the assumptionthat the dollar is good that fiat moneyis great and that you know the theeconomy and the way everything workswith the federal reserve and centralbankinglikemuch of which they have no idea how itworksthat uh because it's the status quo thatit's uh it'sit's sort of good because of that andsort of breaking them out of thatassumption is really job number one fora lot of bitcoiners becausewhat what do most people complain aboutwhen they think about bitcoin oh it'stoo volatile yeah because you're comingfrom the framework of okay the us dollaris all i use and therefore it's going tobe disruptive on a day-to-day basis wellwhat what about the actualmoral case for something that'spolitically neutral or that doesn'tsteal from everybody and so onum buti i wanted to ask you about umthe entire umwell i mean you you pointed out thatthere are lots of benefits to fossilfuels whichessentially completely get ignored and ii think lots of benefits is anunderstanding right yeah i think theworld is livable without fossil fuelsyeah and reading the book i i felt likeoh my goodness yeah he's right the allof these things pretty much all ofcivilizationrequires some form of fossil fuels andumone of the uh assumptions againum sort of like side by side with thedelicate nurturer assumption is thatuh you know fossil fuels are just youknow maybe they power cars or somethingand that's it right like there's a verylimited scope by which people think offossil fuels like there's justyou know you point out in the book youknow like industrial heating and liketransportation and all of the differentproducts that are made with petroleumand you know like just pretty mucheverything that you see uh has somepetroleum product in it and to thinkokay well we'regonna have net zero like it just it justseems kind of crazyuh whatwhatwhat is it about umthe current framework like or have wejust gotten too used to it why why don'twe know about all of these things likewhat what what's themissing link herewell it's an achievement to understandthe world that exists now so if you justbrought in a you know an alien theywouldn't know how it works right andthey wouldn't even have a frame ofreference necessarily depending on wherethey came fromand so there's a job of a society that'sachieved things to explain theachievement to the children in thesociety so that they can they canpreserve the achievement slash build onthe achievement and change theachievement in so far as it needs to bechanged but one of the problems we haveisit's it's not viewed the fossil fuelachievement is not viewed that way inthat a the world is not viewed asamazingly good so i talk about there's asurvey of college educated people ineurope and 55 percent of them think thatextreme poverty is getting worsein the worldeven though since i was born in 1980it's gone from over four in ten peopleliving on less than two dollars a day toone in tenso you just think about that's thegreatest alleviation of poverty inhistory and half more than half thesecollege educated adults think it'sgetting worse 33 thought it was the same12thought it was improving so a tinyminority right think lesson one andseven thinks it'suh improvingsoif you don't understand the world todayis this achievement that we want topreserve and build on that's one thingyou're not going to be so interested inwhat caused the achievement because youthink it's not an achievement right youdon't even recognize how good it is youdon't have the curiosity that say analien from a poor planet would have or atime traveler from like a time travelerfrom a poor part of the pastwould bethey couldn't they would be so blownaway by what we have in terms of ourresources and capabilitiesand they would be so curiouslike what makes it all possible becausei was here 300 years agoand like the water suckedand it was really hard to get food andthe food wasn't good and i could barelybuild the shelter and now we're we havea freaking what are we in this studiowhere we just talkand people can hear it later and you getpaid like what is going onit doesn't make any sense and then yousort of have to explain oh well like wefigured out how instead of us doing allthe work ourselves we can get themachines to do 75 times more work thanwe can do and so we can just have apretty relaxed life and sometimes someof us can just talk and move a pencil ortypefor a living it's likeyou get interested in that right you andthen you get okay well it's really thekey is what i call machine labor havingmachinesdo work for usand then you become interested in okaywhat power is the machines and then it'soh well for some reason despite the factthat we've had dozens of competitorsover the years eighty percent comes fromthese things called fossil fuels andthat's still growing and you'd becurious like why is that and then that'shis chapter five and my book talks aboutthe secret sauce and partially it's theyhave these amazing physical and chemicalattributes like they're very they'restored energy they're like a naturalbattery they're very concentratedthey're very abundant and if you look atsomething like the sun and the windwhich our ancestors tried to harnessthose are dilute and they'reintermittent there's a lot of them butthey're dilute and they're intermittentand that makes itso far impossible to do what you can dowith fossil fuels but i think it it'swe're not getting that that educationand it starts with recognizing the worldis amazingly good that that it's reallyabout machine labor and that it's aboutlike fossil fuels have have madean unbelievable amount of machine laborpossible by being by far the most costeffective source of energy we've everdiscovered it's not hard for people toget i can usually explain it in 10minutes andbut we just don't get it from our systemand we get the opposite we get weinherited this beautiful planet and weruined it and so let's stopand we expect all this stuff to stayhereyeahone one of the things from the book thatreally struck me uh with regard toyou know machine labor umsort of enhancing theproductivity of human laboris that the poor poorer developingcountries essentially have less machinesand less energy and that's kind of whythey stay poorumand you know what one of themoralcases that you make in the book is thatreally we need to be giving them a lotmore energy andcertainly leaving them free yeah and andnot restricting them from not pressuringthem in any way yeahwhich is the exact opposite of what'sbeen happening um how do you viewsomething like um you know the esgmovement sort of putting a lot of theserestrictions on these countries andlike what umhow do you evaluate that from a moralperspective and who who's actuallylikeare are we partly responsible for thatlike what what what'sare we responsible for the predicamentor are we responseslet's just say the esg soi think of the esg stuff of pressuringany pressure away fromany pressuring of these places away fromusing fossil fuelsi think of it as the same as youpressuring like thieves to go take theirfood or something like thatit's like i mean just really directlyharming very vulnerable peopleso i think it's just it's it's totallyimmoralthat's different from it's our fault soit's our fault in so far as we encouragethe state of affairsbut there's this other narrative that idisagree with that it's like well it'sour fault that that other people thatother places are poorand then in particularthey're somehow poor because we'vedamaged their climate and so we owe theman unbelievable amount of moneyand sowhat's actually true ispoverty is the normal stateof human beings right everyone is poordoesn't matterlike where you are skin color none ofthese like everyone starts out poorand the way to get wealthy is prettystraightforward in terms of you needsome significant degree of economicfreedomand then a major use of that freedom isyou empower using machines and then youbecome really productive and then thatstarts what i call the virtuous circleof empowerment where you free up allthat you use machines to become moreproductive you free up time you can usethat time and machines to innovate andfigure out how to become even moreproductive and your productivity goes upand up and up versus when you're manuallabor you kind of stay at that level andyou don't have much time and muchability to think about things youcertainly don't have computers to thinkabout help you think about thingsso this is like when people don't dothisinmod in the modern day the primary reasonis lack of freedom because we know howto empower people and we've seen ithappenin much of the world we've seen ithappen in asia we've seen it happenin certain parts of south america butasia is probably the best example andwhat's great about being advanced is wedon't have to reinvent the wheel interms of what what england say had to dowhen they industrialized like figure outa lot of stuff from scratch like we knowhow tomake machines we know how to power themand so what you can do is you can if acountry is free you can have foreigninvestment in the country that investsin a lot of this infrastructure andamplifying productivity so that thebusiness makes profit but the people arealso wealthier this is this generallyworks really really well if you protecteveryone's rightsbut if you don't have the rightpolitical institutions you can't do thisand this is the problem in a lot ofafrica that i talk about i didn't talkabout this in moral case i mean thereare many things i didn't talk about morecase but this is a particularlyimportant one i talk about the freedomto trade in chapter 10 and without thefreedom to trade which includesuh so the freedom to trade includes youknow property rightscontractsif you don't have those things who'sgoing to investif you can't if your investment is notprotected so it's very important to bepro fossil fuels and to not restrictthem but you also need to be pro freedomand pro property rights and that's justas controversial in many people's eyesbecause they think oh that's westernthey'd call it racist which is insanebecause it's not about it's not aboutit's actually saying freedom is auniversal valuethat's undoubtedly true and to notbelieve that is to saddle people ofcertain skin colors with anti-freedomideas and to say you have to have thosebecause your ancestors your immediateancestors had those but all of ourancestors had thisrighti mean mine did right soeveryone's ancestors had anti-freedomideas so in the pastour ancestors like if you live in thewestern world particularly the u.s yourancestors broke out of the anti-freedomideasbut to treat it as inherent in is totreat the current state of anti-freedomideas is let's let's stop all the antplaces with anti-freedom ideas fromevolving i think that's per that's justas perverse as depriving people ofenergy and those those ideas which gounder multiculturalism saying allcultures all our ideas all ideas areequally valuable that'sthat's a genocidaltype thing to tell people yeah youshouldn't be freebecause your parents didn't believe itlike my parents parents parents didn'tbelieve it i'm sure as hell glad theyevolved out of that and believed infreedom that's why we can be herewell so i wanted to run an idea by youokay um soum by the way you asked me if there'sanything off limits i'm really waitingfor the killermake me turn red well i i i i don't planto get personal but uh but you knowwithin the monetary sphere uh we we knowfor example thatum the imf the the way they operate isthat they give these loans to thesecountries um the money is printed x kneeand low so they create this money lendit to these countries and then give thema lot of restrictions on how to spend itinevitably those countries can't pay itbackand uh and then they go oh you stillhave to pay this money back that weprinted out or nothingultimately what ends up happening isthat they sell the resources of thecountry like mining rights or you knowland or whatever to western corporationsandultimately a lot of theresources of a particular country end upbeing owned bypeople outside of that country and it'skind of a racket thatyou know the imf uh has done and thereare you know even like former frenchcolonial territories in africa many ofthem have a similar dynamic with uh cfaand stuff like thatand certainly china with the belt androad initiative they're doing somethingsimilar to sort of grab a lot ofresources what do you think about thisidea that a lot of thesesort of environmental restrictions thatyou put on these countries it's a way tokeep themfrom flourishing so that you can justsort of keep them undera form of imperialismyou mean in terms of that's the motiveor that's the effect or bothi i i i would think that it's kind ofthe motive because in in a sense theinternational monetary organizations uhof various stripes they they do this asa way toyou know uh take a lot of theseresources so a lot of central americancountries were called banana republicsfor a long time because chiquita banananeeded all of these places to producebananas so they can sell them to youknow the the people in the united statesa lot of the resources in these placesend up beingused by western corporations and thewealthessentially ends up back in the westrather than back into the localeconomies of these uh places it's hardbecause when you havei guesswhen you have an anti-freedom governmentlike there are a lot of bad outcomes andso one kind of outcome is you make dealswith foreign corporations that enrichyouand aren't particularly good or notnearly as good for the people as if theyhad freedom including property rightsin the country but thenit's often true that they're they'rebetter off with those deals than theywould beif they weren't doing that and they justhad the dictators but it's a mess and soit's part of why you need a like verydramatic reform in these places and onething that'll happen is people say likeoh this this there was this abusiverelationship with this corporation solet's just get all the corporations outof herebut that can actually make thingsworse so yeah i mean that's whathappened with cuba rightliterally a lot of places so you needyou need umyou really you really need reform andit's hard it's it's hardbut it's it's not it's too easy to paintit as oh here's anlike here's sort of an external villainthat they're doing but you know thereare many places that would there aremany corporations that would love to dobusiness in a place that respectedproperty rights more and even china issuch a mixed bag in this respect becauseit's very anti-freedom in many many waysbut it has these pockets of economicfreedom and stability that have enabledcompanies to deal with them and so youthink like oh these places a lot ofplaces like working in china and theycan get really reliable arrangements orat least they can on some time horizonwe'll seewe'll see what it is longer term i wantto just make one more point about thisexploitation thing though becauseit's very importantthat so we don't want to restrict what icall the unempowered world fromempowering but it's not our faultthat they haven't insulted except in sofar as we've advocated restrictions butthat's not the primary thing the primarything is youpeople start out poor and you stay poorunless you adopt radical pro-freedomideas that's kind of in one way oranotherthe final thing though is this climatething i find very annoying that it'swe've ruined their lives with climatechangeuh this is wrong in so many ways butjust look at if you look at it inchapter four the book i have thesehockey sticks of human flourishing andlife expectancy those are not for thewestern world that's for the entireworldthe life expectancy around the world hasbeen skyrocketingand our fossil fueled productivity is ahuge reason why you just think aboutlike the improvement in clean wateraround the world and how much of that ispossible by inventions in the fossilfuel world sometimes charity from thefossil fuel world how howless endangered people are by storms inpart because they can have foreignrelieffrom storms the medical developmentsthat have come that save countless livesthat you know extend countless livesso it's a real injustice toward thefossil fueled world to sayoh you like you ruined the rest of theworld the rest of the world is so muchbetter off including they havedrastically declining climate deaths tooso there's this ridiculous racket thatsaysoh well we owe them a fortuneand then sometimes we pay the fortunethey're going to spend it on inferiorgreen energy which is that's all theperversions togetherbecause it's unearned guilt and thenkeeping them poor with inferior energyand this is the kind of thing thedictators love though because they canget rich right they can they can gettake the money spend some on greenenergy get a lot of it you know havetheir palaces and helicopters and stuffand they're totally happy with that butit's a it's a this climate justicemovement it's like these movements arealways the opposite of what they sayit's like climate justice is theopposite of justice it's unjust towardthe productive fossil fueled world andit's unjust toward the unempowered worldwell so thinking about that a little bitright like you you you have these uhcountries um oftentimes with dictatorsbut oftentimes you know they'rethey might have a democratically electedgovernment well i think i thinkdemocracies can be dictatorial too yeahyeah but regardless they they umpar part of whatends up happening is that theycan'tcreate like uh you know a working coalmine or something like that that couldhave a steady energy source for the restof their population uh in part becausethe western world won't let them uh whatdo you meanlike uh soif you try to go and build a coal powerplant inin a particular countryhow easy would that be versus likebuildinga solaruhfarm or something like that well i meanokay what what component of are you soare you worried about somebody's goingto stop you from building it are yougoing to worry that you can't get thematerials are you worried you can't getthe expertise you can't get the moneywell all of the above uh like what theresult seems to be that there's morekind of green stuff being built indeveloping countries rather than saylikesomething much more efficienti mean there's not enough stuff beingbuilti would say periodumi mean the thing is that these countriesare all almost all signing on to theseinternational agreements particularlythe payers agreement and the currentinterpretation of that is you know youshould be getting rid of fossil fuelsreally quicklyand then you have all these financierswho are who are putting pressure in thatdirectionbut it's if you were if you didn't careabout those pressures and you could findthe companies to deal with i mean it'dbe easy to be more cost effective tobuild fossil fuels nobody's beingpowered by solar and wind anywhere inthe worldleast of allbeing prosperous in africadoing that so what's really happening isthey're just not building the the energyinfrastructure that they should beuh building well but as you said likethe financiers won't won't fund it a lotof it yeah yeahand it's part of the esg that's part ofthe evil of itand it'sit's this quasi-government quasi-privatephenomenon but it'sit's been it's one of the scariestthings it's maybe this for me thescariest thing because it's it's notjust governments it's privateorganizations going far beyond whatgovernments would doso our you know our government hasn'treally committed certainly we don't haveany laws saying net zero but ourcorporations have been saying net zerofor several years now and they've beenand people like larry fink arepressuring all these companies to makethese plans that voters would nevervote for and so you've got this unitedparticularly when you have someone likebiden in office you've got this front ofthis anti-fossil fuel president theseanti-fossil fuel corporationsanti-fossil fuel financial institutionsand so it's not lending to foreignplaces but even i know a lot of peoplein the coal industry like it's hard forthem to even get insurance nowand so the basic working infrastructureof our country is under threatby these by these policies and it's ithink of it as we're almost in anelectricity emergency right now you'rehaving all these reports oflikely outages or blackout risks aroundthe country because we've restricted alot of reduced fossil fuel capacity andincreasedunreliable solar and windand and esg continues to push people todo this they're contin it's now it'sgetting some pushback happily frommy mixed case elon muska guy blocked me on twitter for callingthe tesla a good fossil fuel carbut he's been good on this and you knowpeter thiel and other people have beenso it's it's good that there's pushbackand i would just say it's not a momenttoo soon because this is a terriblemovementand until the last year or two it had nopushbackexcept probably from some people in thebitcoin community and from mewell it's interesting though that uhthat the oppressionoffossil fuel building is largely monetarylike not being able to get insurancethat's a monetary thing right umnot being able to get loans i've heardof oil and gas executives saying well iwant to go and drill in this particularplace but the bank won't give me awayit's like part of their esg initiativeright they can't give out these loansthat um that seems very much umyou know like sort of making policythrough money or something like thatit's a i don't know what what do theycall it like a plutocracy or somethingit's it's a scary thing and it's it'sit's hard to untangle so there's a lotof government involvement but it's howmuch of that is government how much ofthat is social pressure but it's in anycase it needs to be morallycondemned i mean if we've learnedanything it should beyou cannot shut down your reliableenergy infrastructure until you have aproven replacement that's actuallyworking versus biden's thing is hepromises this amazing replacementbut he doesn't make the replacement hejust shuts down the keystone xl pipelineand hebans leasing and he threatens theindustrythat ishorrific that's that's what's caused theenergy crisis is thisis you restrict what worksin in favor of the promise that youdon't know works and it turns out not toworkyeah and uh it certainly hashad some serious consequences uh withinthe electrical grid i i think i saw amap earlier today about like which onewhich states which areas of the countryat least here in the u.sum that areinlarge danger of power outages versusmoderate yeah i mean it's most of thewest it's uh kind of crazy becauseyou would think that those would be theleasti mean just given we know how to do itthis is a crazy thing thatwe know how to produce reliableelectricityand for those who think it's a climateissue we know how to do it in arcticconditions we know how to do it andreally hot you can do it in singapore sothis idea that oh texas is too hot likehow are we going to produce electric orit's too coldhow could you produce it in a texasfebruary stormit just it justit shows you it's all policy that's oneway or another that we have policiesthat are preventing us from doingsomething that's pretty easy to do giventhe state of knowledge and technologyand yetand one thing i want to encourage ispeople should be outraged by thisand they should consider it embarrassingthat we have throughout the uswe're worried about can we keep thelights onin the summer like this isn't thomasedison just built the first powerstation right we're way past thatit shouldn't be a question at alland yet we're clearly regressing and sothat's that's in one of the benefits ofthis is it's an occasion to questionwho are we trusting as an expert on thisand and maybe we shouldn't if ourdesignated experts have led us to thepoint where we're worried about keepingthe lights on in america of all placessomething has gone very wrong well solet's go back to the that designatedexperts because that that exists in theeconomic realm that exists in the energyrealm that exists in all kinds of thingscan you just replace them because in asense they're appointed for a particularpurpose yeah as far as i can tellthey serve the narrative of the peoplethat pay them instead of you knowseeking the truth as you have so so justso my terminology so the systemthe system by which we getexpert knowledge and guidance i call theknowledge system so that's theresearchers the synthesizersdisseminators and the evaluators are thepeople who tell you this is reallycrucial what do you doabout what's true so if we're causingmore drought with climate what do you doandyou really have to always watch at thatstep same with covert like okay there'sa new virusit's dangerous to a certain degreeuh we don't have pre-existing immunitywhat do you do about it whatever answerthere is to what it isit does not follow you need to lockeveryone downthat's an evaluation and you always haveto question the evaluation so wheneveranyone tells you the scientists say do xyou know you're being conned becausenothing science says can tell you whatto do it could just factor into what you can do so there's this wholesystem and the people who are who arerepresenting the whole systemare what i call the designated expertsso it would be i use an example of thisguy michael mann who he's when we saylisten to the scientists he's adesignated expert who supposedly speaksfor all scientists and all good thinkingabout thatand i point out these designated expertsare really bad and that they ignore thebenefits and they have a really badtrack record of catastrophizing the sideeffects of fossil fuelsand in other fields you have these toosocan you just replace them well if youidentify what's going wrong with themand what's going wrong with the thebroader system people can be on thelookout for better experts like i'mtrying toi'm trying to become like the designatedenergy expert or certainly one of themin the society and part of what i'mdoingi'm not in i'm not doing it very gentlyeither right i'm saying the existingones are corruptthey theythey are based on this they have thisanti-human way of thinking that i callthe anti-impact framework they'reignoring the benefits of fossil fuelsthey're catastrophizing side effectsthey've caused an energy crisisincluding a growing food crisis you gotto get rid of these people and they'renot apologizing they're not repentingyou got to get rid of these people andyou need people on a human flourishingframework andi'm one of themsoi think you need to do that in otherfields i think it's like you disagreewith a financial establishment it's asimilar thing it depends on howsignificant you disagree if you justdisagree on facts then you can workwithin their framework but if you thinkno the way you're thinking about this istotally wrong you have a job ofdiscrediting the existing experts whichthat's what chapters one through threeof this book doand then you wanna and then you sayhere's how an expert should actuallyfunction here's what their frameworkshould beand then you say okay now let's look atthe facts from this framework and it'sit's it happens though right i mean youhave different people with a different imean we used to have like you knowgenetics experts who are racists andthat was considered totally okay wellyeah eugenics used to be actually quitepopular yeah exactly well and you knowjust racism in general in science usedto be really popular and so these thingscan change and part of it is youdiscreditthe wrong thing and then you offer apositive alternativewell often times ityou need the designated experts that arecurrent to die offers before the newdesignated experts yeah what is it likescientific progress is is measured infunerals yeah something like that rightthat's right yeah i'm not that patientbecause i'm not that youngi think i'm probably about to be 42 so ithink i'm above average age on the i'msure i'm above average age on the planetso these people are not old enough forme to be happy to wait for them to dieso i have to eviscerate them while we'reall aliveand we've got the internet so you can dothings everything more quickly and uhand you you can also get a followingmore quickly without necessarily goingthrough the official channels which isuh which is part of what this book isall aboutum all right so i uh i want to runsomething else by you so um we're seeinga labor shortageall over the world right like i i i wasjust in amsterdam airport andtheyconstantly made announcements about howthey had a staff shortage and thatall of the services were just taking wayway longer soall the lines were like an hour too longand even to get food or something likethat it took like 30 minutesumand part of that uh seems to be at leastafter reading your book the the thoughtoccurred to me that okay if energy doessort of like multiply the productivityof labor so each person instead you knowyou bring up in your book how um youknow a combine harvester does the workof like a thousand people so instead ofneeding 1 000 people you just use oneperson and justyou know feed that machine with lots ofenergy and you you can you don't need athousand people anymore and all thoseother people are free to go and makepodcasts or whatever um or medical curesuh right uh but what what we have hereis uh is a labor shortage andnot coincidentally we've also had umsomething of an energy shortage comingin um you know partly due to wars anduh partly due to you know shutting downnuclear power plants and so on uh whatdo you think of this idea that laborshortages are really likeat least partly energy costi think of themi haven't thought this throughsystematically but i think of them bothas evidence of freedom shortagebecause we have you know lack ofcertainly with fossil fuels lack offreedom to invest in produce andtransport themthat's really clear and then you have anincrease in demandyou have an increase in demand postpandemicand soand and supply can't meet it but it'sit's artificial political type thingsthe labor thing is really interestingagain i haven't studied itsystematically but yet all i mean allthe lockdown stuffand then you have all the anti-freedomstuff of subsidizing people not to workand you've got a lot of anti-workrhetoric as well and like you shouldonly do work if it'slike you regard it as the mostmeaningful thing ever and this kind ofthing which long term that's greatsobut yeah i mean i just like we shouldmaybe here's what i would saythe world the fact that the world ismalfunctioning so badly right now withwhat they call the supply chain crisisthat is definitely an anti-freedomcrisis because this does not happenunder freedom where you have troubledoing all of these basic thingsand it's like the electricity crisis weshould be embarrassedand we should consider it completelyintolerable versuseven you know sake the former presssecretary would make fun of it like ohyou're worried about getting yourtreadmill or something like that it'slike oh wow your word is delayed by freeno you should be worried you should beworried if a modern civilization can'tdeliver your damn treadmillin two months that's a real problem so ii think and this is related to thefinance stuff too like we have a freedomshortage in the worldand we're seeing these consequencesincluding inflation and i think now isthe time for pro-freedom people to seizethe narrative and energyand finance in every and every realmwellspeaking of inflation the other thing iwanted to ask you about is uminflation does sort of like eat away atthe value that you're producing and ithink that that that's pretty obvious uhwhat what struck me about uh you knowyour analysis of energy is thatwell we've been getting really good atextracting energy from fossil fuels fora while um you know i was readingfor example umon airplanes right they they figure outways to get like one or two percent moreefficiency out ofan airplane every year they're just liketiny things that they figure out it'slike okaywe i don't know like screw in this boltharder or something like that andlighter materials better engines yeahfor surebut somehow they they just makeeverything more and more efficient umand you know you're you're able toextract the energy more um it seems tome that likewhat we should be feeling if we didn'thave all of these all of this progressis you know just things get way moreexpensive as inflation goes up and youknow we we suffer but it seems to havebeen offsetby essentially energy gains right likeallall of the ways in which uh like forexample fracking is a major one whereyou knowyou got a lot more energy out of youknow umout of the grounduh for a lot uh and and had a lot moreabundanceinan increase in productivity that sort oflike offsets inflation a little bit yeahthat's your experience of the inflationi mean in general more broadly anythingthat increases yourproductivity per unit of timeis going tomake the consequences of inflating thecurrency less obvious to people becausethey don't seehow much richer they would be if youweren't inflating it but at the otherhand there's also just all these issuesand the austrian school is interestingabout this is just when you inflate it'slike how it how it misallocates capitalin all sorts of ways and do we have abloated financial sector and this kindof thing andinflation is a mess and it's really coolto me that i've believed this for a longtimebut i've been against fiat money for along time but it's it's exciting to methat the bitcoin world has really founda way to demonizefiat money and i talk in my book aboutarguing to 100 on fossil fuels and howto reframe it i think bitcoin is a greatmodelfor in terms ofyou guys really had a positive vision ofhere's what a much better world wouldlook like currency wiseand the way to get there is thesepro-bitcoin policies including i guessbuying it as part of that but there areother reformsyou know versus what the old austriansused to do which was mostly just argueagainst fiat moneyand say like oh if only we returned tothe gold standard which there was noreally concrete thing you could doto support that so i regard a lot of itas arguing to zero they're just sayingoh it's bad for this reason it's betterand you guys gave this new positivevision but as a result of that fiatmoney has also been denigrated in a waythat i never imagined would happenduring my lifetime was a realachievement well so explain the arguingto zero versus arguing to 100 kind ofthing because i i thought that was avery powerful part of the bookand i i think what a lot of people thatdo argue for more fossil fuels andagainst all of the stupid climatepolicies or whateverum they end up stuck in the arguing tozero whereas i think you make theargument that we should be arguing to ahundred um so can you explain that sureand i would say it's but it's notablethere aren't many people who argue formore fossil fuels usually what they dois they argue against policies torestrict fossil fuels so even therethere's a defensive versionso arguing to 100 means that you arguethat a given course of action willadvance an inspiringmoral goal so the moral goal is the 100and i think of it as every conversationhas a moral goala good thing and then a moral eviluh the bad thing so the classic examplei use just not to support it or not butit's just the example of donald trumpbecause i think it was a very effectiveexample wherewhen he came into the debate it wasframed as 100 was more equality andnegative 100 was more inequality that'sdefinitely how clinton and the democratswere framing it and we want to move to amore equal society like economicequality in particularand imagine if he had justuh agreed with that framing and hesupports say more freedom for industryand pro-business policieshe couldn't havehe couldn't really win all he could dois they propose a policy that says heythis is you know this socializedmedicine will get us to 100.he can just say oh that won't work forsome reason and i call that arguing tozero so you're just trying to say thatyour your attempt to pursue 100 won'tworkbut you don't you don't have your owninspiring thing you're just saying no totheirs whereas what he actually did ishe reframed it in terms of a hundred wasamerican greatness so he had thatexpression make america great again andnegative 100 was american decline and sothen he could argue oh my immigrationpolicy is getting us toward greatnessand oh my foreign policy is getting usand my economic policy my healthcarepolicy and you can see it's just a muchmore powerful way to argue where youdefine the good and the badversus you allow the other side too andso in fossil fuels the way good isdefined today for most people is thegoal is to eliminate co2 emissions andthe evil is to use more fossil fuels andif you accept thatthen you can never advocate more fossilfuels you can just shoot down a policyyou can just say oh the paris accord istoo expensivefor the u.s or this solar company won'twork but you they control the directionbecause you're still going toward 100and away from negative 100 so what i'vedone is i'm saying no i rejecti reject as 100 eliminating co2emissions why should that be our goalthat doesn't make any sense eliminateco2 emissions at all costsit should and then i have you know itshould be advancing human flourishingaround the world and in particularexpanding human empowerment having morepeople have cost effective energy and ifthat's the goalthen yes more fossil fuels is obviousand so you can argue to 100 and theother side has to argueto zero so you know in bitcoin there'sthe equivalent of you always have avision or a goal and then you have apolicy that achieves it you have apositive vision a positive policy versusacceptingtheir positive vision and then justtrying to shoot down their positivepolicy yeah and that that is i think wayway more effective and uh and hopefullyif you haven't uh you know picked up acopy of alex's book you really need togo read it because it's uh mind-blowingin many many different ways it justmakes clear some very common sensicalthings that iuh that i i wish i could havearticulated before reading the book umand you know just thinking about all ofthe benefits of fossil fuels um and i idid try to write that in the bitcoinmagazine article i wrote a few weeks agobut that that uh it's it's got a wealthof resources you guys should definitelycheck it out um so where can people findyou where can people contact you alexso you can get information about thebook at fossilfuture.com obviously youcan order it on amazonas well but like if you want to orderbulk or anything like that i'll have allthe latest at fossilfuture.comi'm really big on twitter so i hope youpromote this on twitter and i'll shareit so i'm at alex epstein on twitterand then i think the other thing is ihave a website calledenergytalkingpoints.com where you cangetreally so this is a 420 page bookthat's like a systematic energyre-education and i think it's valuableand i think it'll be amazing for you ifyou read itbut i also think it's valuable to havetwitter length talking points on everyissue so energytalkingpoints.com is freeand you can go there get on that mailinglist and you can search any issue youwantand get like here's a well-referencedpoint on it so i likeyou going from the most extreme in-depththing to like these laser-focusedtalking points so i think that that'llgive you the right i'm trying to createresources that everyone can useto think more clearly and to be morepersuasive on these issues and so that'sthat's the gamut of the bookenergytalkingpoints.com and then me ontwitter those are the three all rightwell that was uh i wow it's been over anhour and it went really fast so thankyou for thanks for having me yeah",
