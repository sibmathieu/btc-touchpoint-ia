well you're gonna have to managecash flow I mean you have to manage cashflow right now in terms of balancingincoming inventory outgoing sales andsalaries that happen on three differenttimescaleswe're simply talking about changing someof those timescales and it's going torequire new processes is going torequire new software it's going torequire new accounting and it's going toopen up new opportunities it's not asuseful if you're a company that isreceiving cash flow streams that come inon a per product basis an inventorythat's coming in on a per monthly basisto try to pay your employees on apermanent basis that's gonna cause yousome cashflow nightmares absolutely butyou know companies manage cash flowtoday and sometimes the product salesare delayed and then sometimes theinventory doesn't arrive and they useinvestment money and operational capitalto bridge the gap between the two so youjust do that but on a different timescale yes think about it we're all goingto be thinking about it for the next twodecadesyeah just-in-time delivery and a lot oftime based services lending as wellborrow more when you need it rotatingcredit accounts yeah I mean the theideas that can come out of this arepretty much endless not all of them willbe practical but we'll see yes we haveseen that we see it one of the firstdemonstration applications for a paymentchannel was called streamium dot IOwhich is a video streaming service thatallows you to pay for as much videos youwatch on a per minute basis of billingso you put a deposit for what you thinkyou're going to watch let's say 30minutes and then every minute of videothat you receive you your your browserapplication signs a new transaction thatpays for that minute and then at the endof the stream when you disconnect orwhen they disconnect the lasttransaction represents your balance soin the actual stream yes so streamingvideo streaming courses for educationall kinds of applications like thatcould be transformed and I think that'stime-based service could be transformedin in many ways using this technology ifyou try to tie it to DRM digital rightsmanagement you're going to find out thebasic rule of DRM which is DRM doesn'twork because I can stream that videowhile holding a camera in front of myscreen and then redistribute it for freeit's not going to change the fundamentalthing that if my eyes can see it so cana camera if my ears can hear it so can amicrophone and copying information ischeap and easy it doesn't change thebasic piracy DRM competition of what itdoes is allows artists and contentcreators to be able to connect directlywith their audience without using aplatformbecause one of the main reasons theseplatforms exist is because they have toa grenade to a level of two or threefour or five or six dollars which is theminimum you can charge on a credit cardso the credit cards cause centralizationof these platforms my questions aroundhow you think the chain might apply todeveloping economies and particularlybottom of the pyramid business modelscoupled with things like microfinanceproducts as just wondering how you seethat potentially changing the well withsome of the poorest economies I thinkit's going to have that impact but it'sgoing to take a while and part of thereason it's going to take a while isbecause the places where this technologywill be most applicable at places whereyou have this particular combination ofextremely technological infrastructureliteracy among the population numeracyamong the population and accessopportunity to use this technology nowmost of you here look younger than I amI remember my first cell phone forgottenin London it was 1991 I was reallyexcited because it was the firstgeneration of cell phones we didn't comewith a suitcase attached I am not jokingsome points before then or a handsetconnected twisted cases my cell phonewas about this bigbefore you extracted the antenna itworked in a half-mile radius aroundcentral London it had an awesome talktime of 20 minutes and a standby time ofan hour 3 which means it could only beplugged in which means it wasn't amobile phonehow long before every Kenyan farmerevery Polynesian price person everysub-saharan Africa hunter every in witon a snowmobile has a globally connectedcellphone with at least the basics adata plan or an SMS plan took about 15to 20 years and if you look at thetechnology right then you'd say it's tooexpensive it's too bulky it doesn't haveenough range only rich people are usingthat guess rock the ultimate statussymbol of a mobile phone is todaysomeone else carrying it if I'm walkingalong and I haven't touched the cellphone in a week and my assistant carriesthe cell phone I have arrived that'swhat it means to be rich it means younever touch your cell phone and if youwere a Bluetooth headset you're ablue-collar trades person right rememberwhen those with status symbols notanymorethat transition took a long time and ifyou didn't see it at the beginningthrough lack of vision you looked at theflaws of the technology the scale of thetechnology but cell phones like manytechnologies were on an exponentialcurve every two years half the priceevery two years twice the range everytwo years twice the battery life twicethe bandwidth and if you do that for 20years you get a thousand X improvement a2000 X improvement we're going to seethat happen with Bitcoin people areupset today and they say like fees arehigh yes fees are high this Bitcoinwon't work for micro payments they'renot going to stay that way we're goingto reach the next level of scale and atsome point fees are going to be muchmuch lower again and then they're goingto be much too highand it's going to oscillate back andforth but this technology is moving onan exponential curve we will domicrofinance we will reach every cornerof the planet and the best reason forthat is because every one of those cellphones that's out there is now a bankone day it will be used as such andthat's going to change the world[Music]you",
