One that is even more rare, but makes up the equivalent of the Navy Seals or Special Forces in this battle.They’re the ruthless mother fuckers who will not bend, and they are the white blood cells who are first in line to defend Bitcoin, and all it stands for.You don’t just start out as a Pleb. You evolve into one, but again, it requires some innate predispositions (as per what I’ve listed below).So let’s examine attributes of a Bitcoiner.These are things I’ve noticed as a commonality amongst many I’ve met + interacted with:Bitcoiners Are / Believe in:Naturally intelligentFirst principles thinkersSystems thinkingCriticalExtremeRenegade WittyProduction oriented Low time preferenceHigh standardsHonest CuriousConvictionContrarianMemeologistsFocusedFrontier orientedCourageousIntegrityLiberty SovereigntyGiving / CaringStrong moral compassMissionaries (not mercenaries)HumblePrivate / Privacy AdvocatesIndividualistRadicalNow…let’s look at the Plebs.They are generally all of the above (to a more extreme degree), and they are also:BrutalBluntAbrasiveToxicCarnivorousDeadliftersIntolerant of stupidity & scammers Next level memeologistsSingle-minded DefendersUnwaveringThe ResistanceWarriorsIt truly takes a special breed of person to cover off being a Bitcoiner, and encompassing the traits of intelligence that comes with that, whilst also having the courage to stand up for what’s right, and be the immovable object in a world of meandering shit.Do some of us seem to go overboard sometimes? Sure...But it comes with the territory.When the 300 Spartans drew that fucking line, they too went overboard, but that’s what the situation called for.Nobody is perfect, neither are the Defenders that stand between you and the world of scammers, parasites, bankers, wankers, statists, socialists, deranged leftists and governments who are out to suck you dry of your time, your energy & of course, your Bitcoin.But the Plebs, Bitcoiners, Maximalists & the most Toxic Supremacists of us out there is the first line of defense. The world will be thankful one day when it looks back on this period of history.They’ll admire the courage we showed in the face of what may seem insurmountable odds.If you’re a Bitcoiner & if you’re a pleb, I’m glad to be on this journey with you, at this particular point in time. We are indeed early, and having conviction when it’s early is hard.Our stance is contrarian today, but if we continue to stand strong, we will change the world tomorrow.The ClapsIf you liked this, give it the claps & share it around.You can follow me on Twitter & Medium too (links below).I also strongly recommend you check out the following & download yourself a free copy of The Bitcoin Times (link below).The rise of the individual.The Fall of the Statemedium.comDownload the full guide at:The Bitcoin Times(Soon to be updated to: https://bitcointimes.news)Follow The Bitcoin Times on Twitter @TimelessBitcoin:The ₿itcoin TimesThe latest Tweets from The ₿itcoin Times (@TimelessBitcoin).
