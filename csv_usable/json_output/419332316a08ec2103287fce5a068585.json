flight as themfrom New York to Riga it was hilariousseeing him and his wife and their sixchildrenHome Alone through the airport to makethe flightsix kids wow goals good for himsoI mean the reason we're here we're hereto talk about what you're doing which issomethingscares some people scared my wife I'mnot gonna lie oh fair enoughis that way I'm gonna come back with abunch of skin care products that aremade fromum from Pig lardwell we don't have a bunch of productsbut you don't need a bunch when theywork really good yeah so how'd you getinto this what do you do I guess I'msitting down with Charles Mayfield fromFaroyeah it's the Northeast uh it's all gooddude it's the Northeast accent comingoutI appreciate it uh how did you get intothisand uh the the short version of the longstory is uh I made a transition fromuh fitness health and fitness in a gymtopromoting health and fitness throughfoodand that attracted me to farmingand then I had the [ __ ]can we can we curse on this yeah myapologiesum I got a really bad sunburn in 2019.um having you know a decade plusexperience and sort of Health Nutritionandum and seeing people make dietarychanges and and and have physicalchanges manifest lose weight this goesaway you know various we were talkingabout you know certain skin conditionsthis morning before we hopped on and soanyway I had this experienceof um being experimental and also reallypaying attention to the um to whathappens and so yeah I got really reallysunburned Martyand I came home uh now X and I weregoing through our divorce soum sort of house is empty I'm sunburnedI live in a small town really small townso all the drug stores are closed it'syou know one of those late nights and Ihaveyou know over a decade experiencecooking healthy cooking and lifestylestuff and I had a Char of lardand my refrigerator that I had renderedfrom my pigsthat we raised we raised you knowpastured pork beef chickenmicro on a micro scale butyou know probably about 45 50 customersthat sort of leaned into us for meatanywayyeah I got a really bad sunburn and thensort of an activedesperation and uh trial and error Ilathered up with this stuff and a coupledays later the sunburn was gonethat was really coolbut I never peeledand that's you know you learn to in yourhealth and nutrition you sort of whensomething happens youyou pause and you pay attention youstart taking notesand so yeah I watched my skinfor probably two or three weeksthinking at some point you know thethe snakes got to peel never happenedand so I started experimenting withmaking skin care products out ofpasture pig fatand uh here we are three two and a halfthree years laterit's two questions number one how'd youget the Sunburn and number twothis act of desperation to start rubbinglard on you was there something thatyou've heard in the past like ah it'sgood for your skin or are you just likeoh this looks like it'd be soothingwell soso what was I doing uh we had we starteda hemp company in 2019 uh in fact partof our skin care bundleis uh we we use I call it a skincareElixir so we're sort of highlighting thebenefits ofCBD ingestionum as it relates to skin but we're sowe're in the middle of the throes ofjumping into theum almost like the gold rush but thehemp Rush of 2019 and uh we had on againI'll never forget the day on July the4thuh uh go America on July 4th we hadplanted about 20 acres of hemp we endedup planting almost 300 but in that daywe got 20 acres in the grounduh drip taped the whole nine yards soread it ready to rockthat evening we flipped the switch on toirrigate itand the irrigation's not performing andso me and one guy stayed up all nightfixing the irrigation otherwise suncomes up the next day and 20 acres ofHampstead like it needs a lot of waterearlyso anyway you know you just you justforget togo back to the house or put sunscreen onor any of that stuff so I was I was outin the fields for two straight dayseffectively and um so that's how I gotsunburned and thenum I'm almost 49 years old Martyum but I grew up in Small Town Tennesseebut we would go to the beach every yearmy mom's from mobile and I have fondmemories of my mom got buying aloe veraand putting it in the refrigerator I doas well right and because it because ifyou're sunburned it's cooland so there were a bunch there were abunch of things that pointed me tomaybe I should try this pig fat it's inthein the refrigerator because it's cooland it'll be soothing and so umso yeah and you knowat some level it's kind of intuitiveright I mean like I know enough aboutpigs like we train surgeons on pigs Idon't know if you knew that or notno I didn't know pigs are so geneticallysimilar to human beings that we trainour surgeons on themand uh filovadia you know Phil Dr ovadiahe's got a great book I fix Hearts Iknow Phil very well he's a heart surgeonand um I've heard of that book yeah yeahit's great great book stay off myoperating table is the is the title ofthis book but anyway I've known Phil fora long time I was on his I was on hispodcast early in in Pharaoh'sJourney and uh you know they're askingabout this I was like Phil you try youknow he's heart surgeon it's like youtrain on pigs it's like actually I usethe the valve from a pig heart two weeksago to repair the valve in a human heartso the biology there is soaligned yeah this is uhmight make people a bit queasy but mybrother uh played college lacrosse andhe wantstook a very hard shot to the netherregions and had to get a surgery downthereand now he's part pickoh nice yeah they sewed up one of his uhone of his guys with some pig skinthat that again that ummy condolences and and they still workuh yeah yeah that'sum so yeah the point isuhpigs arepigs are four-legged humans in in manymany respects so if you raise a healthyhappy I've been cooking with lard for anumber of years you know I mean this isthe this is the background in sort ofPaleolithic nutrition things of thatnature sothere were a lot of signs pointing towhy why wouldn't you try it I um youever hunted been huntingI'm uh embarrassed to say no that's okayit's okay I've grew up hunting and uhyou know again you think about all thethings that sort of go through your headthat point you towards a jar of lard inyour refrigerator you know if you'veever uhgutted and cleaned a deer after you'vehunted you know if you don't have gloveson which why would you wear glovesyou're covered in like thissinewy subcutaneous fatbecause it's getting the animal out youknow we've all got this fat so there area lot of signs that sort of pointed metowards give it a whirl andI mean now it worked so and he made awhole company out well yeah so that wasin 19 it took about two years so it'sfunnyso yeah we say it pharah the Lord worksin mysterious waysum so I you know I have this littleEpiphany and this I didn't peel and sowhat do you do you go to the Internetmachine and how do I make cream out offat so a lot of the early stuff we didwasfor your listeners that don't know go toany drugstore and buy any any cream offthe shelf first ingredients waterthen there's another 40 ingredients ofwhich will include a fat and it willinclude an emulsifier because you haveto bind the water to the to theyou know oil and water don't want to mixso you got to emulsify them and so youknow again I had this Epiphany momentso for I've probably spent already sixmonths in my kitchenemulsifying lard with water I'd usebeeswax I used a couple of differentemulsifiersjust tinkering that's I spent my entirechildhood in my dad's Workshop in mymom's kitchen so I'mreally at home and happy when my handsare busy and so yeah I was just playingaround playing around I could never keepthe earlycreams from from not going to Rancidyou know I'd make I'd make thislusciously amazing cream and five sixdays later it's full of mold andbacteriasoaddanti-microbial essential oils add thisadd thatstill couldn't keep them shelf stableput them in the fridgeand it finally occurred to me two thingsthat occurred to me one is I'm not achemist and I really I don't I I've gotthis 10-year 15-year background andtelling people if you can't pronouncethe name of it don't eat itso again looking at these labels like Idon't want to researchwhich paraben-based you knowpreservatives so uh the light bulb wentoff again you know it's the water it'sfeedingthe mold and bacteria get rid of thewaterso at that pointumkicked the water out brought in somebeef Tallow for your listeners thatdon't know that so the all-natural skincare Market which is still just afraction of a fraction of the of theoverall skin care industry is dominatedby beef Tallowso beef Tallow is the rendered kidneyfat from from from a cow or steer bulland I love Tallow we used Tallow in ourproducts at room temperature Tallow ishard it's it's very balmy and so at roomtemperature lard is very creamy and soyou I know you've opened sort of thestuff I brought you today butso I I kicked the water out and broughtsome Tallow in and started playing withlike the ratios because people like acreamyumuh they likecreamand so uh so yeah started kick the wateryou've cooked bacon before right yes siryeah what do you do when you finishcooking the bacon you take the drippingsand you pour them in a cup yeah we havea nice uh copper cup that we put oh bigtime we pour our uh our bacon greaseinto bacon grease into and then it cansit there right for weeks months and notgo bad there's no water in there it'sjust fatyeah we let it build up oh yeah actuallythe best part you let it build up andthen you've got like this layer layeredeffect of like well here's the bacondrippings froma month ago and here's last week andhere's this morning soumour products don't smell like bacon nowthat unscented they're unscented we havea scented productbut uh but yeah so I I don't where do westart herewith this last question why why youdecided to put lard on you oh yeah wellit works yeah wellif you go to your sitepharaoh.life yep yepum it seems like there's a lot ofscience yet too I mean we talked aboutlike the piguh being very similar to human bodysurgeonspractice on pigs heart valvestesticle encasings whatever it may beand that's one thing you say the skin ofa pig is most like that's human skin ismost similar if you're looking atanother animal too pigskinyes so pigs metabolize vitamins a e andDmechanistically the same way humans dosun exposure and proper diet and youknow environmentand they store those vitamins in theirsubcutaneous fat which is where werender for lard and umyeah it'son on many in many respects it's hyperintuitive what I'm doing and at the sametime everyone's like what the hell manyou want me to put wood on my face so[Music]umyeah it's um pigs are an amazing animalyou know I've spent a little over sixyears in the regenerativeuh farming side of the house you knowPharaoh really represents a aconvergence of healthy eating lifestylehealthy farming lifestyleI would even add into that sort of antiuhpreservative chemicalso all of that sort of convergesand uh and the products are amazing sowe've I've been in town I'm in in townfor the we just wrapped up the JohnBush's Live Free Academy thingum so I was presenting there I'm hangingout with you todayand uhback home tomorrowbut I've been spreading the lard manjustso that's why we're hereit seems very important because youmentioned like it as a nutritionist yourecommend don't eat anything you can'tpronounce and similarly like that's onething I thinkI become more attuned to like probablythe last five years because I go tothe beach every summer spend threemonths there from Memorial Day to LaborDay I'm a pale Irishman who does notreact well to the Sun get a similar tothat get a base burn like all my baseburn every year yep like early June Ipeel get a bad sunburn I don't like toput sunscreen on even though my familyit's been beaten into US you got to doit you're going to get melanoma if youdon't runs in our family and I've becomeconvinced in the last five years it'sactually the laddering of the sunscreenthat is aand all the chemicals involved in itthat are probably worse for you and justfiguring out a way to protect your skinin a better wayand one of the big memes right now islike seed oils if you stop eating seedoils your skin willuh not burn as much if at alland then now something like this youwere using the lard to sort of cool downyour summer does it prevent it at all aswellwell you can you can get in a lot oftrouble in my line of work making claimsabout your products but uh oh listen Ihad when we built the website I had aproducts liability attorney review allthe copy right because you you can saysoothes you can't say heels you can sayrelieves you can't say treats you knowit's all this all thisvernacular out thereumin your experience what has happenedwhat's that and your experience has likehave you had a bad maybe that's thequestion have you had a bad sunburnsince well so I guess the original no Ihave notum we have a com a whole lot of stuffthat kind of sort of compounds up intosunburnum like I I tell so in your in theexample of you if you've got a lot ofIrish jeans no question you're way moresensitive I'm I'm I've got a lot of uhSpanish blood in me and so uh you knowthose are two differentlineages of sun exposure right I tellpeople to generally be smart ourancestors hundreds of years ago uhdidn't have sunscreen they were alsosmart enough to stay the hell out of theSun from 11 30 in the afternoon untiltwo or three you know I'm not sayingthey weren't working or doing somethingbut they weren't outthey certainly weren't out with theirshirt off by the pool right that's afairly new human phenomenon uh we'rewe're totally addicted with like the sunand the lifestyle and getting thatcopper tan I get all that but justpeople being smarter aboutabout staying hydrated you know firstand foremostthe rule of thumb for your for yourlisteners out there is if your Shadow istaller than you aresay it another way if your Shadow isshorter than you are then that you areuh at a time of day and a place on theEarth where you can get sunburned I'venever heard that one yeah like it's agood rule of thumb because you knowyou're not always the sun's not alwaysgoing to burn you if it's low enough inthis guy like right now you know it'swinter here the sun really never getshigh enough in the sky for you to getthethe intensity required to give you asunburn and so that's that's somehelpful information if your Shadow isshorter than you are than you are insunburn eligibility ZoneumI don't use sunscreen anymoreuh they're made with seed oils they'remade with preservatives this is aphenomenon so the microbiome is anotherphenomenon we're learning about[Music]umit's sort of the New Frontier all thelittle bugs and critters that live onand in our skinwell they're there for a reason we'renot necessarily sure the reason but we've co-evolved with this five to sevenpounds ofmicrobiotic creatures uh living in andon our skin and again my creams when Imix them with water they would get moldyand bro bacteriaokay well if I have to put something ina cream to keep bacteria from growingand then I spread that same cream on myskin I'm effectively napalmingthese microorganisms that live on myskinyou know why are they there well I don'tknowbut they're there and we've been aroundfor a whileum why do we why do we have such anincreased incidence of skin cancermelanoma sunburn uh in the in in thesame 30 to 40 time year time periodwhere the SPF level on sunscreens has uhquintupled you know when I grew upagain I was spending time at the beachwith my with my family I can still smellit I can close my eyes and smell thePanama Jack Banana Boat like coconutsmellingsuntan oilwhen I was a kid there was no such thingas sunscreenit's just oil there was there was numberfour number six number eight number tenand number 12 oil and the higher thenumber the more the protection you hadso the darker you wanted your skinmy dad was a number six Panama Jack likeyou know and I could still smell it butso you know that was 30 30 35 years agoand look look at the you know theconstant upgrades of SPF sun protectionFactor the Irish are like SPF 50 MaximusI'm sure they are they should be theyshould be but as as as sunscreen use hasgone up as sun protection Factor hasgone up so have the incidence of skincare skin cancerthat shouldn't be happening yeah soyeah that'sit's funny because it is this like memein the in the Irish Beach goingcommunity that like you need to put iton you're going to get cancer well mygrandmother died of melanomaumand that freaks obviously my family outwhen they look at all of us they're likeyeah lather up she got skin cancer forbeing in the sun going to the beach it'slike ahfor most of my life I was like yeahlather up and now more recently as Ibecome more attuned tojust be smarter yeah I mean you knowhere's some advantages today uh we'vegot all this tactical lightweightclothing that's what I do the SPF shirtsoh yeah we're just wearing hats and justbeing smart I mean look you need your 15minutes of sun exposure every day justlike the rest of usyou might only need about 10 or 15 someother people with darker you know me forme it's maybe 30. I enjoy a couple hoursthoughabsolutely but enjoy it wisely you knowinstead of SPF creams put on a tacticalshirt that's lightweight breathable youcan go in and out of the water I meanwe've got so many Tools in our exposurenow uh at our disposalumto just to allow us to be smarter aboutour relationship with with the sun yeahno not only the sun just like going backto likeI don't say vanilla but like justtypical skin careI think everybody rubbing all these Olaypotions on themselves andum I was telling you I haven't with myEczema like I really can't weardeodorant because it flares it up andthere's you look at the back of like OldSpice and it's same thing I'll read halfthe ingredients all of them yeah it's ifyou're buying it off I mean so we so wemake these creams sort of fresh likeready to orderand and and I've sort of done the mathwe can scale you know I mean you knowwe'd like to scaleour company but we can we can I meanlook around we figured Logistics out youcan click a button and order from Amazonor ubereats or I mean you know like andlike it's therelickety-split so the logistics side ofthe house we've got figured outglobally really but you know so I canmake you can order a a product from uson Monday it might not ship tillThursdaybut but you're what you're paying forwith with supporting a brand likePharaoh is you know we're going to handmake thisyou know it's going to get to you as asfresh as possibleumI mean you can eat our creamsthis is kind of fun we have fun withthat you know this large Tallow LeafFlorida honey essential oils in our inour scented we've got our own littleproprietary blend of everything butum you know at the end of the day youshouldn't be putting stuff on your skinyou wouldn't eat anyway because that'swhat you're doing your your skin is yoursecond stomach it's your largest organyeah so what's what's happening when youput this stuff on whether it betraditional skin creams orthe Pharaoh stuff like why shouldsomebody actually use skincare productsat all yep great question so and youknow again if anybody asked me I tellthem make sure you get enough water youknow try to remove uh thepro-inflammatory uh foods from your dietyou know the the seed or you mentionedseed oils earlier seed oils are highlyoxidative uh they're they have a reallywhacked out ratio between omega-6 andOmega-3 for your listeners that don'tknow omega-3 is the anti-inflammatoryfatty acid omega-6 is thepro-inflammatory you don't get onewithout the other they come in tandemhowever the the more stressed an animalis or the more refined uh various seedor plant-based oils are then you youhave a huge ratioum wild caught salmon which isyou know in the in the food world ispropped up as a highly nutritious formoffat uh has a great ratio of omega-6 toomega-3 fatty acids pasture raisedregenerative raised beef has a muchbetter ratio than the industrial feedlotraisedum beef just because again the stressesthat that the feedlot can put on theanimal among other factors but yeah wewant to we want to keepomega-3 as high as possible in omega-6as low as possibleand if you're not using skin care doesthat ratio get out of whackwell soso the Skin Care industrythis is another one of the intuitivebeauties of of our product the Skin Careindustry is a relatively new creationum I would I would make the argumentthat 200 years ago we'll just go back200 years which what do you think isthat four generations five generationstopsOkay soum200 years ago99.9 of the people that inhabited thisplaneton a weekly certainly monthly basiscertainly if they were an adulthad their hands uh elbow deep in thecarcass of an animalon a weekly monthly basis becausesomebody go out andHunt and Gather someone would bring ithome and have to skin itand prepare itfor consumption and you know you can goback thousands of years this has beenhappening for thousands of years but butcertainly200 years ago this is pre-refrigerationyou know you had to get that meatpreparedquickly and cooked quickly or salted andcured quickly and soyeah everybody was elbows deep in uh inanimal fat yeah on account is except theelitist of the elite of the elite uh Iwas you know again at this conferencehere that this past weekend and I therewas probably 400 people thereand that same question Phil the samequestion I was like 200 years ago 399 ofthe 400 people that are in this roomwould have had their their hands cuttheir covered in animal fat and then wecooked with it I mean if you think aboutall the situations whereour skin 200 years ago came in contactwith animal fatwe didn't have sunscreens 200 years agoif it was 12 30 in the afternoon Marty200 years agoif you were outside you had a hat on youwere fully like long sleevesyou know working out in the fields orworking in the garden or working in thewoodsumyou know it's a fairly new concept oflike taking half your clothes off andhanging out by a swimming pool but thepoint is the Skin Care industry hasevolved and it's its need hashas increased because fewer and fewerpeople come in contact with animal faton a regular basis ah this gets back tolike the microbiome living onyour skip so this okay so the Skin Careworld is dominated by three thingsfirst and foremost water and again Iwill challengeany one of your listeners going to anydrugstore anywhere in the country thereis not a shelf there's not a product onthe Shelf that's first degree is notwaterunless it's a oil-based serum that's youknow but but your deodorants your yourshampoos your any any skin care creammedicated and not if it's a creamthe first ingredient's water okay thenon the other end of thatis an oilso you got water and oil and if you'rein the skin care industry the oils thatthey're using are the cheapestnastiest in some cases the the the mostwidely availableunusable derivative from the petroleumindustryyou know and then in the middle of allthat are all these chemicals that umthat so so it's water it's seed oilplant oil based fats and then in themiddle are all these chemicals that thatpreserve and bind them yeah bind themand preserve them and you know we don'twe don't really know what some of theseendocrine disrupting parabens is onethat comes underconstant scrutiny and should we we don'tknowthe impact long-term of of thesecompounds on our skinumthe consumer protection side of skincarethe foundation for that started in 1938it's called the food and cosmetics Actand this is sort of the precursor to theFDA and a lot of other stuff but so in1938 they came out with this legislationsort of governing consumer protectionand at the time the only ingredients inskin care that required pre-markettesting for safety or color additivesnow this is 1938 right so we're gettingpretty good at making diesel gas andpulling it out of the ground and allthat but from a from afrom a consumer derivative productpetroleum industry we're in our infantstages rightso but that's the that's the preeminentact governing consumer protection forskin care they updated the act in 1974.excluded Cosmetics from the ACTright so so the legislation on the booksgoverning consumer protection in theskin care industrywas written in 1938excludes or includes color additives asthe only requirement for pre-markettestingall right and so think about what we'vebeen able to do technologically speakingwith all these hexanes and gas derivedthings in terms of all the stuff we canturn gasoline into right these micseverythingninety percent of the room we're sittingin is 100 of the room we're sitting inhis petroleum derived because whenyou're you're burning it to minesomething or whatever the case may be Imean the carbon Society we live in thisI get a little out of sorts with theenvironmentalists sometimes it's likethis zero carbon neutral footprint I'mlike listenthat's that's crazy it's not possiblelet's let's just get really efficient atusing these amazing assets we havebecauseyeahso solar power is is only going to getus so farand it's awesome and we should pursue itnuclear power is amazing yesum you know if you follow the work oflike a Robert lomberg or any of thesesort of globaleconomies basedsmart people that can look at theclimate and look atcarbon and look at and look atpopulation you know like what what arethe real issues we're facing todayumget a little tangentially off off trackhere I feel like but no but I think whatyou're getting to is likethe conflation of carbon production withpollutionyou should really focus on the pollutionand being as efficient as possible wellyeah andit's a good thing that the environmentis environmentalist is they conflate itthey say if you come out and you're likeno I think hydrocarbons are goodbut we should be efficient with it yeahlike I'm a pro fossil fuels guy thathatespollution and waste I like to considermyself environmentalist but if I mentionthat I'm Pro fossil fuel and I can't bean environmentalist you have to be Profossil fuel if you're pro-human rightand and you know it's it's like um wellthis drives me nuts the umyou have to be Pro fossil fuel if you'repro-human we have an obligation to be asefficientand and and smart with these amazinggifts we've been given I I like to lookat these so I'm I'm in the farming worldyou know and uh I don't know if you'veread uh sacred cows a good book for yourlistener uh Rob Wolfe and Diana Rogerssort of covercows get a lot of flackokay they're they're ruining theenvironment according to umpeople some people they're ruining theenvironment because they burp and fartright and that emits methane into theair and I listen we're we're we live ina day and age now where we're addictedto air quotes the science right well letme let me give you uh everyone in thein the audience a science lessonscience is amazing and if you reduce acomplicated process or system to afraction of its cycle and use science toanalyzea piece of thatyou're not you're not being honest withthe science or your audience and soCal's emit methaneand if you follow that methane across a10-year cycle it goes up into theatmosphere and eventually turns intowaterand that is a that is a closed-loopsystem that takes of roughly 10 years tohappenwell if you analyze the first two monthsof that 10-year closed-loop system allyou're talking about is emissions from acownotthis is part of a 10-year life cycle ofthis animalbuildingand enhancing the atmosphere yeah notonly the atmosphere but even the soil onthe ground like the regenerative farmingmovement has really highlighted thethe benefit of grazing cattle theirability to to re-green areasumthe the deepest richest soils in ourcountry that we've about mined down tonothingis in the Corn Belt this is the IowaNebraska if you look at where we growall of ourcrops you're talking about soil that wasbuilt over millenniaby herding bison followed by migratorybirds and so if I could surmisesummarizewhat we try to do with regenerativefarming is just mimicking a system likethat which is a short high intensegrazing periods followed by long periodsof rest right and so that's a lot ofwhat the holistic Land Management ethosof like an allen Savory or theregenerative farming ethos of like awhite oak pastures or polyface whatthey're trying to do is is mimic andalso Leverageleverage natural systemssoin a natural system you've got predatorsright the Wolves the the Bears that'sthat's what keeps hurting animalstogether tightand also moves them pushes them aroundso now we have modernlightweight poly wire fencing andportable electric energizers and allthese so we effectively become thePredator the gas pedal and the brake forthese animals and the coolest part aboutthat isumthis is a situation where you take anaturalsystem and enhance itlikeenhance the efficiency Mother Nature isvery efficienthey less investment and that's rightheavy industrialumlike machines that are necessary likethe White Oaks umwho runs that his name's this willHarris Will Harris yeah I mean his Roganepisode where they they showhow his regenerative farming affects thewater systemcompared to the Farms yes like adjacentto them so the the most compelling storyabout white oak so you're familiar withsome of these uh plant-based meatcompanies right and they claim like zerocarb emission blah blah blah blah or uhcarbon emissions and so the huhso there's an independent third-partylab that did the carbon emissionsuh program test analysis for beyondbeyond meat Beyond Burger whatever and Imay be getting this wrong but one ofthese plant-based meat companies thatcan claims you know carbon neutralwell so will Harris had that samethird-party lab come down I think theyspent like six or eight months at WhiteOak measuringhow much carbon was either emitted orsequesteredfrom his beefrightand what do they learn they learned thatevery pound of beef that rolls off theOff the Shelf at White Oak is actually anet carbon sequester so so their net netputting more carbon back in the soil sofor your listenersyou know we've got carbon dioxide in inthe air and plants breathe carbondioxide and turn that intoyou know photosynthesis they bring allthat together and turn it into grass andsoyou know cows come by and mow the grassand when they mow the grass they move onbut that grass has to regrow and soumif you think about like a pasture foryour listener so let's say you've gotpeople associated with like their theirlawns but when we say grasses we'retalking about feet of of pastured grassso imagine like that three feet of grassabove the ground well there's also threefeet of grass below the ground it's allthese roots and which are which arecarbon right that's carbon that's beenpulled out of the airturned into rootsand stretch and stretch and stretch sowhen that cow comes alongand takes that three foot plant andturns it into a one foot plant mows itwell here's what happens so plants wantsymbiosis they want homeostasis and so aplant that's gone from three feet to onefootwill nowLop offThe Roots under the ground it will takethat carbon that living and it willstore it it will it will get rid of itit'll shuck it off because it has tore-establish equilibrium there's only afoot of biomass above the groundI need to I need to shuck offotherwise I'm out of a certain amountthat's right I have to have to come backinto balance right and if plants are sosmartand so and so then what does it do wellI I gotta grow again so then itpulls more carbon out of the airand builds more roots and you just rinseand repeat that so technology excuse meallows us to take a natural system likeherding bison and migratory Birdsand ramp thatstack that up more and more and morelike we canwe can control the restthat this little spot of land gets andif we have a lot of rain we get we canput the cows back on it faster if it'sdrierlet it rest a little bit but you you getto evaluate and playPuppeteer to how fast can you weregenerate and build topsoil yeahand then the positive externality isfrom treating that soil correctlydoing it the way it's been done forMillennia like again going back to likethe water like it acts as naturalfiltrationsystem for Water Systems as well whereabsolutely places like Iowa Nebraskawhere you're completely decimating thesoil not only do you have bad soil butprobably have bad wateras well because it's not being filteredas much andthere's a bunch of published data outthere that wewill run out of topsoil I think the yearis 20 60.sothat's like less than a generation fromnowand if we run a topsoilwe're done sorry you're done so we'vegot I forget how many uh cubic tons oftopsoil that washes you know washes downthe Mississippi into the Gulf of Mexicoevery year we've killedwe've killed uh effectively a aswath of the Gulf of Mexico the size ofRhode Island with all of the runoffpesticides and herbicides and fungicidesumwell you know again there's a lot ofsynergy between the lack of consumerprotection and complete missing the boatbetween farming glyphosate that's theone that gets all the Press you knowthis Roundup Ready glyphosate okay soglyphosate is the active ingredient inRoundup it's 51 of therecipe okay and when they ran the testto see if this was safe for humans theyonly tested glyphosatenotthe concoction that is Roundup theytested glyphosate they do the same thingwith vaccines theythey test the standaloneyou knowanyway not really uh indexing for thecombination of oh they don't count forthat andum what does glyphosate say what doesroundup do kills weeds kills plants notjust weeds it's it's like Napalm itkillsalmost anything that'sphotosynthetically inclined we'll sayOkay soone of the early conclusions they drewis because humans don't metabolizeenergythrough photosynthesis we're blockingthis photosyntheticsystem right that's what kills the plantso we'll see humans don't do thatso it's it's intuitively safe for humansright now we'll do all our tests anywaybut we're just going to test glyphosatewe're not going to testRoundup but here's here's again we're atthe we're at the precipice of this froma scientists and pointing attentiontowards it but all those little bugsagain that live on and in our skinum that's exactly how they metabolizeenergyand and Thrive you know they have aphotosyntheticprocess that they rely on to survivesome of them not all of themso againdoesn't hurt humans but we forget thathumans have thisrelationship with all these little bugswell it's like a system right peopletalk about like the microbiome in thestomach it's all the same extremelyimportant it isI mean one can make a very strongargument and it is part of the human isthese this sort of Cooperative uhcollection of differentspecies I don't know species that I wearto our differentthere's way more DNA that doesn't belongto us living in our bodies than DNA thatbelongs to usum yeah I you know again you get back tosort of thisit's kind of intuitive right sowhy did they get here how did they gethere I I don't need to answer thosequestions to tell you that they're hereit just is and they wouldn't be here ifthere weren't someyou know overarching crazy reason why Ihave a funny uh hypothesis that I'vethat I've thrown out to uh folks overthe Dark Horse podcast I don't know ifyou're familiar with Brett WeinsteinHeather Hein love themlove him uh evolutionary biologists so Igot I gotumpoison ivy bad case of poison ivy aboutsix seven months ago I'm around thatstuff all the time but I hadlong story short I had gotten tick bitesabout three or four tick bites over thecourse of about a week and went to seethe doctor I was like uh you know thisone's a little red and so we heprescribed a a fairly aggressiveum antibiotic protocol for me just tomake sure Lyme diseased it andhappen to rear its ugly head right someabout 10 12 days into this 21 dayprescriptionagain I'm around poison ivy all the timenever get itand all of a suddencrops up like all over me and so here'sI'm taking this antibiotic orally butI've got this microbiome living on myskinprotecting me from the Sun protecting mewe don't know Marty but it's thereand I had this like Epiphany I'm like Iwonderifwe as a species have co-evolved to livewith these bugs and one I mean if youthink about like naturaloccurring in nature noxious thingsthere aren't many I mean you got rottingyou know Flash and this but from a plantstandpoint I mean there's lots ofnoxious plantsbutum in terms of just our ability tobe in contact with these plantsthinking well of course overhundreds of thousands of yearswe would have maintained a healthyrelationship with something on our skinthat helps preventthis oil because that's all it is poisonivy poison oak poison sumac it's an oilfrom the plantwell maybe maybe I remove theprotective layer and allow that in Idon't know it's and food for thoughtit's a very compelling hypothesisbecause yeah that's when I've I've neverhad poison ivy before and I'm prettysure I've come into contact with it andmy sonon the uhthe ladybird Trail here in Austin wewalked out quite often and they havesigns like poison ivy andmy son's about to be three no he's atthe point where we let him out and likerun around andhe has no concept to what poison ivy isso like run up in the brushwe're always like oh you're gonna getpoison ivy he never does though nothat's good yeah so because some peopleare naturallyumaverse too it's actually getting inother people are more inclined to get itas well oh yeah humans are fun becausethere's always a spectrum and uh and youknow we we spend most of our time on theextremes of every Spectrum in terms ofthat's how we Viewthe world is uh it's on the extreme soyou eithersuper allergic or you don't get itbut um well that actually is a goodsegue into like bringing this back tolike regenerative farming andfixing the topsoil uh that's one of theI meanregenerative farming has been a biggrowing movement over the last five tenyears and I think more people arebecoming aware of the fact that it isprobably an ideal way toSteward the land that we're using tofeed our local communities but the oneknock is that it's not scalablewould you say that's true well you knowyou gotta you got to start defining yourterms right what does scalable meanum I would I would Point your listenerto the to the work of the SavoryInstitute and Alan Savory White Oakpastures happens to be a Savory huband we have we had this mindset we hadthis idea that it's our responsibilityto feed the world and that is [ __ ]you know the world was doing just fineyou know a couple hundred years agouh and and certainly longer ago but youknow when did it become the southGeorgia peanut Farmers responsibility togrow peanuts for the entire country orthe you know or Taiwan or Germany youknow I I don't I don't buy into any ofthatumI I do believe that the way thatFarms like white oak polyface uh Farm Ido believe it's scalable to a pointuh but more importantly it's repeatableyou knowumMicrosoft is scalablebut not repeatable yepand you know one thing and we're livingthrough this now specifically around ourfood supply one thing that you we we'vewe've uhwe've handed the keys to the foodproduction Castle to a very few playersI mean I think with meat in this countrythere's four companies five companiesthat that control 85 percentof of the meat that we eatand when you do that when youconcentrate that much you know the theif a cog in the wheel gets screwed upyou know you got serious problemsum if we found that out and we foundthat out absolutely so so you know takeyour take your Will Harris White Oakpastures as an example you knowforeignyou could droptwo or three white oak pastures intoevery state in the countryat their scale at their size at theirability to servethe consumer you know part of why thepastor's problem and all the problem iswhy why are they shipping food toCaliforniathey shouldn't be no you know and againI'll just I'll just use them as anexample you know they're three hourssouth of Atlanta population good Godfive six seven ten million depending onwhere you want to draw the lineum White Oaks uh 22 25 million dollar ayear top line revenue companyI I know will and them very well I'veknown them for years and I'm not sayinganything out ofout of sorts I mean he's talked publiclyabout this but but the point is how inthe hell can't why why is he shipping toCalifornia when you've got 10 millionpeople that live three hours up the roadright right and so uh so you take thatit's it's it's it's it's uh duplicatablescalable to a pointI don't I don't I can't Envision whatthe next step above like a white oakwould be because they've got their ownfor your listener that doesn't know theyso they raise it goshtens of thousands of different uhanimals you know Beef Pork poultryum they've got their own on-farm USDAred meat and poultry slaughterhouseagain for your listener if if you'regonna sell uh meat by the cut to a aconsumer it's got to have a USDA stampon it there's somethere's some workarounds for that but ata micro scale if you're going to be asbig as white oak you got to have theUSDA stamp right which is in another oneof these governmentrequirementsperturbing the market yep yep got tocontrol the supply sideum I'll tell you a quick funny story soearly in the pandemic you know this isthis is White Oak pastures they growmeat and feed their communitybut they're USDAand so early in the pandemic it wasgovernment employees don't show up towork you know we gottaslat in the car let's flatten that damncurve y'allwell if you don't have a USDA inspectorin your USDA plant to check the USDA boxcan't sell any Behavior you're notmoving any you're not moving any producttoday you're not you can't Slaughtermost of the USDA regulations are aroundSlaughter Innovation evisceration uhpass that into the butchering side ofthe house you get into food safety butum but the the big controluh the big lever with USDA is thatSlaughter and eviscerationanyway but yeah so if uhif the usda's telling their employeesthat um you're not to go to work todaythen um no foodand so anyway early on I I remembertalking to Mr Harris about I you know Ihad to pick up the phone and call thegovernor and be like uhnot so fast my friend you know and ithappened the the inspectorscame back to work but you know it's thatkind of [ __ ] that justdrives you nuts right but anyway so yeahyou drop a drop of white oak pasturesdrop a white you could probably havea dozen White Oak pastures in Texas manoh you could have one North Austin onesouth of Austin again I mean itwhat's your average family of four spendon meat a yearwhatever that number is multiply that bya thousand familiesand you know work backwards yeah so wellanother thing to highlight too isthe topsoilproblem and conversations going on likeyou said by 2060a lot of studies are predicting therewon't be any more topsoil and peopleimmediately go toa state of fear and Desperation but Ithink that's one thing aboutregenerative farming that it shows thatwithin a relatively short amount of timeyou can begin to healthe soil so well back to the back to thetechnology piece like we we had this hasbeen proven out sallison's done it uhWill Harris is doing it there's a bunchof people doing this at micro scales butwith the technology we have at our handsand Disposal now you can you canaccelerate these natural systems in avery healthy way you know Nature'sNature's really good about not gettingover its skis right it'll it'll takethat accelerated impact it'll take thataccelerated nurturing up to a point butthen it'll it'll give you very clearsignals too fasttoo much you know you just gotta listenum here's another one Marty 75 roughlyof the agricultural landin uh in this countryis what's considered marginal landyou know what that term means I have anidea but I'm not exactly sure okay somarginal land from an agriculturalstandpoint means you can't plow it soit's either too hilly too Rocky to thisto that you can't plant grains on itthat's what marginal agricultural landin this country iswell what can you put on it legally orphysically like is it just like agovernment like this isdesignated as marginal land so you can'tFarm on it or it's just it's it's it's aterm Farmers recognize it's not going togrow here because it's marginal and it'snot wellagain back to a bunch of differentfactors so look at the uh Farm subsidysystem in this country and where we putmost of our government dollars It's AllGrain productionso why is marginal versus arable arableis the opposite of marginal arable meansI run a plowthood it's deep soils I cando all the things the big differencebetween those is where where is the sowhere does the government Point itsmoneywhere it cangrow the productsthat it promotes soy corn wheat oatsrighthere's a funny aside you're familiarwith the food pyramid yes yes yes theyjust redid it too they did they didfrosted many Wheats are apparentlyhealthier than eggs and eggs and andbeef and yeah so so uh wow it's insanethat we're sitting in 2023 and they'restill trying toforce that food period narrative downpeople's throats wellwe're two and a half years into uh thelargest uh genomic uh psyop experimentuh and and the data's already clear andyet they're still pimping that soum you know we hold on to those sacredcows hard and fast but uh now this is aagain I love the intuitive side of thissoin in a world where you have the Foodand Drug Administrationokay who writes the who writes thepolicy who writes the uhwho tells us what to eat where did thefood pyramid come from lobbyistswho publishes it the government rightwhich which sectionthe USDA or the FDAnot the Food and Drug Administration ourhealth care policy in this country iswritten by the U.S department ofagriculture what do we grow corn wheatsoyso the the people holding the keys toour nutritional guidance are also thepeople holding the keys tocorn wheat and soy production and we'rereally good at ityeah so it's also destroying oh for sureor metabolic Health well here's anotherfun one uh so about three quarters ofthe grains grown in this country aregrown to feedcattlecattle prefer grass they're not evenbiologically ableto assimilate grain even with all theirstomachs even with all those stomachsand the rumen and everything else theydon't like itand it's they don't I mean it makes themsick it's hypercaloric so it's factoryit fattens them up quick yeah but umso you know sort of circle back aroundto I think you could drop a white oakpastures almost anywhere I think youcould drop a polyface Farms almostanywhere you knowumthe food you know again they hold thekeys to the castle you want to buy asteak for me it's got to have this stampon it and you know for the people I'veknow I know that um have had successif you want to call it that in sort oflike a private membership Association soyou can sort of circumvent some of theserules yeah the Amish do this inPennsylvania absolutely well and we hadthat case recently in Pennsylvania whereyou know the guys areas with the rawmilk all the things if you look intothat story too as it goes back to like2016. it was like a woman that boughtraw milkfrom this Farm I forget the name of itwas in Lancaster somewhere and then wentback to her house in Floridaand didalyst area but they were neverable to like directly correlate the themilk to the listeria and she was alsolike 96 years oldyeah but she's she's a poster child foryou gottayou gotta pasteurize and homogenize andI mean that's it's become a meme onRabbit Hole recap with Matt Matt and Imet said once like it was never raw milkit was just milk for thousands of yearswell you know again this back tointuition I look at people I'm like ifuh raw milk were bad none of us would behere right if uh if eating meat were badnone of us would be hereeggs that's a that's the best one youyou look at the 40 or 50 year trackrecord of eggs you know it's like lookat the cover of Time Magazine over everydecade it's like eat them don't eat themuh eat them but only twice Can't GetEnough don't eat the yolks don't eat theyolks oh that's the favorite one don'teat the most nutritionally dense part ofthis thing that is almost a perfect foodlike you could lit you could literallylive off of eggs raw eggs oh for sureit's been a big theme here in theCommons we have oh yeah we have uh eggslugging them down eggs yes yeah we slunksome eggs back uh back in the kitchen Iappreciate that Marty yeah it's uh thatwas hilarious you had this whole likeegg white omelette movement where peoplelike oh you can't eat the yolks but I'lleat the whites it's like you're notgetting any well yeah so that's thatthat started gaining track you knowwe're again the satched vilification ofsaturated fat and you know the the mostfrustrating thing especially aboutdietary policy isum the thecheating that Ansel Keys did okay soAnsel Keys is sort of The Godfather ofuh saturated fat vilification so he uhdid this huge meta study on a bunch abunch of countries and then throughoutthe ones that didn't there were twoprevailingtheories you may have covered this withyour other guests but there are twoprevailing theories way back when whichwas heart diseases caused by eithersugar or fatsugar saturated fat sugar saturated fatand so this is all in the historicalrecord you can pull this out you canlook this up you can put put yourfingers directly to all of the lobbyingand paid off scientists by the sugarLobby to vilify saturated fat this isalldocumented in fact it looks a whole lotlike the same lobbying that big tobaccohad only decades prior in terms of it'snot that bad for you it's actually goodfor you andthree out of four doctors approved youknow smoke smoke Newports when you'repregnant because the Menthol helps withyour breathing you know I mean it's justyou can look all this up so anyway yeahso in the 70s 80s you see this massivevilification andumwe get fat phobicfat phobic and if you take the fat outof food not fat people phobic but notfat traditionally nutritionally yesdietary fat phobic dietary fat phobicand umI even back to the origin story ofCrisco you know Crisco I'm a lard guyrightuh when I got into this you know one ofthe things I eventually did was was sortof go down the rabbit hole ofhow do we how do we get here you knowand umyou know the Procter Gamble story so Ihad I had always assumed I had thisbackground in sort of paleo andnutrition you know I pointed thatwhat to eat what not to eat lands overhere on skin care right and so I hadalways thought that seed oils and allthese refined oils were the werenaturally manifested through food turnsout it was actually skin careuh and soap and Procter and Gamble turnof the century uh started started makinguh soap and candles out of uh cottonseedoilI figured out how to make itnon-toxic-ish andum and so they they bought a bunch ofmills in Texas ironically and scaled uptheir cottonseed oilmanufacturing capabilityand then all of a sudden turn so candlesand soap candles and soap turn of thecentury electricity comes along lightbulbcandle sales aren't looking so hot sothey team up with the German scientistsfigure out how to hydrogenate this thisuh cottonseed oiland to convince the world that it'sbetter for you than the preeminentpredominant cooking oil of the timewhich was lard and beef towel right andand Tallow but lard wasthe go-to the lard works in mysteriousways Marty and that's funny because I'veuh I'm a 90s kidand I have a very uh it's funnyhow like this seeped in the pop culturelike Rugratslet's do uh the dad he was a largesalesman and I didn't know that and hehad a tough life because like lard wasso hard to sell it was so hard to sellum but like that was like when like hewaslike a a large salesman that had areally tough job because lard was soone of my closest Cousins is uh is sortof aantiquer very very good eye giftedgifted antiquer and uhthey have collected countless oldlard tensand I've got pictures and pictures theyfind them everywhere 120 poundsof lard in one vessel right so so lardis white lard is the for your listenerslard is the rendered back slash bellyErgo subcutaneous fat of a pig and uh sobelly fat back fat we have we haveeffectively two types of fat in our bodyfor people that don't understand thissubcutaneous fat which is belly fat backfat it's just under the skin and then wehave visceral fat so a fat that is therefor padding in internally this is akidney fat beef Tallow is renderedkidney fat from a uh from from a bovinespecies[Music]umbut anyway yeah lard lard is whiteuh Crisco is not they they they bleachit or color it white because they wereliterally competing with lard and againI've got all these old I mean peoplethat's what you did you went to thestore and you bought a five gallonbucket of lardand you spoon in and just spoon it outand get after it man get after it yeahthere's this incredible clip of JuliaChild's it's funny it's like we get backto like the food pyramid they justupdated itand you have Rachel Levine who's likethe head of the healthcare system of theUnited States or the hell is ourwhatever the title islooks like [ __ ] coming out and tellingyou like this is what you freaks need toeatand there's a bunch of memes that floataround I think they're the the ministerof Health in the Netherlands is like 450pound well it's like it's a whole don'tbelieve Your Lying Eyessituation where you have all theseunhealthy people telling you like noLucky Charms are better than eggs andsteakthen you go back and then go back tolike the Julia Child's clip it's anincredible clip because it was I thinkit was in the 80s or early 90s whenMcDonald's shifted they're frying frombeef Tallow to 74 92 94 somewhere thereyeah hell I grew up on McDonald's manyeah and those fries are delicious whatis this Cliff she's like I'm nevereating McDonald's again they wentfrom beef tala to to seed oils and friedtastes worse it's not as crisp as itused to be and it's probably not ashealthy she said that as well andlike she's a preeminent Chef who's beenworking with food knows what good tasteis good nutrition is andum for some reason or anotherwe've just been psyopt into cooking withthese poisonsthat's killing us sure well I mean againback to the intuitive nature ofanimal fat for our skin it's you know Ican sit here and tell you well it's itmakes sense to meyou know but I've I've also sort ofejected myselfuh you know the Paleo Journey for me wasreally interesting because you getbehind the curtainof of looking at what's projected on thepublic the food pyramid and you know uhsugar for you know uh high fructose cornsyrup that's way better than sugar andthen artificial sweeteners are evenbetter than that and you just think ofwell you know intuitivelynobut anyway sort of you get behind thecurtain and you see that and of coursenow skin care it'smarketing is a powerful thing it is andit's so ingrainedlike I think slim and I have talkedabout this before butjust like the marketing in thesupermarket like all the colors like thecartoons on the cereal boxes andthe where things get placed in asupermarket makes people more likely tobuy them but thengoing likegoing back to like the trends changing Ido think I have hope in the mothers ofthe world particularly my wife shout outto my wife love you baby she came backfrom uhthe grocery storelast week andlike cheered when she walked in the doorshe's like I got everythingin our our weekly grocery run nicenothing has seed oils like their momsare beginning to come attend to this canI hit the head how does this work you'regonna hit the head all right I gotta dothat okay you're okay you hit the headI'll be right back yeah I'm back Martyfeeling uh relieved you know uh it's oneof the things that travel reallyscrews me up with I don't I've got areally good routine at home in terms oflike coffee entering the body at thistime yes this amount of waterconsumption by this time yeah the uhtraveling messes me up a lot yeah I haveto travel a lot I do not love it and I'msort of an obliger by Nature so I'll sithere and hold it and hold it don't everfeel compelled to hold it okay you gotto go you gotta go I'm holding nothingback with you today Marty we're talkingabout nature when Nature Calls youabsolutelyabsolutely so nature called and I Ianswered and I appreciate your uh yourunderstanding no it's like I was tellingyou we've been uh we've been pottytraining so I've been very intimatelyinvolved with Nature's calling over thelast three days it's been a it's been aan experience How old uh almost threeokay yeah maybe a little late on thepotty training but we're getting thereuh you know what I discovered with uhwith Scott he's my he's 10 now uh thebest way to potty train him is just tosit into the bathroom with some youngkids that are already potty trained butwatch it's like oh I want to be like thecool kids yeah the peer pressure yeahit's amazing yeah it's a as is today'shis first day at school with the pottytraining wheels half off so we'll seehow it goes that is excitingcongratulations thank you thank youso gentle enough for the kids by the waythe uh the Pharaoh the lard I want to belathering them up yeah well speaking ofkids that's what before you hit the headthat's what I thought that wasI'm extremely optimistic like a lot ofthe topics that we cover on this whetherit be like monetary policy state ofglobal economicum landscapeprivacy in the digital age like at allin 2023 seems to be coalition coalescingin this weird dystopian nightmare butwe do have to highlight like theoptimistic trends that exist highlightthem and try totry to hold them up and amplify themthat was right before you hit the headthat's what I was saying I think thereissomething naturally occurring in themothers of the world that exist outthere at least some of them that arebeginning to realize like looking attheir children I know my wife's lookingat her two boys like what the hell am Ifeeding you what am I what am I puttingin your body how's it affecting youryour temper from a day to day experienceandit's one thing my wife has taken theball and run with like cutting seed oilsout and cooking at home andtrying to to make it so like the kidsare eating healthy yep well I meanthat's you know I've got eight and tenuh daughters the eight-year-old andthey're a big part of the Muse you knowget so I took this took this lens of ifyou can't eat it you know if you can'tpronounce it don't eat it don't eatpreserved Foods you know it's not goodfor us blah blah blah blah you take thatlens and you shine it over on skincareand it's like what thoughI mean it's bad it's it's actuallyit's actually worse than food because itwe don't we don't perceive that our skineats thingsright so again back to this consumerprotection but umbut yeah I mean the mama bears Mamabears are standing up and and speakingup and you know one of the silverliningsuh JP Sears was one of the closingclosing deals with I love JP's work uhhe was one of the closing acts that uhthis conference I've been in town forand he'she's talking about like having gratitudefor the world economic Forum or havingyou know like finding the Silver Liningsand and all that and you know one of theSilver Linings to all this madness forthe past two or three years isumit it it's woken a lot of people upand you know again I've saidI took this lens over here in the foodworld and all of a sudden shining allskin care well now shine that same lenson big Pharma shine that same lens onthe fed you know just the the list goeson and on and onumpeople are waking up and it's harder andharder to hide the truthnow that's what people are dyingsuddenly all over the placeyes due to climate change apparently dothe cows oh yeah we're just gonna killthem yes the cow farts are you knowcausing heart attacks there was a cliffthat came out of the world economicForum last week I had the Epiphany whenI saw the clip it was I believe the CEOof Siemenswas telling a verya very heart-wrenching story about howhis daughter said you need to go veganbecause the cowsare destroying the world and hebasically went on this long rants likewe need to stop eating meat uh to reduceCO2 emissions and I had this Epiphanywhere it's like the act of eating meatdoes not produce emissions it is thefront end of that supply chain which isthe cow is actually livingtheir lives and so like if you take thatstatement like we need to stop eatingMeats reduce emissions these peopleliterally would have mass genocide allbovine creatures because they view themas the product of these emissionsand that's really what they're sayingwhen you get to the Crux of it we have asaying in the South bless bless theirhearts and umyou know again it's just back towhat people know and what they thinkthey know and what they've been talkedinto I meanyou knowthis this this lovely country that weinhabithad a uhthe records show that it had uh herds ofBison uh that that would uhthat would make our current domesticatedbovine population look look very smallminusculehundreds of millions of ofherbivorous ruminant species when youwhen you add in the bison and the elkand the deer we are at a fraction todayuh the population of animals in thiscountry that we were 500 years ago andit's funny when uhpeople first came here and they startedmoving West the great Frontier describehow beautiful it was the landscape howluscious it wasroaming bison had something to do withit well so the Fertile Crescent inAfrica where where Humanityyou know effectively was born as a damndesert now this is again this you got tothink about these Silver Linings likehumans are destructive creatures rightwe're really good at cutting trees downand killing off animals I mean we'vewe've Advanced as a species pretty wellwe're winningall right well that same that samecapacity can bethere's there's a there's an overapplication of the humans rape andpillagemindset we also repair and build and andand and so you knowwhat a blessing these opposable thumbsand a developed prefrontal cortex andall the various things Pigs Can't SweatI love pigs but like pigs don't sweat weget to sweat which means we get to doall these other cool things uh I'm goingcrazy here tangentially butumyeah there's we have the capacityto reverse a whole bunch of stuffagreed and if we just Farm correctlyFarm correctly andget out of this narrow framework thatpeople like the US federal governmentand those who are speaking and leadingthe world economic Forum have put peopleinto they give you this weirdbinary option if it's this way or thatway and I think that's why I likesitting down talking to people like youis like maybe it doesn't need to beeither of those options maybe just thinkdifferently about how we're producingfood what how we're regeneratingland using raisin Cradle to to Greenareas like you talk aboutthe Fertile Crescent I was like probablyone of the only good TED Talks I've everwatched was I forget his name but he waslike 2012 2013 being like hey if youwant to solve climate change like weneed tobegin roaming herds of cattle that mightbe Alan Savory that might have been Ithink it I think yeah 2012 sounds aboutright he his Ted Talk and it's one ofthe still to this day one of the mostdownloaded TED talks of all time yeahand they had to be because it was sopowerful about that was the picturesit's like look this was a desert Ibrought in some roaming bovine creaturesand it greened up in a couple years hisstory is so unbelievably tragic I don'tknow if you know his backstory so he wasa basically an effective African fishand wildlife kind of person and theywere seeingdesertification so the desert wasgetting bigger and looks around sees allthese elephants and as a youngEnvironmentalprotectorhe draws the conclusion that it must bethe elephantseating the grass that are causingthis desert expansion and so he was partof a team that came to an ultimatedecision I forget how many thousands ofelephants they calledright the road to hell is paved withgood intentions I think this wasactually part of his Ted Talk it was butit's just it's it's it shows the the thethe I mean hisjourney ispowerful because it's like let me go dothis this is going to fix the problemproblem got worse oh and now I've gotthese I think man I think it was like 10000 elephants they called right so I gotthe death of these 10 000 creatures onmyon my resume and it did it got worseyeah and sono Alan Savory is uh the SavoryInstitute they're doing great work goodon him for course correcting oh hellyeah it's a rare trait the ego is uh istough to right like Rumble pies it's nottasty no because some cost fallacy comesinto play you're like oh no II banged my career on this like it hasto be right and then those people try tofinddata that supports the hypothesis thatthey put forth a lot of that's going onright now well you start with uh what dowe want to know what do we want to proveyes this is this is the answer we wantand then you work backwards yesindividuals like Alan are able toactually be up front and confront thefact that they were wrong and recognizethat they were wrong and then try tocourse correct from there it'swe need more of those humans in theworld sure especially today I meanwhat's going on with its economic policyfood policy uh the covid policy a lot ofpeople justdouble triple quadruple down like no wewere rightI really enjoy your show and and youknow I'm I'm fairly new to the to theBitcoin space we we take it now for ourproducts online which is really cool butI have a lot to learnI recognize its importance that's whywe're sort of taking it you knowleveraging it as a as a means for forpaymentum but man like getting to know you andand slim and Adam Curry and some of theother folks in the even Odell andumyou all say this all the time but fixthe money fix the food rightI'm gonna say fix the money fix a wholebunch of stuff right like fix the skincare you know wires why arepreservatives and chemicals and um andSeed oils so prevalent in our CosmeticsMarket well maybe it's because we makethem unbelievably cheap because we printmoney and give it to Farmers and youknow whether they grow good corn or badcorn or good wheat or good wheatuh we do the same thing with all thesepetroleum you know there's just thissystem that's this Fiat system that'sset up toincentivize crap yes like non-efficientI mean hell without Farm subsidies Idon't think anyone would grow corn inthis countryyeah maybe like South Jersey justbecause you get that sweet corn but wellwhen I say corn you know what I meanlike we wouldn't we wouldn't and youknow again just back to the assbackwardness of the system we spend morefossil fuels growing corn to makeethanol to put into gas then we save inthe carbon emissions from the ethanolthat goes in the gas it doesn't make anysense it's a it's a negative literally agroup of insanity yeah Insanity soyeah now we have it out here fix themoney fix the world yesI truly believe if people think we'recrazy uh part of a cultbut I do think a lot of this stems fromperverse incentives introduced by easymoneyColts uh short for culture man they canbe you know that that's the beauty of uhwaking up a little bit not woke butawake is you understand that umthere's two sides to every pillow youknow and there's two sides to every coinand so you know it's like pigs pigs Ilove pigs pigs get a bad rap becausethey're destructive wellleverage the destruction you knowdestructions what the soil needs it'swhat the you know disturbance we like tosay disturbance not destruction you knowbecause there's a fine line and and umso again you knowCults are awesome yeah Cults are alsoreally terrible so which which side ofthat coin you want to be yeah you gottayou gotta pick the right cult I think Ithink I picked the right cult then we goback like pigs beingnot destructive but Disturbed like mypartner one of my partners a standardbook when he actually owns a farm andNorthern Tennessee and the last time Iwas there he was excited because theywere getting a mama pig and some pigletsthe week after I left but it wasliterally just to plop them downby like the the edges of his farm sothey could run through all the brush andjust clear it out it's pig pigs areamazingly impactfulto the land and so again you wanna youwanna harness thatand also use it wisely you know if forfor your listeners a lot of people Iknow know at least what backyardchickens are like you know I I have adifferent Circle than most of the worldbutat my age a lot of people can reminisceabout the the chicken coop they hadbehind their house and if you knowanything about a chicken coop even theone I grew up around when you walked inthe chicken coop there was no grass itwas dead pan dirtand you go get the eggs every day wellchickens are highly destructive and ifyou leave them one place for very longthey're going to eat everythingand then you got a moonscape and so evenpoultry productionumanimals move they don't spend very muchtime in the same place so leverageleverage leverage all that stack it allupand umno that's why I think it's veryimportantthe things that you're doing EllenSavory Will Harris and others in thismove is educating people aboutthings that are relatively simple likeonce you understand the base concepts ofthis I goyou like fence cows into like a certainSquare to eat all the grass they eat allof it you move that squareyep into another one they move to thatthey eat all of it they poop whilethey're eating and it adds the soil it'svery intuitive well yeah and you knowagain back to the leverage right back tousing these gifts we've got you know inin natureyou're looking at like a one-time passright so here come the Bison they eatthe grass they pee they poo they move onwellmonth and a half two months later thatgrass is back and it's ready to go againum but the Bison you know in a naturalsetting many times the Bison have movedon they're they'rewell they're on to the next onto thenext grass so in in our systems again wejust we're we're able to responsiblypush the push the gas and push the brakeon ecology buildingum that's it's it's truly remarkable Imean you know againmeasure it by topsoil measure it bycarbon content in the soil measured bythe microbial you know every every uhpercentevery one percent increase in organicmatter in the soiluh your your you have an increasedcarrying capacity per acre of water it'slike 22 23000 gallons holy [ __ ] right becauseorganic matter needs water and it bindsto it and it holds on to it and so youknow when we plow you know back toarable versusmarginal land when we break the soilsurface with a plow we open the baresoil up to the sun you know that sungets really hot it kills all the organicmatter you know you're you're the soilssurrounding is an example Will Harriswe've talked about him quite a bit todaythe soils surrounding his farm from thepeanut farmers and the soy Farmers youknow are averaging likehalf to one percentumorganic matterso you get a you know two three fourinch Deluge of rain over the course of aday or twoI'll flooded out it it runs off that wasone of the videos we were talking aboutearlier it runs off well again thinkabout that's that's a half inch of rain20 I think that's rightit's either an inch or a half inch ofrain 22 000 acre 22 000 gallons per acreI can't remember but either way it's alot of damn water so every incrementalincrease in organic matterthe water stays there can absorb it itabsorbsumthere's a whole new thread coming outnow I think the meat Buffy guys just uhinterviewed a guy or maybe they're aboutto on beaversand the impact of beavers to ourenvironment that's a little far afieldfrom our cows and pigs conversation butjust how we relateto the water system in this countryumgo back to wolves there's that famousvideo that's like very viral it's beenaround for years but reintroducing rulewolves too Yosemite Park and acompletely changed landscapeanother land because you had to forcethe herbivores the elk anddeer forced them to to reacquaintthemselves with the natural systemswhich was you can eat down here to thatright now but you better get your assback up that hillotherwise you're getting huntedotherwise you're getting hunted so theydidn't over graze all the lands and thegrasses holding up the banks of theseRivers for your listeners that don'tunderstand how this works you know uhruminant species elk deer cows sheepthese are all ruminant species theygraze on grass and where's the tastiestgrass grow right down by the Riverbanksand if there's no Predator AKA wolfto keep them from just hanging out thereall damn day eating grass until thegrass dies we talked earlier about thesymbiosis right you eat that three footplant down to a one foot and it breakseverything off and regrows and all thatwell if two days later you come back tothat one foot one inch tall plant andyou eat a six inches off of it you'veeffectively killed a plant so over greatthis is the power of over grazing and sothese wolves come into the park theriver had beenyou know altered forever because thegrasses have roots that hold the bankstogether no grass no roots no banks andso in a matter of like very short orderum that they started re-establishing thebanks of this River because grasses wereactually able to grow here's an evenbetter one for you where's the richestgrassdown by the riverhow do you take how do nutrientssoil nutrients cycle back uphillgravity ain't gonna happen yeah right sohere's the symbiotic role of theseherbivore or herbivorous species so I Ispend a little bit of time down in thevalley eating the Lush nutrient densegrassAlong Comes the walls I could get my assup the hill so I'm going to eat I'mgonna head uphill and take a dump I'mgonna take a dump and a pea at the topof the hill so they're cycling nutrientsback uphillyou know the rains come and bring thosenutrients back down you got this againcompletely the circle it's beautiful manwe talked about it early on like we takethis little snapshot of methane comingout the butthole of a cow and all of asudden that's a problemwe got to kill all the cows we got tokill all the cows because they'reemitting methane that you know thatyou're average every day run-of-the-milldozen oysters emits as much methane intothe air as carbon they're not they'renot protesting Oysters Rockefeller theydon't I love oysters oystersif you're slogging oysters with eggsslonking excuse me I always say sloganslog slunk yeah tomato tomato yeahthat's that's that's some magic sauceThere raw oysters and raw eggs justknocking them back yeah that's uhoysters are SuperFood mm-hmmand I always tell myself I'll never eatseafoodmore than 100 miles from the coast buteven down here in Central Texas I I caveand eat oysters quite often well againyou know Pharaoh works because wefigured out the logistics you can getI again I'd love to see more local Ilove to be more centralized you knowwhite oak pastures doesn't need to beshipping food to Washington State rightbut someone in Washington state if youreally want to order Pharaoh I'll shipit to youwith no regretsbut umI just gotta check time out but wefigured out the logisticsright and souh Seafood you can get really freshseafood I know pretty much anywhere inthe country yeahthere's a little I'm used to growing uplike right on the coast where it comesright in that's my mom's from mobile andso yeah my fond memories of like freshyeah we used when we lived in SouthCarolina I mean look in the back Baysyou think you should go put your handin the muck pull out a bunch of oystersshock themshrimping back thereliterally from the Back Bay too to yourplate oh it's it's fantastic man I meanfarming's that same thing for me likeyou know there's this reverence it's alittle bit different I think fishing andandacquiringum you're not cultivating as much in inthe aquaticum are doing with the whiskers now theyare they are they are absolutelyum but there's a there's a connectionthat comes with raising them you knowumyou know people always ask like you knowhow can you raise this animal and thentake its life it's like you knowit's hard there's a reverence I mean somany people are disconnected from foodnow they don't they don't appreciatethat you know gogo hug a damn farmer it's it's not funand and and reward and it's veryrewarding it's not a lot of fun all thetime and uh but there's a reverencethere you know our pigs our chickens ourcows have one bad dayone bad day and the rest of their lifeis full and filled andand and we absolutely you know Pharaohis an offshoot of really honoring thatsacrifice I mean it's a waste product inmany respects part of the reason beingthat we've moved away from animal-basedoils and for cooking and various otherthings and moved into these you knowcheap ubiquitous government-sponsoredFiat supportedCommodities poisonsyeah I'd say I I think you're right theseed oils literally affect people's ohyeah genetics no it's awful it's awfulyeahum no it's like you'rerespecting the animal right I mean youhear the uhand hear the phrase liketail to nose nose tail I mean you'reyou're taking thethe fat pie product of making making ohit's growing yeahyep sothis has been a fascinating conversationum where can people find out more aboutpharaohour website Pharaoh f-a-r-r-o-w dot lifeis our websiteum we've got an FAQ section everythingon there the best to the best of myabilities and um we're still small thisis our first

like omnivorous and gregariouslike everything's a potential meal andso they're always curious they're smartas hell it's crazy likewhen they become undomesticated out intothe Wilder physiology literally changestoo it's crazy yeah it's absolutelyinsane they say uh so pigs are you knowthis is why pigs are a problem in Texasso pigs uh the gestation for a pig isthree months three weeks and three daysand so uh Mama Sal can get pregnant andhave three litters a year yeah and uhthey've taken pigs they've taken wildpigs put them in captivityand two generations later they'redomesticated they've taken domesticatedpigs put them back in the wild and ageneration or two later they're back tolong hair Big Fang you know tusks andthe whole nine yards it's crazy that'sthey're an amazing species very Dynamicunbelievable you know one could arguealmost as adaptable as humans yeah tothe environment you know it's it's ablessing for us that we're so adaptableI think we've reached nutritionally andSkin Care wise and environment I thinkwe've reached a Tipping Point with likewe're a resilient species but God damnman we're pushing it pretty hard now allthe seed oils all theyou know toxins all the bpas all of thisall of that and with a shitty diet anduh toxic uh you know toxic environmentand uh Fiat money so like we're we're atthe Tipping Point so yeah then yeah I'lllike the mental like thedopamine hits from social media andattention spanswe uh I mean it does show that humansare extremely resilient as well despitethe fact that we have not extremely fatfrom eating all this stuff but itdoesn't seem like people are waking upand even with the onslaught of thedigital age we are adapting maybe notincredibly well in most people's mindsbut I do have faith that we'll figure itouttotally agree Marty I again there's twosides to every coin right technologyhandheld devicesamazing technology and Power in our handalso a place where you can waste yourentire goddamn day yes
