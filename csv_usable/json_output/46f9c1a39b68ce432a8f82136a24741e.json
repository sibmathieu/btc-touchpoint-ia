and it'striggered by cold and so what'sinteresting is that this year it wastriggered by the the freeze thathappened in December so it was moved upa little earlier but it lasts for likeweeks and I've yeah been mainliningClaritin-D and Flonase and both my kidshave it they have we call it hay fever Idon't know the same yeah it is yeah yeahthey both haven't they really my sonespecially his eyes can fully close upand I don't know why I mean I don't haveit um oh geez yeah anyway nice to seeyou good to see you happy Friday happyFriday welcome back can I embarrass youof course uh the last show we made atthis very table yes uh was my favoriteshow last yearyay yeah no we really enjoyed it um itwas a topic I right at the time I wasreally interested in really enjoyed itand the feedback was fantastic I meanyou must have seen it oh that's greatyeah I did catch some of it on Twitter Ithink the things you're interested inwriting about areyou covering something I'm reallyinterested in in that everything's kindof [ __ ] on a political front andthere's so much polarization uh I'minterested in people who are trying tobring people back together rather thanseparate them yeah and uh so you're thelast show of the Sprint the 20th show in10 days yep nice and I've very much beenlooking forward to this great okay soyou wrote an article yes in this issuehere yes it's time to uh refund theAmerican dream in the orange party issueyes why did you attack the subjectI broached the subject because I don'tthink any kind of meaningfulum political reform is possible in theUnited States without moving away fromthe uh Imperial tradition that hascharacterized our politics since atleast the end of the second world warand uh I say that very advisedlyum because there are many peoples aroundthe world who have counted on uh Americaexerting a kind of uh Global policemanForce butum many of those peoplesum have also experienced that as adouble-edged sword I say thisspecifically as a Polish Americanum you know so uh Poland you know theUnited States long time alliesum there's there's a lot ofum I think desire on the part of thepolish-american community for America tocontinue this position of GlobalLeadership butum I see it as containing unsustainablecosts both for the United States and theWorld At Large and so I think there areum difficult diplomatic decisions to bemade but they can begin with recapturingof the foundational American traditionof Liberty not Dominion this was verymuch the the point of view the foundingfathers and articulated eloquently byJohn Quincy Adams in the 19th centuryis there a connection betweenthe US's role as like the internationalpoliceman this imperialism which hasbeen largely economic is there aconnection between that and thepolarization or is it you're justrecognizing that there's a focusrequired on you know refounding theAmerican way and in doing so you justhave to discard because it's too much ofa distraction what is the thereabsolutely isum soum you may be familiar with this uhphenomenon known as The triffin Dilemmayes um yep but I explain it to listenersbasically the idea is that um the UnitedStates made this kind of bargainum with not all of the world but much ofthe worldum post-world War II that in exchangefor using the dollar as the globalReserve currencyum the United States would maintain atrade deficit with these other countriesand that in effect was a program ofeconomic uplift it enabled thesecountries to earn the dollars that theycould then use to trade with the UnitedStates this was a solution to thepost-world War II global economicsituation where basically everybody butAmerica was broke and so America had youknow three-fourths of the world's goldandum you know a vast Arsenal and uhindustry but nobody to trade with and sothisum bargain enabled countries around theworld to run trade surpluses vis-a-visthe United States the problem with thatis that it has decimated over time theAmerican productive economy particularlyin manufacturing and it has generated somuch dollar Surplus in other countriesthat you know that needs to be parkedsomewhere and so what we've seen is theslow selling off of American hard assetsuh landum equity in American companies whichused to be unheard of Commoditiesand in effect what that means is we'vebeen selling our country piece by pieceto maintain This Global dollar ReserveSupremacy and how has that affected thecountry domestically in terms of uh thevery clear polarization that's happenednow is it is that connected to thisum certainly so the emisuration of theAmerican middle class is something thatyou know has been a multi-generationaluh trajectory and it's resulted in a lotof political polarizationum people want to point fingers at youknow culture wars generally the easiestthing you know the the people that Idon't like the political tribe that Idon't align withum but ultimatelyuh regardless of who is elected who hasbeen elected in the neoliberal ageum that trend has not reversedum so we've seen you know decliningstandards of living it's no longerpossible for a family to really makeends meet on a single income I mean it'svery difficultspiraling costs of housing Health Careeducation which are also connected toother factors but in shortum the vastnessof resources that the United Statesdedicates year after year to maintainingthis status as a global hegemonum is actually detrimental to theAmerican people at this point and do youthink people are recognize this I thinkpeople recognize this an issue there isa problemyour nation becoming wealthier but astandards a living dropping I thinkpeople recognize there is an issue withpolitics and media and polarizationhow many people recognize this asconnected to what you've said relativelyfew I would say this is still far fromum mainstream let alone consensusum and I mean that's unsurprisingbecauseum you know historically the the riseand fall of Empires has very little todo withumpublic understanding of the causes ofthe rise and fall of Empiresum Empires uh rise when their resourcebase is expanding and they fall whentheir resource base is Contractingum prosaicallyum and the people may not alwaysunderstand why it's suddenly Contractingbut in this case it simply has to dowith an economic trade-off decision thathas reached the end of its logic andyou're trying to front run the collapseand resulting Revolution by encouragingpeople to consider that uh some kind ofReform can either minimize the damagethat's caused by this or or point thecountry in a New Direction absolutelyyeah soum I I think theimperative to be dominant to be theworld's policeman has resulted in theUnited States conducting itself in waysthat many Americans wouldn't recognizeas what they consider to be Americanvaluesum and we saw this you know particularlyafter the war in Iraq but also the therecent withdrawal from Afghanistanum there are now uh multiple generationsof young people who have grown up with abackground of constant War many of themhave parents who served or themselveshave served and they have this sense ofmoral injury which is a psychologicalphenomenon where they've sacrificedeverything in many cases and they don'treally know what it was for their livesaren't materially better they don'tparticularly feel saferum you know the global war on terror isno longer the the big Salient politicalissue that it was a couple of decadesago now it's the rise of China or Russiaand sothere's a sense that there was apolitical calculus here and notnecessarily a moral calculusum and and I think Americans want to beproud of their countryand that starts with who you are thatstarts with how you conduct yourself inthe world and when you feel constrainedto always be in chargeit doesn't give you the space and thefreedomum to consider what might be the moralcourse of action have you watched theseries on Netflix Turning PointI have not no okay I recommend it highlyit's uh four part it's a four-partseries isn't it that covers 911Afghanistan Iraq andas America's role as the World Policewhether you agree with it or not theybecame the target over years I meangenerations ofumuh terrorists whether it was theoriginal I think it was 1991 attempt atbomb in the World Trade Center I can'tremember the exact date but theembassies around the world buteventually 9 11. yeah and there was alot of Sympathy For America and supportbehind the internet of Afghanistanum I think and it covers a lot of thereason why that sympathy was lost withIraq because there was little belief orthought that this was the actions of theWorld Police this became more like theactions of the war of a World's bullyand a lot of Suspicion between behindwhat happened in Iraq and now I thinkthere is a lot of Suspicion behind anyform of War even I mean I'm fullysupportive of the Ukrainian people intheir defense of their country but anykind of financial support of that thesuspicions that this is really tosupport the military-industrial complexso I feel like Iraqhas muddied the waters for anythingAmerica does as well police yeahabsolutely well inum one of the things I pointed out inanother one of my essays about the endof the petrodollar uh system is that theinvasion of the iraqs happened happenedsuspiciously closely to Saddam Husseinpublicly declaring that he was going tostart pricing oil in Euro yeahum and he was one of the very fewcountries in the worldum making that claimum and so there there is certainlyum I think a way in whichThe petrodollar Reserve System reallykind of saved the United Statesum global economic position after theclosure of the gold windowum I mean it was it was a NixonAdministration priorityum to to get this deal doneum and so preserving that preservingthat world order has beenum considered a Paramount Nationalstrategic importance I don't want tominimize thatum on the other handum you know it's like it's like being adebtor you know if this this was Ibelieve John Maynard Keynes but if youowe the bank a thousand dollars you knowyou're in trouble if you owe the bank amillion dollars or you know billion ortrillion then you own the bank yeahum and so we've kind of become uh what'sinteresting is after the closure of thegold window we actually sold the worldour debt as gold this was no otherEmpire human history has ever done thiswe fully monetized our debt and madethat the global Reserve asset but that'sput us in a position where we have tokeep generating more and more debt inorder to prop up the liquidity of theentire global economic system and thatputs us in a terrible position becausewe inflate our money supply weimmiserate the the middle class andincreasingly the upper middle class andnot to speak of the lower class like soit's it's really been a a dangerous setof trade-offs can we do the thebackground theatrical yeahum can we talk about uh your parentsmoving to the U.S and what thatexperience was like for them because I Ithink that sets out the foundations ofwhatthe like the what people believe are thetraditional American values and why theywanted to come to the US when I as a kidalways look to the US and wanted to comehere and yeah I spent a lot of my timehere because by the way there's the lensof what you see of the US on mediaonline but the experience most of thetime I'm meeting people like you who Iwho who represent the values what Ibelieve America is about right rightyeah so my parents came to the UnitedStates and at the very beginning of the1980s they were both software Engineersum in in an era where that was not yetuh as common as it is todayum and they they didn't intend to stayum but it just so happened that martiallaw was declared in Polandum while they were here they had bothbeen active in the solidarity movementwhich was a broad Coalition likesociety-wide Coalition against thecommunist stateum and so they were concerned aboutbeing thrown into prison if they were togo backum and so they ended up finding jobs andI grew up here I was born hereum I you know loved itum and so you know watching I my parentsare like some of the most patrioticAmericans like you'll ever meet and alot of immigrants are they they trulyhave made sacrifices to be hereum they've never expected anything theydidn't feel entitled to it they theyreally came here to work and to make alife for themselves and they also haveexperienced communism right and andthey've seen what the alternative can beyeahum and so they you know for them this isthe land of opportunityum and it has been for me as wellum and sohaving a kind of allegiance to thevalues of Liberty of free enterpriseum that's what I believe America to beand that that means you can't haveeverythingso you can't be the World Police andalso the land of opportunity at the sametime and that's what we've been learningslowly as a countrywhy can't you be there becauseum it costs everythingif you want to be any kind ofumpower Supremacycosts you everything over time this iswhy authoritarianism is so brittlebecause it always contains within itselfthe seeds of its own destruction I meanit has to be constantly upheld andmaintainedthe United Statesspendsan extraordinary amount every year onthe military apparatus and that's justthe known military apparatusum we also when you have you know anapparatus as big as that you intend touse itum and so there is this constantum pressure to engage in new forms ofcovert and overt military conflictum and a case in point in this you knowgoing back a few decades wasum after the Vietnam War whereum you know that didn't end very wellfor the United States andum there were you know a whole bunch ofCIA uh agents sort of out of work backin the U.S Stateside feeling uhdemoralizedum and so we decided to start a proxywar in Angolaum and just like shipped our agentsthere and like completely destabilizedthis country that most Americans havenever even heard ofum and so you know if you have a hammeryou're inclined to use it and over timeusing that hammer changes who you are itchanges your character and so now you'vetraded your character for Supremacy andit's the character piece that I'm mostconcerned withso if if the U.S was if you know if yourthesis is correct and as a country itdecided to re-establish its values youknow resign from its role as WorldPolicehow does this actually happen like whatare the things we're talking about is itremoving Americans from all these basesaround the worldyou know because becausethe world the role of World Police issomething that has to come to force whenthere's required support and actionright yeah when there's certain regionsthat are being destabilized but there isalso this kind of like uhthis kind of this this I don't I'm notsure how to put it but there's this kindof protective layer that the US hasbuilt around the world you know whetherit's in Japan or you know trying tosupport Taiwan and the South China Seaor you know bases in Germany or I meanI've seen these maps I mean can you tryand find that map of U.S bases aroundthe world are we talking about scalingthis all back and America coming back towithin the confines of its own bordersyeah soum there's not going to be a simple wayto do this but there can be aclear-sighted way to do it yeah therealways needs to be a positive projectum a negative project isn't going towork it's not it's not something thatwill motivate people or serve as acoherent rubric for Action so from mypoint of viewum the positive project here is to be agood neighborand I'm literally talking about you knowMr Rogers uh good old-fashionedRepublican American valuesum of being a good neighbor and askingourselves what does that mean first ofall with our most proximate neighborswith Canada and Mexico let's just startthere let's just start North Americawhat does it mean for us to be a goodneighbor to our actual the countriesthat we share a border with and thenlet's you know let's ask about uh Cubaand the Caribbean and Latin Americalike and we can begin expanding fromthereand over time we can as we're Guided bythis philosophy or this commitmentum we will we begin to organically maketrade-off decisions between what being agood neighbor isum finding that fit finding that win-winfor both parties without overextendingum and that can guide our policy yeahbecause I wonder what that even means meand Danny were talking about this theother day you know uh we uh weinterviewed a guy who runs gridless downin Africa and he was very critical ofngos but a lot of the work ngos is is itis it good intentions misguidedintentions how do you avoid havingmisguided attentions feeling like you'resupporting a country but actually you'redestabilizing it or you're trying tochange the culture of a country tosomething that isn't American that'sthat's a great questionum and I think it starts with beinghonest about your own interestsand so being a good neighbor doesn'tmean pretending that you're a selflessaltruist no country around the worldbelieves that you know America or anyother country acts you know selflesslyon the world stage there's always aquestion of Interestand this is where you know I actuallyhave a background in um sales andbusiness developmentin that kind of situation it's veryclear what's going on I'm selling aproduct there's a potential buyer on theother side of the tableum my interest is clear but also theirinterest needs to be clear and salesworks not by strong arming but byfinding fit so that both parties walkaway from the transaction feeling likethey've benefited in some wayum and that's that's the ethic that Ithink we need to recover I'm no longertrying to sell democracy around theworld right I mean we we can stand fordemocracy but it it's like John QuincyAdams says we have to embody ourselvesthose Democratic Values it is ourexample which stands for democracy notour military interventionum and honestly you know there arecountries many countries around theworld where American intervention evenvery well intentioned has sabotaged thecause of democracy there are Autoaccuracies that exist because you knowwe took out the guys who we thought werethe bad guys but they ended up being themost likely Vector of democratic reformand so now there's nobodyum and so by being by focusing onourselves being who we espouse to beum that gives other people courage tothemselves make the sacrifices that willbuild their own futureyeah I had Alex kunstein on hererecently we were discussing the IMF andthe what bank and he's written a longpiece discussing U.S economicimperialism and he talked about how incertain countries that the US would makesignificant loans and uh to help youknow grow and support the country but indoing so create trade relationshipswhere the resources of that countrywould be fed back to the US he gave afew specific examples but he oftentalked about uh these often propped upuh authoritarian regimes because you hadcorrupt people within the countrywilling to take the money and sell offthe resources but I also know yeah inyour article you talked about the fallof the Soviet Union and the IMF theWorld Bank that they relied on theirloans to maintain democracy so there's athere's kind of a conflict contradictionbetween what you're saying and and whatAlex gladstina said to me and I guessboth could be true yeah so you know thethe history of these multilaterallending institutions like the IMF andthe World Bank is very interesting theythey were founded in the era ofum High liberalism High internationalismum in the westum in a largely prompted by this desireto never again experience something likea World Warum so you know we tried after the firstworld war tried again after the secondworld warum and the idea was that if there was aglobal body that was a lender of LastResort for countries that nobody elsewanted to lend toum then maybe we could avoid some of youknow the terrible conflicts that we hadseennowum the the problem with being a lenderof Last Resort is that that's a positionof immense power so everything you do ishighly leveraged and you can end up youknow just moving a little bit andsquashing like an entire generationum and so the power that theseinstitutions have wielded has beenum often profoundly destructive it alsoum has often been the only reason thatyou know people in some countries werefedum because their governments were socorrupt that there was no bilateralthere was no other country or privatelending institution that was willing toto lend to them um because they couldn'ttrust themum and so it's it's very difficult toextricate yourself from that but it'sit's also I mean if you go back furtherthis is this is part of the legacy of ofcolonialism as well is that many ofthese countries were colonies they hadIndependence movements they wereliberated but their resources and theirEconomic Institutions were stillentirely owned by the west and so theyyou know they had entrepreneurialpoliticiansum who knew how to advance their ownpersonal interestsum and amidst this web of of great powerpoliticsit sounds very messy yeah it's extremelymessy yeah and if the U.S was to resignfrom its position of well policewhat are the considerations towardshanding this role to China or not somuch that I believe China would want tobe wild police but by changing the powerstructure you know across the world andyou know we've seen with the Bottom Roadinitiative that China is willing to makesignificant loans to countries and thosecountries have become indebted they endup owning their ports or havingconsiderable power yeah like what riskis there with consideration for thatbecauseyeah my my brother I talked to him aboutthis and you know my brother is a veryhe's very much anti-war he marchedagainst the Iraq Warbut he sees a higher risk of givingpower or changing the power structureand giving more strength to China hesees that as a much more risky scenariofor the world yeah no I I think theUnited States no longer being the globalhegemon yeah does not mean that there issome other country out there who wouldbe a better hegemonthere is in fact the structure ofhegemony is the problemum but I would I would encourage you toconsider thisum I mean what if like imagine that youknow China had a client state thatbordered the United States likeum you know Mexico or something and thatthey had fully militarized it they hadbases there they would do you knowregular military exercises Land Air andseeum and somehow claimed this territory aspart of their sphere of influence wellwe might we might rightly ask they'reall the way on the other side of theworld like what are they doing here likewhy is why are they asserting this istheir sphere of dominanceum and and so this I mean this also getsat the Russian concerns about expansionNATOum the problem isn't that countriessmaller countries are defendingthemselves against Russian aggressionum that is obviously a prerogative ofany sovereign state the problem is thatum the United States established itselfpost post-world War II as sort of themilitary protector of Europeum and so European countries have uhindigenous Defense Forces butum they still largely rely on the UnitedStates for protection and this isPutin's point is he's basically like ifyou if you're not militarily sovereignyou're not sovereign and so who's reallyThe Sovereign well over Europe let's seeUnited States and so it's a war inUkraine but it's a war against theUnited Statesum this is this is part ofum I think I mean there are there aremany considerations here but the pointis that this prerogative that manyAmericans feel is just second nature tojust be anywhere at any time andself-evidently be in chargethat's a problemyeahum I I think many other countries aroundthe world would be fearful of the usbringing in its protection for othercountries but then alternatively I don'tI mean who's to know whether this wouldmake the world a safer place rightwho's to know um you talked about in thearticle or you mentioned that you'reseeing like a rise of well there is arise of socialism around the world or athreatened rights of socialism do yousee this as a rejection of capitalismwhy is this happeningum the pie is growing at a much slowerrate right so the when does acivilization feel confident it feelsconfident when it's expandingum it's expanding when the economic pieis growing fast enough that generallystandards of living are uh being raisedum people feel that they haveopportunity prospectsum that trend has reversed not just inthe United States but but we'reexperience it yep yeah in the UK we wereexperiencing that absolutely and so whatwhat happens when the pie starts toum shrink well people start clamoringover the existing resources and callsfor redistribution become louder callsfor punishing corruption become louderthis often you know becomes a kind ofpopulism you know people like to sayright wing or left wing but I don'treally think those terms are appropriateI think there's a kind of inko at sensethat the elites as such are they'vegotten too top-heavy and that is in factmaterially the caseElites consume more resources than anyother stratum of the populationand as you know they have children theyreproduce and they expand generationafter generation they want all of theirchildren to be situated also as Elitesand so you can't have a shrinkingeconomic pie and a growing Elite baseforever eventually the elites also startto feel constraintsum and really that there's a historianuh Peter turchan who argues that priorto the Advent capitalism in theagricultural world it was actually thesebattles between Elite factions thatspelled the end of Empires I think Ithink the uhI think during covid during the year ofcovert and post-covid we we really had alight Shone upon a separation betweenthem and Us in two ways I think duringthe covert era we had the lights shownon this kind of separation between thethe elites and the the peasants in thatand I think it was in two waysum uh with the um the numbers that werepublished how some of the richest peoplein the world got much richer and then weall saw you know companies had to closedown bakeries ice cream I mean we hadMichael malice in here yesterday he wastalking about how he left New York hesaid all the you know all theinteresting little quirky shops they'veall closed you know all the cafes theice cream shops we we saw all that butwe also saw the ridiculous thing wherethere would be some kind of event I MetGala or whatever nobody was wearing amask but all the staff were yeah and Ithink it was the kind of like thisreally grotesqueum display ofof separation between Elites andeveryone else yeah look there's alwaysgoing to be wage disparities there'salways going to be rich and poor but tohave it so grotesquely put in people'sface now you add to that since then youknow a lot of Suspicion aboutthe truth that's coming to us that we'reseeing a lot of Suspicion with regardsto Media I mean the the I you know Malhas corrected me the same mainstreammedia called it corporate media butthere's a lot of Suspicion to theincentives now so I I I feel like we'rein this place ofyou have a teacher on on potentialRevolution and I don't say that lightlybut I just think people have [ __ ] fedup yeah yeah no I I think that's true Idon't want a socialist Revolution thoughwell yeah every Revolution is messyum and and revolutions tend to uh theytend to replace one set of elites withanotherum the question of whether or not theyaffect actual structural change thatwill materially upliftum the condition of the people is awhole separate questionum and you know in some casesredistributive revolutions have hadum near-term Equalization effects butthe problem with mirror redistributionis that if you're not generating theeconomic flywheel if you're notpreserving the engines of wealthGenerationUm then you're gonna just run into thesame problem that the past regime raninto and this is why capitalism mattersit's not because it's morally virtuousit's because it's the most reliablesocial technology we have for growingthe pie like before the 19th centurylike net World economic growth wasum almost stagnant like most peoplewould make the same amount like of moneyor resources for their entire lifeum that also meant the pace of socialchange was much slower but once theIndustrial Revolution hitsum once Capital becomes a technology youstart just seeing spikes in uh economicgrowth and much faster changingstandards of living culture changeeducation science I mean everythingtakes off which is not to say that it'sbeen great for everybody but there is nomeaningful alternative that doesn'tshrink the pie and shrinking the pie iswhat leads to famine and uh rollingRevolution well yeah and potentiallymillions of deaths the reason we hadMadison was we were talking about uh theSoviet Union and what happened underthere a Communist Revolution you knowtens of millions of people died was ittens of IndiansMillions maybe a couple of times yeah Idon't know the numbers a lot of [ __ ]people died yeah yeah well what's what'sinteresting is that you can't destroythe productive class right and Leninactually realized this so after theBolshevik Revolutionum there was a period of time when theCommunist Party wanted to you know doaway with money they dissolved thecentral bank they printed quadrillionsof rubles just literally hyperinflatedthe currency awayum people began you know bartering justto go about their daily livesum and Lenin quickly realized that heactually couldn'tum build the Soviet Union into anindustrial power withoutum some value some stable Peg of valuethat could be a store of wealth in amedium of exchange so he brought backthe central banker and re-established abank reissued the currencyum and in fact embraced some thingcalled the new economic theory whichwhich was also the model for Dengxiaoping's reforms in China that led itto be basically a market economyum so you know Lenin's thinking was thatum you actually had to haveentrepreneurial activity this the smallbusiness the entrepreneurum and the worker were all United inthis common cause of building theSocialist Republic andum the early USSR actually saw some ofthe fastest economic growth rates in theworld because they were I mean they werean agrarian economy industrializing andwhenever you do that you just I meanyour GDP goes through the roof becauseyou're literallyum exponentially increasing yourproductive capacityso where did the Soviet Union fail whereperhaps China has succeededso that's I mean that's a great questionum and I am not uh a historian of eitherof these places in enough depth toprobably answer it satisfactorily canyou point us where we should look yeahbut I I would suggest you know some ofthe major reasons that have beenidentified for the uh the slowdown ingrowth in the Soviet Union isinterestingly aroundum a kind of resource protectionism soum notwanting to basically be self-sufficientum which is is I think a a nobleintention but when your economy isgrowing you know sometimes there need tobe periods of time when you are relianton you know foreign sources of whateverum there also was this phenomenonwhereby the stateumkept plowing resources into factoriesum that were no longer productive so itwas a kind of propping upum you know again well-intentioned notwanting these you know workers to losetheir jobs these Factory towns tobasically become miserated I mean lookwhat happened in Detroit or the UnitedStates you know uh we just kind of likeabandoned that cityum the Soviet leadership didn't want todo that because after all that it wassupposed to be a Workers Party but theproblem with that is that the factoriesweren't solvent they weren't able tokeep up with the productive demands of agrowing economy and So eventually thestate just couldn't prop it up anymorethe state does run out of resourcesum and we're seeing you know thesecascading defaults start to happenaround the world now the United Statesis in a privileged position because allof our debt is denominated in thecurrency that we print and so there'sthere's a bandwidth that we have to kindof print awayum our insolvency for a certain periodof time buteventually the question of real valuealways catches up with you is yourproductive economy able to support thelevel of debt that you have and I wouldsuggest the answer is noso can we talk specifically about Chinauh for for a country an authoritariancountryit has been economically successful overthe last would you say two decadesum so the the realkind of post-mow reforms startedhappening in uh the late 70s early 80sum and they've they've continueddramatically and and now the problem isyou know China's facing many of the sameproblems as the United States which isthat they haveum a Tip-Top Elite of super richum people many of whom uh have beenengaged in scandals around you know notpaying taxes andum incurred public outrage aroundostentatious spending and lavishLifestyles and so the the Chinese stateis really trying to ramp that in or reelthat in likeum you know that's descent also rightand so this is the problem with with theexercise of state power it's always youknow framed publicly in this in thesevirtuous ways you know we're fightingcorruption we're fighting terrorismwe're fighting money laundering we'rewe're fighting crime but you know aswe're fighting all this other stuff wemay also find fight the people who aregenuinely criticizing us for reasonsthat we need to be criticized I meanJack Ma has just agreed to step downfrom Ali it's what's the what's the whyto come it's the Alibaba the maincompany I think so yeah yeah did you seethisI I did this week I agree yeah so yeahand groups have you got the articlebecause he went missing for a while yeahbecause he would been I don't needmildly critical and so he'd been missingfor a while probably in somere-education Camp somewhereum so yeah yeah to give up control ofChina's ant group jagmar will seecontrol of Chinese fintech uh giant antgroup the company announced followingthe Communist Party Crackdown on thenation's Tech sector the target thetargeting the characteristic billionaireone of China's most blah blah blah blahblah but the former teacher hadretreated from public view since Beijingtorched and planned an IPO in Hong Kongfollowing his Barbed comments aboutgovernment Regulators yeah his companyyeah he also met publicly with TrumpwhichumI I saw someone comment uh recently thatyou know in Chinaif you're if you're a captain ofindustryyou cannot also be a diplomat if you tryto cross into the sphere of politicsit's sort of overstepping uh your boundsum yeah I mean but but he was criticalyeah of the regulators and suddenlydisappeared and now he's back and he'sgonna control his groupumit's it's very authoritarian and uh butit's I guess the thing I wanted to talkabout is like even yeah as an outsiderwe're all very critical of China despiteus you know having iPhones and suchwe're all very critical of Chinaum but they have also managed to growtheir economy I mean you you saidthey've lifted 750 000 people out ofpoverty 750 million sorry 750 millionpeople out of poverty and so like whatare the what are the trade-offs hereyeah well I mean that's exactly rightum the question that many U.S electedofficials are asking openly now is whycan't we be more like China and thatchorus is only going to growum but that's actually veryanti-American because all the all thefilms and TV shows that kind of refer tothem I don't know this may be the erathe 50s 60s it was like oh they comehere yeswhere are the commies you know like itseemed to be like every EverythingAmerica stood for was anti-communismthat's right and the threat of theexpansion of Communism around the worldright right and now I mean I know thatthey're not communist anymore eventhough the Chinese Communist party thereis a certain amount of entrepreneurialSpirit but they said they areauthoritarian yeahum there is an economist who recentlywrote aboutum howthe the main Paradigm of politicaleconomy going into the 21st century isnot capitalism or socialism but adirigest economyum so that's a French term forum a market economy that is centrallydirected so it's it's neither you knowfull single party economic planning noris it free markets it's the state iskind of the benevolent Steward of themarketum andtakes a very active role in shaping themarketum and I I would suggest thatum you know China's perhaps on a moreauthoritarianum end of that Spectrum but most westerngovernments at this point aren't thatdifferentum aren't materially different they mayin their rhetoric and in their culturalTraditions have these traditions ofLiberty but um in practiceum the state is sort of seen as theArbiter of virtually everything fromspeech to economic transacting toguestives yeah I mean like literallyevery little thingum and again we talked about the hammerand the nail problem like you have ahuge military you're going to use itumthe political classtheir mandate is to pass laws and soum they tend to approach solvingproblems by passing more laws instead ofthinking about I'm just I'm sorry thereason I'm giving them not to Danny youdon't understandwhat is it uh every new law whether goodor bad means less Freedom roughlyright unless it's a law to remove abunch of lawsbut yeah generally speaking yeah exactlyso I mean it the laws we never get lesslaws like we don't get fewer laws we getmore laws we get a more complex layeringof laws and this then requires moreadministrators to interpret the laws andmore complexity in the layers ofgovernance that oversee these societiesand so the state gets bigger and biggerand biggerum that trajectory uh isn't going to bereversed through rhetoric it actually weneed real action here and it's going tobe hard there's going to be a lot ofresistance to it it also it also damagesproductivityI mean they're like absolutely uhto say that you don't get the removal oflaws I was memorized out in Wyoming uhwith Tyler Lindholm and he talked to mehe was talking to me about licenses it'slike you have to have a license to be ahairdresser it's like why do you have tohave a license to be a hairdresser I'veeven got hair or you can't and I thinkyou know you do get periods of would younot argue deregulation is a removal ofregulationsperhaps but they're the exception yeahthere's a neck I mean Eric Voorhees oneof my very first interviews you knowhe's a Libertarian talked about you knowthe size of the state he saidI'm not even asking for the abolition ofthe state or I just can we just get onepercent smaller right can we just getyeah just a little bit and then maybeTarget five percentumbut yeah it you know the nuclearindustry has been hamstrung byregulationum that's right yeah there's certainthings with it even what I do in the UKlike certain rules are holding back mybusiness the ability to get bankaccounts I'm now actually beinginvestigatedum for buying a house because I've soldBitcoin in the past huh there's so manythings like that they get in the wayyeahbut but how do you how do you get thesereforms because I'm with you now yeahyeahabsolutely how do you do it soum I think there has to be agenerational turnover in leadershipum and that in itself that's sort ofnecessary but not sufficient because whythere were generational turnoverleadership are you talking about thepolitical class uh I am talking aboutthe political class yesum becauseumI would suggest that the currentgeneration of political leadership hasbeen formed under a paradigm ofgeopolitical relations and economicum well let's just say political economythat is profoundly in this direction ofum good guy American kingum durgist State economies a sort oftop-down Federated uh system of controlthatum ensures that the world functionssmoothly well that's a very coherentpicture and it's comfortingum the prospect of a more decentralizedmulti-polar world is terrifyingum to many people in in the currentgeneration and you know even even thepeople who do lean more libertarian I Ithink the the younger generationum hasn't inherited the assumptions ofthe post-war order they're entirelydigitally native so the world is attheir doorstep and has been at theirdoorstep from childhoodthey have known nothing but economiccrisesum and a shrinking of prospects andlowering of standard of living and so Ithink they're openbut the question is always open to whatand this is why there has to beleadership there have to be peoplevoices in the public sphere who arespeaking in terms of character and notjust of getting yours or getting revengeagainst the bad people who took thingsaway from you no who are you going tobecome what are you going to build whatare you going to invest in and sacrificefor that's the world that you're goingto createwe seem to have very few people of thatkind of character and quality about atthe moment because I I mean you talkabout a turnover a generational turnover the political class but we do seepeople are entering the realm ofpolitics new interesting you knowyou can believe they want to change theyyou can believe they stand for somethingbut they seem to get co-opted by thesystem very quickly the incentivestructure the the horse trading thatgoes on behind scenes I mean we talkedabout it the other day and you know thiswhatever you think of Matt gets and hisquestionable datingum you knowyou know he he appeared to be standingfor something right and be a littlewhisper in his ear from The Godfatherand changed his vote you know so I I youknow I wonder how difficult it is to getanything done because the incentives ofthe system completely screwed yeah wellthis is this is the problem is that eventheum revolutionary voices or therebellious voices are themselvesbeholden to an authority structureum it's sort of it may be a mirror imageAuthority structure of the one that'sdominantum but you know this is athis is very much like you know the thesort ofdichotomy between obedience andRebellion that is such a cultural Tropeand like Teenage life or growing up youknow putting on the leather jacket andyou know showing my parents that I'mindependent by rebelling wellum you're still acting in reference totheir Authority when you're doing thatyou're just now opposed to it ratherthan for it and people who ping pongbetween obedience and Rebellion theirwhole lives never actually individuateand so what I'm talking about is a kindof cultural individuation where youbecome autonomous you act withoutreference to Authority it doesn't meanyou don't have authorities doesn't meanauthorities don't exist they're alwaysgoing to be authorities it's a socialtechnology but you are an autonomousindividuated human being who navigatesAuthority structures so I can't evenknow earlier when you talked about uhyeah Reformationrefunding the American dream based ontraditionalRepublican values so I'm bringing thatup because you said you know there is somuch polarization yeah to sell in uhreform based on traditional Republicanvalueson a on a person-by-person account youmay be losing plus 50 of the nation it'sonly close to 50 of the nation and Ithink some people might say no theproblem is we haven't evolved fromtraditional Republican values and theworld has changedhow can you ever get reform when whenthe reform is based onuh one political Wing yeah are there nottraditional American values that spanAmericans absolutely yeah and and when Isaid that I was I was being somewhattongue-in-cheek okayum I mean look when I think oftraditional American values I thinkRepublican yeah right I mean that's kindof been the Brand This is why everyDemocratic uh presidentialAdministration basically governs like arepublican Administrationum from a policy standpoint I mean therereally is no meaningful differenceum I would suggest uh between theparties on most issues there are a fewissues where there is a difference andfor some people those are the issuesthat they will vote on foreverum but there is absolutely a bipartisanum consensus thatum is is basically has shoehornedpolitics into you know different flavorsof the same thing and so when I you knowinvoked Mr Rogers earlier I mean he wasa a minister uh a republican but henever talked about politics on his showthere was nothing political it was hewas coming out of the era of children'stheater Puppet Theaterwhere the interest in the developingchild was considered to be Central tobuilding the character of the nextgeneration of American citizensum and and their friends and soyou know that there's a realumI thinkopenness that has been lost you knowAmerica is a nation of immigrants a lotof people believe that genuinely on allsides of the aisle America is a diverseNationum butthere's a kind of culture of hospitalitythat I think has a spiritual center youknow in his case he was a man of Faithum you don't have to be a religiousperson to have this conviction but theopenness of heart the willingness toreach a cross difference with theunderstanding that you and the personacross the table will forever bedifferent the goal is not sameness thegoal is doing something together that'swhat a shared project is and that's theonly reason that America Matters from mypoint of view yeah we had a gun in thepodcast last week Vivek I can't say it'sWyoming yeah Swamiumwe're not sure we 100 agree with himDanny you would be a little bit moreskeptical than I amum well I brought up this thepolarization and he said there isn'treally a a true Left Right divide thereal divide is between the management uhclass and the citizenry and when hetalks about the management class thatcould be from within politics withinum uh within umlarge tech companies you know the peoplewho get to make the decisions andthere's this kind of collusion thathappens between them that we saw withyou know some of the Twitter files havebeen released yeah and like mycomparison to that is in the UK we havethe nurses have been on strike recentlyand they're all strike they're all verysimilar people with a very same standardof living live in a very similar lifebut they are struggling with the rise ofinflation and Rise of cost of living youknow as nurses and they want to pay arise yeah and when they're on the picketline striking it doesn't really matterwhat party they represent right theyactually have the same goals the samekind of objectives of things the thingsthey want to do and I do wonder how muchthe incentive models of politicians andmedia is divide people who genuinely arekind of on the same team right sowhether I agree with Vivek or not I dorecognize that actuallythere are a lot of people whether you'redemocrat or republican you you're beingpunished the same way by a broken systemof incentives but you'll be you're beingtricked into creating The Wrong Enemymm-hmm absolutely I mean this is andwhat's funny about this is thatum I mean this was Marx's analysis ofthe German ideology in in the 19thcenturies is that this is how classpolitics works is it worksum when the elites exacerbate uhcultural divisions between the workingclass to prevent them from recognizingtheir shared interests as in fact themajority and the people who produce mostof the value that the managerial classsiphons offum and so you know the question is notso much as you know the managerial classor the capital class or the elites arethey like evilum or I mean do they serve a purpose insociety they do clearly there there hasto be an executive function forpersonalities of a higher order forhuman collectives to uh move in acertain direction to to produce valueum the question is is theum distribution of rewards of economicrewards proportionate to the valuethat's createdum noperight and and this is why we have youknow what some would call class struggleand what others would call you knowsimply uh freedom of contract you knowif if you as my employer are notcompensating me adequately for the laborthat I provide I'm going to go elsewhereand the problem is when the managerialapparatus either of the state or of theprivate sector gets so heavy that peoplecan no longer meaningfully exercise thatfreedomsame with the truckers right exactlyexactly that's why in some ways uhsometimes I'm like I should just stayaway from politics but I'm so interestedin it because I'm interested inthe solution I think so many people willfocus on uh what divisor separates usand then you know support this machineand perhaps I've done it at times formyself but I'm always looking out forthe people who are like yourself who islooking for a solution because this isso utterly broken and having it's it'snot benefited in hardly anyone yeah thisis this is fragmented Society you knowit's causing Division I just [ __ ]hate the whole thing but that's why Iwas you know Andrew yeah I found AndrewYang so interesting you know I disagreewith him on Ubi right absolutelydisagree with them on Ubi but he's atleast goingwe need something different even BrettWeinstein what was the he um he startedto try a new political party he had anidea where we would get as uh somebodyfrom the right somebody from the leftand former party together we get somestrength from both sides and get them towork together these you know whetherthese ideas are naive or work it's atleast there are some people withstrength out there sayingwe need to fix this and change thiswhich is why I kind of I want so muchmore out of Elon Musk like that's thekind of person who you think just yeahstop being captured by the audience likemake a difference right no and and thisis this is actuallyum the caustic nature of the celebrityculture that we inhabit now is it I meanit'll fry your brain and this is one ofthe things that I myself you know amcareful of like every public appearancethat I make is something that I treatwith great respect you know it's like awild animal because you don't want it towield you you want to be sure that youare wielding your public personalityum and that you are in service to theorganizations and the people that you'reresponsible forso there's a a wild Natalie's malinskyunder there that wewe prod in the right way we will get youto well any any kind of amplificationwhether it's throughum celebrity or power or money is uhyou're you're dealing with wild forcesum and if you don't know yourself thenum they will own you in fact you willown yourselfyeah and I think that's the big issuewith like we know this with audiencecapture once you're captured gettingyourself out of that position is verydifficult difficult because again backto incentives right your incentive is toyour uh you're you're incentive is todog whistle the audience you've createduh but I had it when I was with EricWeinstein we did this interview inum we're in LA and he said discardtemperature let's get let's get rid of10 20 the audience now let's insult themand get rid of them like keep sheddingyour audience keep willing to let themgo say things they don't want to hearbecause then when the audience you haveis going to respect you for the honestyof opinion and they're going to trustyou and you have integrity so manypeople out there have just been capturedI always Tim Paul's always a greatexample for me you know I just I justthink he's become a dick and that'sgoing to piss people off on this but heis so captured by his audience that hedog whistles them the whole time and Ifor me I think I have the strength to gookay I like someone what you saying whatyou don't say I think other people don'tyeah so those people add you know and bythe way people criticize the mainstreammedia these people are making the samemistakes they're doing exactly exactlyexactly the same [ __ ] thing that youknow someone like Tim Paul willcriticize the mainstream media and I'mlike you've you've got the same Playbookright you've got the same incentives youwanna you wanna separate your audienceyou want a dog whistle you want to buildup this kind of uh rabid following andyou know you you'll contribute into thesame problem it really pisses me offanyway Natalie what what is what is theanswerforeignthe answer is the slow hard work ofCoalition buildingand character building in a sharedprojectand that's the questionum what is the American project and Iwould suggest that the American projectis one ofum prosperity and opportunity regardlessof who you are or where you come fromum if you if you have an entrepreneurialSpiritum you know whether you're generatingcapital or knowledge or you know anyother form of innovation you should bewelcome here is that not true anymoreI thinkI think it is but less and less so Ithink it's becoming harder and harderfor either people born in America or whoimmigrate to America to make itum that needs to be fixed so you cancome here but like making it is also abarrier right what are the barriers thatare up well we have a veryum uh Byzantine and bureaucratic Visaprocess that routinely just leavesum thousands of people highly qualifiedum people uh either out of the countryor forces them to leave unable to setdown the roots that they need tomeaningfully build something hereum meanwhile you know we have uhimmigrants leading like the top 10technology companies in the UnitedStates and so there's there's clearly amismatch between our need for talent andour ability to to import the talent thatwe need to sustain the the engine ofeconomic growth and then you know forhomegrown Talentum the the challenge is you know oneoften of economic hardshipum and an education system that mirrorsthe hardship of the local communitiesum and so you have these are ViciousCyclesand that Visa system would you saythat's just a function of more laws morerules right yeah more bureaucracy noexactlyum and there's there's a lot ofpolitical grandstanding around immigrantvisas becauseum you know political administrationswant to appear tough on immigration oryou know like they're prioritizing uhAmerican jobs you know jobs forAmericansum but the reality is and and actuallyElon Musk has spoken about this is thateconomic Prosperity you know generallyrelies onum either like rapid population growthor a lot of immigrationum because you need to generate theproductive capacity and and that's yourhuman capital and so if you have ashrinking population and you're notreplenishingum kind of influx of fresh Talent thenyour economy will contract over time anddoes this also become political becauseuh correct performance wrong butimmigrants are more likely to voteDemocratum you knowI thinkI think there'scertain groups of immigrants that aretargeted by you know whatever the hatemessage of the day isum but I would say immigrants on thewhole are extremely diverseum I I grew up in a community ofimmigrants many you know from all overthe world and I would say the vastmajority of them voted Republican ohreally yeahuh that's not a function of thegeography where you're fromum it is to a certain extentum it's also a function of professionthere are certain professions that tendto vote Republican or Democratum that may have changed you know sinceI was growing up in that Community butum these areyou know when we talk about partyaffiliation we're talking about cultureyou know people are often Democrats orRepublicans in the sense that their youknow methodists who go to this church oryou know they're you know from thisparticular neighborhoodum and and so this this is why I'm I'mactually hesitant to label people yeahum because I've spoken topeople with very different partyaffiliationsum who who agree on issues that theywould never think they agree onum but for cultural reasons they can'tbe seen together or affiliate with oneanothergodum okay can you help me just understanduh just some historical context back uhhundreds of years ago when umAmerica established a little rights andthe Constitution and the forefatherswere debating it were there still twoyou know how was the political dividethen and how how were these issuesdebateddo you mean around um power projectionoutside of the United States no I'mliterally no no no just within theUnited States when the forefathers weredebating the Constitution the Bill ofRights and I know there are certainthings that were written anonymously butduring that period thebecause I am clueless to this the peoplethe forefathers themselves were theyRepublicans were they Democrats was it amix there so those parties didn't existokay so what existed then there I wouldI would say uh yeah I mean there werethere were profound Geographic divisionsso the main question in like the earlyearly American Republic wasto what extent are we a coherent projecta coherent Stateum there was a lot of opposition to theConstitutionumfor the reason thatpeople in in all of the different stateswere suspicious that a federalgovernment would Rob them of theirLiberties and each state had a verydistinct culture a distinct history likereason for formation like literallydifferent populations were sent there orchose to immigrate there from Europe andthat created different different statecultures and so there there was thesense that every state was Sovereign andyou know much like in the European Uniontoday that joining this largerFederation would result in a compromiseof State sovereigntyum and so actually the um theAnti-Federalists wereum just as vocal and popular as theFederalists wereum and in many states ratification ofthe Constitution happened through likesome really strong arm tactics likepeople being tarred and feathered andlike physically like beat up in inpublicum there was I mean it was a violent eraand so you know there was a question ofis America a country like is it acoherent project and eventually the theFederalists wonum I would suggest though I'm not ahistorian of this era because the logicof common defense was still so freshthere was still the sense thatum if we didn't unite if we didn't atthe very least share an armed forces wewere vulnerable to being you know takenover again by our former colonist orcolonial power or perhaps a differentone like Civil War rightum yes certainly that that was a concernas well well state by state conflictum I think uh probably more pressing waswas the concern that you know we justliberated ourselves from the BritishEmpire but they could be back and infact they were back right um and so weneed to hang togetherum but like Washington wanted todissolve the military he he didn'tbelieve that the United States shouldhave a standing army and this is why inthe Constitutionum it makes reference to well-regulatedmilitias this notion that you knowcitizens should have the capacity todefend themselves they should be readybut it but it needs to be a citizen Armynot a professional standing army that isan instrument of tyrannyum and look where we are nowyeah when when we had the brexit voteum uh for the UK to leave uh the EU Ireally struggle with the decisionbecause as a Bitcoin I was like wellIndependence is better you know smallerstates are better yadaum but I really struggled with thedecision I ended up speaking to one ofmy friends and he said the great thingabout the EU is one of the biggest it'sone of the most successful peaceprojects the world has ever seen and wehave not gone to war in you knowcountries in the EU have not gone to warwe've had war in Europe we had theBalkans but you know you you knowcountries within you you have not goneto war with each other because we areunited we won't disagree with each otherbut we United and so that that's alwayskind of like weighed heavily on me inthat's you know for all the bureaucracyand the inefficiencies you get the factthat you remove that incentive for waris kind of you know it's a big reason tovote to remain becauseI don't know it just feels like theright thing to do I'm not really goinganywhere with that by the way well Ithink what you're pointing to is thatum there was an economic friction thatwas removed yeah in trade betweenEuropean countries that did create akind of rising tide of prosperity thatincentivized the people to keep thepeace yeahum however that there was a trade-offthereum you created a larger uhadministrative class in Brussels yes umwho then could dictate terms um to everymember of this Union uh Brussels andStrasbourg do you know about the EUmoving to Strasbourg every month forthree daysyou know about this okay okay so I meanI I will I won't get the details correctbut in the establishment of the EU Ithink it was a French disagree with theidea that it would you know be placed uhit would just exist singularly withinBelgium and so the compromise was threedays a month the entire EU I mean theyliterally in lorries they packedeverything up they moved to Strasbourgfor three days they operate there forthree days they go back I think the costis like 150 million have you found itI'm just having a look now yeah I thinkit's at the cost of 150 million a yearyeah here we go oh your EU Parliament is114 million a year moved to Strasbourgaway some money but would it ever bescrapped so uh just to ruin the historyone can you scroll down a bit more Dannyyeah the EU parliament's triangle oflocation stress Birds Brussels andLuxembourg were formed to balance theoriginal smaller European Union amongthe cost of crude by the monthlyrelocation however includestransportation for thousands ofparliament officials political groupsparliamentary assistance of freelanceinterpreters in addition to paperworkthat is transported by trucks betweenlocation in March plenary resolution ofthe EP budget it was noted that theenvironmental impact is significantstandard between eleven thousand ninetythousand tons of CO2 a year theequivalent of driver between yeah yeahdiverse yeah I mean it's just [ __ ]ridiculous they literally move itum you can understand why they arguethrough it at the time but I think we'rein an era where that that is unrequiredbut yeah it is there's a lot ofinefficiency there yeah okay so uh youmentioned coherent state would you sayit's an incoherent State now then wellumthere are significant incentives toum maintaining the Integrity of the U.Sstateum one is much like the European Unioninterstate commerceum I mean if if there were to be abreakup of the United States thecomplexity of you know setting abilateral trade relations between all ofthe states would would make doingbusiness in any of the former U.S statesprohibitive for a lot of companiesum and again this common defenseum you know it's it's maybe uh it's notso hard to imagine the United Statesfending off a Chinese Invasion it's hardto imagine Mississippi fending off aChinese Invasion and soum there there are you know in terms ofeconomy and Military sovereigntyum really strong reasons to coherethe question is you know what beyondthatshould the federal government doum and I think that's really where theopen question issomaintaining a common defense there's athere's a solid and good argument forthat but uh removing the power or theamount that the federal government getsinvolved in would make the country moreefficient it would make it lessimperialist and that could lead to Imean how much of a common goal do youneed is as long as you have strongstates rights and States decisionspeople have the ability to move and livewhere they want anywayyeah no I mean it it's a it's a questionof uhto what extent do we maintain the stateapparatus that we've built like just togive you a sense of thisum there are currently 18 Federalintelligence agencies eighteen eighteenlike they've they've been exponentiallykind of growing like there's a hockeystick curveum and that's not to say anything of allof theum you know Federal basically police youknow uh law enforcement agencies andthen the state uh law enforcementMunicipal County Law Enforcement so thatthere's this massive and growingum police apparatus that exists at alllevels of government and to what extentyou know do people in Texas for exampleneed to be subsidizing with their taxdollars you know all 18 of theseintelligence agenciesI don't know hmmI'm not sure how to close this one outum let's open it well yeah I mean like Isaid to you what next you said build acoalition but yeahpart of me thinks maybe things have toget worse before they get betteryou know I thinkI don't know the answer like I'm totallyintrigued by this subject but I'mmassively out of my depth adding to itbecause I'm not an American I don'tunderstand historical context it'slittle I know about itwhat you put you're gonna have to closethis one out for me Natalie whatquestion do you put out there no I Iwould like to end with an invitation toyour listeners to consider what it wouldbe to build Libertyum what does that mean as a positiveprojectum you know over the next few years oneof the reasons that I do research intopolitical economy is becauseum I would actually like to turn theseprinciples into a set of actionablepolicies that uh something like apolitical not necessarily party butmovement can form around and this is whyI'm I'm actually genuinely inspired bythe solidarity movement that took downthe communist state in Poland I grew upyou know hearing stories of this and itwas very much alive when I when I was achild this was a coalition of right andleft and people of different religionsand atheists all across the Spectrum tosuggestself-determination is something that'sworth fighting forum and I think that Spirit of solidaritycan be rekindled again can you lead itwell I'm I'm out here trying I mean youhave thehistorical context with your parents itwould feel only right that you were tocarry that torch on here in the US andtry forward that solidarity absolutelyabsolutely well you would have my fullsupport and backing and the limitedresources I have to help you I hope Ihope you do it I'm so sick of it I'm sosick of it I'm I'mregret anything I've got involved inthat is uh drives polarization I've gotzero interest anymore yeah all I can Ijust care about trying to bring peopletogether I don't want to say it in a LexFriedman everyone but but at the sametime like there is something to be saidfor that like yeah we justwe need to bring people togetherabsolutely this is just the beginningyes uh we me and Danny are going to belooking for out there looking for theNatalie's valenski solidarity movementyes uh creating solidarity between thethe left and the right and hopefullyending this [ __ ] uh Natalie as wellout of my death today but I absolutelylove talking to you and listening to youtalk about this and I wish you all thesuccess uh where do you want to sendpeopleall right soum TXbitcoinfoundation.org I owe you somemoney oh well no I do I totally forgotabout that okay yeah I'm gonna send yousome money so we want to doum we're already publishing the Satoshipapers this is the first academicJournal we're bringing togetherhistorians economists social scientistsphilosophers to write about why Bitcoinmatters for human societies and forState Society relations specificallyum so that book is coming out and by theend of this yearum and then we also want to do some funevents like we want to engage people wewant to bring like some really smartpeople who aren't necessarily bitcoinersbut who write about the stuff that we'vebeen talking about today because I thinkbitcoiners are some of the mostintellectually curious people that I'veever met and they're hungry for this solet's let's do itthat was the question I didn't ask Iforgot I have a Bitcoin showwhat does the role of Bitcoin play inthis solidarity wellum it'sit's a reminder thatum all all power is not top down fromthe stateum in fact value is an emergentphenomenon it emerges bottom up asindividual people opt into somethingthat is better than what they'recurrently livingum and so what Bitcoin is first andforemost is an alternative it's a newway of imagining it's a new way ofrelatingum people have forgotten what a freedomto transact means that I can just payyou for something without having toinvolve a third-party intermediarywithout having to prove my identity tosome panopticon without having todemonstrate that I'm a good and loyalsubjectno the government is subject to me I amthe source of sovereignty you are thesource of sovereignty so let's take thatback yeah honestly I should show youthis email afterwardswe've got a quote for the opening of theshow I think yeah I think we haveumso in buying this house right I have tosend six months of bank statements andprove I have the funds in um in my bankaccount and now I've got my solicitorscombing over all my private transactionsand questioning them you know obviouslythere's Bitcoin transactions yeahthere's you know and they're asking mewhat it's about what it's for can Iprove it and it's it's such you know notonly is it invasivebut it's like why I'm not a criminalhere right what the [ __ ] have I donewrong exactly you know surely I mean ifI was American surely this you knowwould be against the the FourthAmendment yeah it's sort of sort of yeahoh yeah no that's search and seizureisn't it well this is the thing thethese constitutional rights aremeaningless you need a new constitutionno we needum we need a leadership class with thecharacter to live by it Integrity yeswow integrity and politicians don't gohand in hand Natalie listen I
