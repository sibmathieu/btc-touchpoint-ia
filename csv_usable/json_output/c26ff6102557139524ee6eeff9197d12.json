Many thanks to him for his work that I found beautifully written and very insightful.Nakamotard·Follow50 min read·May 8--ListenSharePreamble: The article is lengthy. You can go directly to the summary at the end of the article to discover the main takeaways. But obviously, they are more enlightening when one has read the complete article!To avoid making it even heavier, I use references at the end of the text indicated by numbers in brackets [X]. Feel free to refer to them throughout the reading! I have not found a more ergonomic solution on Medium to replace footnotes :(“Mr. Pasteur, you claim that by injecting me with a virus, you will cure me?”Yes, I’m starting strong with a controversial subject that has nothing to do with it: vaccination.Actually, it’s not really “nothing to do with it.”The common ground between Bitcoin and vaccination is that both solve problems in a counterintuitive way.Medical history is indeed extremely rich in examples of this nature, which seem funny to us today but were not at all at the time of their occurrence. The Hungarian physician Ignace Semmelweis, for example, was interned in an asylum where he died for suggesting that doctors’ hand washing could reduce infections in mothers during childbirth.Pasteur, better known in France, fortunately did not have the same fate and was honored with numerous national awards. But the process of vaccination remains counterintuitive when one is not educated about it: how can the injection of a disease prevent said disease?Similarly, Bitcoin is counterintuitive: it consumes a lot of electricity… which allows it to promote the fight against climate change.The assertion may seem disturbing, even shocking, and very much like “greenwashing,” but the aim of this article is to try at a minimum to present you as honestly as possible why Bitcoin is not the ecological disaster that is presented to you, but on the contrary, an unexpected solution.To do this, I will present my argument in two parts. The first will not deal with the “operational” functioning of Bitcoin, i.e., its energy consumption in particular, but with its systemic implications on human behavior compared to the current monetary system, and how Bitcoin promotes sobriety. The second will address two major operational categories: the deployment of renewable energies (RE) on electrical grids, and the use of Bitcoin as a catalyst in the fight against methane.Part 1: The current monetary system is the biggest environmental destructive machine humanity has ever invented.“The Argentine inflation experts give their advice to disoriented Americans.”This is how Bloomberg attracted readers in December 2021 to its article on the “sudden” rise in inflation in the United States.It must be said that all those who had docilely listened to central banks and other specialists could only be surprised. First, inflation did not exist. Then it was supposed to be temporary (“I see an inflation profile which looks like a hump,” said Madame Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank (ECB) at the beginning of December 2021. Understand: it’s a temporary bump). And it wasn’t until November 2022 (!!) that the same Christine Lagarde admitted for the first time that we probably had not yet reached the peak. Of course, she absolved herself of responsibility, since this inflation had “appeared out of nowhere!”But my goal here is not to blame anyone. Rather, it is to draw attention to the famous advice given by the Argentines, who are used to terrible inflation, to Americans, whose monetary and financial daily life is the opposite, thanks to their position as the world’s leading economic power, based on the international reference currency.“Figure 1: Argentine Peso vs US Dollar since 1992. In 5 years (April 2018), the Argentine peso has lost 90% of its value against the US dollar, which itself has lost between 15 and 20% in purchasing power… [2]”What is this advice?“Spend your paycheck right away,” the article reports. To fight rising prices, you should spend your money faster? This may seem counterintuitive when you are used to being careful with your money. Counterintuitive because inflation refers to two different things. In the “common” sense, inflation refers to the general and sustained increase in prices. Initially, however, inflation is the phenomenon of increasing the money supply, that is, the amount of money in circulation in the economy. When this increase is too rapid, for example, faster than productivity gains, inflation results in the loss of purchasing power of money, which ultimately leads to the general increase in prices, referred to by the “common” sense of the word inflation. What is counterintuitive is therefore actually quite obvious and revealing: we do not spend our money because prices are rising. We get rid of it because its value is decreasing day by day.To realize this, it is necessary to carry out a thought experiment, to put oneself in the shoes of a good part of the world’s population and to consider one’s daily life in an economic area whose currency is collapsing. Some countries, by the gravity of their situation, allow us to see these effects before our very eyes, without even needing to open a history book and review the Weimar period in Germany. In Venezuela, for example, over the past ten years, the value of the currency has been divided by 400,000. In other words, on average, Venezuelans have lost two-thirds of their savings every year for the past ten years. If you could afford a beautiful house in Caracas in 2013, you can now only afford a piece of bread in 2023. In 2019, inflation reached the unimaginable figure of 2,000,000%.Figure 2: In Venezuela, inflation is so high that the currency is worth less than the paper it is printed on! This leads local artisans to use it as a material, as seen in this photo, with this handbag made out of banknotes.Of course, Venezuela is an extreme case, but in 2022, almost half of humanity was living with a “official” double-digit inflation rate, thus losing at least half of their savings every 5 years. In this context, it becomes “rational” to spend our money at all costs and buy anything. Because anything will always be better than losing the fruit of one’s labor. Indeed, if the money you receive loses its value in a duration that is no longer measured in years, but in months, weeks, or even days or hours, then every minute counts.“Consume, you poor fools!”This hyperinflation situation, which we hope to never see in our country — although its likelihood of occurrence is increasing — has at least one merit. It opens our eyes, through an extreme situation, to a more insidious daily reality: the incentive and economic behavior system induced by traditional fiat currencies.Indeed, whether inflation is at 1%, 2%, 10%, or 100%, only the intensity changes, but not the general mechanism: the incentive to get rid of one’s money. In other words, after satisfying essential needs, the incentive is to invest it in the hope of beating inflation (stocks, real estate, works of art, etc.), or to spend it on short-term, non-essential goods or services, often fueling overconsumption.The second option is generally preferred because it is less risky and requires less time and expertise. Indeed, how can one reasonably ask a layperson to become a seasoned investor and beat inflation (while keeping their job, of course!), when even the vast majority (80%) of asset management professionals struggle to beat major indices? Investing is a full-time job, and it is far from easy.Money is the lifeblood of the economy, and the monetary system as it is currently constructed influences all our buying behaviors and decisions, forcing us to prioritize the short term and spending over sobriety and the long term, without even realizing it.In other words, we will not have sobriety in the current monetary system[6]. It is impossible. And yet, sobriety is necessary in all scenarios envisioned by the IPCC for our planet to remain livable.Throughout human history, saving was generally considered a wise decision, allowing people to insure themselves against the perils of an uncertain future or guarantee a future for their children. We sacrifice our short-term well-being and comfort to improve our long-term prospects. In short, we behave prudently, and in the only way that allows humanity to progress.Today, this sober and forward-thinking behavior is insidiously punished in favor of waste, comfort, and the short term. The climax was reached at the time of the arrival of the Covid pandemic, when central bank interest rates turned negative. In economics, the interest rate represents the price of future risk, and a negative rate means for all economic actors (including households, you!) that the future is more certain than the present, which is by definition impossible. Why save if tomorrow is hyper-certain? How can we make any long-term decisions when the rules of the game are so absurd?The direct and terrible consequence is that any attempt to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or preserve biodiversity through sobriety is doomed to fail in a system where each of your actions is directed towards the consumption of natural resources despite yourself. In a corrupt system, corrupt behavior is rational behavior.To explain this more practically, I will adopt Endorsen/Baseload’s colorful explanation on Medium, itself borrowed from economist Saifedean Ammous in his excellent and lengthy interview with Lex Fridman, although I do not agree with all of his analyses.To exchange goods and services, we need a medium of exchange. If Farmer A produces oranges and wants apples, and Farmer B produces apples but does not want oranges, Farmer A will have to find something that Farmer B wants to obtain his apples, such as bananas. The banana becomes the medium of exchange.Assuming bananas are used by a society as a medium of exchange, a problem would quickly arise: bananas rot in a few days. The incentive here is therefore to get rid of bananas as quickly as possible to obtain something more durable.A rational behavior, therefore, is either to eat the bananas (immediate consumption), which is not necessarily the best when one is not hungry, or for example to pay someone who is genuinely hungry by giving them some bananas, and ask them in exchange to cut a tree for you to store wood, which is more sustainable. You hope that this wood will allow you to buy more bananas tomorrow when you are really hungry. In this case, of course, it is hoped that you have done your analysis of the wood market, supply and demand, dynamics of resource utilization, etc., at the risk of having to sell your wood for fewer bananas in a few years. This is the alternative of investment. The end result: a tree that did not ask for anything from anyone has been cut down.This metaphor allows us to illustrate quite simply what we have seen previously, namely the tragedy of a means of exchange that cannot preserve purchasing power: it forces us to spend or invest, i.e., to consume natural resources.Inflation is the name given to the speed of banana rot. In February 2023, inflation in the eurozone was 8.5%. This simply means that your euro does not rot in a few days like a banana, but in a few years. At this rate, in about 5–6 years, any euro saved will have lost half its value. Yes, half.What is the incentive for all participants in such a system? “Spend your paycheck right away,” as the Argentines would say.You are driven away from saving, forced to find projects to finance to beat inflation. The result is often the financing of activities that would not have been sustainable in a normal context, fueling once again the unnecessary extraction of natural resources[7].To this shaky incentive system, we must add a dubious construction that amplifies the ecological absurdity that the current monetary system constitutes.We all pay in oil.At the end of World War II, the international monetary system, previously based on gold as a standard and the British pound as the main reference and pivot towards gold, changed drastically during the Bretton Woods agreements (1944). According to these agreements, gold retained its role as the world standard, but the US dollar became not only the main pivot, but the only pivot. In other words, all world currencies are expressed and converted into US dollars, and only the latter is convertible into gold at a fixed price: $35 per ounce (today, nearly $2000 per ounce. Did someone say inflation?).For the United States, the temptation was strong to give in to the ease of creating dollars ex nihilo, without supporting them with gold acquisition. This was done in the 1960s, particularly to finance the Vietnam War and its intensification from 1965, as well as President Johnson’s Great Society social programs. In 1965, it was France under General de Gaulle that began to blow on the house of cards by calling for a return to the gold standard, and above all by beginning to sell its dollars in a sustained manner to recover gold.Figure 3: France’s international reserves. Starting from the presidency of de Gaulle, France began to accumulate its reserves in gold. Source: IMF.In 1970, there were only the equivalent of 11 billion dollars in gold left to support… 24 billion dollars in reserves held by foreign countries.Figure 4: Stock of gold and dollars: United States and the rest of the world. Source: IMF.In 1971, the United States defaulted. They will not redeem the gold they owe. Gold is no longer convertible at the agreed price. It should be noted that, as often, this major, unilateral, unjust, and confiscatory political decision was presented as “temporary” in order to make it easier to digest. Friedman used to say that nothing is more permanent than a temporary measure…For the first time in history, currency is therefore not backed by anything. No commodity. This is the birth of purely “fiat” currencies (“So be it”). This is followed, as everyone knows, by a complicated decade: oil shocks, inflation, stagnant growth…Gold, which had been the very definition of stability for centuries, adjusted to the quantity of available money, and its price skyrocketed.Figure 5: Price of an ounce of gold in USD since 1915. The year 1971 is clearly visible on the graph: it is the moment when the curve explodes upwards.Can you imagine? In 1792, the price of an ounce of gold was set at $19.75 in the United States, a young country emerging from a war of independence against the world’s first superpower, the British Empire. In 1932, the price was $20.67! In a century and a half, the price did not even fluctuate by 5%! In contrast, since 1971, that is to say, in half a century, the price has gone from $35 to $2000, an increase of 5600%[8].In the months and years following this monetary cataclysm, the influence of the United States was clearly questioned. The emergence of a multipolar world, in a context of Cold War that did not help matters, was a possibility. The Americans had to find a substitute for gold that would allow them to continue to dominate the international financial and monetary scene.That substitute was oil. And in particular, Saudi oil, within the framework of a historic agreement signed in 1974 by Kissinger, the US Secretary of State, and Saudi Crown Prince Fahd, which led Saudi Arabia to sell its oil exclusively in US dollars and to recycle those dollars into US debt. Black gold replaced gold.As Alex Gladstein, Director of Strategy for the NGO Human Rights Watch, reports in his article “The Hidden Cost of Petrodollar,” citing a Bloomberg article, the agreement is surprisingly simple: the Americans “buy oil from Saudi Arabia and provide the kingdom with military assistance and equipment. In return, the Saudis sow billions from their oil revenues into US Treasury bonds and finance the US government’s deficit.”The OPEC followed suit in 1975, and soon the entire world was pricing its oil in dollars. If you want to feed your machines, to use Jancovici’s (famous french engineer specialized in explaining in simple words concepts related to energy) wording, you need dollars.Since that day, we have all been paying in oil. And in weapons too, as it is the counterpart of the agreement. Saudi imports of American military equipment increased from $300 million to over $5 billion between 1972 and 1975.[9]The current global monetary system, launched in 1971, is an incongruous parenthesis in human history, unfortunately still open, and which, out of habit, is now taught as normality or even progress.A “progress” whose legacy in just 50 years is quite impressive: devaluation of labor in favor of assets, further fueling inequality, rampant deindustrialization, incentives for short-termism and consumption, etc. The “narrative” that has prevailed, to avoid talking about oil or weaponry, is that fiat currencies derive their value from “the wealth produced by a country or an economic zone,” which is completely false. How can we explain, if this were true, that the monetary base could be doubled during the pandemic, for example, when the global economy is at a standstill and in decline?The illusion created by artificial demand and a military-industrial agreement with a Gulf monarchy was sufficient to preserve the status of the American currency as a reference, and more generally to sanctify the concept of fiat currency, which had always seemed absurd to our ancestors, and each experiment with which had been a disaster. Voltaire already said in the eighteenth century that “paper money, based solely on trust in the government that prints it, always ends up returning to its intrinsic value, which is zero.” The episode of Law’s system, then that of the assignats during the French Revolution, marked his century with their resounding failure.Energy, past or future? Money, the great absentee from climate and energy thinkingThe fundamental difference between a currency like gold, which was the reference for humanity for several millennia[10], and paper money is the relationship to time and the energy spent to create value.In a system where gold is the currency, each monetary unit represents past energy. Despite the attempts of alchemists to create this precious metal ex nihilo, gold cannot be “invented”; it must be found. It is a commodity money system. Indeed, the gold nugget paid to a merchant had to be extracted first, by someone or something. This represents an already spent energy. And when you pay with it, you are only transferring a representation of that energy to someone else.In a system like this, the economy is constrained by the physical world and therefore compatible with a finite world, since the currency (here, gold) itself is a natural resource, available in limited quantities. It takes work to extract gold, and only then is that gold available in the economy, portable in time and space, and used for consumption, investment, or saving. Savings are a perfectly viable alternative because in a world constrained by physics, any allocation of resources is made at the expense of another allocation. So, if at a given moment, no investment seems worthwhile, it is perfectly logical to save, waiting for a better opportunity.This does not mean that the system cannot grow or prosper, of course. Both the first and second industrial revolutions largely increased global wealth, all under a gold standard system[11]. This was thanks to the discovery of new sources of energy (respectively coal and then oil, to simplify), and especially new ways of releasing it productively into the economy (steam engine, internal combustion engine, etc.). However, the physical constraint remains.On the contrary, in a purely fiat currency system, like the one we have currently, each monetary unit represents not a past energy expenditure, but a promise of future energy. In a fiat currency system, money is created through credit. When you borrow money to buy a house, you go to your banker, and it is the banker who creates money out of thin air to help you buy a house when you cannot afford it.The “underlying asset” of the money the banker has just created is your future ability to repay the loan. No energy expenditure is necessary, except for the muscle tension required to click the banking software button and create hundreds of thousands of euros. This is not a commodity money system. It is a debt money system.In such a system, money is not constrained by the physical world. It is constrained by the economic actors’ anticipation of the future. A perfectly subjective data, and above all… manipulable, especially through central bank interest rates. The lower the rates, the more economic actors are encouraged to think of the future as low-risk, and therefore to create money through credit.Some economists argue that limiting inflation would kill the economy by creating deflation, which slows down incentives for consumption. But firstly, from an environmental preservation perspective, this is precisely what we want (to limit overconsumption or at least waste), and secondly, the idea that deflation would necessarily be harmful is a shortcut. The prices of electronics and computers, for example, have been decreasing steadily for decades, and this has not prevented consumers from buying when they deemed it necessary, nor has it prevented the industry from growing and hiring. The effect of deflation, compared to inflation, is indeed to push back non-essential purchases because savings are favored. Or rather, savings are not penalized, they are simply a viable alternative. This is precisely what should be the case. It is perfectly acceptable to have created artificial needs and overconsumption for decades with fiat money, and then to accuse sobriety of destroying this superfluous consumption! Know that any economist or politician in favor of a fiat currency system is de facto in favor of a system that encourages consumption. And this is not something “hidden,” by the way, since “consumption” is one of the variables of GDP, this magical quantity that must absolutely grow…Money is therefore energy that travels through time and space. And, for the record, this is what actually led the industrialist Henry Ford, at the beginning of the last century, to propose the creation of an international monetary unit based on energy. A sort of joule standard.The current monetary system, favoring inflation and therefore perpetual devaluation of money, is an organized theft of our most precious resource: time. And it’s not a bug, but a desired feature. The statutory mission of central banks is to target 2% inflation. Beyond being perfectly arbitrary, this level is insidious enough for us not to notice it on a daily basis, and that’s the point. Because noticing it would panic savers and turn the global economy into a giant Venezuela. But it only takes a little perspective to realize it: the dollar has lost 97% of its value in a century since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, and the euro has lost a third of its value in 20 years. Give it more time, and it will undoubtedly catch up with the dollar’s feat!It is absolutely clear that the commodity-money model, limited in quantity, constrained by physics, requiring real work before circulating in the economy, is much more compatible, even necessary, for pursuing the environmental and climate goals of our time. One could also argue that by limiting the effects of financial bubbles on assets, it favors work on capital, something that should appeal to both traditional leftists and liberals in their fight against rents. But that’s a debate for another article![12]It is unfortunate that this aspect is so often overlooked in climate and environmental analyses and recommendations. Yet it is the elephant in the room, the main data point of the system that conditions everything else. Infinite fiat money is taken as an unchanging input, an unquestionable assumption, even though it is one of the most polluting and destructive machines that humanity has invented. By its historical construction, at the intersection of oil and weapons, but also and more seriously, by the warped economic incentives it conveys to all economic actors.At this stage, two questions remain:What monetary system substitution can incentivize virtuous behavior towards the environment?What would be the environmental impact of such an alternative system?Which substitution system?The most immediate hypothesis seems to be a return to the gold standard. Gold is rare, difficult to extract, divisible, and transportable. It has a long history as a good currency and enjoys international consensus.Although its failure in the twentieth century might make us skeptical, attempts at a return to the gold standard have been made. Recently, three Republican representatives even made a proposal to the U.S. Congress to allow such a return. Among the reasons they gave for the proposal were those mentioned earlier: “The dollar has lost more than 40% of its purchasing power since 2000, and 97% since the passage of the Federal Reserve Act in 1913” and “The actions of the Federal Reserve have created inflation rates of 8% or more, increasing the cost of living for many Americans to unsustainable levels, enriching financial asset holders, while threatening the jobs, wages, and savings of blue-collar workers.”In the 1990s, at the end of the Cold War, some economists were already calling for a return to the gold standard and warning us of the pitfalls of the fiat system in a way that now seems prophetic. This was the case with Bettina Bien Greaves, a collaborator of Nobel laureate Milton Friedman, who in a 1995 article outlined the modalities of a return to the gold standard. According to this economist, “time and again throughout history, paper currencies have generated waste and high costs; they have distorted economic calculations, destroyed people’s savings, and wiped out their investments.” She also cites her distant colleague, William Graham Sumner, a 19th century economist: “All our attempts to gain by easy money have failed and have cost us, in every generation, much more than a commodity-money would have cost, even if every generation had to buy it anew.”However, gold has a first problem: it is not at all suited to the digital age. Gold does not exist on the Internet and does not allow for fast and inexpensive international transactions.Gold has a second problem, of an environmental nature this time, and it is that it is extremely dirty to extract: cyanide, mercury, arsenic… All of these substances, which are not recommended for humans and life in general, are necessary and in large quantities for its extraction. The world’s largest mine, Grafsberg in Indonesia, is, for example, a veritable environmental disaster in the heart of the third largest tropical forest on the planet after the Amazon and the Congo Basin. More than 250 km² are contaminated: groundwater, rivers and streams, soils, etc. The waste is estimated at more than 87 million tons per year.In France, the subject of gold is also causing concern. The “Montagne d’Or” project in French Guiana has been particularly publicized in recent years, with always the same issues that could be summarized somewhat caricaturally as follows: should we go and dump tons of cyanide in the virgin jungle to collect nuggets whose probable future is to sleep in a safe? Indeed, central banks are among the largest holders of gold in the world, despite the fact that gold is no longer the standard of the monetary system! Habits die hard…In metropolitan France, the debate is just as lively. It’s simple: the most polluted site in the country is… an old gold mine, the Salsigne mine, in a site sadly renowned as “the valley of arsenic”. In 2018, during floods that carried the waste from the old mine, the problem was brought back to the attention of the region’s inhabitants, and extremely high levels of arsenic are found in schoolchildren in the surrounding area. A problem that the state seems to be ignoring.Part 2: Bitcoin: an ecological disaster, really?Bitcoin: the digital goldIn 2008, an anonymous person calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto invented a UFO, a “peer-to-peer electronic cash,” which they called Bitcoin, a “digital coin” in English.Bitcoin mimics the characteristics of gold: rare, divisible, transferable, etc. But it does so in the digital world. A bitcoin can be held on a mobile app and sent anywhere on the planet in a few minutes.To ensure the security of the system, Nakamoto proposed the “proof of work” system. The concept consists of providing an irrefutable proof of work (energy expenditure) in order to guarantee the immutability of the system. Systemic immutability (the rules of the game must not change: number of units in circulation, transaction process, etc.), but also practical immutability (one should not be able to appropriate someone else’s bitcoins!). This energy expenditure is provided by voluntary third parties, usually companies, called “miners” in reference to gold mining.[14]Bitcoin thus becomes the first digital private property. Unlike everything else in the digital world, it can be owned by oneself. Bitcoin is not someone else’s counterpart. It is an asset, a digital commodity, and you can own it directly, by yourself, without a bank or other third party. Bitcoin therefore allows for the first time to attempt to reconstruct a monetary system of digital commodity money, and not of debt money.Like gold, Bitcoin used as currency is the representation of the transfer of a past energy expenditure, not a future promise. This proof of work, energy expenditure therefore, is also a necessity of the system. It’s not a bug, it’s literally the solution to a computer problem that no one had ever solved before.Instinctively what happens in your head resembles this famous meme inspired by the video game GTA: “Ah shit… here we go again.” “Another additional, even superfluous, energy expenditure. It’s not with that we’re going to solve our problems…”Figure 6: the famous meme “Ah shit here we go again.”I understand this reasoning. The effort I ask for is to try not to stop there. Because in reality, and even if it seems counterintuitive, the positive externalities of this system, beyond the general and economic aspects that we have studied above, are numerous. Including from an operational point of view.Indeed, the great machine that started in 2008 has created, involuntarily or voluntarily, the only economic incentive system for energy transition. With Bitcoin, energy transition is no longer a cost but a revenue. The power of this assertion is unimaginable, and a real hope for the future.All energy actors who have had the humility to pass the instinctive stage of wholesale rejection, and have dedicated time to the study of Bitcoin, have had this “Eureka” moment. This moment when you finally understand something, and you reprimand yourself for not seeing it before. This is the case with the Norwegian giant Aker, who recently announced opening a new mining business, calling it an “essential network balancing battery for the energy transition required to achieve our Paris agreement objectives.” This is also the case with the Japanese energy leader, Tepco, who has launched the same strategy for valuing surplus electricity. We could multiply the examples: the Texas network operator (ERCOT), the oil companies ConocoPhillips or Exxon, but also independent investors or actors among whom Daniel Batten [15], whose testimony, which I transcribe here, may sound familiar to your ears.“As a climate activist since the 1990s, when I first heard about the use of Bitcoin energy, I thought, ‘This must be a bad thing.’ When I heard someone say it was ‘net positive,’ I thought, ‘That sounds like greenwashing.’”[…]. No one was more surprised than myself to discover that the best way to do it (reduce our greenhouse gas emissions) was to mine Bitcoin. […]Are you lost? That’s normal. I will try to explain how Bitcoin, beyond its economic aspects, is an exceptional opportunity, a formidable lever, and even the missing piece that we have been waiting for in the energy transition.There are two main lines of thought. First, Bitcoin helps transition to an electricity mix made up of a greater share of renewable energies. Secondly, Bitcoin acts as one of the most important vectors for reducing methane emissions into the atmosphere, a gas whose environmental impact is significantly higher than the more well-known CO2 (80x stronger over a 20-year period), and one of our main short-term levers for action against climate change according to the IPCC.Bitcoin & Electricity Grids: A Smart Partnership to Accelerate Electrification and Renewable Energy DevelopmentIt’s not me saying this, but the interim president of the Texan grid operator (equivalent to RTE in Texas), Brad Jones: “Bitcoin mining helps new renewable energies find a home on the grid, then balances their intermittency”. Brad Jones isn’t an internet troll looking to speculate on cryptocurrencies. He has 20 years of experience in energy, including 3 as president of the New York grid operator, and 4 as vice-president and then president of the Texan equivalent. How, then, can he come to such a counterintuitive statement?To understand this assertion, we need to take a step back and understand the major challenges that come with the necessary transition to renewable energy sources. These challenges can be synthesized around intermittency. Renewable energies, and particularly solar and wind, which we will discuss here, are not controllable, and their ability to generate electricity does not necessarily correspond to the location or time when most consumers need it.This leads to a multitude of related problems: load balancing, voltage regulation, energy “lost” or wasted during transmission, or capacity to scale up. These problems do not allow for the construction of an electricity grid that runs solely on solar or wind power, even with the help of batteries.Let’s first talk about the spatial and geographical challenge. Unlike thermal power plants, solar and wind power require a lot of space to be built, which often leads them to be developed in remote locations isolated from consumption centers. Consequently, two usual problems in electrical grids are exacerbated: losses during electricity transmission due to Joule’s effect, and congestion, meaning the grid’s inability to transmit this electricity to consumption locations.Two examples can be cited to illustrate the latter problem. The first is American, the second is from New Zealand.In the United States, the electrical grid is not unified at the national level, and several networks coexist: the Texan network, the Californian network, the New York network, etc.During the period March 15, 2023 — April 15, 2023, the average price of electricity in California was $60/MWh. In Texas, it was $22/MWh. How can this triple difference be explained within the same country?The Texan network is much better supplied with electricity generation than the Californian network, given its consumption. In terms of renewable energy sources (RES) alone, the Texan network has an average active power almost twice that of the Californian network (18 vs. 10 GW), even though Texas is somewhat less populated (30 million inhabitants vs. 40 million) and California has an almost 50% higher GDP ($3,598 billion vs. $2,355 billion). Unfortunately, congestion on the network does the rest: electricity cannot physically flow on a large scale from Texas to California. In other words, using a car metaphor, it’s as if there weren’t enough cars in California, but the highway coming from Texas isn’t wide enough, causing traffic jams. This is perfectly unfortunate, since Texas is large and relatively flat, and allows for a significant amount of RES to be installed, which California cannot easily do, being squeezed between the Rocky Mountains and the ocean.In New Zealand, the location of RES generates another problem reported by Daniel Batten. Almost all of the electricity produced at the national level is already renewable (mostly hydro). But this electricity is produced on the South Island, where the mountains and rivers allow hydroelectricity to be deployed, while three-quarters of the population live on the North Island. Therefore, it becomes difficult to regulate the electrical voltage of the network. The solution the country seems to be moving towards is intriguing: a regulation station, estimated to cost $100 million, useless 99% of the time, not generating electricity, but able to regulate the electrical voltage of the network when necessary.This solution doesn’t seem very satisfactory if more electricity could be generated on the North Island and the flows balanced. But to do so, a consumer who can operate from a remote and poorly served location would have to be brought to the middle of the island, where there is space but few inhabitants. This leaves us with the option of Bitcoin mining and batteries, whose installation and operation can be carried out in such places.This brings us to the second problem with renewable energy sources (RES), which is their inability to produce electricity when we want it.Solar energy produces during the day, not at night. Wind energy can produce all the time, but it is highly unpredictable. Empirically, electricity consumption experiences two peaks in the morning and late afternoon, and is not stable throughout the day, nor does it correspond to the moments of production of these RES.Figure 7: Average daily electricity consumption in France by hour, source RTE 2020 Electricity BalanceNature is so poorly designed that the peak production of solar energy, for example, almost exactly matches the consumption gap… We produce the most when we consume the least.Figure 8: Reference production curve for French solar according to RTE. The peak is reached, as expected, around solar noon.Batteries have long been presented as the solution to this problem, but they are not sufficient. Although their cost has been rapidly decreasing for years, they generate their own problems.Firstly, their capacity is finite, which means that they cannot absorb surplus beyond a certain amount. Beyond this physical finitude, this also generates a profitability problem, that is to say, they must discharge as soon as they have the opportunity in order to remain “available” for future surpluses. This injunction does not necessarily correspond to the moments when market prices are interesting. This is an economic risk that has a cost.Secondly, batteries compete for rare resources (lithium, cobalt, nickel), which should steer their use towards sectors where they are irreplaceable, typically electric cars. The use of batteries for balancing grids, to meet absolutely enormous needs, may have to give way if an alternative solution arises for this use case, and that is not deployable in others[16].On the other hand, mining can be complementary with batteries to offer flexibility to the operator and the network manager, by providing a second outlet to choose when wholesale prices on the main network are insufficient, or when the batteries are full.This flexibility remains the main advantage of mining: being able to be installed anywhere, to turn on and off instantly, on command, and for as long as desired. It is literally the perfect specification for a demand-response program that networks will increasingly need as intermittent energies develop.According to a definition by the International Energy Agency, a demand-response program involves moving or reducing (erasing) electricity demand to provide flexibility in energy markets, thus helping to balance the grid. There are two different mechanisms: first, price-based programs (“implicit demand-response”), which use price signals to encourage consumers to shift their consumption[17]. Then incentive-based programs (“explicit demand-response”) that monetize flexibility directly through direct payments to consumers who voluntarily erase when asked. We will mainly focus on incentive-based programs.These programs may seem counterintuitive because they require the installation of new flexible consumers, thus increasing electricity consumption. However, they are necessary for the energy transition. According to the International Energy Agency, in its “Net Zero” scenario, it is necessary to add 500 GW to these demand-response programs by 2030 (about 50 GW in 2020).I repeat, because this point is often counterintuitive and mentally blocking when discussing the virtuous character of adding electrical consumption to a network through Bitcoin mining: yes, it is not only accepted but also desired and recommended by international organizations to INCREASE electrical consumption in these programs in order to promote the transition to electricity. Because we will not change the electrical mix to non-pilotable and therefore unpredictable supply without changing the nature of the demand to flexible.However, the sectors that usually fill these programs have many constraints. In fact, we had to have these debates in France last winter. Do you remember when the nuclear power plants were facing the problem of stress corrosion cracking, and electricity prices seemed to never stop rising, and the question of rationing and load shedding arose? With questions like: should households or businesses be deprived of electricity first? Which businesses? Can certain regions be cut off before others? etc.In this context, and as the question of industrial sovereignty resurfaced, the case of aluminum factories was quite representative, as they are very large consumers of electricity. Indeed, Cyrille Mounier, CEO of Aluminum France, declared on September 9, 2022, that a single primary aluminum factory consumed as much electricity as the city of Marseille.The question then arises: wouldn’t this be a great candidate for an erasure program?Yes… and no. According to Cyrille Mounier, the maximum duration for which an aluminum factory can be shut down is two hours. Beyond that, the aluminum solidifies, and the factory must be demolished at a cost of around 2 billion euros. So it is better to be vigilant and not exceed the threshold…This case is emblematic of the problems encountered by these necessary demand response programs: finding a willing customer to shut down their industrial equipment (and capable of doing so!) for an indefinite period, with the threat of extreme climatic or geopolitical risks that can require immediate action in just a few hours or minutes, is a Gordian knot.This brings us to several graphics that the company Lancium (as relayed here by Shaun Connell) has been able to produce on the case of Texas and its ERCOT (Electric Reliability Council of Texas, the network manager), which allow us to better appreciate the advantages of mining for a real network and under actual conditions.The first is a summary of what we have just seen above, that is, a visual version of the advantages of mining compared to typical demand response customers. A steel plant can reduce its electricity consumption by up to 96%, but not for more than two hours. A cement plant can achieve 70%, but not for more than three hours. A Bitcoin miner can achieve 97% reduction instantaneously, for an unlimited duration. For a simple reason: there is no industrial equipment or supply chain that would suffer as a result of mining being turned off. That is the beauty of the Bitcoin network: it operates in a decentralized manner thanks to mining around the world. Unplug Texas, and Bitcoin will continue to function normally.Next, we have the historical price curve of the MWh in Texas.We can clearly see on this graph that the price oscillates between $0 and $130/MWh for almost all the time, but, as often, it’s the extremes that pose problems: on one hand, the periods during which the price is negative (beginning of the curve) and we don’t know what to do with the generated electricity because the demand is not strong enough, and on the other hand, the periods during which the price suddenly rises exponentially during peak demand, significantly impacting the wallets of consumers, households and businesses.I want to focus here on negative prices and electricity surpluses because I have noticed that it is also a mental block for some, even to the point of denying this reality, that yes, surpluses or overcapacities are real issues to manage for an electricity grid. Even in Europe, where the grid is well interconnected, these problems exist: for example, during Easter week, the Czech Republic literally disconnected hundreds of solar panels because the grid could not handle this excess electricity, Spain was doing the same thing, as shown by the graph below, whose shape you now know in normal times (see above RTE solar curve), and even the Netherlands, a big country for solar (no), is starting to sweat with “forward” prices reaching up to -200€/MWh (!!).Figure 9: Photovoltaic power curve in Spain. In the afternoon of April 17, about 1 GW was disconnected from the grid as wholesale prices dropped from €168/MWh to €4/MWh.Figure 10: “Day Ahead” Price Curve of MWh, i.e. the price for reserving electricity for the next day, on April 19th, 2023 in the Netherlands. At this moment, nobody knows how the surplus energy produced by photovoltaic panels during the sunniest hours will be used, which leads the producer to pay for someone else to use the electricity.As of April 19th, 2023, in the Netherlands, no one knows at this time how the surplus energy produced by photovoltaics during the sunniest hours will be used, which leads the producer to pay for someone to use the electricity.In the United States, some areas have negative prices more than 25% of the time, and the average frequency of these negative prices increases (surprise, surprise) with the deployment of renewable energy sources, quadrupling in just 15 years.Figure 11: Frequency of occurrence of negative prices in the United States in 2020.Figure 12: Average frequency of negative prices in the United States (green) and average wholesale prices (blue) since 2006These negative prices, which significantly impact the profitability of renewable energies and therefore their deployment, are not a marginal problem, but rather quite central.The installation of Bitcoin mining can have an effect on prices that can be represented on the following graph in the “valley filling” category. This means that mining increases the price of electricity during periods when it is particularly low, while contributing to sustainably lowering it during peaks. In other words, it eliminates risks to the profitability of renewable energy producers while reducing the cost for consumers on average and in the long term.Figure 13: Types of demand-side load management in an electricity networkHow does this manifest itself in Texas?The following graph shows the example of the summer of 2022, which saw extreme heat in Texas, with miners whose machine shutdown is programmed to trigger when the electricity price exceeds their profitability threshold (that is, when prices rise high enough, in this case, 125$/MWh. The S19 being a model of mining machine).Figure 14: Load curve of mining in Texas, price of MWh, and breakeven threshold of this mining, during the summer of 2022 in Texas.We obtain a double mirror curve, the green and the purple. The green represents the electrical power requested by the miners to operate, the purple represents the price of MWh. When the price (purple) exceeds the breakeven threshold of the miners (orange), then the machines stop instantly (green) and “return” the capacity to the network to produce for other customers. They do not do it out of altruism, they do it because they would lose money if they did not, which is generally a reason for the reliability of this mechanism: everyone has an interest in working in the same direction.When they stop their machine, like any participant in an incentive-based curtailment program (seen above), the miners are paid by the network operator for the service they render. The miner has a stable business model (either they mine, they are profitable, or they do not mine, they are compensated), the operator has a flexible consumer available, the producers can come and develop the electrical capacity of the network, and the consumer sees their bill decrease in the medium term. Everyone wins.It should be noted that the Texan network manager, ERCOT, in a recent report, praised Bitcoin mining following the historic blizzard that the United States experienced this winter. A difference that was materialized by the stark contrast in adaptive capacity between Texas and Pennsylvania. Where Texas was able to mobilize nearly 1.7 GW in emergency by relying on the cessation of Bitcoin mining, i.e., more than the flexibility offered by battery storage (0.9 GW), wind power (1.5 GW), or hydropower (0.4 GW), the Pennsylvanian operator PJM Interconnection had to ask the 65 million Americans it serves to turn off, among other things, their Christmas lights on December 24 and 25. This allows me to sarcastically remind you here that Christmas decorations in the United States alone have a monthly electricity consumption higher than Bitcoin (globally, not just the USA) during the holiday season, and for some reason, there are no articles about the environmental catastrophe they represent.The long-term effect for the network is to send a favorable price signal for the installation of a greater amount of renewable energy, as the risk of having to bear losses by having negative prices becomes almost zero. And with the installation of greater production capacity, average prices decrease in the medium term for all end consumers.We often see at this stage of reasoning a defensive reaction from Bitcoin detractors, who would prefer to see other methods to accelerate the deployment of renewables, rather than resorting to these erasure programs. Let’s calmly reason: when these erasure programs fail, there are two alternatives. Either take the risk of “blackouts”, simply, or electricity producers must resort to what are called “peaker plants”, i.e., controllable thermal power plants whose sole purpose is to be mobilized quickly if demand suddenly grows. And to be mobilized quickly, the turbines must remain hot, which leads to running these power plants idle 24/7, wasting fossil fuel and emitting CO2. No alternative is frankly exceptional.If the use of batteries allows to reduce the use of these power plants, mining allows to amplify the interest by doubling the “increase in supply” effect of batteries with a “reduction in demand” effect of mining, which is much more reactive. Indeed, a battery cannot “instantly” return all its energy to the grid, whereas a miner can stop instantly, offering much more flexibility when managing a demand peak.To conclude on this aspect, I would take word for word the conclusion of the above-mentioned article by Daniel Batten, and which I have largely been inspired by:Solar and wind power do not match the “when” or “where” of consumers.Bitcoin mining doesn’t care about the “when” and “where” energy is produced.This makes Bitcoin the catalytic customer that solar and wind power were waiting for to make renewable power grids a reality.When batteries and Bitcoin mining are used in conjunction with solar and wind power, they can solve almost all of the “when” and “where” problems that threaten to limit the amount of renewable energy a power grid can afford.Today, Bitcoin’s electricity mix is obviously not perfect. The study used as a reference in most media is the one from Cambridge, which estimates the share of renewables in Bitcoin’s mix at 37.5%. Not surprisingly, when we connect to an electricity network, we simply consume the electricity mix of that network. There are no green electrons and grey electrons, just electrons. But this figure already tells us something: mining tends to favor installation on networks where renewables are overrepresented. Indeed, globally, the share of renewable energy (including hydro) in the electricity mix was 28% in 2020, which is 25% lower than the mix announced by Cambridge for Bitcoin.But above all, this study has a major limit (acknowledged by the authors themselves), namely that it only takes into account mining connected to various national networks. However, as we have just seen (and will continue to see in the next section), incentives to place oneself outside national networks, in underserved or even isolated areas, are strong for miners. So strong that in reality, more than half of mining takes place outside these networks! The Cambridge study is therefore “relatively” reliable (at least for the order of magnitude), but for less than half of the electricity used! By including “off-grid” mining, located directly on isolated production sites, the proportion of renewables in Bitcoin’s mix is over 50%. This is more than any other industrial sector. And above all, the trend towards greening is increasing every year. To say that Bitcoin is dirty today and that all the arguments I have just deployed are false because there is still coal in the electricity mix used by Bitcoin is therefore fallacious, and as foolish as saying in the 1990s that solar or wind power should be thrown in the trash because they are not profitable. What interests us are the orders of magnitude, the comparison with other mixes, and above all the trend over just ten years.But this still leaves us with a small half that is non-renewable. However, this figure is also to be relativized, because part of the use of this “non-renewable” is a positive-sum game for the climate, and one of our best levers of action, as we will see.Reducing methane emissions: finally a solution to a known and major problem.We have seen at length how bitcoin mining can contribute strongly to balancing electricity networks, and promote the deployment of renewable energies by improving their profitability and reducing their risks.There is another way in which mining can be used that is already contributing to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions: the hunt for methane.Methane is indeed a much more dangerous GHG than CO2, 80 times more in the short term (20 years). Each molecule of methane released into the atmosphere is equivalent over this period to 80 molecules of CO2. According to the Climate Policy Initiative, “while methane is responsible for nearly half of net global warming to date, […] funding for methane emissions reduction measures represented less than 2% of climate-related financial flows, a little over $11 billion, in 2019/2020.”Using already produced and previously released methane as an energy source is therefore actually “carbon negative”, unlike renewable energies, whose operation is “carbon neutral” (I am not referring to their manufacture here), because it reduces the overall impact on the climate. Here too, the conclusion is counterintuitive, but there are contexts in which, paradoxically, CO2 is emitted to mitigate climate change.According to Inger Andersen, Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), “reducing methane is the most powerful lever we have to reduce climate change over the next 25 years, in addition to the necessary efforts to reduce carbon dioxide.”Once that’s been said, we need to identify where anthropogenic methane emissions come from. According to the aforementioned UNEP report, “more than half of global emissions come from human activities in three sectors: fossil fuels (35% including 23% for oil & gas, and 12% for coal), waste management (landfills, wastewater, etc.) (20%), and agriculture (40%, including 32% for livestock through manure and enteric fermentation (the famous “cow burps”), and 8% for rice cultivation). This is one of the reasons why reducing meat consumption, especially beef, can drastically reduce our GHG emissions.”But while this last idea seems to be generally accepted, little progress has been made for years on the first two levers, fossil fuels and waste.The case of gas flaring is emblematic. “Flaring” is a practice that simply involves burning methane to prevent it from being released into the atmosphere. This combustion transforms methane into CO2, which is a net gain for the atmosphere, since as we have seen, methane is much worse than CO2. However, this flaring is not 100% efficient (92% on average according to the International Energy Agency), and it represents a cost for companies that have to engage in it, which does not really incentivize them…In most cases, this concerns landfills (where waste emits methane) and oil companies, which face this problem when exploiting oil fields that contain gas in too small quantities to be economically productive and which therefore must be flared due to lack of demand.In the case of landfills, for example, in the United States, only 30% of methane emitted through this channel is flared, the rest is simply untreated, vented into the atmosphere as it is.In the case of hydrocarbon operations, the International Energy Agency tells us that “natural gas flaring has been a long-standing problem for the oil industry. The most recent data indicate that approximately 150 billion cubic meters (bcm) of natural gas were flared worldwide in 2019, the same amount as Japan and Korea imported that same year. Despite a growing awareness of the problem and a number of initiatives aimed at reducing flaring, the amount of gas flared each year has slightly increased in recent years, and the world is flaring as much today as it did ten years ago.” This provides an opportunity to appreciate (sic…) this satellite map of places engaged in this kind of practice.Figure 15: Satellite map of gas flaring. Data from the Earth Observation Group, Payne Institute for Public Policy, Colorado School of Mines.And this is only the “least worst” aspect of the problem. As with landfills, since flaring represents a net cost for operators, according to the IEA, approximately a quarter (!!) of the gas that is not used effectively (i.e. used on site, re-injected into the well, or transmitted to consumption areas) is released into the atmosphere without combustion. This represents 55 bcm per year, of which 19 bcm comes from the Middle East and 13 bcm from Africa.Since Bitcoin detractors like comparisons, here’s one: if all this lost gas had been converted into electricity, we could have obtained the equivalent of three-quarters of the annual electricity production of the entire European Union[21]. This puts things into perspective.Thanks to the same characteristics that make Bitcoin a boon for the development of renewable energy and balancing grids, namely a very high degree of flexibility and the ability to be installed anywhere without impacting other logistics chains, Bitcoin has the potential to simply contribute to half (!!) of the UN Environment Programme’s methane emissions reduction targets by 2045[22] (!!).Other technologies enable methane storage or capture. In a recent discussion I had with an oil operator, efforts to reinject methane into wells, for example, were mentioned in order to avoid flaring or releasing it into the atmosphere.But where Bitcoin changes the game is that chasing methane becomes a source of income rather than a cost! A real “game changer” to use French.The lack of economic interest in treating this methane is the main reason for the dramatic findings mentioned above by the IEA, namely the immense amount of untreated methane, and the stagnation of efforts and results for at least the past ten years.Bitcoin offers a quickly deployable alternative with proven efficiency (see Crusoe Energy)[24], which alone can achieve half of the UN’s objective. And this without political intervention, often a source of friction, inertia, or inefficiency, by using a carrot rather than a stick, i.e. by directly remunerating each ton of methane avoided. No more cat and mouse games between slow regulators who do not have the means to implement sufficient controls, and an industrial sector that does the bare minimum, when it is not simply trying to mask or circumvent regulations. The recalcitrant will simply be less profitable than their competitors.Bitcoin establishes a true global incentive program to work for the climate, a global methane hunt financed by the private sector, voluntarily, and not by your own funds. The dream.The Blind Spot of the IPCC: We Are Not in a Collaborative WorldThis last point is particularly important because, in my opinion, it is one of the blind spots in the IPCC’s recommendations. This is perhaps a more personal aspect of the analysis, and I do not claim to have the revealed truth.In its latest report, the sixth, the IPCC establishes what it calls SSPs, Shared Socio-economic Pathways, which are projected global socio-economic evolution scenarios until 2100. These scenarios allow for modeling and anticipating various consequences on the climate and on the adaptation of human societies throughout the planet based on our current behaviors.These SSPs are numbered from 1 to 5, and are defined by a paragraph of text that can be easily found, for example, on Wikipedia.In summary, the SSPs can be represented on a matrix based on the challenges they represent for two variables: adaptation to climate change on the one hand, and reduction of this climate change on the other.Figure 16: Positioning of the SSPs on a matrix representing the challenges to climate change adaptation (x-axis) and those to climate change mitigation (y-axis). Each SSP has a title summarizing the underlying scenario. In order (1 to 5): “Sustainability”, “Middle of the Road”, “Regional Rivalry”, “Inequality”, “Fossil-Fueled Development”.For example, SSP1 is the “best” scenario. Everyone cooperates effectively, we manage to reduce and adapt to climate change. It describes a “more inclusive development”, “respect for perceived environmental limits”. “Management of common goods is slowly improving, investments in education and health are accelerating demographic transition,” and “inequalities are decreasing both between countries and within them”.In contrast, SSP3 is the most pessimistic. Entitled “Regional Rivalry,” this scenario takes place in a context of “resurgence of nationalism,” evokes the return of “concerns about competitiveness and security,” “regional conflicts that push countries to focus on national or at most regional issues,” policies that focus on security, military, energy, food, and “low priority given by the international community to environmental problems leading to a strong degradation of the environment in certain regions.”In short, quite unenthusiastic perspectives.The problem is that the description of SSP3 is eerily similar to the current and likely future world. War in Ukraine, tensions in Taiwan, industrial sovereignty, energy security, “resurgence of nationalism” are subjects that are much more on the political agenda today and in the coming years than inclusive development and the management of global common goods. The probability of suddenly moving to a collaborative world is extremely low, which is problematic given the time we have…However, the IPCC does not identify any possibility in SSP3 of achieving the objective of limiting the global temperature increase to +1.5°C or failing that, 2°C compared to the pre-industrial period. The reference conclusion in SSP3 (SSP3–7.0 for purists) is simply a cataclysmic warming of 4°C.Implicit conclusion of reading the IPCC report: we need to collaborate more to avoid SSP3.Unfortunately, SSP3 seems to be the baseline hypothesis and the world we are heading towards.The interest of Bitcoin is that it is one of the few solutions that works without political coordination, i.e., it is compatible with the probable SSP3. This absolutely does not mean that we should stop our efforts or stop fighting for more international coordination, but it is crucial to have a lever that can be activated even in the worst circumstances of fierce competition and refusal of global cooperation.In summary, for those of you who may have had the perfectly understandable weakness to skip a few lines or read diagonally:The current monetary system is built to favor growth, consumption, and punish savings, i.e., sobriety and long-term time, the main vectors for preserving resources and their better marginal allocation.This system is based on an opportunistic alliance between the world’s first army and a Gulf oil monarchy. This alliance allows the first party to establish geopolitical, financial, monetary, and legal domination, as well as unlimited deficits and perpetual runaway, and ensures military protection to the second party. All payments in traditional fiat currency are based on this agreement. We all pay with arms and oil.This system, despite the current discourse, is not the “normal” or “what has always been.” It is the exact opposite: a parenthesis opened barely half a century ago, initially presented as temporary, and which has imposed itself by habit as the practically unquestionable new normalcy. Humanity has operated differently for 99% of its history; it is not an indelible reality that would naturally impose itself but rather a collective illusion generating its share of winners (people close to the monetary faucet) and above all losers (everyone else + the planet through resource predation).This illusion can be entirely terminated. However, like a drug addict, withdrawal will be difficult. We have so accustomed our societies to infinite money and the illusion of debt that returning to reality cannot be easy or without bumps.The energy transition requires electrification of needs as much as possible, and the rise of renewable energy sources (RES) in the global energy mix. This leads to a drastic increase in production capacity and, above all, the need for network flexibility. The latter is currently one of the main weaknesses slowing the transition, leading to physical problems (voltage, transmission, etc.) and economic problems (negative prices).It is not possible to build a “renewable” network without demand flexibility, i.e., without a functional and reliable demand response program. Bitcoin miners are by far the best candidates for these programs.One of the least-discussed points of climate change, yet one of the most important, is methane emissions. The fight against these emissions, although designated as a priority by various international agencies and organizations, has stagnated for years. Bitcoin offers a possibility to fight against the most harmful short-term greenhouse gas now, without requiring political coordination, as it transforms the hunt for methane into a profitable treasure hunt for those engaged in it.All of this reasoning is independent of your moral or philosophical judgment on the “social usefulness” of Bitcoin. At this stage, even if you consider that Bitcoin has zero economic and social usefulness or that it is just a Ponzi scheme, it remains one of our main levers for action on climate change. And, moreover, in this hypothesis, a lever funded directly by fools, thus preserving your purchasing power!The last barrier to the development of Bitcoin mining to help us achieve our environmental goals is its image.This leads to absurd situations. In 2017, the World Economic Forum headlined “By 2020, Bitcoin will consume more energy than the whole world today.” Obviously a ridiculous assertion, based on calculations from an employee of a central bank (did someone say conflict of interest?), which only fueled criticism against Bitcoin. In 2023, Bitcoin’s energy consumption is around 0.01% to 0.1% of global consumption. So at least a factor of 1000 error, followed by no mea culpa. And obviously, the myth continues, fueled by media that never verify the original source of the assertion (I note that this same central bank employee continues to be cited today as the main reference source).However, the same World Economic Forum, in April 2023, released a video highlighting the success “of a start-up that captures wasted methane to power data centers.” That start-up is Crusoe Energy, mentioned earlier. And the “data centers” in question are Bitcoin miners.How do we go from denouncing an environmental cataclysm to highlighting a Bitcoin start-up in 5 years? Thanks to Crusoe’s genius and the cynicism of the WEF. It’s simple, Crusoe doesn’t talk about Bitcoin, but about “mobile and modular data centers” “able to install on site, close to wasted energy sources.” In short, Bitcoin miners, but without saying “the forbidden word.” Hide this Bitcoin that I cannot see. It’s sad to have to resort to politically correct contortions in order not to be accused of destroying the planet when we’re precisely trying to help it?Bitcoin is an counter-intuitive solution to climate change, requiring a certain intellectual effort and honesty. Bitcoin is the best carbon credit there is, accessible to all, without conditions, and with concrete and immediate results. The alternatives for your savings, punished by the current monetary system, are not satisfactory: ESG labels and other “green” financing, beyond a certain opacity, often prove to be disappointing in terms of financing orientation.Buying Bitcoin today is encouraging someone, somewhere, to balance an electrical grid, develop renewable energies, or remove methane from the atmosphere. While peacefully advocating for the end of the petrodollar system that incites every person on earth to destroy natural resources.Warning: I am neither an energy expert nor an electrical engineer. I am someone who tries to be curious and intellectually honest, and who thinks that energy and Bitcoin have at least one thing in common: they are both immensely complex and fascinating subjects, too siloed today. I obviously sourced the assertions and hypotheses I used in this text, and tried to be as rigorous as possible. I am of course open to debate, corrections, remarks, and comments. I may have forgotten elements in my reflection, and I always learn with great pleasure. However, comments like “blah blah blah Bitcoin pollutes”, “this is whataboutism!!!”, “evil Bitcoin lobby speculating on the backs of the poor!” or other unargued invectives will be deleted.Footnotes[1] And Mrs. Lagarde added “Inflation will decline over the course of 2022.” We now know that it roughly doubled in the euro area over the period, rising from 5% to over 9%.[2] The US Dollar itself being subject to inflation (between 1.2% and 4.7% between 2018 and 2021).[3] The goal is not to launch an economic debate on the causes of price increases. The latter does not necessarily and solely originate from the increase in the money supply. Other factors may play a role and/or postpone the appearance of price increases over time. For example, the increase in the quantity of money following the 2008 crisis did not generate a massive increase in prices in the sense that it is usually calculated (Consumer Price Index). However, for some, if the average increase was not observed, it is because it was offset by productivity gains that pushed prices down, for others it simply shifted towards financial assets, real estate, and technology stocks in particular, etc. There is, in any case, a very broad consensus to argue that, especially when it is faster than productivity gains, the increase in the quantity of money is a major factor in sustainable and widespread price increases, and for some, such as economists of the Austrian school, indeed, the only one. The 1976 Nobel laureate Milton Friedman said in this regard the famous formula “inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon”.[4] Between 1921 and 1924, Germany experienced an extraordinary hyperinflation, with the value of the paper mark being divided by (hold on tight) 100,000,000,000 compared to the gold mark. This is one of the most well-known and studied periods of hyperinflation.[5] I write “official” because these figures are often contested in their calculation method and are accused of sugarcoating reality. For example, the truflation.com website proposes another methodology than the official one, and if the calculation leads to roughly the same result for the United States over the past few years, it gives a figure ranging from 15 to 20% for the United Kingdom for almost a year, whereas the official figure is barely 10%. I do not wish to debate here which figure is the “right” one, but to draw attention to the fact that these figures are regularly contested and that it is likely that more than half of humanity is affected in reality.[6] I am talking here about systemic sobriety. Of course, individually, one can be very strong and resist incentives and injunctions. But this is doomed to remain at the stage of marginal and individual contributions that require strong personal sacrifices, of people who are capable of consenting to these sacrifices (psychologically, but also materially because their needs are already met in general).[7] It could also be argued that it is often these same activities that create “bullshit jobs,” meaningless jobs, in “zombie companies” that are not profitable and survive by rolling over their debt to pay interest on it, and which subsequently take governments hostage by making a preservation of jobs against subsidies.[8] This gold curve may look familiar to you. It indeed looks like that of… bitcoin! This raises questions for us: is it the numerator (gold or bitcoin) that is a speculative bubble that is appreciating unreasonably? Or rather the denominator (the dollar) which is losing its value?[9] A brief diversion into current events: this is why recent oil production cuts, including by the Saudis, as well as their desire to sell their oil for other currencies, especially yuan and ruble, could be the beginnings of a major geopolitical shift underway.[10] For those who are interested, we explain in our book with Claire Balva the beginnings of the use of gold as a standardized currency in the 5th century BCE, and the legacy of goods used as currencies in our vocabulary: the words “salary” and “soldier” come from salt, “species” comes from spices, “silver” obviously comes from silver, etc.[11] The gold standard system does not prevent the development of credit or banks either.[12] I invite you to listen to Jacques de Larosière on this subject, whose CV is far from placing him in the category of anti-system conspirators (Former Managing Director of the IMF (1978–1987) and Governor of the Bank of France (1987–1993)), and who speaks extremely critically of the actions of central banks and recent monetary expansionism.[13] Out of a total of 171,300 tonnes of gold held in the world, 84,000 are in the form of jewelry, but the holders are dispersed among a number of holders that is difficult to know. Conversely, 6 countries (USA, Germany, Italy, France, China, Russia) alone hold more than 20,000 tonnes of gold. If private investment is added, more than 60,000 tonnes of gold are sleeping in vaults.[14] This energy expenditure is consented to because it is paid in bitcoins through the transparent and predictable mechanism of Bitcoin’s monetary creation, namely: 50 bitcoins issued every ten minutes (in 2009), a sum divided by two every four years or so, resulting in a maximum monetary mass of 21 million units reached around the year 2140. Like gold, Bitcoin is rare and finite, and bitcoins are becoming increasingly difficult to “find”.[15] Daniel Batten has been an investor, author, analyst, and environmental activist for several decades, and is now the founder of CH4 Capital, an investment fund dedicated to projects that reduce methane emissions. He is the author of the website batcoinz.com, which offers numerous reflections, calculations, and estimates regarding the environmental impact of Bitcoin.[16] And for now, bitcoin mining does not seem to allow vehicles to move, for example![17] Think of the “off-peak” rate of EDF, for example. In Paris, for example, electricity prices are drastically reduced between 1pm and 3pm, as well as between 1am and 7am to encourage the use of electricity-intensive appliances such as washing machines during these periods of low consumption on the grid. This can also lead to disputes within households, when these time slots are missed and someone is sought after to blame. And no, this is absolutely not a personal experience![18] When a price is negative, it means concretely that the seller is willing to pay to find a buyer, often because of the inability to manage externalities such as storage. Obviously, a negative price greatly affects the profitability of the seller, that is, often in the case of electricity, the producer.[19] Electricity cannot be stored, or at least not very well. Unlike other industrial sectors, the supply and demand must be constantly balanced because surplus cannot be shifted in time. Therefore, power grids establish targets for electrical frequency, which are controlled to ensure that supply and demand are always equivalent. In Europe, the target objective is 50 Hertz, with a tolerance of plus or minus 0.05. Failure to meet this can lead to major problems for the grid, such as load shedding, overheating, degradation of infrastructure, or production equipment… So, a surplus of electricity is not a blessing at all.[20] D. Batten mentions this figure and the US Environmental Protection Agency as a reference, but I do not have the link to the primary source.[21] Based on the ratio of 10 TWh per bcm of gas, we obtain 2050 TWh for the 150 + 55 bcm of flaring + venting, compared to the EU’s annual production of 2664 TWh in 2020.[22] The source of this assertion is also Daniel Batten, in an analysis “peer-reviewed” by Ruben Mendoza, consultant, Margot Paez and Sergio Sejas, climate scientists: “Using Bitcoin mining to burn previously released methane could eliminate 5.32% of all global greenhouse gas emissions by 2045. This represents 23% of global methane emissions: more than half of UNEP’s 45% reduction target by 2045.”[23] United Nations Environment Program, whose objective is to reduce methane emissions by 40 to 45% by 2030.[24] Existing pilots have been successful. For example, see the case of Exxon, or Crusoe in the United States whose combustion efficiency is 99.9%.[25] If you are wondering about this social utility part, I refer you to my previous article, the survival manual in the jungle of anti-Bitcoin clichés (available in video/podcast format, thanks to Grand Angle Crypto!), or my column on BFM Business in December 2022.[26] The same unfortunate cynicism exists in France, where some companies avoid using the word “Bitcoin” (or “crypto”) in their statutes to avoid triggering a vendetta by the banking industry, which unilaterally closes the accounts of companies.BitcoinClimate ChangeBitcoin MiningRenewable EnergyPetrodollar----FollowWritten by Nakamotard0 FollowersFollowRecommended from MediumThe Pareto InvestorNASA Just Shut Down Quantum Computer After Something Insane Happened!Houston, We Have a Problem!·3 min read·Nov 9--96Ignacio de GregorioOpenAI Just Killed an Entire Market in 45 MinutesThe Story Everyone Should Have Seen Coming·6 min read·Nov 9--185ListsStaff Picks507 stories·458 savesMedium Publications Accepting Story Submissions154 stories·1026 savesPomeroySaysOnlyFans Ruined My Friend Mandy’s LifeAll she wanted to do was pay off some debt.
