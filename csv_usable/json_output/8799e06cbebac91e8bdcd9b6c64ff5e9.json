  "text": "hello everyone welcome to the my bitcoinstorieswe are yeah this podcast capture storiesfrom people about their journey withbitcoinand today we got a special guest robertritloffuh welcome to the show thank you i'mvery glad to be hereyeah robert bridlov is the ceo and cioof parallax digital he's also frequentquestfor financial and bitcoinmedia such as real vision the reach thatchannel the kaiser reportthe investor podcast network whatbitcoin did and tells from the cryptand considered to be an important figurein the bitcoin spacethrough his writing and presenting theidea of separation of money and stateso robert you have been featured in manyshows and podcasts where you share yourview about fiat money and money ingeneral and you have a lot offascinating ideas which is one of myfavorites as welllike master and life of money the numberof zeromoney and bitcoin money bitcoin and timeseriesso a lot of people like reno reallyadmire you on the wayfor you think about bitcoin so myquestion is likehow did you get to think like you doright now was ityou know like what is the background wasit your friend from your parents fromyour family friendsuh it's funny because like howhow did you get to think the way you doum i i assume it's some combination ofnature and nurtureum but from aas long as i can remember i've beenextremely curiousum i've talked about this a littlebefore but when i first started readinga lot um it was actually driven by mycuriosityabout the universe so i used to justwe had a trampoline went camping a lot ialways found myself juststaring up at the stars wondering wtfwhat's going on herethis is a lot so as soon as i kind ofpicked up the habit of readingaround the age of 10 or 11 like i couldread well i can pick up pretty much anybook and figure it outum i went straight to the deep end ofthe pool so to speak and started readinga lot of astrophysics umthat i think really made methink about things from a very firstprinciple standpoint like you alwayswant to understand the whythat traces all the way back to thesource of whatever it isum but it's funny what comes on now toois actually if i look backa little further than that umwhen i'm three four five years old mymom wasvery big on education she just umwe had you know certain challengesgrowing up andshe was always making the point thateducation was the key to get through anysituationright um so i remember doingthere were times when we didn't evenhave paper but we would have likepaper grocery bags so we would do mathand paper grocery bags andwe'd do letters on the etch a sketchwhich i don't know ifpeople know what an etch sketch is butit's like a little plastic thingwith knobs yeah with the magnetic thingsyeah so you could draw up things andthen erase itum andso i was fortunate to have that i guessshe really instilled that in me at ayoung agejust the importance of education andself-educationnot just taking things at face value butalwaysasking you know getting beneath thingsto figure out[Music]i guess the truth get to as close totruth as you canand then uh i was also very fortunatethatum this was a guy she worked with at thetimei don't even remember his name to behonest but he was actually teaching mebecause i was very interested in mathspecifically and he was teaching me likei figured out addition and subtractionpretty easilyand then he was actually showing memultiplication and division i couldn'tunderstand it at the time i'mfive years old but i remember it justleft me with this fascination i'm likewhatlike he like he showed me long divisionand i was just like my mind was blownand um i guess planted a seedjust of i don't know what curiosity youwould call itcuriosity fascination in math yeah inmathyeah going through deep down on thewhite thing yes rightand then again when you get intoastrophysics you see thatthese aren't the entire scientific bodyof astrophysics is largely not based onobservationright like we like einstein figured outor hypothesized that black holes existedwell before we observed a black hole wehaven't we stilltechnically haven't observed a blackhole we've observed the gravitationalinfluence it has on the stars around itso we can say oh there it is um there'ssort of this picture of a black holethat was recently released but it's justanyway we can't you can't really see itso the point is you're translatingmathematical concepts into things thatyou can't even observe with your ownsenses but you're proving that theyreally exist in the universe so mathis this incredible tool right it'sit's a fiction in a sense that numberslike what numbers aren't real they'renot anywhere you can touch feel ormanipulate but they're almost hyperreal and that they can be used tocategorize or groupand manipulate our understanding ofthingsanything in the universe right you canyou can use this language of mathematicssoyeah that just took me down that rabbithole i guess i'm not a mathematician ori'm not formally trained in mathematicsso i just have a deep fascination withthem i would sayin their relationship too betweenman and nature the mathematical bridgebetween man and natureum i think i may have veered from theoriginal question a little bit but howtoi guess all of this added to the way ithink and thengetting into my teenage yearsi had no idea what i wanted to dowhen i grew up but i knew i wanted to bea businessmanno idea what that meant i thought you'rejust carrying a briefcase and sendingfaxes and collecting a paychecksomething like thatum you know barely understoodeconomics really didn't know what astock i just didn't know iso i started to kind of point mycuriosity that directioni started reading the the economistmagazine became a veryimportant publication for me i read itreligiously every week it's probablystarting around the agei guess 16 17 18 going into collegeand then in my young adult years roughlyand similar thing i couldn't understanda lot of itbut but this is how we get smarter bythe way like if you can'tif you're reading a book and you thinkit's above your comprehension levelbut you're still interested you'reyou're reading the right book becauseyou're it's likeit's curious about it yeah when you goto the gym like you need to trainto the edge of failure to adapt and growyeah so if you're just reading a bookthat's always in your comfort zone andyou understand it completely you're notgoing to grow from that bookyeah it's true so thatopened my eyes a lot this there are allthese games beingplayed worldwide to try and allocatescarce resourcesconsistent with the the general wants ofhumanity or the configuration of demandso i wasreally thinking about that and theni fell into which they don't talk aboutin the economist magazine at allhow did i discover this i don't recallhow i discovered it but i eventuallystumbled upon the creature from jekyllisland oh yeah which is abook about yeah the inception of thefederal reserveand all the evils of central bankingpretty muchand that was just what you know that wasa whole notherrabbit hole light bulb moment for methat oh my gosh all of thisyou know economics in the world it has ait has a rottencore it's it's not you know wewe we pay homage and testament to thesefree market principlesthat generate wealth and got us intomodernity but in factwe have this rotten monopoly at the coreof the whole systemthat steals from the whole systemand that was a big impact on me i endedupgetting a book it's pretty much anabridged version of the creature fromjekyll islandcalled dishonest money written by josephplummerit's a creature from jekyll island hugebook i don't know 500 600pages this book was like maybe 100 pagesand distilled the the essence of itto a smaller book i purchasedmaybe 10 or 20 copies and gave them tofamily and friends at christmasthis is2005 or six so i'm probably20 years old roughly anda few friends and family actually readthe book and they get back to me andthey're like heyyou know thanks interestingbut what they're gonna do about itand i always reflect back on thatfeeling because it was likei thought i had found the secret tosaving the world and that all i neededto do was go out and tell people aboutitlike i discovered it or something andthen it would just things would bebetter yeah yeahbut then quickly was snuffed out so youcan't even your inner circle is likeokay cool but what can i do about it istill need dollars i still needpaycheck i got bills to pay kids to feedwhateverand i was just like oh like left kind ofhopelessfeeling like oh man i guess the world isjustcorrupt and we don't have a choice soswallowed that bitter pill and moved onwith my lifeum i ended up getting a master's degreein accounting and financeand went on to bepretty much i did some public accountingfor a while then i was a career cfovery focused in tech too i had alwaysbeenentrepreneurial my whole life likelargely online type businesses i used totrade uh it was actually i say i jokethat i was in digital assets beforebitcoinbecause i was trading in-game itemson a game as a multi-massive multiplayeronline game yeah called diablo 2 i usedto trade these assetsin the little economies and i would itgot to the pointbecause you could either play the gameyou could go into the game and you knowfight demons and dragons and whateveractually not dragons just demons andzombiesor you could and you you equip yourcharacter with all these different itemsand give them different powers and youcan duel other charactersor you can step out of that game and gointo the trade networks mm-hmm which arethe markets basically so there were twoone of their trading like just thetrading items itemsyeah swords for rings for armors forshields forcharm like all these different littleyou know it's just infinite complexitywhen youstart combining all these different uhconfigurationsand there were real markets there was acurrency that emerged naturallyit's called the stone of jordan ringthey were called sojsso people would largely denominate theirtrades and sojs likethis shield for 13 sojs you know and youcould take 40 sojs and buy this bowand it was a real market and there weredifferentmarkets too you go into differentchannels to trade different things andum i over timestarted playing this game less theactual gamediablo and started playing the tradinggame moreand was just learning i guess economics101 in the trenchesjust buy low and sell high wait untilsomeone was overpaying for something i'dsell itwait till something was being sold firesold by a cheapand i ended up becoming like wealthy inthe gameyou know so all all my friends thatplayed this tooi ended up being the guy they'd come tolike hey can i have the armor andyou know i was just like whatever and ihad no ideait taught me a couple things one ididn't know i was learningeconomics i just figured it out on theflyand two i learned to type lightning fastbecause it's all it's all doneby type so i'm typing like 90 words aminuteby the end of my years playing this gameandso i guess that planted the seed thatvalue doesn't need to existjust in tangible space you know trueyeahthere's a whole i guess the thesis itook away from thatand as the world increasingly becamemore digitized in my early years andthe emergence of the iphone and thingslike this i developed this thesisthat the world is becoming a video gamesomore and more of our relationships aremediated by screensmore and more of our wants are satisfiedthrough software applicationsum even if you look at like the teslatoday if you've ever been in a tesla carit's likeplaying a video game basically it's agiant screenyou can you know a lot of buttons yeahand ityou know is that quote from umi forgot the name of the guy but anysufficiently advanced technology isindistinguishable from magic arthur cclarkeso it's as if we're likeit i think we're in a renaissance noweven today i would say that the digitalageis a renaissance it's hard to see it upclose we thinkoh this is just cool it's new tech andwe've had especiallyif you're young it's hard to see it buti'm just old enough to see i rememberrotary phones you know when i was veryyoung not many people had them stillbut there were still some placesi remember the dial up internet you knowyou know yeah all thatand i've lived long enough to see itcoming to what it is today and i thinkthis trajectory keeps going that way soi decided that i wanted topoint my career towards the convergenceofcommerce trading economicsand technology andi guess the other piece would be kind ofthe social business pieceyou know i learned just through collegeand high school there's all these sociallayers and enclaves to everythinghuman you know it's we're socialcreaturesso something that combined those threeelements and thenwhen i just you know discovered bitcoinreallyit took me i found bitcoin in 14 but ididn't go down the rabbit holeuntil 16. but ever since then it's likeoh my gosh this is everything i've beeni feel like my whole life has beenleading me up to this point almostlike i knew about digital assets i knewabout central bankingi'd see software's eating the world andbitcoin's like all of that wrapped intooneand it's humanitarian which is the otherthing that'sthat's like the most powerful forcebehind it is that it justit is the answer to that blackmonopolistic core that runs the worldtodaybitcoin actually disruptsand and and remedies that pathologicalhierarchy that runs the world todayso it's almost like it's a gutenberglike i would say i put bitcoin in thebucket withinternet and digital tech more generallythey're gutenberg-like revolutionsthat are disrupting the dominantinstitution in the world where thegutenberg printing press disrupted thechurchwe have the internet bitcoin andequivalenttechnologies you could say encryptiongenerallyis disrupting the nation-state centralbank monopoly on commerceso people you know gutenberg printingpress gave us free speechthe ability to mediate communicationswithout interference now we have a wayto intermediateenergetic flow or value withoutinterference and i think it just unlocksthe next level ofcivilization so i'myeah that's a very long-winded answer toyour question but i guess ihad a number of influences in my lifeandi'll just thank my angelic mom forplanting the seed to always be learningyeah so that's really beautiful thanksand i mean you touch a little bit aboutlike how youread the book uh like the creature ofjekyll island and is this why you end upgoing down thewhat is money rabbit hole yeahhow what is the story like how was yourrelationship with money growing up andthen how youend up in this like rabbit hole tryingto reallyfind yeah umyeah growing up like i mentioned weearly on in life we were really well offmy mother and father were together andthen they separatedand went to the opposite end of thespectrum things were really hardso um just scraping to get bya lot soand then when i started to learn aboutmoney definitely the central bankrabbit hole teaches you quite a bitabout what is moneythe one thing i lacked there though thati didn't discover until bitcoinwas the austrian economics rabbit holescarcely touched on it i think i read alittle bit of rothbardbut i didn't i didn't know about myseason hayek and all of this soi knew enough i guess the the bottom ofmy thinkingin the central banking rabbit hole wasthat gold is money but i didn't getbeneath that enoughlike to understand the monetaryproperties and how it how moneychanges and emerges different times indifferent places based on thesethese properties so umthe thei guess what we come into so i thinkgetting into bitcoingot me into austrian economicsthat which is one piece to bitcoin bythe way bitcoin's a multi-disciplinaryunderstandingyou need to know physics and computerscience and thermodynamics and gametheoryand economics with their scienceyeah this it touches everything rightand i found that i i hadyou know i'm the type of person thati'll sit there and read and put in thehourslike just time i'll just imbibe all theinformation i can to reallyget to the bottom of something andunderstand it but then when i try andtake those learningsand articulate them to someone else it'sa lot like how can you dohow can you compress all of theinformation yeahbecause you know if anyone that's beendown the bitcoin rabbit hole it's likeyou're in there for a few hundred hoursbefore you really get ityou know whatever some people havegotten it more quickly than others ittook me a couple of hundred hoursa flat out speed reading yeah andre-reading to really understandwhat's going on here hard to turn aroundandshoot that into someone's ear in 30minutes you knowand i've i guess just thinking deeplyabout this entire topic i decided thatwell the real trick here is just gettingsomeone to really think about what ismoneylike you just i don't need to tell youanything first of all you're gonna beresistant to whatever i tell youlike we're all skeptical what's hisagenda he probably owns bitcoinand as anyone outside of bitcoin willtell you we sound like a bunch of rabidmaniacstalking about how this thing's eatingthe world and changingyou're not gonna use dollars anymore andpeople are okay bro like take it easyso i thought that maybe a a softerapproach which is more like uh have youseen the movie inceptionit's like incepting the idea yeah thenlet it grow itself yeahlet them if they ask themselves thequestion earnestlyand persistently i don't think youi don't see how that road doesn't leadto bitcoin at some point because if youkeep asking that questionhonestly and you really pursue it you'regoing to find austrian economics you'regoing to find the first principles ofmoneyyou're going to look at bitcoin throughthe lens of first principles compare itto everything else and see that it'sorders of magnitude betterso that to me was likeokay this is and no one had done thatyet no one hadreally laser focused on that question toreally try anduh garner it the attention that itdeserves umso yeah that's what i decided to namethe youtube channel and podcast thatthe aim is going to be to talk to thebrightest minds in the worldabout that topic but but it's not justeconomics and money becausethe deeper you get into money yourealize it touches everything likeit's it's i argue that it's it's anextension of our mindsactually like when when you when we makeeconomic decisionwe're thinking in dollars or thinking inthe local currency it's like languageit's like a software implementationalmostum and when you'vewhich also makes it really hard to thinkabout because you have to beit's meta thinking you're thinking aboutyour own thinkingyou know you have to look at what islooking you have to observe the observerit's it's tricky uh no becauseeverything is automatic like you do itlike automatically yeah exactlybut if you develop that level ofthinking all of a suddenyou're like you're free you can you'remeta you can apply this meta thought tootherother constructs and umso that's it i hope i hopethat people will take it seriously youknow like i'veby the way i'm already learning a lotfrom it i've only had one guest i hadsailorthe holy cow i mean the the connectionbetween money and energyand money being meta energy the highestform of energy humanbeings can channel across space and timeand the entire purpose ofhuman life the reason we're dominant inthe world is because we channel energyacross space and time more intelligentlyand with more purpose than any otheranimali mean my mind still i've watched themthree times editing them and doing themmy mind is still blown justguess one and i know how many answersthere are to that question what is moneyand how many sides of life it touches soi'm really excitedit's for me like a passion project tojust satisfy my own intellectualcuriositybut then i think it's also somethingworthwhile to share with the worldand that again back to thegutenberg-like revolution another thingthat happenedwhen the gutenberg revolution took placethere were 10 million books produced inthe decade that it was inventedprior to that decade there were 10million books approximately producedin 500 years prior so the amount ofbooks explodedthe cost of information access implodedthe result of that was people had moreaccess to informationthere were more thinkers there was amore variety of thinking there washigher quality thoughtuh more heretical thought at the timebecause they were questioning the churchright more critical thinkingand on average populations became moreintelligentso i think the digital renaissanceat least one aspect of it is that we'vecollapsed againthe cost of information access and we'regoing to see a commensurate boomin general intelligence andthat's what i intend to be at theforefront ofi want people that thatbecome swept up in this renaissance viabitcoin or whatever other meansum i want them to look to you know myshow and my guestis a real valuable resourceto that end umyeah i hope i could just get peopleasking the question what is moneybecause i think that acceleratesbitcoin so that's true like thatthat's question what is money is likethe center of likeyou know at least bitcoin and then likehow we seehow we see everything in this worldright now you know likewhy stuff is not happening as it shouldbestuff like that yeah so maybe we can goto your bitcoin story soi mean how like when did you first hearabout bitcoinhow you get yours your hand into bitcoinand i mean did you just buy it you tradeit or likehow was it how was the story how was thejourney until you're like oh yeahthis is it yeah you know the funny thingabout it is iti don't know that i can pinpoint theexact first moment that i heard about iti feel like i heard about it a couple oftimes beforei was really like okay i'm gonna gocheck this thing out the one time that irememberi was in i was living in las vegas atthe timethis is probably 201413 14 i guess and i wasvisiting one of my friends at his officeand his it guythey were talking about it i don't likemaybemaybe this was right when bitcoin didits big run up to 11 50 and late 13.maybe this was during or immediatelyafter that possibly around that timeframeand they were just like oh whatever andthen i t guys like ah it's [ __ ] ijustbut that that was like oh i'm gonna gosee what like there'scomputer money now i don't know what'sgoing onthat's the first time i remember hearingabout it but i felt like i'd heard aboutit likeit seems to me like it was one of thosethings where you don't really thinkabout something till you hear it likethe third or fourth time yeah i feellike that was the third or fourth timethat's the only one i can reallyexplicitly recalland then bought i think i read justarticles about it but nothing meaningfulyou know maybe likeeven the economist you know again thismagazine that i like was disparaging itand i guess all that influenced me alittle bit buti decided i'd buy a little to speculateand thenit went up in price and i sold a littlebit and then i kind of stopped thinkingabout itpretty much thought i was a genius madesome money it was doneuh but then in 2016it was actually ethereumso they were running you know which is aan alternative crypto asset but they hada prettymajor marketing campaign i guess thatthey're trying to be this smart contractplatform of the futureand it's super slick imagery like it'svery cool marketing you're like allright what's like what is thisand i zeroed in on smart contracts andstarted studying those deeply that gaveme like something to grab ontowhereas bitcoin is just trickier becausei guess i was just reading the wrongsources but smart contracts wassomething very specificit's not like there are economistarticles saying oh smart contracts willnever work it's likeit was unheard of basically in thegeneral so when you research smartcontracts you're automatically a littlebit deepyeah and when i got to nick zabo's workand nixabo had written a piece on smartcontracts in the 90s maybe early or late90si was like the finance industry is asmart contractlike i was like holy cow this is thethingwe where you have human enabled smartcontractthat's this intermediary business modelthat we call the financeindustry today is truthfully justmatching buyers and sellersthat entire function should be eaten bysoftwarebecause it's dry code right yeah i wouldsay all of it butthe vast majority of it you're justmatching capital on ideas buyers andsellers et cetera et cetera and taking ascamyeah but that scheme should be able tobe collapsedif it's facilitated by software insteadof people right you do it much morecheaply just likealso reduce the number of resources andyesyeah just orders of magnitude moreefficientlyto do commerce via a computer then callin your broker that calls his brokerthat calls the guy to call the guy youknowand that's by the way that's how bondsare still sold today all rightgovernment bonds are still sold likethisso umthat was my boom my light bulb momentwas like this wave of innovationsmart contracts which are only possiblewithcrypto assets are the thingi need to buy a bunch of this and figureit outso i started investing heavily andstarted out diversified so i was oncoinbase i'm like bitcoinethereum litecoin i think with the threethat they offered at the time so boughta bunch of thatand then kept studying kept studyingkept studyingand then really started to go down thebitcoin rabbit holeright started to find uh again more ofzabouh there was a podcast with zabo andduvall on tim ferriss that was reallygood i think a lot of people havelistened tobut they were still not bitcoin focusthey're kind of likelike more cryptocurrency you knowbut then you get into the pierre richardand the vj and the safedeen and thenactuallyreading safety's book so i'm going downthat whole rabbit holebecoming more and more focused onbitcoin like oh wow bitcoin is the thinghere these other things are good intheory perhaps but bitcoin could disruptgold gold is thebase layer of geopolitical sovereigntyin the worldso there's a reason central banks holdall the gold so they can make all therulesand now bitcoin is this digitaldisrupter that's pulling the rug outfrom under them like that is the wholegameyeah by the way and that it's easy tosay oh it's digital goldor it's disrupting gold people like welli don't use gold anywayso why should i care about that but youhave to get this broader perspectivethatgold is the game being played todayyeah the armies in the world are fundedby the gold holdings of the governmentsthat control goldwhen governments go to war with oneanother ifone conquers another the first placethey go is to their central bankto steal all of their gold uh it stillis the dominant money in the worldfrankly like we the peons are forced totransact in theseuncollateralized government debtcertificates we call fiat currencywith the government but the money isgold goldis money basically still today and evenif you're a law abiding citizen and youdon't know anything about thisand you don't own gold and you don't ownbitcoin and you're just walking acrossthe streetto go to your cubicle office job thelaws you're abiding by the privateproperty rightscontract law the courts the police thelegal systemall the sovereignty of all thisauthority isrooted in the gold holdings of thecentral bank so it'severy all of our socio-economic systemsare a derivativeof gold even though we don't understandit doesn't matter if you understand itor not you're lit you're playing thatgameyeah you're living in this game you'repart of someone else's storyeven andthrough that lens is why bitcoin's sucha big dealbecause bitcoin is the first competingsovereignty system in the history of theworld some like a new game to playand it's it's superior like the thereasons gold was selected on the freemarket bitcoinis exponentially better in every way ialways hit on the five properties ofmoneyi guess i should see them divisibilitydurability recognizability portabilityscarcity that's why gold was selectedbitcoin has perfected all those monetaryproperties essentiallyand it just the futurelooks as though it will be constructedin an entirely new way as a resultyou could think about this as it's againhumanity uh gold is like thebase level operating system so like thelinux i guessof civilization and now we have thissuper linux essentially that's beenerected andthe higher layers that are built uparound it are completely differentas a result umso i became much more narrowly focusedon bitcoin andit just gave me an impetus to startwritingyou know i've been reading my whole lifei'd written a little bit here and therebut nothing specific butum we had started a business whereso this whole time i'm running a fund aswell so myportfolio construction isbecoming more reflective of my thesisover timeso initially we're diversified becomemore and more focused on bitcoinand then this is during the bitcoin bearmarketso i'm playing psychologists with a lotof my investors like it's okayhere's what bitcoin is and that was kindof the impetus to really start writingit's like okay i really i need tosharpen my own conviction and make surei really know what i'm talking abouthere i have like money's on the lineother people's money's online i have toreally drink dig into this that must bereally tough yeah during the bear marketoh manbrutal and that's actually i got thistattoo at the bottom of the bear marketsnovember 2018 is my only tattooi was 33 i guess when i got itand it was that process it was likestudying bitcoin so deeplywriting about it talking about it hadthismoment where i'm like i'm going tocommit my life to this thing essentiallyand soreading a lot of clubs books at the timelike skin in the game and antifragile soi decided all right i'm going to haveskin in the game for real[Laughter]um soyeah i may be veered from the originalquestion again butthat was my path into bitcoin and now iconsider it to be my life's work yeahyou know i'mthe other joke i like to make is we allend up on bitcoin's payroll eventuallyso i guess i just decided to jump inearlier than the rest of the worldthat's that's really smart yeah i mean imade a tweet the other day likeyou know i go to work to collect setsand then once we got paid by sets wedon't have to go to worklike that yeah it's a great way to lookat it yeahand um so you also like you knowlike i read a lot of your articles and ireally loveuh you know how you put everything sowhere do you get that inspiration fromlike i mean like you youread a lot of books you read you hear alot of podcasts probably but likewhere do you get that inspiration fromwriting those thingshmm or just like always in your mind andjust likei don't really know i think wethere's definitely a domain beyondknowledgebeyond space and time even thatwe're connected to and that's whereuh you know things like spiritualitycome into play but it's notjust you know um spirituality there'salsoif you study austrian economics eventhis study of praxeology which ishow people treat objects as means andendsto accelerate themselves towards theachievement of goalsgoals being largely targeted at thereduction of uneasinessor alleviation of anxiety there's asubjective side of existencebut value or value is whatever we wantto help us acceleratetowards our goal and all of our goalsand valuations are inherently subjectiveso there's somethingum i can't just point to like theobjectivesource of inspiration there's this othersubjective domain thatand they blend together reallyinterestinglyi'll say that i think when we readwe're tapping into if you want to usethe wordspirit of these other thinkers whothemselves were tappedinto the spirits of other thinkers thatcame before themuh another way to say this more in amore secular fashion is thatwe're all just filters of informationyou know they've been passing and fromnot just thinking and verbally but yourgenes by the wayancestor well your genes are immortalinformational organismsand your current body is just a vehiclefor themyeah like they're going to be passed onto your kids they don't really changeformyeah the vehicle changes form but thegenes do not very littleso we are these uh echo chambers ofinformation in a wayand um so i think a lot of it comes fromthat that you're channelingthe spirit or the information of thosethat have come before you we're standingon theproverbial shoulders of giants rightum and theni think there's something too like i gotinto yoga and meditationwhen in my early 20s andlike meditation is something else idon't have i'm stillwrestling with my life all the time toget a regular practice all the time ithink it's really hardto maintain and i want to do betterabout prioritizing itbut i've had good runs in life wherei've like meditated daily fora good chunk of time you know severalmonths maybe evenat least regularly for years at a timeand i also practice yoga a lot veryregularly which is kind of a movingmeditationthat gets you tapped into something elsesoi don't know i don't know where it comesfrom but it'salways there yeah if you want to openyour mind and seethe seer you know again getting meta getoutside yourself and be able to lookdown on things from a differentperspectiveexercise meditation breath work yeah ifunny enough because like two weeks agoi attended thistantric event in ubudand then like you know we are talkingabout a lot about energy like masculineand feminineenergy and how masculine is all aboutyou knowlogic and math and you knowaction whereas like feminine energy isaboutexpanding yeah writing the chaosand um and yeahit's like a more like decentralized kindof work because like howwomen always see like you know indifferent side and then throughout thisevent which is likeit's like a tantric event but i'm justlike in my head i get download ofbitcoin and how likeoh my god like bitcoin is like havingnotnot only just like masculine energy butalso feminine energy how like it canwrite throughout chaosand how like all of these dieties that'sbeen represented infemale energy is actuallyuh being manifested in bitcoin which isreally cool so i think like you knoweven during the meditation you can alsoget that downloadmonies and bitcoin yeah that's the rightway to put it as a downloadfrom whatever yeah umbut no that's a great point i in bitcoininfinitely interesting because it isthis union of opposites in a lot of wayswhere you're talking aboutmasculine and feminine energy or orderand chaosyeah you know uhwhich capitalism and socialism by theway like capitalismi would say is much more masculinelogical socialism is like well can'teveryone justyou know get along and we'll give andsocialism is great at a local level likeyour family you're very socialist withyour family you'll just give themwhatever you want but it doesn't scaleright yeah so we need capitalism at thehighest levels butsocialism at the lowest levels and thenbitcoin is like thispublic utility right it's available toeveryoneyeah but it facilitates trade flows ofprivate propertyyeah and privacy and privacy and so it'slike bridged the gap betweencapitalism and communism which was theideological struggle of the 20th centurythe mining algorithm itself isdeeply immersed in entropy and chaosright it'sthe the numbers are quite literallytrying to find a single atom in theentire universeis when the miners are casting votesthey're casting these hashes as votesthey're trying to find the real needlein a haystack the needle in the cosmichaystackand from that resolution of chaoscomes the most indisputable order theworld's ever hadyou cannot argue with a bitcoinblockchain it's the only sourceof truth in the world so all thesethings are just likethat's that's the pathway into therabbit hole[Laughter]all right so uhso how like you know what do you thinkyour biggest lessonabout money and bitcoin and how bitcoinhas changed your lifeyeah umi think my it's funnyas a kid growing up i had a lot ofinsecuritiesactually um i wasjust made fun of for different reasonsso i had like insecurities about myselfand i thinki over compensated in a wayjust by trying to be at the best i couldbein all these different ways and then ialmost maybe swung the pendulum too farin the other directionum because i had a lot of successearlier in my career and i just thoughtyou know it's like we take feedback fromthe market so youtry something and then you succeedyou're like oh okay i figured that outlet me try something else and yousucceed like oh i figured that out tooand at some point you become you losehumility a little bit i thinkmy biggest failing in life thus far hasbeen thisi think i was arrogant for a while ijust everything that i tried i wasdoing well not nothing was perfect i hada lot of challenges along the way butmore or less everything came out netpositiveand um[Music]bitcoin and i think this does it toeveryone bitcoin humbledhumbled me a lot when itrying to develop a trading strategy tooutperform bitcoinand having some success but then gettingcrushed in the other direction yeah so ilearned a lot aboutthe use of leverage umthe the in a radical truththat markets are inherently unknowableso your model may work for six months 12months 18 monthsbut then then that's reinforcing yourconfidence in the modelbut if you put your money in theconfidence in that model the model isgoing to break down at some pointso it can you can havea streak of wins a mile long yeahbut if your last decision is wrong youcan wipe it all outyeah so i just think that bitcoin hastaught me humilityat a very deep level um and i i now prayfor it every daybecause since then like since learninghard lessons things have been going wellagainthings are going but i'm always likethank you for what's happening that'sgood but please let me stay groundedand ritualized in the world and knowthatthis can all none of this is promisedyou knowcan go the other direction just aseasily so yeah yeahthat's very i think that's like uh sumuplike all the all the experience ofpeople thatyou know trading bitcoin people thingsthat oh yeahi know i know this thing yeah oh yeahyou don't know and i talked to peoplenow that that aresometimes in a similar boat to where iwas a few years ago and they're like alli've tasted are winsyou know like i've been betting onbitcoin i'll buy it it goes up andthey're doing other trades like they'rebuying call options on tesla or whateverand making moneyand they're like maybe you think ishould like leverage up and just doubledown on this option strategy orleverage up and buy more bitcoin and i'mlike look here's the dealcan amplify your gains but it can alsolead to ruinous losses so you just havetoyou got to be humble and it'sit sounds maybe cliche to some peoplelike oh yeah everyone says that yougotta say it was likeno you need to stay humble or you'regonna gethurt so yeahyeah i love that and umyeah oh and in your podcast you alsomentionedfrequently about sovereign individualand i saw there's thatbook there so which come first to youbitcoin or sovereign individualwell i thinki had that libertarian seed planted withthe central banking rabbit holeyou know just uh came to see it as asystem for controlling peopleand i've always had a healthy disregardfor authority umi've labeled myself freedom maximalisti think in uhmore classic times we would just say youknow free market capitalist orlibertarian before the word was allthese words have been bastardizedin in modern age so i think freedommaximalist captures itpretty inarguably it's like no you justwant more freedom not just for yourselfbut for everyoneum sof liberalismfreedom maximalism came first for meuh but through bitcoin i actuallydiscovered that book the sovereignindividualwhich is i recommend it on i think everymedia show that i do one of the mostimportant books you can ever readnot an especially enjoyable read i'm notrecommending it because it's the heightof literaryum creativity you know it's kind ofdense andit's like reads like a textbooksometimes butfor me it's the best map i havediscoveredof the world we're moving into the thistransition from the industrial age tothe digital age what they call theinformation ageuh i think digital sounds better so i gowith digitaluh but ityeah the thesis of the book like thethe maxim that's credited to andreessenhorowitz that software is eating theworld that includes governmentsoftware is going to eat government aswell umand book was in 97 they predicted theemergence of bitcoin essentially theycalled it anonymous cyber cashand they said that once thisbreakthrough occurredthat when people had an option to storecapitalin encrypted money that everyone woulddo sobecause you could you could basicallyunilaterally escapeinflation taxation capital controlsand you can put it in a money that can'tbe stolencan be inflated can't be taxed so itbecame it becomes thisentirely new domain that people theeconomic incentives will force peoplethere as governments become moreoverreaching as we're seeing in theworld todaypeople will be forced to defend andshelter their capital by any meansnecessaryand there is no more unassailableterritorythan digital like if you put your wealthin bitcoin and you've custodied itproperlyyou're good you can do anything you cango anywhere in the world do anything youwantthat has the second order effect ofcollapsing the revenue modelof the nation state which is solelybased on taxationand inflation so the bookexplores what happens nextwhen government revenues gradually thensuddenly go to zerowhat how does the world organize itselfuhand it's we have no historic parallel wehave a coupleagain like i referred to the gutenbergthing earlier therelike we saw the collapse of the ussrwhen they kind of bankrupted we saw whathappened there so there's there are somecase studies that we can apply to thisthat the book does a great jobbut we have no idea right we have noideaand i'm actually writing an essay serieson the book right now thatit'll be a 12-part series that goesi think there's 11 chapters in the bookso i have one extrapretty much each part in the seriescovers a chapter in the book but i haveone extrafocus on bitcoin specifically and umyeah i hope to hope to unpack some ofthose ideas andagain the book's not the most fun thingto read so i'm trying to put my ownvoice to it and add some of my owncommentary andperspectives on it and hopefully make ita little morestylish you know orpalatable for readers i guess butum yeah really excited about thatso this is the book that you are goingto write well this is just an essayseries this is an essay so i'm justgoing to be publishing itactually sorry i'll publish uh part onemonday i think and thenyou know 12 parts so i'll release themthroughout the rest of the yearum it may be you know some of that maybe a component of my book as well butit's notintended for that right now so tell metell us more aboutthe book that you're in the book torelease what what is itwhat's uh are you going to cover thereyeahwell say a couple things about the bookthe tentative title istime money soulum i've got a like a patreon group setup for it i think i'vegot a f i don't know 150 paidmembers right now uh we have like aprivate telegram chat so we're alwaystalking they help editmy like this blog series helping me editit umso i'm trying to i don't want it to justbefrom my head you know i'm actuallytrying to participate with the market sowhen i put these things outfor draft i get great feedback peoplelike this doesn't make sense or have youthought about this orwhat about these ideas and start toincorporate all this feedbackum but thatbook so here's the premisehere's the other thing it's prettyambitiousso i don't know if i'm gonna get it allinto this firstbook that i'd like to publish by the endof the year i've got a ton of notesright nowthat are kind of messy and disorganizedand i've got a frameworkfor the book like basically a table ofcontents and i'm trying to synthesizethe twoi don't know that i'm going to get allof those ideasinto the first book and i don't know ifthe first book will be by that title ithink this time money soul might be mybigger book that takes a little bitlonger to writethe book's coming out towards the end ofthe year so whatever it may have thattitle may not i haven't figured that outyeti'll give you the general arc that iwant to try and coveri hope in this book but maybe inmultiple sothe universe is made of space and timespace and time started with a big bangrightso i'll kind of run through that firstprinciples astrophysics how did we gettotoday umlife emerges the mainimpulse of life is theterritorial imperativei think my hypothesis and that means itwants to expandits dominion over space and time so notonly does it want to take as muchphysical territory as possible but italso wants to expand its dominion overtime which means it wants to have asmuch offspring as possibleso life is like trying to grow intospace and time as much as possibleharness energy to spread itself throughspace and timethat territorial imperative inman is expressed in property rightsproperty rights are our claim onspace and time and energy right energywhich helps usgain more territory the most importantprivate property right in any economy ismoneyso this i'm trying to draw thisconnection between astrophysicsto biological reality to economicrealityso uh hopefully really rooting money inthe first principle right yeah anduh thenthrough that lens explain centralbankingwhy is it structured the way it is iwould argue that it isthe territorial imperative of a fewtrying to benefit at the expense of theterritorial imperative of the manyright they want essentially a vehiclefor perpetually siphoningvalue from the productive economyuh we'll also which we'll get into whygoldwas really why gold was chosen as moneythe why central banking corrupted ithow bitcoin is better and disrupts thecentral bank by disrupting goldand then hopefully get intouh the other piece of that is like gametheory right so game theory is abiologicalthing it's not just human we game theoryis exhibited by a number of creatures sowe'll explainmoney and trade through game theory andthenpost bitcoin what does the world looklikeyou know just some ideas like glimmersof what what does it look like if weyeah what is it what do you think afterlikecost of living the main thing is cost ofliving would just collapsebecause an unhampered market economywe've generated this much wealth with anextremely hampered market economyan increasingly hampered market economyactuallyhow much wealth could we generate andhow much innovation and breakthroughscould we achieveif we stripped out all these barriers tofree tradeand free trade is the generative sourceof all of our good ideasall of the modern luxuries we enjoyevery day we take for grantedyou know umit propels us into a new level of ofwealth and civilization frankly and whoknows like whatwhat kind of breakthroughs lie on theother side of that with no freaking ideaum but you could maybe just game it outa little bit it's like what thissort of like to sovereign individualdoes like what does society look likepost nation statepost scarcity when i say scarcity i meanlikepeople working to survive when youinstead just work a few hours a weekyeah survivability to meet your basicneedsyou know instead of working 40 hours aweekto eat and have shelter maybe you'reworkingfour hours a week to eat and haveshelter what do you do with the other 36hoursi think human human creativityartistry ingenuity all these thingsstart to flourishyou know culture flourishes umso yeah that kind of gets into the soulif it is time money soul that'd be kindof the soul aspect of the bookum but justgetting out of our own way by fixing themoneyso yeah wow like looking forwardto to read that well it's so freakingambitiousi don't know i don't even know if i canwrite it but i'm going to do my bestwell obviously from like sharing and notyour knowledge we allgot you know the taste of it yeahyeah okay i hope the main dish is worthworth it so maybe the last question islikewhat maybe like what kind of adviceor things that you can tell to peoplewho just startyou know getting into the rabbit holebitcoin or likeuh holding their bitcoin especiallyright now we are in thethird halving so like yeah maybe you cangiveyeah yeah uh i think it's actuallyrelatively straightforward andover complexifying it is what will getyou into troubleso i think what i'm gonna lay out heresoundstoo simple maybe and we have thisbias towards action or towards doingmore than is necessary in a wayand that's why you know holding orhuddling is so hard actually on a lot ofpeople becausewhat do you mean you just buy and hold iwant to treat it i want to buy low andso high it's like okayyou're free to try that but 99.9of humans fail miserably doing that youmight be the point one maybe it's onepercentit might be the one percent that tradesuccessfully most do notyeah so you can walk that path if youwantbut the first rule is justeducating yourself just study i meanread the work of all these great writersthere's so much good contentin the bitcoin space now and you can getvery high signal to noise ratio if youfollow the right peoplewhich this is why i think twitter issuch a great toolum you if youzero in on bitcoin justthis is where a lot of people get lostbecause bitcoin sounds great but thenyou immediately get distracted by [ __ ]coins yeah but if you could justtake this one piece of advice like justfocus on bitcoin at firstokay if you just trust me on that oneuntil you get your feet wetthen if you decide you still want tolearn about [ __ ] coins which i don'tthink you willonce you really get bitcoin uh then youcould do that but justnarrow your focus to bitcoin initiallylearn about it focus on learning aboutit umspecifically on authors that arereferencing the austrian economicdimensions of moneyand i'm not this i guess a littlebackground on austrian econ is necessaryi'm not some crazy guy that's attachedtodogmatically to austrian economics whatwe have in the world iskeynesian economics austrian economicsaustrian economics is the collective sumtotal of all the world's knowledge abouteconomics acrossall time basically just compressed intothe austrian school so all the greatestthinkersancient wisdom compressed all the way upto modern knowledgeis austrian economics keynesianeconomicsis 200 year old banker propagandabasically that justifies the printing ofmoneyso they say that we need to print moremoney to make people want more stuffyeah and i think if you just look at itintuitively for one second like wait aminute people always want stuffeveryone wants to more material youdon't need to print money to make me gobuy stufflike i'm always going to want the stuffit's a matter of allocating scarceresources to create the stuffso really focus on bitcoinpreferably through an austrian economicslenslearn learn learn um when you decideto buy bitcoin because you will if youactually do thatum i don't know anyone that's studied itdeeply anddoesn't buy bitcoin which also diffusesthe other argument wherepeople will argue on twitter like wellyou're just saying that because you ownbitcoin it's likehow can you understand bitcoin and notown bitcoin it's notpossible yes of course i own bitcoindo you so whatever that's a bit of acircular thingum when you decide to buy bitcoini lay out a very simple strategy forpeople i think they should follow it'sjustlook at your portfolio say it's amillion dollar portfoliosay you've decided you want 20allocation to bitcoin in totalum i would advocatemarket buying in an initial positionwhich would be maybe ten percentso maybe do a hundred thousand dollarmarket buy a bitcoinand then average in the last hundredthousandover time so your dollar cost averagingin and then that gives you becausebitcoin's so volatile you don'tno one knows what it's going to do inthe short runyou can opportunistically buy dips sothis will let youincrease your portfolio allocation whiledecreasing your cost basisso you get a little bit of opportunismcoupled with some immediate exposureand then as far as the timing of that uhlike do youmarket by 15 or 5 percentand this gets a little more nuanced butjust look at the having cycle like rightnowwe are 12minus we're eight months post-halvingnew bitcoin all-time highs are typically12 to 18 months post havingso if i was going to be taking exposuretodayand for all all indications are that theprice still maps onto the having cyclepretty closelyi would be market buying a largerpercentage of that 20and averaging in a smaller percentageversus if we just had a blow off top andi'm buying there i'd be market buying amuch smaller positionand averaging in over an expected bearmarketthat all that said that's veryloosey-goosey because you're assuming alot of things butbelow that is the more general strategyis justcontinuously accumulate bitcoin it isyour savings accountthat is the only money in history thatcannot be inflatedor stolen umand accumulate as much as possibleforever and never sell i mean you couldby all means if you find something thatyoudecide is more valuable for you yourdream home or wedding or whatever thething isby all means sell your bitcoin and goget it butuntil you find that thing or you find oruntil bitcoin has grown so muchthat there's just less upside to it umi think it's the best asset you can ownin the worldfor storing value across even a hundredyearsum and i think by interacting withbitcoin tooyou'll when you own money thatappreciates you every yearyou're dis-incentivized from buyingstuff you're like well why buy the tvthis yearif it's going to be 25 cheaper for menext year so it lowers your timepreference lowers your consumptionhabitsand then finally self-custody do notleave bitcoin on an exchange or with acounterparty because it's the onlydigital bearer money there is so if youleave itwith a counterparty and the counterpartydefaults then you're wiped out on yourbitcoinso take custody for bitcoin learn how todo thatyeah uh multi-signature is bestit's a little bit more complicated youcan pay for services to havehelp you set it up but that gives youtheself-sovereignty to control your moneybut also gives you redundancy so if youlose one keyyou haven't lost them all right so youcan sit because there's nobitcoin headquarters to call and getyour key backthere's no reversing a transaction it'swith great power comes greatresponsibility so a lot of learninguh following a pretty simpleaccumulation strategy and then holdingit yourselfyeah that's wrapup the you know this really nicediscussionand then going through your stories andyour you know your background and thenall the bitcoin uh yeahstuff also so thank you so muchuh robert for the time uh for us to dothis podcastand uh your podcast is the series iswhat is moneyalso like what is money show what ismoney showand spotify and also in youtube soplease check that outand thank you so much for the time thankyou so much",
