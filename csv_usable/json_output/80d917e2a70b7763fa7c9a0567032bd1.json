tutorial on the device andfinally if you're backing up anyimportant bitcoin wallet you're going towant to get it not just on paper that'skind of flimsy not great when it comesto fire damage or water damage you'regoing to want to get in solid steel andthe way i'm backing up my importantbitcoin wallets is with the bill foddleover at privacy pros dot io again itgets them in solid steel i'm not worriedabout things like fire or water and i'mdefinitely not going to accidentallythrow out a big piece of steel sittingaround so uh be sure to check them outagain links are down below and with thatlet's dive into the videoso as i was saying in the introellenbits is basically this dashboardthat is chock full of differentapplications that you can use in concertwith the lightning network now if youwant to just test it out you can ofcourse just go on the web and do it in acustodial fashion where you don't havefull control over your funds or you cando it via your own lightning node nowlet's talk a little bit aboutprerequisites ofwhat we're going to be using herewhat may be of interest some knowledgethat you may want to have beforehand nowup first um would be knowledge aroundhow to use a lightning wallet and thiscould really beanything i've got a few recommendationsof ones that i've found workin particular well with with ln bits umi've got up here i've got zebedee i'vegot uh blue wallet breezewallet of satoshi and just to showwith my own node zeus um that'sconnected to my own lightning node so iwould say if you don't have your ownlightning node currently set up thenperhaps you want to uh maybe check outbreeze um or wallet of satoshi both ofthose work uh pretty well keep in mindbreeze is non-custodial wallet ofsatoshi is custodialbut either those will work just fine andi've got tutorials for those as well youcan just search them up on my channelnow in terms of if you're going theroute of running your own node i haveplenty of videos in and around thisnow i will say and we'll get into thisin a moment but umi'm going to be doing this demo with a ahosted node through voltage and i'vejust found thatit tends tobe a lot less onerousandsetting it up in that if you're runningyour own lightning node at home on yourown dedicated device it works fine overtor and everything but if you want justa regular clear net addressand shareable links and stuff like thatit's going to be a bit of a pain doingsome network configuration which ismaybe kind of above and beyond my paygrade i'm not sure uh but nonetheless umi have tons of videos in and aroundrunning your own lightning node but onesthat will be particularly useful forthis even if you go the voltage routewould be uh i've got a couple shortvideos one on how to open a lightningchannel another on how to get inboundlightning channels so you can receivepayments and uhand then i've got my long form one onhow to run a bitcoin lightning nodeand this would apply even if you arespinning up your own voltage nodebecause you still need channels okayi'll show you really quick hereln bits you can access it via the webhere at legend.lnbits.comand this will allow you to just test itout in a custodial fashion just kind ofdink around with some of theapplications on ithowever again i find that sometimes yourun into liquidity issues or certainwallets won't work with this and theytend to work better with the voltagesetup so just keep that in mind all thisstuff will be linked down below um butthat pretty much does it forprerequisites and let's dive intogetting you set up on voltage and thenstarting to use ln bitsso this isvoltage.cloud and they're basically aservice that allow you to set up and runhostedlightning infrastructure without givingaway uh the keys to your money yourprivate keys and the keys to yourlightning node in this instance sobasically they will run and host theinfrastructure for youum but they don't have access to any ofthe funds they're in because it'sencrypted with your passwords and andall of that okay i've done some videoson voltage before both for btc paceserver and for their flow product whichhas to do with opening channels to youso you can check those out if you seefit just search for voltage on mychannelbutif you're logged in your dashboard isgoing to look something like this sofirst up you're going to want tofundyou're going to want to fund your nodeso you want to make sure that there'ssome fun sitting here so you just go tobillingandunder billing you're gonna see an optionto add node credit you pick an amountyou hit fill up and you'll have theoption to pay uh via bitcoin vialightning or uh with credit card if youso choose i've already done that i'vealready got node credit going everythingis all good therenow back on the main voltage page you'regoing to want to go to nodesand at this point you can see i alreadyhave a couple nodes runningi have an lnd node which is the onewhich we're going to be using today ialso have a btc pay server node notrelevant for this video but if you'recurious go back and check out that videothat i've created but if you don't haveany nodes running but pretty much youhit create new you choose a lightningnodeyou can choose your type of lightningnode herei detail more about this in my btcvideo butbasically you can have like a lightninga light node uh or a standard node areprobably the two options that you wantto go with umand that would be backed by a standardnode is backed by a full bitcoin nodewhich is a bit morehosting on their end so it's a bit moreexpensive but if you just want somethingsimple light should do just fine you hitcreate and you'll just be billed uh bythe hour i believe yeah 0.171.7 cents per hour for it to be runningso really really inexpensiveanyways you get that up and you shouldbe set umyou head back to your node page andunder lnd you just hit viewso within your node here you're going towant to get set up with channels andthis is where if you're unfamiliar withsetting up channels i'm not going to godeep into this topic in this video hitthe one down below with how you can getsome inbound channels to yourself andoutband channelsthat would be here but where you'regoing to navigate to in order toestablish that with your node here isyou're going to go over to dashboards onthe leftand then where it says thunderhub you'regoing to hit create dashboard and thiswill give you access to thunderhub whichis a mechanism through which you canopen channelstoother lightning nodes and establishlines of liquidity to be able to sendand receive payments so you're going tohit create dashboard and then once youhave that dashboard created you'll see abutton like this that says launchdashboard under the thunderhub part andthen you can go through your uh yourcreation of your channelsnow what you're going to want to do oncethat's all done is then you're going tobe able to accessln bits and you can see ellen bits isright below thunderhub exact same thingthere's going to be a create dashboardbuttonandimportant to note thunderhubthat one will persist for about 60minutes of inactivity before it justshuts down and you create a newdashboard but ln bits will persist untilit's deleted okay so i've previouslycreated a dashboard and i wanted to dothat because i wanted to add and enablea bunch of apps that i was going to beusing todaynonetheless you're going to hit createdashboard under lnbits and once itpopulates you're going to hit launchdashboard okay and when you get toln bitsit's going to look something like thisnow not exactly because i've been usingthis one but more or less you will havea paste request create invoice or scanbutton you can have all these things onthe side api info export to phone renamewallet delete walleteventually you'll have transactionsbelow but initially this will be emptyyou will see nothing under extensionsyetother than manage extensionsand you will have named your wallet youcan add as many wallets as you choose umand then you will have a zero balanceheresonow that's established let's exploreand check out what lnbits has to offerso one of the first things you're goingto want to do here in ln bits is testout the wallet functionality itselfreceiving a payment and sending apayment so the way to do that is just inthis main block here you have options topaste a request create an invoice orscansoyou're going to want to first create aninvoice to get some bitcoin some satsinto your wallet so you hit createinvoice you're going to choose your unitso either sats or if you want to say adda dollar or whatever your local currencyis uh you can change that thereso i'm going to requesta thousand satsand then i willsend it fromwe'll do it from wallet of satoshi soi'll just add that as a memo for myselfcreate the invoice and this creates a qrcode which is scannable or you can tapcopy invoice and send it off however youlike as text all rightnowover on my phone and i'll justtransition to make it a bit larger herehere's wallet of satoshi really simplei'm gonna hit send which will open up mycamera so i can scan on the screeni can see here a thousand sats isrequested i'm going to go ahead and hitpayand i'll transition sowe can see both wall there we go whilethe satoshi shows it ascent and we cansee our ln bits wallet updates with thattransaction down belowperfect now let's try something a littlebit different let's try sending out soagain i'll open up another wallet on myphone this time i'm going to use breezeas an exampleso this is breeze wallet a non-custodiallightning wallet and so i'm going to hitreceive i'm going to receive via invoicei'm going to request we'll just do ahundred sats for this onei'm not going to add a description forthis one right now i'm going to hitcreate this will createagain an invoice that can be scanned ori can hit the copy button send it overand paste itsoback onln bits i have the option again eitherto paste if i had this invoice frombreeze as text or i can hit scan so ican open up my webcam and scan the qrcode which i'm going to do right nowperfect so now we can see a hundred satsare requestedand then if i approve that i'm justgoing to hit payperfect we can now see brees hasreceived the payment and again theoutgoing transaction is added into ourfeed down belowperfect we've now successfully testedout the wallet we have some funds in ouraccountand this is of course linked to ourvoltage node unless you're testing thisout on the web and now we can startplaying around with some applications inln bitsone very important note here is whetheryou're using the web version or you'reusing one through voltage with your ownnode it is important to bookmarkyour ln bits wallet in your uhin your browser because if you fail todo that and something happens where youcan't get linked back to it you may losefunds soas soon as you set this up right awayplease bookmark it don't navigate awayfrom it until you doyou've been warnedyou can lose funds if you don't keepthat bookmarked sodo it nowso within ln bits of course you cancreate as many wallets as you like andthen there's these things calledextensions over on the left hand sidenow these will only be populated if youenable the extensions themselves andthis is done through the manageextensionsselection over herewhen you hit manage extensions it'sgoing to show you all of the differentthings that are available currently forln bitsand all you need to do to turn them onor off is to hit the enable buttonand it will add it to the side here ifit's something that you don't want youcan hit disable and it will be removedand that's pretty much it soright away we can go ahead and we canstart playing around so we're basicallygoing to go through the gamut here andwe're going gonna see what these thingsdo now i won't be able to get to all ofthese obviously because there's a lot ofthem and to be honest some of themrequireuh you knowfor example this you can set up your ownlightning atm i don't have the hardwarefor that right nowthere's certain things like being ableto stream and get notifications in livestreams for tip donations so and soforththat take a lot ofprep umand kind of beyond the scope of thisvideo but you'll get the idea from anumber of thesefirst up let's take a look at eventsthis would be for event ticketsand i've been playing around with this alittle bit before but basically all youneed to do here is you can hit new eventyou can create the title ofan event um we'll just saytutorialuh you say which wallet that you want tolink it to remember you could havemultiple i just have one right nowum[Music]watch this tutorial is the descriptionticket closing date so one of theclosing when's thewinner tickets no longer going to beavailable i'll just set it for tomorrowuh when does the eventbegin i'll set it for the next day whendoes the event end i'll set it for theday after that you get the point therehow many possible tickets are there i'mgoing to say there's 10 tickets and theprice per ticket will be10 sats all right simple we're going tohit create eventand this willcreatean event right here that says tutorialnow this you can see there's there's acouple little options off to the sideif you tap here this would be the resregistration where people can scan thetickets that they get from your eventhoweverthe link herewill open up a link that people can goto that you can sharefor people to be able to purchasetickets so you would give a nameand you would give an emailand you would hit submitat this point there's an invoice hereyou can copy this and paste it in orwhatever but again this is from theperspective of an individual that'slooking to make a purchase all rightso i'm going toagain bring in a wallet herethat's on the screenso this is my zebedee wallet justanother example of lightning while it'sworking with thisand i'm just going to hit scan so that ican scan this invoiceall right it says 10 sets and i canconfirm and payall right payment sent and there we goso the person buying this ticket wouldthen say hey link to your ticket this isnow your tutorial ticketwhich is what me as a vendor would bescanning when they arrive so they canprint this off they can screenshot itwhatever they likeand then i would be able tofromthis screen here i'd be able to scanthat ticket and then it would changethis to registered uh true instead offalse so i could see who's already beenthrough the door so basically verysimple way to set up uhtickets for an event whether it be abitcoin meetup whether it be whateveryou can do it quite easily throughthis extension on ln bitsup next i want to take a look at the lndhub extension here and what this allowsyou to do is actuallyconnectthis ln bits wallet that is connected toyour own voltage nodeand connect it remotely either via bluewallet or via zeusnow since you own your own funds andyour keys if you're using something likevoltage this means that a typicallycustodial wallet that would be based inblue wallet is now non-custodial andrunning through your own node so this issuper awesome i really enjoy thisi have a sticky note covered over herethere are two separate qr codes and whatthese are isthis is an lnd hub invoice url to theleft that means that the wallet that youcopy will be able to create invoices andreceive funds on the fly but will not beable to spend whereas the one on theright is an admin url meaning you'll beable to create invoices and receive andspend remotely on the fly with yourmobile device so i'm going to go aheadand i'm going to scan the admin urlsthat i have full access and we'll justsee what that looks like within a bluewallet so i'm going tojust transition herejust to blue wallet itself meanwhile onthe screen i've taken the cover off ofthose qr codes so within blue walletreally simple you can hit the plusbuttonyou're going to hit import wallet you'regoing to hit scan or import file andyou're going to scan the qr code thatyou choose as i said i want the adminone for thisandyour wallet has been successfullyimported and you can see heresame balance the transactions that havecome in and out all populate everythingis there and i can send and receiveeasily from the exact same lightningwall we created in ln bits but now it'sallocated on my blue wallet on my mobiledevice as well the same would apply forzeus they have full instructions on thewebsite here as well on how to do thatand i'll just transitionback but you can see the instructionsare here off to the side they're quitesimple but just slightly different pathto get to that spot in zeus butnonetheless super usefulup next we've got lnpor payso you want people to be able to createinvoices and pay you directly with youwithout not having to create theinvoices yourself okay so what you cando is you're going to hit create new paylinkchoose your wallet choose the itemdescriptionumwe'll just saypay menow you can either set a fixed amount orthe person can put in the amount ofsatoshis that they choosethemselves okay so it could be the sameamount every single time i'm going totake the fixed amount off and then itgives you the option of a minimum and amaximum i'll say min 10 max100okay currency is in setsuh you can add a comment you can add anyweb hooks that will be redirectedthey'll receive a link if they make apayment whatever you want you can add asuccess messagethanks foryour moneyand then again a success url whateveryou want umperfect so we're going to hit create paylinkit's now created so now anybodyi can view this by the way it'll bringit up and i can view itori canopen the link itself this link isshareable i can share this to anybodythey can scan this so let's take a lookat what it would look likescanning it on our phoneso i'm going to go ahead and usewe'll use breeze for this oneso i'm just going to go ahead and scanand then it gives me the option to putin my own number of sats and i'llenlarge that so you can see here amountain sat and it says enter an amountbetween 10 and 100. so i'll put 50i'll hit continueand approve and that will be sent offto my ln bits wallet and i did not haveto manually create an invoice herefor this pay payer okay all i had to dowas create this ln url pay linkand now i can receive and i get there'sthanks for your money thank you you'rewelcomeuh so i've now received payment throughthis and anybody can scan this and andgo ahead and if i refresh here i believei guess i'll go back to the wallet herethere we go pay me so i did i got a igot a payment through that link andthat's recyclable people can can gothrough that link anytime that they wantand you don't have to be there to createan invoice somebody can justsend you any amount whenever all rightit's good i would say to set a lowerthreshold here meaning that you don'twant to just have it be one sat becausesomebody could potentiallyddos attack you with a ton of one satpayments because that's next to nothingif you set it low to 10 or 50 or 100 orwhatever it prevents people because itthen it becomes costly for somebody toddos you sojust food for thoughtup next we're going to use ln url w orwithdrawal linksso here you have two options again thisis meant so that you can allow people towithdrawfrom this particular lightning wallet umwithout them having to create an invoicefor you okay so this would be like avoucher nowyou can hit quick vouchers and chooseyour walletthe amount per voucher let's say we'lljust put it at a minimum of 10 and howmany vouchers are there i'll just sayone okay so i'm going to leave that i'mgoing to hit create vouchers and at thispoint again you can tap and i'm gonnaclose some of these additional linksthat i've got going here but we'll openup the shareable link herethis is what it looks like and this cannow be scanned so i'm going totransition here all right so i've gotwallet of satoshi not the one linked toln bits this is just like a custodialone that i've set upandi'm going to hit thereceive button and then it gives me anoption to scan and i'm going to scan theqr codehereand it sayswould you like to create an invoice soit's going to create an invoice and thensend it back to ln bits so that it cansend uh to meso it's basically just bouncing back andforth it's doing a few extracommunication steps in order to get apayment or a withdrawal so i can see10 sats have been received to mylightning wallet and i did it byscanning a qr code so kind of theinverse of what i would normally doand there we go received a few secondsagoandthat will be reflected in the walletwithdrawal of 10 sets there we gonow you can also do more advanced ln urlwithdrawal links so when you click heregives you some more options of courseyou pick your walletyou give a link titlefree setsminimal withdrawal okay so you can do atleast 10 we'll saymax withdrawal will say50.amount of uses how many times can peoplego to this link and use ituhwe'll just say one andagain you could put that to whatever youwant time between withdrawal so maybeyou don't want somebody uh executingthis every millisecond so maybe you puta ayou know in in seconds i believe this isyes uh so we'll say 30 seconds inbetween and you have a drop down you canchange it to minutes hours whatever andthen use this unique withdrawal qr codeto reduce ass milking this isrecommendation if you're sharing linkson social media or print qr codes so umwe'll hit that because this qr code willbe shown here we'll create thewithdrawal link and it gives you justsome more optionalityin terms of settings for it but it workseffectively the samewill open up that linkwill uh receive and scanwithinblue walletnow this oneit auto populated to 50 but i can adjustiti'll just leave it as 50 create invoiceall right perfect and there's our 50sats coming into our wallet transactionapproved and back in ln bitswe go to the walletthere's the 50 sats going outum next let's take a look at the offlineshop this allows you to createln url pay linksin a physical store that wouldn'tnecessarily be online but allows you toconfirm that payment has been receivedand do it all via qr code as people goaround and pick up items in your shopso how this works is you can hit add newitem you canname the item we'll just call it a smilethe best smile as a matter of factyou can add a link to an image if youpreferthe item price again we'll say 10 setsunits or sets we'll hit out of itemnow at this pointyou can add as many of these as you likeand then when you're ready you can printthe qr codes for the items so here it'llgive me the option to print this smileqr code which i can then place around myshop in front of the item that is forsale and again just as an examplei will uh on my blue wallet here i'lljust hit send and scani scan the qr code and it says heyyou're going to pay 10 sats and i willreceive a smile and in fact the bestsmile so i can go ahead and payand that will be sent offto that qr codenowi will be showing uha link here and let me enlarge this fora secondso this linkis then able to be opened and i see thati bought a smile if i open that linkit's going to give me a word okay andthat wordis shownand let me bring it up herethat word is shown in the shop here as apossible word uh and i'll transitionover there's a list of words that couldbe given to individuals that are makingpurchases within my shop if this showsup as a linkthen i can kind of confirm that somebodyhasindeed purchased a product from my myoffline store and they're not justpretending that they sent me money okayso it's just kind ofagain a security measure to make surepeople aren't ripping you off and thisis this is uh generated in in a way thatsuch you know somebody's probably notgoing to guess the word bison and youcan change the word list if you see fitlet's take a look at paywalls this willbasically enable you to put any internetlink behind a paywall so really simplehere i'm going to hit new paywallchoose my walletuh choose which url it's going toredirect for an example here i'll justtakea recent interview i did with jeff boothand ludafrom the open dialoguefoundation so we'll take a look at thatand i will jump back to ln bitspaste that link inand then uhwe can name it whatever we want i'm justgoing to call itpaywall for nowvideoand how much does it cost to view thisvideo and again i'll just for the sakeof simplicity 10 sats now uh you canalso set it to remember payments so oncesomebody is paid they will always beable to access the link from theircurrent ip address or it you can have itso it's a repeat thing if you go back tothe website later you'll need to payagain okay so i'm going to leave this asis i'm going to hit create paywalland then this here uh this is myshareable link so i canshare thisand the paywall video is here all i needto dois uh in order basically i can sharethis link and when somebody gets to thisthey can hit the check markthey will see the invoiceand againi've got my phone handy hereandagain we'll just use we'll use breezefor this onewe will scanwe will approveperfect and then as soon as that paymentgoes through it will say you can accessthe url behind this paywall and then itshows you what the url is you can openitand then it will take you toin this casethis video that i had mentioned beforeso you can again do that with any pieceof content you don't want it to besomething that's easily searchable onthe internet anyway so obviously in thisinstance it would be a video that wasuploaded as unlisted so only people withthe link would be able to easily find itbut that's not the case if you if youwant to go watch this video it's forfree so go go go ahead check it outbut nonetheless again super easy awesometo useit wouldn't be bitcoin if there wasn'tsome sort of an awesome gambling gameinvolveduh sats dice is actually kind of a funthing that you can set up just just forshits and giggles we'll call it uh butbasically it's um an algorithmic game ofchance and you can set uh the parametersas you see fit and then anybody can usethe link to wager sats and potentiallywin back more so you can go here you hitnew sats dice which wallet is it goingtogive it a titlegive me setsnow you set a minimum and a maximum betsize all rightyou can set a haircut how much whatpercentage of this are you going toremove um[Music]in terms of winnings and then you canbasically use the sliding scaleto give this uh crazy chances back andforth so it starts off low where if youwin you would get 1.5 times your satsback and the chance of winning is 60 soreally not that badbut as it goes up three and a half timesyour money chances of winning are 255.5 and 167.5 and so you can see you know you canget all the way over here and you couldwin just shy of 20 times your money butyou only have a 4.62 percent of winningall right souh i'll i'll put it down here at uhthree and a half timesand maybe since i'm the casino maybe iwill takethree percent of that so now it'sthere's a 22 percent chance of winninginstead umand then we'll just create it create sasdice there we goso now at this point i can viewandthis is now ashareablelink so you can launch it as anindividual page here and effectively ican scan this and we'll see what itlooks like within an actual wallet soi'll do wallet of satoshi hereokay and so i'm gonna hit send and i'mgoing to scan what's on the screenso it's going to saygive me satschance 22chance of winning and it willgive me 3.5 times my sats now 10 statsis less than a penny i'm okay with thatand you can adjust it keep in mindremember the maximum that i put was athousand sas so you could bump that to100 sats or whatever within your walleteither way i'll leave it there hit okayit's going to send and then i'm going toget this ma message payment on the waynow it says successuh you can see there's a link here i'mgoing to open the urlunfortunately i lost so that's too badbut that's what you see when you losewe'll do a couple of these until we seeone where we winall right so only took me three tries towin not bad all right so at this pointit takes me to a page and it sayscongrats you won 35 sets you must claimthe sats nowuse the nln url compatible bitcoinwallet to payto playthe sas dice okay so you can copy the lnurl or you can simply tap on it for meit brings up a list of wallets that ican redeem it to i'll just do wallet ofsatoshi since that's what i was usingthere we go you will receive35 satsand there we go 35 sats into my walletgranted i paid 30 sats to get them soi don't know how far ahead i am therebut you know that's uh that's all rightbut at least i was just paying myselfanyways uh but yeah either way reallycool i'm gonna i'm gonna leave this onedown in the link below if you guys wantto play some sas dice and uh contributescontribute some sats uh to uh stoke yourgambling addiction butthe spotify jukebox is one of the appsthat i really enjoy for ln bits and thisallows you to do exactly as it soundsyou create a jukebox that people can paysats to play songs at an event whateveryou choosebut more or less all you're going to dohere you're going to hit add spotifyjukebox you're going to give it a namecall it sessionswe'll choose our wallet to use and theprice per track you set in sets and thenyou hit continueat this point you're going to need to goto developers.spotify.comwhichand you'll need to get some informationhere so this website hereyou're going to need to go tocreate an appand we'll call itln bits jukeboxwe'll just call musicfor setsi understand and agree with spotify'sterms we'll hit createnow at this point you're gonna see acouple things you're gonna see a clientidand then under this is a client secretwe will copy and paste the first onepaste it inhere and then i'll do the other one offscreen and we'll come back for the nextpartat this point you're going to copy thisredirect uriyou're going to jump back to yourdashboard here in spotify you're goingto hit edit settingsyou're

place to accept tips so to create oneyou hit new tip jar you choose yourwallet uh you can't have on chain butit's got to be activated and you got tohave a walletthe name so we'll just put sessions forthatand then a url to send somebody to oncethedonation is paid that could be anythingfor example let's put my website andactually i believe that actually has tobe like http it's got to be the full urlsowe'll just use my events page insteadinstead so we'll copy thatpaste it inperfect create tip jarthere you go now you can open that upthere we go we can leave a namesteve how many sats100please

thanks for the tipyou can also create point of saleterminals so we can hit new tpos give ita nameum[Music]sessions storechoose your walletand you can choose your currencyyou can have it i believe in in sets uhbut you can also just have it in localcurrency so let's just sayusdwe createat this point you just simply open it upon on the screenyou choose however whatever theexpense is we'll just say one cent whichis around 50 sets we'll hit okayand that brings up our paymentwhich we can then defer to our walletandthe anybody that's at a merchant couldthen pay so same thing send and scanthat's 50 sats i payand off it goes so a really simplesolution if you just want to beaccepting payment at the front of astoreand finally the last thing i want totouch on isuser manager so one of the things ireally like about ln bits is you cancreate users and multiple wallets forthose users and what this might beuseful for is if you haveperhaps friends and family or you haveusers on a um on a website that you'remanaging so and so forth uh for me ilike the friends and family anglebecause a lot of people i know ifthey're using lightning they might beusing custodial solutions and so a stepbetter than that you know maybe notfully down the path of running their ownnode but if i'm running my own nodemaybe i have a hosted one voltage and idon't necessarily want my friends andfamily trusting custodians with theirfunds i can at least have them link upto my ownvoltage node and then they're trustingmy liquidityrather than somebody that they may notknow at all so what you can do here isyou can create a new user and i'vealready kind of queued this up here butwe'll just call it lisa lisa's walletand we'll just leave it as mymy email here and we'll just do thepassword is test okay terrible terriblepassword don't use thatbut i can then create a userokaythis now has a wallet but i can alsocreate new wallets forlisa or for anybody any of the userslisted now the wallet i can click andthere's now a link to this wallet it'sits own segregated ln bits wallet linkedto my node however it can beexported to a phone with a qr code allright i can hit theuh i can hit the export button herethis canthis can be exported as a web address sopeople can log in and get access to thiswallet oras we saw before we could add anextensionfor lnd huband lnd hub then allows you to scan thisadmin andand put it into something like bluewallet to use on the fly so this isincredibly usefulif you want people going through yournode maybe because they don't have theirown soyeah really really love this featurehere and if i no longer want this i canjustdelete the userand then that's no longer linked toanything herebut all in allsuch a useful feature within ln bits andyeah just anothertool in the toolbeltthere are so many cool things within lnbits and again we barely touched on onall of them and i'm sure there's goingto be even more over time but i meanlook at look at thislist of extensions that you can playwithand as i was saying in the beginningthere's a number of things when it comesto like sub domains ororcreating and hosting lightning addressesor dj live streams or umyou know thelive tips onon something like twitch or whatever youchoose to dojust so many different cool and uniquethings to do hereso i really encourage you guys toto play aroundexperiment with lm bits again you canjust do a web-based if you choosebut it's really inexpensive to do it viavoltage as well running your own nodeand it's pretty simple to to get set upand and you can learn a little bit aboutopening channels and everything likethat in the processeither way uh kudos to ellen bits andeverything being built everybody that'sworking on lm bits umi i thinktools like this are indispensable andoh it's it's gonna throw a lot of peoplefor a loop because i think thatthere are a lot of people don't thatdon't realize kind ofwhat is possible with lightning and eventhat it works in a lot of instances umyou know there's still obviously lots ofwork to be donelightning isn't perfect butthese are justgreat proves proof of concepts that youcan play with right now in the wild so ihighly encourage you to do so and againhats off to everybody working on ln bitsthank you guys so much for watching asalways please do like subscribe shareall those things really do help thechannel if you
