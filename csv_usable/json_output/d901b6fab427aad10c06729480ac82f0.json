  "text": "hello guys my name is colin and this iscolin talks cryptonot too long ago daniela camboni did aninterview with michael saylor and frankgiustra two billionaires and they havedifferent outlooks on the subject ofbitcoinmichael saylor has famously invested apercentage of his corporate treasuryinto bitcoin itselfand frank giustra is a gold bug whodoes not think that that was a smartideaduring this awesome interview and debateof which i recommend you watch theentire thingmichael saylor makes an incredible pointabout the security aspect of storingbitcoin versus storing goldand he pulls some facts right off thetop of his headduring the interview during the debateit's really impressiveit makes a fantastic point about theconfiscatability of bitcoin comparedwith goldand actually this applies to mostcryptocurrenciesbecause of the non-physical nature ofcryptocurrency versusa physical asset such as gold so withthat being said i'm going to play a clipfor youof michael saylor he's really quite aneloquent speakerand in a way he's a poet of words riskfactorshere's my thought about risk factorsgoldinvites violence alexanderyou know gallivant around the world toseize gold livvy tells the story of onethousand roman siegesin order to steal the gold caesarsacked gaul to take their goldkubla khan sees the gold pizarra seesgoal from the incas cortez sees goalfrom the aztecs charles the firstseized the gold from all the britishnoblesdepression seized gold from the frenchin 1871in world war one everybody sees the goldlenin seized gold from the church in1922roosevelt seized everybody's gold in1933stalin seized the goal of the spaniardsin 36 churchill took everybody's gold in1940 at the onset of the war at brettonwoods the united states seized theworld's goldand then you know took it hostage andthen nixon killed all the hostages in1971.gold's always getting ceased the problemis you can't securegold the cost to secure it goes up withthe number ofnodes or caches of gold the value of thegold in the cacheyou have to secure it with guns peoplesteelconcrete carbon it doesn't scaleif you want to stress test it you askyourself the questionwhen i give this thing to 5 billionpeople how much is going to cost meso gold transportation costs don't scalebecause the moretransactions the more the value thetransactions the more jurisdictionsyou know brings more cost and moreregulationand you need guns people vehicles andcarbon is too expensive for mosttransactionsgold audit won't scale because the morenodes the moretransactions the more value the morecost and the regulators get involved isvery people intensive it'sinfrequent slow it's unreliable it's arisk factorgold security transport and audit areregulated by every nodal jurisdictionthey're corruptable they'reuncompetitive they're antiquated they'reelitistthey're ineffective and they're out ofreach for 99.9of the population the gold applicationswhat we call paper gold they don't haveany technicalprotocol with integrity so they're allcorrupted by hypothecation regulationand inflationbitcoin security transport and audit arepretty effectively freethey're effective they're unregulatedthey're egalitarianeverybody has the same rights a personwith a hundred dollars a bitcoin has thesame security as someone with a billiondollars a bitcointhere's competition to continuallyimprove the servicesthey're decentralized the security nodesare decentralizedand they're protecting the interest ofthe holders from local violencelocal regulation and local corruption isthe bitcoin miner in iceland or thenorth pole or siberia or chinaprotecting the interest of somebody inmanhattan or ontario and it's abeautiful thinggold's physicality and indestructiblenature they invite malefactors to killyou and take your propertybitcoin safely stores your property incyberspacewhere it can't be seized by force andthat encouragespeaceful negotiations rather thancoercionso there you guys go i think that wasjust really impressive with how herecalled from memory all these differentmoments in history where gold has beenconfiscatedand it really is true the confiscatablenature of gold and precious metalsthemselvesmake them susceptible and make themtargets foracts of violence and war and you mightbe thinking to yourselfwell sure but someone could use violenceagainst a cryptocurrency holder as wellyes but at the same time not as easilybecausewhen it comes to one nation state takingover another nation stateor attempting to steal the gold fromanother nationthey're not going to be able to easilygo and steal their private keysas they would be able to march a groupof soldiers a militiain and physically take the gold oncethey've taken over the countryit's much easier to hide bitcoinas a nation than it is to hide gold as anationso he makes a really good point here andthe cherry on topis the peace factor because in a wayyou're eliminating this honey potof gold confiscate ability if you wereto store your nation's wealth in acryptocurrencysuch as bitcoin you are effectivelyreducing the violencebetween nations when it comes to greedand theftat least when it comes to greed andtheft of a monetary nature such as goldtheftgold itself actually encourages thattheft because it keeps that honey potpresentso this is just yet another example ofwhy cryptocurrencyis superior to legacy assets and legacystores of valueand i think michael saylor did anincredible job bringing these points toour attentioni've said it before and i'll say itagain bitcoin is apeaceful and passive resistance if youfound this useful please do watch thefull interviewthe link is in the description below andplease smash that like buttonshare this with all your friends andi'll be back with you again
