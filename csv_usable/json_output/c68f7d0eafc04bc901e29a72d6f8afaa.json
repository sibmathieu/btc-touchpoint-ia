  "text": "i mean couldn't you say that at the end of \nthe day there'll be three classifications of  political reaction there'll be some governments \nthat that uh resist reality and they collapse  and and maybe they collapse into civil \nwar and they just collapse into chaos  and there'll be some governments that that \nfight resist struggle and eventually uh  reconfigure themselves after great deals of pain \nand agony and there'll be some governments that  that look at the world and they they uh \ntransform themselves in an agile fashion  and they maybe they don't get through without \nk without stress but they morph into something  different and accommodate the world right what \nhappens if a small country the best example  would be what if a small country that still \nhas a currency starts printing the currency  to buy bitcoin the first one right there's a \nlittle bit of room right like like what if uae  right or saudi arabia what if they were to go \nand just start buying bitcoin with their currency  like how long could i mean in theory couldn't \nyou if you ran a country like emirates  couldn't you go ahead and buy billions two three \nfive ten billion of this before anybody noticed  before and and it might never \nweaken your currency rightyeah they've got an annoying strength capital \nright yeah they're hosting world cups that you  know cost them a lot of money they could be buying \nbitcoin and watching the world cup on tv like a  good uh i mean a good model to consider is norway \nand sweden and other sovereign wealth funds right  the the really they're you know you've got \nregressive you've got cuba and venezuela right and  north korea and they're not really \ngood at embracing property rights  and then you've got the middle of the road \nconventional and their central banks are  holding you know u.s sovereign debt or gold but \nmainly just sovereign debt and then you've got  progressive nations and norway is one norway's \ngot a massive equity portfolio right switzerland's  got a massive they they didn't use gold they \nactually used big tech as a store of value  um you know ksa and uae in fact all of the middle \neastern countries they generally have sovereign  wealth funds that are holding diversified \nportfolios of property including equity they  own banks they own big tax sometimes sometimes \nthey own like tons of property real estate reits  not to mention commodities right oil \nrights like mineral rights and the like soi think uh i think generally the world is a \nmore complicated place than we are able to  predict right like you're trying to predict what \nthe market will do and is is it the whole basis  of austrian economics right that nobody can really \npredict the market you know yeah it's human action  at the end of the day and so everybody has free \nwill right like microstrategy can do what it did  like microstrategy stock was 120 and then \nwe flipped and it's up by a factor of five  and and what did we do we basically bought some \nbitcoin and then we started issuing stock to buy  bitcoin isn't that the same as a country buy some \nbitcoin and start issuing currency to buy bitcoinyeah right yeah so i guess it's a slightly \ndifferent because it devalues the currency  when you issue more of it but if you back up this \nbitcoin it isn't slightly different because when  you issue stock you devalue the stock right you if \nyou're issuing equity you're diluting the equity  and if you issue currency you're diluting the \ncurrency but but the equity is a claim on the or  on the cash flows of the company and the currency \nis a claim on the assets of the bank that issued  the currency if it is redeemable and uh if \nit's redeemable in gold or bitcoin then yeah  so that's what they've got to do they have \nto go on a bitcoin standard let's let's be  extreme right what happens if uae buys 10 billion \ndollars of bitcoin and the price of bitcoin then  increases by a factor of 20. and next thing you \nknow they've they've got 200 billion dollars  worth of bitcoin and everybody in the world knows \nthey've got 200 billion dollars worth of bitcoin  well the first thing that's going to happen is \nthe saudis are going to want to buy more thenyeah so i think uh i think \nthe point here really isyou can spend a lot of time fantasizing \nabout how you never want any banks to buy  bitcoin you never want any companies to buy \nbitcoin you never want any governments to  buy bitcoin and since they're not going to ever \nbuy any bitcoin you're the enemy of the banks  and the companies and the government right \nyeah right and and you see that narrative  right like like banks are the enemy of bitcoin \ncompanies are the enemy of bitcoin not your  keys not your coin the government's the enemy of \nbitcoin but the other possibility which just turns  the entire thing on its head is what how would \nyou feel if you woke up tomorrow and you found  out that goldman sachs did buy 10 billion dollars \nof bitcoin and uae bought 20 billion of bitcoin  would you be angry by the way your bitcoin would \nbe trading at like four million dollars of bitcoinand you could be angry and say no no give that \nback to us i want to go back to 50 000 bitcoin  look if institutions weren't involved in bitcoin \nbitcoin would be trading at like 8 000 right now  right if you look at you know the last \n18 months so you could like just we could  unwind that and you go back to eight thousand \ndollar bitcoin or you can move forward but  it's just a taste so you know \nmy what's my big point here it's  it's like nobody can predict how the future \nwill evolve except to make this one observation  people are generally rational and they take the \npath of least resistance and so at some point  it's possible that someone's \ngoing to buy the bitcoin  not because they agree that with with your most \nextreme vision of no governments and no companies  and living together peacefully in one world \ncurrency maybe that's not why they're going  to do it maybe they just want the money right \nyeah for sure uh bitcoin is is far more popular  than anarchist ideology that's for sure i i \ni totally so where should i understand that  right when that happens then uh the entire \nthing is going to tilt a different direction  inconceivable right you don't you just don't \neven know which direction it's going to go  but the world is going to find its way forward and \nand uh you know like when the lockdowns took place  right there's this phrase life finds a way right \nyou know like the jurassic park phrase when the  lockdowns took place we shut down cruise lines and \nwe shut down airlines and we shut down theme parks  and we shut down movie theaters and if you're if \nyou're uh an investor in the disney corporation  you could look at the disney corporation and \nyou could say well they're in cruise lines  oh and hotels hotels airlines cruise lines \ntheaters everything's shut down you know and  if you're if you're an analyst you could \nsay well it's pretty obvious the stock  is impaired the company is impaired i should \njust dump my stock or i should short the stock  but at the end of the day someone went on \ntelevision and said how's disney going to react  and someone went and disney went on television \nsaid we're just going to do disney plus streaming  and they said well how many customers do you \nhave like right now you know at the time of the  lockdown they were like the ninth largest you know \nnon-launch streaming service and it would have  accounted for 0.1 of their revenue or one percent \nof their revenue and minus nothing of their profit  and you could just focus on that narrative or you \ncould get on tv and say yeah well we think by the  year 2025 we're going to actually be growing a \nhundred percent year over year and everybody said  this is great they've got a plan stuck at an \nall-time high yeah and so you know and so the  point really is are you going to bet on everybody \nto lose or and not come up with the right strategy  or what are the odds that they're just going to \nfind a strategy which is a winning strategy and  a winning way to accommodate right i mean nobody \non d nobody from disney got on television and said  you know the you know streaming video will never \nreplace the theme parks it will never replace  you know the the movie experience we believe \nfamilies need to come together in our hotels  and be in our you know disney world rides i \nmean they didn't spend a lot of time you know  wallowing in self-pity and dealing with that \nreality they just completely change the focus  talk about the new thing and move forward so \ni i think that uh everybody loves a winner  and bitcoin's a winner and the winning strategy \nis let everybody win with us right yes definitely  everybody can win with is it i don't care what \ngovernment you know can governments win yes all  of them even the ones i don't like even the ones \ni don't like right can companies win all of can  the banks win yeah sure they can i don't you \nknow you don't like that company because they  censor this thing no they could still win like \nat the end of the day if everybody wins with you  and you're you know you have the most extreme \nvalues like multi-sig coal storage with you know  guns and a cabin and your own source of water \nand your own food supply you're still going to  be better off right yes you know your bitcoin \nis still going to be worth 10 million a bitcoin  yeah my view on all of this is to tell people \nthat you know bitcoin's permission list and  that includes that it's uh complete \nyou can't stop people from selling  ious for bitcoin you know people think about it as \nif we need to stop people from buying bitcoin ious  well no it's bitcoin holders who are selling \nious and there's nothing you can do about it and  i think you know generally as a libertarian \nleaning anarchist i i i don't get upset at  things that are peaceful i can't oppose people \ndoing peaceful things that don't hurt othersyou",
