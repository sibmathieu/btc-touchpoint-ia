michaelsayloron which my austrian economics course isnowbeing provided for free anybody can goto sailor.org and take that course forfree so you can take it by becoming amember of safehaddeen.com but now it'salso available uh for free for anybodyanywhere in the world to take it andsailor.org offers university levelclasses for free for anybody in theworldand it also offers university leveldegrees which ispretty astonishing when you think aboutit because as students from anywhere canlog on and learn the material on theirown at their own paceand then they can do an examand they'll be proctored during the examand they will geta university degree and it's auniversity degree that's on the verge ofgetting accredited as well so it'll be afully accredited university degreeso jeff thank you very much for joiningus todaythank you for having me great to be hereso um well you and i have uh workedquite a bit on preparing the coursesthat uh you're uh posting my coursesthat you're posting on seller.org but wehaven't had much of a chance to discusssailor.org itself until last week whenmichael saylor and i had atwitter spaces conversation aboutmy course and we also discussedsailor.org and sofirst of all congratulations on beingvery close to hitting the 1 millionstudent milestone should be anytime anyday now that you uh hit a millionstudents uh so that's an astonishingachievement and i'd like you to pleasetell us moreabout the founding of sailor.org itshistory how it's evolved and how youended up with a million studentsyeah sounds good soobviously it's a name sailor academy asyou noted for our namesake michaelsaylor a lot of people know that michaelwent to mitwhat many might not know is he went tomit for freeon an army rotc scholarshiphis family was from modest means andthey couldn't have afforded even onesemester at mit let alone the wholethingso he was able to get a free degree orhe actually got two degrees from mit forfreeand he's you know and that struck himyou know as very profound because itallowed him to start a businessand you know and many of you know thatbusiness it's called microstrategy uhhad he had a bunch of student debt heprobably would he says he might not havetaken that riskat that timeuh and so obviously microstrategy nowhas been around fora few decades and employs a couplethousand or three whatever numbers twothree thousand people around the worldand michael attributes a lot of that andto being debt-free when he came out ofschooland also you think about ityou knowedu higher education education generallyis critical in some formto every single sectorin the world economy rightbutwe put up these barriersto every people joining every othersector but through the make them gothrough thisyou know uh depending where you liveuh you might have you might have verylimited access or you might have veryexpensive access we put up this gauntletthat people have to get throughand it's it ranges around the worlddepending on where you are uh so you gotto get through that then you can joinone your preferred sector in the economyright so we we need everyone educatedenough to participate in the economy atsome level if not the highest level thatcan that they can achieve their humanpotentialumand the more you knowthe more people who can achieve theirown potentialyou know most of us probably agreethat's probably good for all of usumso michael's idea based on his give backisthat you know he got his free degree sohe wants to give that to everyone elseand also just to encourage to encourageothers entitiesyou know companies governments othernonprofits to do the same thing as welluh and try to make as much educationaccessible to people around the world aspossibleyeah and so um tell us a little bitabout howsailor.org is different from otherlearning platforms so we know khanacademy and coursera are two of the mostpopular around the world how are youdifferentso khan academy right now is k-12 focusso so your primary education and we'resecondary education focused and that'sbecause whenum you know khan's doing everything sowelluh and there's a couple others there'sone called ck12 that's very good onprimary education and there's probablyothers around the world as welland who knows maybe someday we'll getinto that as wellor at least the bridge between primaryand higher ed and then coursera is is avery nice platform a lot of free coursesa lot of niche courses too it's oftendesigned for people who already have adegree uh but also umtheir certificates areare not free you can learn but you can idon't know if you get all the featuresbut you can learn basicsuh but you can't get it for acertificate for free from that costmoneyyeah and so you guys you offer a fulluniversitydegree for freewell uh certificates and right now wedon't we don't um we don't have thedegree right now so we are in theprocess of getting permission for thedegreefor a business degree we have all theelements there all the courses you wouldneeduh we're and so in america the worddegree is highly regulated uh so wecan't use the word degree yet but we'rein that process there'll be two phasesone phase is getting a state to give uspermission so we're we're looking in thestate of florida michael's a residentthereuh and then and we have otherother other rationale for that uh andthen toonce you get a state license then youthen in america we have the goldstandard is called regionalaccreditationand there are eight regions but they allare equal in the eyes of of the worldyou know so stanford isunder a different regional accrediterthan mit uh but you can argue that thosetwo are the better two of the betterschools in the country you know theyhave different regional accreditors butthe regional creditors are supposed tobe all in the same playing field sowe'll get hopefully get our statelicense this yearand then then we have to have agraduating class we're putting out anmba first just to kind of get get thingsgoing uh and then uh once we have agraduating class that could be tenpeople or it could be ten thousand butit could be ten people enough then wecould go to the creditors and say here'sour project here's our program here'show good it is uh et cetera andhopefully then we get the full goldstandard accreditationmost most people most uh universities inamerica seek that because they want totap into financial aid uh we of courseare not looking to do that because we'renot charging anythinguh and so it's an interestinguh conundrum for some of the regulatorsbecause they have a hard timeunderstanding freebecause they're so used to the vastovercharging that's been happening uhfor a long you know inflation on collegedegrees is through the roof as you asyou know i'm sure you know at least inthe u.s and probably elsewhere as wellyeah absolutely it's a theme thatrunsregularly in this uh seminar hereobviously the uh inflation it's a topicthat is uh very near to the heart of uhpeople who are interested in bitcoin andi think universities are a wonderfulexample ofjust how much prices have gone up forthe most desirable goods and i creditsailor really for uh pinpointing this inthis way when he said inflation is avector you shouldn't you can't think ofinflation as being one number the cpiwhich is an average because that onlyworks if everybody has the same basketof goods there's no average basket ofgoods becauseeverybody consumes something differentand you can't average outqualitatively different uh things and soif you look uh you know if you try andlook at the basket of goods and theconstituents with a little bit more umprecisionyou'll seethings that are highly desirable like auniversity degreethey are increasing at prices muchfaster than inflation they go up muchfaster than cpi inflation at leastand the reason isyou know that's where the inflationshows up it shows up in the things thateverybody wants that's where it shows upmuch best and universities have beenabsolutelyamazing at how much their fees have goneup over the yearsdid youyou did not work in a university beforecoming into sailor.org you were not inacademia righti was not i think that's helpful rightyeah very much soum you know and so i actuallyquick aside you know i i was at a majorlaw firm in dc years agoand umthis is 1999. i had i graduated templelaw school in philadelphia uh worked fora federal judge for a couple of yearsand then i came down to washington dcand uh my first few weeks into the uminto the um job i go into hr fill insome paperwork and they say oh heyaround the corner free bagel someone'strying to sell us a new coffee machineor something so go get a free bagel so igo over there get my free bagel in thecorner i see this gentlemandistinguished looking i say to myselfokay he's obviously a partner manager inthis firm i he probably knows i'm new ibetter say hello well there's a thousandof us we didn't know i was an attorneylet alone knew you know but i said hellothis guy um uh became so we and ended upuh hitting it off very well and ended upa few months later he said hey one of myyoungest attorneys just left my team youwant to come work for me and i said surethis is 1999. but the reason he had thatopening is because that young attorneywent to work for a guy named michaelsayloruh so my so my connection ofof sorts goes back not directly butindirectly to sailor world goes back to1999 when i replaced someone on a lawfirm team uh due to michael uhgetting them on his teamand then that boss uhthen i went to the government for awhile and then when i was in thegovernment that my old boss says now i'mgoing to go work for sale i said greatumand then 10 years later around 2010um roughly 10 years later several weekslater uh 2010 he this old boss of minesays hey you know i've been working forsailor he's got this foundationthere's a lot of there's some money hereand you know we're looking touhget it well more well known we startedbuilding courses and soi think this first course is startingbeing built around 2008 and went live in2009 and mostly was just like let's justput up a bunch of courses and see whathappens was you knowand there was some there was some ummythologymethodology to it which is oneuh how do we do this asynchronously sowe'll talk more about that in a minuteuh but then two what should we put up soat the time they just sort of picked the10 most popular majors in the u.s sobusiness and psychology and those typesof things and started building all thecourses that you would normally see ifyou took that degree at a typicalquote-unquote u.s universityumand so so so the course so we've hadlive courses since 2009 we didn't reallystart offering certificates untila little bit later and then we didn'treally get serious about kind oftracking and pushing people forwardtowards certificates because a lot ofour early models just built the coursesand also we were thinking maybeuniversities wouldn'ttry to create a licenseum that wasn't always successful andsometimes it's hard to find openlylicensed licensed materials um we evenlicensed a bunch of textbooksumuh for example we have a great linearalgebra textbook that was used at byuuh then we licensed that it's now freeanyone in the world could use it um infact we're about about to bring back ourlinear algebra course umbut umso you know we've had so we've neverpivoted away from free it's been freethe whole timebut we've been kind of but in the earlydays we were unsure whether we were a bto b model or a b to c model then we nowwe have now we're predominantly b to cand of could be or beta studentumand you know it's true that universitiescan use our stuff i just we just don'tactively market to them for that purposeif they find that they want to use it weguide them it's all on github uhall the courses they can just take it uhnot the exams though but all but all theall the materialsumand then um but now so now we decidedyou know a few years ago to really pushfor you know let's just go directly tothe students uh the access the need isphenomenal right umthere are you know unesco saysuh there are 100 million people who by2025 will be academically academicallyprepared for college but there's no seatfor them or there's no cost so there's amonth there's no money for them orsometimes bothum because not every country hasbroadband everywhere right and so a lotof countries haven't gone online yet umso there's either no no sheet physicallyuh like in nigeria there's a lot ofpeople who take online courses in the usbecause they're literally waiting fortheir spot in the local universityuh and then the same thing and some ofthem don't also of course depending onwhere in the world you don't have themoney eitherso there's 100 million people who areacademically prepared but if you thinkabout it there's probably a lot morethan that that we could prepare a lotmore right and you think about uh thecourseyou know that you you sent you gave usuh worked with us on it it's umit's now this morning by the way i justlooked it's just over a thousand peoplein the course already it's barely up twoweeksumand so that's exciting right and youthink about that too we you know in theu.s that course if you went touniversity you want to take that courseat the us university it's easily athousand dollars it's not more but let'sjust say a thousand for the math so athousand times a thousand is a milliondollars so in two weeks we've set upwe've set up the potential of a milliondollars in education savingsjust like thatuh another cool thing is you know wethink abouti'll just take because the math easieruh android devices you know we have a wehave a sailor academy has aan app in the app store that connectsyou to oursite and you can take quizzes and allthat stuff online on your phone thereare three billion uh android devicesroughly in the world so think about acouple weeks ago once we hit live oncewe made that course go live weeffectively delivered that to threebillion people now we gotta get thediscovery process to happen right butright now it's in their pocketsuh or wherever they're keeping theirphone and it's there and so and alongwith all the other courses that we havewhich is you alluded to and we've gotall the general electives that you wouldnormally take at a university criticalthinking philosophyumyou know economics of course but but funyou know umpolitical science and history as well soall the things you would normally takeand as well as a bunch of computerscience and business courses um there'smore we can do in other areas of coursewe will do but for now we stuck there asyou know the gen ed plus those sort oftwo disciplines as the major areas uhfor now and hopefully we'll be expandingdown the line but you know so soeffectively right now there are threebillion people at least i'm pretty surewith the apple store too but let's justfocus on android there are three billionpeople walking around this course intheir pocket they just don't know it yetso we gotta wait that's the next thenext trick is to get them to know itwow that's pretty incredible when youthink about itum it'sit's it's an amazing difference betweenthe efficiency of online education andthe efficiency of university educationand i don't think it's purely about theonline i thinkonline is a symptom of it it's a symptomof how the university system hasfailed to take advantage of online inorder to reduce costs and overhead forstudentsandi think that brings us into theincentives and the problems so tell usmore about how you've umyou knowas an outsider who's come into uheducation what have you seenas the problems of uh moderneducation systems in modern universitiesi'll speak to the u.s i haven't studiedeveryone else but you know i'm aconsumer of us education i have twodegrees um and there's a point there's abunch of different things but one onereally important thing the system ofcourse takes advantageof this but also on this on the demandsidewe're not good consumers in the usum we have a false belief thatumthe more money you pay for somethingthe more the better quality it issometimes that true but not always rightum and you know big big differences sofor example you know there's a lot ofchoices that can be made by peopleuh community colleges in america providedirect gateways to middle class jobs andcyber security and nursingand lots of really interesting thingsbut a lot of people no one is there's noone on the news or a government policytalking about community colleges becausethey're seen as lesser rightum but at the same time you know aslovely as mit is it's still only servingwith its degree program a very smallminority people around the world and ifyou get strap laid out in any given yearthere's 20 million u.s college studentsthat's still 20 million out of the worldpopulationum that could be accessing these is alow it's a pretty low number even in theus it's kind of a low number in someways and not everyone needs a full uhfour-year degree we get thatum and and but you think about thistraditionallyuh they've been able to throughgovernment policy by giving them moremoney uh rightup upping the aid upping everything uhas well as bad choices where people evenin america solet's say uhand if you that we have 50 states eachstate has a major flagship universitymost of those are pretty soliduniversitiesuh yet many people choose to go out ofstate and end up paying four times asmuch have they just gone to their stateuniversity so just that alone can cutcosts rightumbut then you also have things like usyeah our programs like ours you know wedo have some you know we do have ourcourses recognizedby many universitiesuh and what's interesting is that everyaccreditor that i met referenced earlierhas approved our type of course to be tobe uh recognized by the universitiesthey just all haven't done it yetbut umum the the you know remember so wetalked about 20 million studentslet's just cut that in half and say 10millionuh kick out and um because you thinkabout 20 million each are in each yearbut some of those are juniors andseniors and what i'm talking about ourtypes of courses are usuallylower division so first and second yearthat we've got college creditrecommended for we've got the fullum finalthe full panel but we don't have collegecredit recommendations for all of thembut for the ones we douh haveuh let's just say you know if you take10 if 10 million peopleuh of those decided just if they werejust to take ten courses with us so oneyearright that's a hundred million courseswell the average course is over fifteenhundred dollarsdo your math hundred million times fiftyhundred dollars right is that 150billionthat they could collectively save uh soif you cut that in half and say and say5 000 excuse me 5 million people took 10of our courses for college creditum so in other words if you had 25percent of college students taking just25 of their credits with a group like usthey've could collectively save 75billion dollarsthat's amazing interestingly you knowi've been to the obama white house topresent this i've been to the trumpwhite house uh nobody nobody'sinterested uh we've been to governors uhwe sent letters to governors we've sentwe've met with governor steph um youknow there's something called theamerican council education that thatthat has been around for 40 plus yearsor moreand most of the universities are membersof it and they're the ones that reviewour courses for credit recommendationsand they tell all their members aboutthe serviceuh yet there's really no coordinationand so really to save 75 billion dollarsall it would take would beyou knowa handful of political celebrities andother celebrities just to tell americathis is availableyou know uh and because we don't wedon't have we don't have the money tospend on tv ads and radio ads andyoutube ads and whatever elseuh to tell everybody that we have we'renot the only one with low-cost umopportunities but but umbut it's just really interesting no onereally you know the news kind of stillcovers the traditionalyou know you got to go live in the dormbottle and all that kind of move-in dayall that kind of stuffyet you know fastest growinguh population in america for collegestudents are adults who are beyond dormage who mage orhalf of which are taking hybrid and oronline but like you said theinefficiencies go beyond just you knowthe dichotomy of onlineuh versus offlineand a lot of it isinformation sorry just informationlack of coordination umand and so so we've done our best youknow we've been for years now trying topound on doors andand talk to people umand so to me you know and i'd love tohelp those you know five ten millionpeople save some moneyuh by the same time you know i'm alsomuch more interested or i'm sorryequally maybe even some days more sointerestedin the big blue ocean of trulyunderserved learners around the worldright you think people who take businesscourses heard of the blue ocean strategyoh there's there's billions of peoplenot being served at all right so how dowe reach themuh and we'll keep trying to reach thepeople in school and get people to makebetter choicesat the same time can we also can wemaybereally reach some people who are noteven going at alland they don't have to get the fullthing can they come and learneconomics can they come and learn pythoncan they come and learn english in manycases and you know of course we don'twe're not that's not a westernuh we're not trying to make a westernimposition on people to learn englishit's just it's justfor whatever for better or for worseenglish has become the language of theglobal economy and sowe decided to make it available uh to beable to learn english as well and wehave some more courses coming out inthat frontso i'm going to pause for a second andlet's see if i'm still answering yourquestion maybe i've veered off a littlebitno that absolutely is uhthe is what we're getting at i thinkit's uh it's amazing when uh when i wasuh planning on leaving my job atuniversity one of the things that i wasthinking of is you know reading aboutuniversities and how they've evolved andhow the costs keep risinguh and howyou know the university experiencethe number of professors that youinteract with is declining for studentsbecause most professors are spendingtheir time doing research that nobodyreadsandyet the cost is spiraling andyou find that the increasehas come primarily athas come primarily from an increase inthe salaries ofbureaucrats at the university so peoplewho are not students and people who arenotteachersand you knowthis isn't administrative staff thesearen't janitors the real money is goingto all of theseuh completelyvacuous titles that really just don'tbelong at a university you knowvice president for student engagementand uhvice president forthis and that and there's just anendless array of uh jobswhere you know when you're when you're auniversity professor you start realizingjust how um corrupt this system uhisandbecause you know the the university isbuilt around professors the idea is thatit is a place run by the professors andin the uh you know the ideal form isthat the professors run it and hand itover to other professors and then youjust have a aa a system that lasts through timebecause the people in charge are handingover to people that they themselvestrained and that they trust but now allof that has beenformalized and commoditized into thepeer review process where professors sitthere andassess each other's work and give eachother's ratings on their work and thendecide to give each other promotion butultimatelythat's becoming a small sideshow in theuniversities compared to the amount ofmoney that is being spent on theseother jobsand it's uhit's quite telling you know you see thispretty much everywhere where universewhere uh government intervention beginsto take place because once governmentmoney comes in the metric for success isno longer serving the customers but itis uh serving uh the bureaucrats whowant to pay the uhwho are the ones who actually pay the uhpay the billsand so then the bureaucrats you knowthey can'tif it's a modern government and ademocracy it can't just be uhit can't just be some capricious rulewhere some guy decides who to give moneythere need to be guidelines and researchproposals and all kinds of complex uhprocesses that take place in order tomake it so that the uh so that thepeople who are uh in chargecan dispense the money with some senseof objectivity but that just creates ahighly complex mess of a process whereessentiallyacademic research is completely divorcedfromuh any kind of real world relevancebecause it's just uhyou know professors grading otherprofessors onhow well they do the job without anyfeedback from the real world without anyfeedback from the market and instead uhyou know as the role of the professordiminishes in its significance and ofcourse diminishes in its intellectualfreedom and in its capacity foryou know engaging inreally value-added productive researchthe flip side is that the power goesmore and more towards administrators andyet we don't see administratorsum excelling in uhdoing innovative things ineducation and i think the example youmentioned about the blues the blue oceanstrategy or the blue seasof uh you know why why isn't mit andharvard thinking abouteducating a million people they alreadyhave the name where millions of peopleall over the world would dream ofgetting into uh these universitiesbecause of all of the um hollywood andthe media propaganda that they hearabout how these places are just soamazingand they've got enormous amount of moneythat they're using to trade on the stockmarket they're effectively a hedge fundmasquerading as at a university at thispointand they don't considermuch of uhthey don't pay much attention to theidea of educating more and more peopleuh it's stillyou knowthe notion of limiting the amount ofstudents who are enrolled at auniversityin order to make it uh exclusiveis truly archaic when you think about itthis kind of made sense a couple hundredyears agowhenthere was one library in each city oreach townand if you wanted to learn about a topicyou had to go to that library and youhad to spend a lot of time near thelibrary and there was just because ofthe you know the space around thelibrary being uh scarceyou had to have an institution around itwhere the people who knew how to readthose booksuh could guide the people who didn't andso there was a scarcity thatnecessitated that you know harvard couldonly take on this many studentsumbut nowthat has been completely revolutionizedby the internet the uhthinking of it from the perspective ofwe are a university that wants to teachas many people as much as we canwould lead you in the direction ofhow do we utilize all this newtechnology to increase the efficiencywith which we can perform education sothat we can educate more people so thatwe can deliver more degrees so that wecan teach more people calculus and umenglish literature and whateveranduh that would be i think what a freemarket in universities would haveachieved and um you know i i used toalways say where is the steve jobs ofeducation why isn't there somebody likesteve jobs in education or somebody likerockefeller working on making thingscheaper and thuspopularizing them why hasn't there beenmuch of this from the university systemand why is the university systemcontinuing to be so insular you knowthey're still limiting the number ofpeople that go to harvard even thoughnow they're making them all learn onzoom well what difference does it makefor you if you're sitting in a zoom callwith 50 kids or 500 kids or 5 000 kidsit's the same thing it's the same zoomcall and sothere are so manyopportunities for increasing theproductivity of these uheducational institutions and so manylow-hanging fruits but they just are notvery interested in picking them wouldn'tyou sayyeah absolutely yeah now they have donei will give harvard's mit a littlecredit with their edx program but theyjust sold that to a for-profit so wedon't know what's going to happen withthatumbut they haven't done it with degreesgeorgia tech has has reduced the cost ofa master's degree pretty significantlybut it's still assumed you have theability to do all the work to get intothe master's degree so we're still veryearly days andyou know it's really interesting youthink about the music business rightmusic business had a monopolyon all the major talent in the worldright they went back before steve jobsdecided to do what he did and the musicbusinessdidn't you know they just sat there andlet steve jobs totallydecimate and digitize their their thingand so and you're gonna i would you knowi've been in conferences with smallliberal arts schoolswho pretend the internet's still a fadyou know at least at least the way theytalk about itandyou know and what's gonna happen we havei think umi don't know three thousand four fourthousand universities and colleges inthe u.s and at some point that number'sgonna get cut way down uh just throughthe market becausethere you know if you if there's a bunchof you know these state universitieswill be around harvard will be aroundbut you know there's going to be a bunchof small countryside places that justdon't keep up because they're holding ontoyou knowuh you know the 1400the model from you know literally 1400for if you go back towhen did the first university startaround the world um somewhere back therebut anyway umyou know it's it is amazing how howthey're not just really tapping into itand again the prices are going up rightnot not only they're still beingexclusive but the prices are going upbut the inflation rate on the universitydegreeis i think it's 260 percent orand i think that 260 numbers old nowit's probably closer to 300 you know thelast 30 yearsumso it's just a lot of moneyumyou know and it it's one of those thingsthat so i think now what we're seeingis quickly you're seeing others stepinto the voiduh at least at a different at some levelgoogle google is now partnered withcoursera you can go on there and learndata science from google and you couldargue that google knows a bit about dataright maybe as much as any university ifnot moreuh and so they've got a pretty cool datascience program that you can you canlearn it for free but if you want thecertificate it's stillit's it's much more affordable thandegree and they and they're saying itcan get you a job so google's steppingin amazon's giving away a bunch foreducation as welland of course that that is also you knowit's it's part of that is of course umit is is uh you know socially beneficialbut at the same time it also isself-interested right they need morepeople to be educated to come work forthem uh both as you know both internallyand externallyumand so it's it behooves uhall these people to really you knowmicrosoft should be giving away foreducation uh all these people should bedoing that apple should be giving awayapple does have itunesuh has some stuff but there's much moregiven the amount of money they havethere's no reason as michael has said inthe past that you when you buy yourphonethere should be uh kindergarten throughphd on your phone already and you justpick your path you knowumand as a as ai develops in the in thecoming decades you know that that that'sgoing to be even more realisticas you get you know different things andagain you know it might not there'll besome people that are always going towant to overpayuh that's okayumbut then uhyou know can we reach you know as wetalked about againyou know i don't know what the data isnow but at a few years ago more peoplehad access to a phonethat had access to clean water rightuh and so so more people get that phonethe thoughts cost of the phone is comingway downumand we can and there's billions of thosedevices so the more more people we canget to learnuh economics and english and coding andwhatever umthe more you can have a rising uhsome new people looking to rise up intothe global middle classyeahabsolutely so i'm wondering what areyour thoughts on how universities adaptum do you see so so you mentioned youknow some of the smaller places mightnot keep up the big state universitiesand the big major brand nameuniversities will probably still bearoundbut how do they adjust do they justcontinue to do business as usual offerthis you know 300 000 country clubexperience to start off yourprofessional lifeand continue to find takers ordo you think they're going to changetheirmodeli think we're the tipping point wherethe consumer behavior i talked aboutearlier is starting to change people arewaking up to say wait a minute you knowthey we did everybody knows theirstudent debt and out we have over wellover a trillion dollars in student debtand the price tags are shocking i thinkthe number of people willing to go intodebt is starting to decrease you havesome you have some of the youngergeneration just saying okay i'm notgoing you knowand so now you know so now what do theydo but they have you know they have inplace uh what's called a continuing eddivisionwhere for you know almost everyuniversity has one which was kind of asecond class thing where you just earn acertificate in somethingumbut those will become more prominent umonline will continue to play a role togrow but right so far no one isdiscounting even though it's muchcheaper to deliver that online programno one's discounting that hardlyanyone's discounting the price they'restill charging full prices if you werethereuh so that's got to change for them togrowthe two largest the two fastest growinguniversities in america online areboth non-profits and both activelyencourage people to take courses fromplate people like usuh so they can lower the cost becausethey know that it can help they can helpget them over the finish line umso i think universities to survive aregoing to have to get very nimble onshort programs you know boot camps isone name for those but you can call themwhatever you wantuh and bring it make that affordable uhbecause if i can get you if you're ifyou don't want to go into the 200 000 or100 000 whatever or more debtummaybe i can get you a short program andyou get a job with that and then you canthen you can if you want to purchaseadditional education to finish thedegree you can you can do that you knowyou can do that in it so it would upendthethe traditional you know go to go to acampus at 18 and come out at 21 or 2whateverand then you're done but but againthat's already the minority of peopleas far as new students in the u.s anywayand so that's only going to accelerateand souh as more and more people are sayingi'm not i'm not going to go and i can'tgo into debt because it's just peopleare waking up to how crippling it is youknow umand and now especially now now overlaythat with what they're seeing in thelast year and a halfbetween umreddit and the wall street vets in thestock market let alone bitcoin and andwhether whether we uh uh like it or notother cryptocurrencies as welluh but just just thinking about bitcoinandand wall street betsyou know if you could if you could havespent your tuitionon gamestop and bitcoin the last fiveyears you'd be doing pretty well rightnow rightumso you know or some combination thereofso so there's a lot there's theopportunities now are quickly changingum people are starting to recognize thatyou can get jobs if you knoweven microstrategy they nowmichael's company you take exams uhassessments they don't really look atyour resume as muchand so google's google is claiming theydon't look at the resume or they don'tlook at the degree as much they'relooking at what you know how do you showwhat you know so depending on what youwant to do how do you find ways to puttogether a portfolioumand so i remember i worked in adifferent entity where i had a mentorwho used to be ceo of holly andworldwideand when i when i um when i startedfirst started working at sailor i wastalking to him about itand he said you know jeff if someonecame to me and appliedto work for meand they were equallypositioned academically etcbut one of them told me how theyused their judgmentto make better choices and save a bunchof moneyand come out to the same leveluh at a quarter of the price or whateverbecause i would hire that person everyday because that's just really soundsmart judgment and that's really reallyprofound when you've got a ceo sayingthatum and then there's a lot of ceosunderstand that that's gotta that'lltrickle down to the hr department andover time the degrees will be less andless importantumwe'll we'll still try sailor academywill still try to work on making anaffordable degree possible for a lot ofpeople because it's still something thatit won't disappearuh and and so right now the problem isit costs too much and takes too long soif we can reduce the time and the costthen maybe the degree gets some morelife for many more decades as acredential but other credentials youknow certificates um etc are quicklyrising as validas i mentioned on the talk the other daywe have people in rwandagetting a job with a sailor certificateumodds are i'll never go to rwanda but yetour work is touching someone there it'sjust that's just really profound thatyou you know another profoundimplication of the digital economy umand digitization of educationyeah it's truly amazing i think um youknow i i used to say who the next stevejobs of education is and i think uh it'suh michael saylor and you of course jeffobviously i you're uhuh you're you're playing a major part inthis and it's uh it's truly amazingbecause uhthe the the cost involved if you thoughtabout it as a businessman if you thoughtabout it from an entrepreneurialperspective of how do i deliver the mostvaluethere's just so much room forimprovement it's like you're walkinginto a soviet uhministry andyou know all you got to do is justhave a little bit of discipline in thereand there's so many there's so muchimprovement soumyou know i i wanted to uh run somenumbers to illustrate this point withyou to get an idea about uhhow much it costs to get a studentthrough sailor.org versus thetraditional university model so first ofall uh the most important number perhapsis that sailor.org is about to hit 1million studentsin the next few weeksandprobablyi don't think there's any university inthe world that has graduated a millionstudents probably in its lifetime theremight be some but i don't think thereare manyumdo you know about that do you thinkthere are universities that have given amillion degreesthat's interesting i don't knowuh you know it's a small number eachyear even if you've been around for athousand years yeah i don't know that'sa great question umand you know and we and we you knowlet's do and i don't want to overstateour in fact uhyou know not everyone's taking 50courses with us you know some are takinga handful uhthat number uh we're by the way we're at987 651 as a 10 minutes agoumandumand so but it's there you know and soso you have this opportunity for peopleto take what they need that's the otherthing right is in the past we made youbuyfor you you had to buy two years or fouryears rightuh now we're saying we you can buy onecourse you can buy or you can actuallyfor us get it for freeum or you can take 10 you can take 30 40whatever you need and come you knowcobble together your own pathway umthere's a gentleman and also completionrates are kind of interesting as welland one story i'd like to point outthere's a gentleman in india he wantedto take something called the gate examwhich was the e stands for gate as anacronym the e stands for engineering iforget the rest but he wants to takethis engineering acceptacceptance exam to get himself intoschooling in india just several yearsagoand he figured out that on our site ifhe took pieces of different coursesthat he could prepare himself for thatexam we didn't have the work jade examanywhere near our website we didn't knowit existed umbut he found his own way now so heactually didn't complete a single fullcourse with us yet he got everything heneeded by doing bits and pieces ofdifferent courses to prepare himself soso that's a win too right um even if wedon't count them and come out with acredential at the end that we recognizeso so so we open ourselves up to youknow people just coming and reading andlearning which is lovelyand of course we do want to credentialas many people as we canbecause we know it helps umand you didn't think about so cost wiseyou know i thinkright now this year we'll spend about 2million dollarsum but you know some of that is onyou know it's just not you know you knowvery little on marketing i got a couplemarketing assistants but umbut most of that is based is spent onyou know um updating the courses thevast majority of our spend is thereuh when you look at you know humanresources uhand andboth internal and external throughcontractor professors etcumso we don't have we don't have a lot oftheyou know you can effectively eliminate alot of costs right being online makestotal sense um but we also don't evenhave even a lot of online schools have abunch ofextra bureaucracy so even when we moveto university status somedayyou know we'll we'llwe're going to do it carefully and addin you know a few you know we have tohave a few roles that sound like atraditional university like right nowi'm looking i'm filling a role forthedirector of academic affairs and soevery university has a vp of academicaffairs so so we'll put some things inplace like that that will help us dobetter uh but also and help usas we try to get the traditional systemto recognize usand we're not really you know we don'tlive or die on traditional acceptance orrecognitionuh but at the same time it will behelpful to the students as we uh youknow because this transition that we'vebeen talking about in thisdiscussion is still is happening in realtime right so not everyonethat everyone is looking at not everyemployer understands the certificatesyet you know and all that stuff but it'scoming um and so to help bridge the gapwe are looking for the recognition forthe traditional system but yeah cost uslet's say we stay at 2 million a yearfor a while umyou know that's way less operating costis way less than a lot of universitiesand of course now with you know our oursite is hosted on amazonservers and so if our student if ourstudents double tomorrowand we go let's say we wake up tomorrowand it's two million um our cost atamazon does not double right it takeswould you have to the student cost andthe and the to get the server cost to goup we'd have to have i don't know 10x orsomething like that students are andeven then it doesn't go you know it'sit's very incrementalso once you've got it up once you haveyour model downthe cost of adding more and scaling outit's reallynext to nothing and and umand so our hope is that you knowit's kind of weird like right now we'vegot 1.4 million followers onfacebookbut facebook wants to charge me money tosend them to to send them a message andhave a new courseright um so i'm not paying facebook forthat right now i'm just saying i'mputting up the free and now we're doingour best to surface and encourage theword of mouth from students of coursewe've got nowyou've got tools like twitter and andpodcasts like this and other platformsandbut uh the big the biggest thing and nowwe live in the social economy sowe're seeing more and more students uhat different levels really you know somepeople thank you for learning my firstenglish orpeople who have advanced degrees sayingoh wow i never took this course and i'mamid-level manager i took this now i feellike i've learned something new that'sgoing to help my career and and thosetwo extremes and everybody in betweenand so we can scale to meet a lot ofpeople's needs and i don't know if we'llbe the silver bullet for everybody but ithink we have at least something foreverybodyuhjust bitcoin in your course aloneeverybody should take right uh and thenand then umthe other coursesyou know someone might take one or twoor they might take another 50 whateveruh we don't care that's the media that'sthe beauty of our model as well rightwe're not trying to sell you a bigpackage that you may or may not needyeah that's uh incredibly refreshing umincidentally i wanted to mention whenyou were talking about the exorbitantopportunity cost of university um yeah ithink you know universe in universitytextbooks on economics they barelydiscuss the concept of opportunity costand i think it's because if you reallyforce students to think aboutopportunity cost criticallythe first thing they'll do is quituniversity and go take their money anddo something else with itand one of theyeah and one of the uh one of the one ofmy favorite genres of twitterof my twitter account is whenever i seea university professor um callingbitcoin a scami'll i should start doing this moreoften incidentally i go through theiruniverse i look at you at theiruniversity's website and figure out howmuch the tuition is and then i calculatehow much you would have had if you wentto their university five years agohow much money you would have spent ontuition and then if you hadn't gone tothat university and instead put thatmoney in bitcoin how much money you'dhave today and so i i i ran the numberson krugman and i dug up the tweet rightnow i ran the numbers on krugman thiswas at the beginning of the yearso i did academic years that startuh 26 2017 2018 2019. so you would havegraduated in 2020so you'd have uh graduated a year agofrom nowand that's very recent so we're not eventalking about you know buying uh earlybitcoin this is 2016. if you had uhspent that money on tuition you wouldhave spent about two hundred andthousand dollars on tuition to graduateuh a year agoum but you would have a hundred andseven bitcoin right now and that's worthfive million dollarsrightholy cowyeswhich is way more than the averageamerican who goes in that debt will havefor retirementpretty much yeah and i think uh 5million i think you know the averageyale graduate and this is yale we'retalking about here um i'm guessing theyneed at least a decade to earn that umif they're lucky and uh you know that umi think bitcoin is just going to forceeverybody to learn about opportunitycost it's um you know the internet ingeneral is going to teach people a lotof things because people get exposed toall kinds of umcontent that's different from what theiruniversity would have given them but ithink also thethe existence of bitcoin and the factthat bitcoiners are always running thenumbers in your face and trying toexplain this to you is just going toforce people to become much moreruthless with how they think about theiropportunity costs and i thinkuniversitiesstand to losesignificantly from thisit's interesting on that point as youknow we have this devon lavera coursebitcoin for everybody on our site and umwe're very close so we've i've convinceda and it's really a it's really a softsell but it was where i'm now convinceda few dozen universities to now offertheir students our courses for free likeactively encouraged so we and now we'reseeing in india in particular some otherplaces umare actively encouraging students theirstudents to take our courses and we seethe students like oh my gosh i'velearned so much it's sort of it's reallyit's really a self-indictment rightbut in some ways but at the same time wedon't like to view it that way because iwant these people to partner with me toget more peopleand even those students aren't trulyunderserved but they're good models whenthey share the certificates the otherpopulists in the country sees it andhopefully that helps get the word outbut i bring that up because we're ican't name the name but we're about tosign with the university and they get tosay they also ask us to create a landingpage so when their students come to usthey see their logo and one of thecourses they recommendas you know india has either either hashas been flirting with banning bitcoinrightum or at least at least we have variousaspects of it and umso it's very it was very interesting tosee this university we're about to signwith the top courts that they'verecommended putting on therecommendation is the bitcoin foreverybody course so it's really kind ofinteresting to see a university indiauniversity umso hopefully that'll be live that thatagreement will be live in a few weeksand we'll make that pointbut it's very very interesting right umbut yeah there's a opportunity cost ishuge and by the way when we talked aboutcosts earlier we also forgot about thecost of the new textbooks right uh youhave 1200 you know what depending onwhich subject and if you buy it new orused or what have youbut um so let's just keep that aside butyou know there's there's umthere's so much you can learn there'sand you know againi listen when i listen toyou and michael saylor and a lot ofdifferent people talking i've learned alot umyou know i i'm i'm i'm not embarrassedat all to say that two saturdays ago iactually ended upfrom nine o'clock to eleven o'clock onsaturday night listening to two hours ofuh bitcoin and economics related podcastbecause it was justit was justreally enthralling and all this newstuff for me i've learned a lot in thelast year and a halfum but there's still much more to learnright and andyou think about it really helps you inmany ways right because you think aboutbitcoin or you think about economics andthe way you talk about itit really influences you to think abouta lot of things differently right andand think about first order thinking andall kinds of differentdifferent things and so it's you knowi'vei've i've had success uh in some waysand i've figured some things out butthere's just a lot more i needed tolearn as well you know and souh it's exciting it's an exciting timeand i think so despite a lot of problemsin the worldumthere are many but you know it'sexciting to seethe digital transformation both of moneyof everything else as michael likes tosay and now including education so we'reseeingyou know umyou know peopleeverywhere uh you know havingopportunities and you know what you'llprobably see students doing right andthey're already doing is they're theywill bundlethey might take a low cost coursewith a udemy uh or another provider likethat and then take some sailor coursesfor free and maybe they find a way toto buy some certificates from courseraas well then now they've put togethertheir own five to ten course packetpathway that where they've learneda bunch of stuffmaybe they've learned all about pythonand data scienceand umand they've spent very little money andthey're probably job ready you know andnow slowly more employers arerecognizing it and also giving them theopportunity to show what they know rightand of course there's the startupeconomy of course there's also thethat's just the stark economy butthere's also the umthe freelance economy right the gigeconomy as they call here but um sopeople can create their own you know ifyou learn data linuxthere's a whole bunch of businesses thatneed your services that don't know howto do it rightuh and so if you learn if you learn howto do google ads there's a bunch ofbusinesses that need your service thatdon't know how to do it there's a wholebunch of things you can learnumand so so for for low prices or next tozero or at zero depending you're doingit with so it's just really exciting tosee that talk about efficiency tooum not just on cost and bureaucracy butbut uh we have a the professor who builtour python our python coursehe um is also building outa um as soon as he was done i said whatelse you got do you have anythingrelated to data science well i could dotight time for data science i said donea week later he started so jeffyou know we had a conversation a weeklater i started the courses at that myat my university that teaches thatfull-timethat would have taken anywhere from sixto 12 months to get approval to buildthat new courseand we've now we'll have it out uh hereand hopefully and or hopefully by theend of september it should be outso so we can move uh fast or faster we'dlike to move you know michael likes tomove really fast um we can't always keepup with his speed butbut we're trying our best and um so youknow we'll probably deliverone to two courses and one to two newcourses a month you know for a whileand at some point we'll accelerate anddo more but umyou know we've got a lot there and we'vegot some really cool things that othersdon't have like your course andand the bitcoin for everybody course andand some and we're also working on someuh i can't name names but are very wellsome very well known bitcoin people areworking onuh some developer courses with us thatand we might have one of those ready bythe end of september certainly not byoctober so that's exciting as wellfantastic yeah i think you know thepoint you mentioned on uheducation for uhyou know employers is uh is an enormousefficiency you know google knows exactlywhat they want from the data scientistsand the university is just an enormouslywastefuluh middleman they're going to teach thema bunch of bunch of math and a bunch ofcomputer science and a bunch ofstatisticsum but they're going to teach them awhole bunch of other stuff that is notreally relevant to the job and i thinkum you know the internet is not justallowing us tocommunicate quicker and send each otherthe videos of the lecture quickerit's also allowing people to demonstratetheir competence directly withoutneeding accreditation i think this isreally this is a very important thinglike you don't need to look at people'suhwell 200 years ago you neededsome kind of way of knowing that thiscomplete stranger that you can't googleshowing up at your office and asking fora job that they have some kind ofsomething that says they have somediscipline they have somemental capabilities they won't steal youand going to university for four yearsand hanging around with a bunch ofprofessors and books and surviving andgetting a a degree that says that youdid it is a pretty goodcommunicator of value but todaythat's not really the case anymorebecause whatever the job is you knowthey canthey can test you online they can offeryoua trial they can get you to do a part ofa job and see how you workand that just obsoletes all of the uhcredentialist nonsense sothinking back on the numbers you weresaying about two million dollars runningcost per yearand i think during themichael seder conversation on spaces youmentioned that it wassomething like 5 000 students a week aresigning upcorrectyeah so that's about a quarter millionstudents every year signing up for twomillion dollars so it's about tendollars a student rightyesyeahyeah and so even if we said um let's saytwo percent of these students uh aregetting a university degree uh or auniversity degree equivalent stickingaround and taking a lot of coursesuh that's still a hundred bucks if wesaid it's uh one percent of thosestudents that'll bea thousand bucksso no wait 50 would be uhuh wait i messed up the numbers we isaid it's ten dollars per uh studentrightif we had if we had uh if we had aquarter million let's say it's tendollars per student but thenif we only had uh10 or one percent of these then it wouldbe a hundred foldso it'll be a thousand bucks of studentsso it's a thousand dollars per degreefor a university degree which uh issomething like fifty thousand dollars oruh at leastten thousand dollars there are very fewuniversities in the world now where youcan get a uha degree for less than ten thousanddollars per year and whereas here we'retalking about a thousand dollars overthe full four yearsso the improvementsorry go aheadand that's our cost not the studentsrightyeah absolutely um sothe improvement is i think uh50x in terms of cost at to be extremelyconservative 100xmore likely uh several multiples of thatseveral hundred times the multiple of uhthe cost that you can deliver it withand it's uh it's astounding it'sastounding thatthat you can pull it off but what thatmeans is that it's much more astoundinghow others are not interested in thisyou know you'd thinkthey'd be all over thisyou you would you know but again they'vehad they've had that luxury of beingspoiled just just like the musicexecutives were spoiled foreveroh no what you know people are going tolove their lps they're going to buy cdsforever they're going to buy thisthey're going to buy thatuh and then they didn'tright yes so at some point umyou know there's that uhbitcoin phrase gradually was itgraduated suddenly is that the phrase umuh i think you're seeing that here aswell and so at some point it's already ithink you're already starting to seesome peopleof more people publicly saying i'm nottaking that debt on no way and and thenthey're figuring out different thingsand so that'll that'll acceleratebecause because we one thing we knowit's trueoverall anyway the prices are not goingto go downum that's just that's just not going tohappen um you might have some thingshere and there but overall thatcost of that four-year traditionaldegree is going to continue to go upand soit does you know how do we find ways toget around that how do we find otheropportunities and again you know we'rewe love the 5 000 new students a weekbutwe also hope at some point you knowuh the right people retweet us and theright peopletell their citizens about usif i'm a governor i take credit for thisright you know in maryland so i live igrew up near a little town in marylandabout a half hour north of baltimorebaltimore is you know a troubled town inmany waysuh there's a lot of great people therethough and right nearby is a greatuniversity called the university ofmaryland global campuswell a student can come to us and gettwo years two years for freeand transfer into that schoolor they can do it at the same time youcould enroll there and take courses withthat do it at the same time you canstill get two years worth of freetuition creditsuh yet i can't get the mayor to talkabout us i can't get the newspaperbaltimore's son to tellanyone about jessit's just like you know they're eitherthey don't believe it or they can'tunderstand it or there's some otheragenda right um where they're decidingnot to tell people about for educationum and i think i mentioned on the otherday in dc it's illegal to give away foreducation um they're not reallyenforcing it but it is on the booksand so talk about government overreachumi think you know i was all excited tomaybe break out my law degree and do afirst amendment case butwe didn't have to do that we chased themaway when they came to our officetelling us it was illegal but umyou know it's just interesting to seethat it's here it can be doneyou know others are doing it googlegoogle will probably certify thousandsand thousands of people this year invarious things amazon will do the samethen next year it'll be tens ofthousands and it'll go up and thenothers will start doing it right umand so andyou'll and every professor like whatyou've done every professor is abusiness if they want it right umthey can open up professorjones.com andteach cyber security whatever theirspecialty is and and maybe they have youknow and you know and they might have wemight have that free course but there'sother add-ons like you you do theseminars and all the other add-ons thatare worth paying a hundred dollars orwhateverum so again you don't have to choosenecessarilyone over the other but if you cancombine them in smart waysyou could do really well you knowyeah absolutelyum daniel is asking what is the averageage of the students coming to sailor.orgdo you have that uhnumber do you know yeah so so by underbecause of all the international privacyrules we don't allow anyone to enrollit's under 16uh however why don't we don't block youright anyone can so anyone have anywayscan read but but we don't collect thedata uh we don't ask them for that butwe've but throughthrough voluntary stuff we've figuredout it's probably in in the late 20searly 30s is the average age umbut we have plenty of people who are youknow in their late teens but we havesome people in 30 40 50 years oldbecause you know i you know look at me igot myfoundational college degree uh and igraduated 1993 that's many years ago nowthere's a whole bunch of things i needto learn i haven't learned data sciencedata analyticsfor oneso you know everybody on the planetneeds continuing education uh everyonethat's working i should say needs itbecause there's new things happening youknow umand and so umyou knowright now i think our average age isright probably right around 30. uh giveor take you know something on the otherside but that's that's more that's moreanecdotal through umyou know analytics we get from twitterand from from facebook and from otherplaces but because we don't directly askthe question because it's not relevantto us other than saying you must be 16to so we cannot adhere to privacy lossbut otherwise umyou know it's right around that but wewelcome anybodyfantasticall right um stefano has a questionabout grading an assessmentdo you want to go ahead stefano yeahyeah thank you save and thank you jefffor this very interesting presentationso my question is the following i'mcurious to know what what do you thinkaboutthe difference of assessing students umwhen you take an in-person course versusonline and i ask this question because iremember when i was in collegeor as you mentioned michael went to mitit's reasonably to expect thatif you get a good grade in a programmingclass at mit for example you know how toprogram uh but in my experience at leastwhen i took a fewintroductory classes online many yearsago the assessment was very superficialusually it was a multiple choicequestion that honestly wasn't reallyevaluating much so what are yourthoughts on thatwell that's a great question and i thinkyou're right sometimes it can go thatwaywe spend a they could even tell you wespend a lot of time on our assessmentsand we we put the professors through aa bit of an some of them haven't haven'treally done multiple choice in the wayyou need to do it there's a lot ofstudies that show that if you domultiple choice correctly it canactually be just as rigorous and morefair because even an essay exam in aplace like where i went to school youknow the teacher knows my handwriting ifi'm a good you know if she likes meyou know she may subconsciously give mean extra 10 without realizing it rightumbut umyou know so we think so we think so inlaw school when i went to law school ihad we had one assessment and it wasblinduh however even even in an essay you canyou can write certain things and you mayhave said something in class that thatprofessor remembers and you write thatin your exam and that might trigger thati thought oh yeah this is jeff he'sgoing to give him yeah he's good i likeyou know umbut you know there's data that shows andstudies that show if you do it right amultiple choice assessment can be can beequally as effective a lot of medicalschools are moving to it exclusively totake out bias and keep the rigor uh oncomputer science though we also now havesomething called code runnerwhich if you take our python courseyou're actually going to get somequestions wherethe code and the code runner will gradeyour code and to make sure you're doingit rightso that's kind of cool and so soso there's more that can be done uh andwe're we're looking to improveassessments all the time but we do thinkuh ours are fairly rigorous and in factyou know you'll see thatsome of our courses there's a 50 passrate or 60 pass rate so because peopleare finding it's difficult but um andsome people decide to try to take thetest on the first day without taking thecourse and have to go back and okay yeahi really don't know it but it's a goodquestion uh we're trying to improve itbut i think i think you could if you doit right you can do automated assessmentat a high level so that you can trulyshow what somebody knowsand a quick follow-up jeff if you don'tmind yeahi mean what i'm realizing and i thinkit's becoming probably more and moreobvious that a very important skill iscommunication you may be verytechnically savvy you can know theprogramming stuff you can all thetechnical details but ultimately if youcannot communicate if you cannotpersuade uh it doesn't really do verygood to you right and at least when iwas in college many many years ago i'maround this image as you a veryimportant part of the assessment wasgiving oral exams where you had topresent talk on you know on impromptlywithout really having any uh preparedquestions before and i noticed that alot of the people that come out ofcollege today because they are using amultiple choice format they really don'tknow how to communicate how toarticulate their ideas rightit's both how to organize your ideas butalso how to express and how tocommunicate whether it's orally or in apowerpoint presentation or even an emailso what are your thoughts about that areyou planning to offer some classes to beable to addressum this need and um yeah just curious toknow what you thinki think you're right communication isone of those skills that no matter whichit's a foundational skill that no matterwhat sector you go into you have to haveit rightum and so we do have multiplecommunication courses we have a courseon presentationsum you know the challenge for us i knowwe don't havethe ability to get a person to watchyour speech right right now but but aiis coming and i will watch it soon butwhat we can do though is teach you thefundamentals of public speaking and sayhey look put a youtube video up and haveyour peerstell you if you're doing any doing wellor not you know um or you can beconfident about it and uh and then youcan attach that video you attach a salespresence let's say you're gonna be asalesman uh you attach that salespresentation to your to your digitalresumeyou know and so you can actually showand you know here's my link here's medoing a pitch on on why you should buyan apple iphoneuh or whateverand umsomeone can see you in action right soso we we agree that communication iscritical we we have multiple courses onthat front professional writingtechnical writing uh multiple humancommunication group communicationintercultural communications coming outuh so we have a bunch of things likethat that are we think are important uhso you're dead on and then we're doingour best to try to figure out how toassess it better or at least finddifferent ways for people to show whatthey know right so can they demonstrateit through a presentation they createdwhether that'syou know a slideshow or whether that'san a an old-fashioned speechuh or some combination thereofokaythank you jeff really appreciate thatthis isvery interesting and fascinating thankyou yeah thank you for your questionyeah i think stefano's questionuhi think stefano's question uhleads to something else that i wanted toask you which isdo you i thinkwould you agree thatthere seems to besome advantage for some credits and somekind of courses that are not very easyto teach online and i thinkum perhaps in a sane world in whichuniversities were competitivea lot will be done online but i thinkyou know there might be a few classeswhere you turn upand you have the uhphysical stuff you know thephysical interaction which is necessaryso one of these is uh you knowlearning to talk and communicate andpresent and uh speaking to an audience ithink a classroom is useful for that ithink another one is obviously medicineit's still going to be useful tocut up human beings and then mostsciences that involve laboratory workthat's probably useful that's going toneed to staybutwhat else do you think and do do youthink these can beturned online as well or do you thinkthere are many others what are yourthoughts on that well let's go back tolast friday when you and i were onspaces with michael that right yes uh onless than one day's notice 3 900 peopleshowed up including a bunch of verifiedtwitter accounts and and one of those ofcourse was jack dorsey and umand what what if that what if we turnthat into a speech class and we gaveeveryone five minutes umand we come up on stage right you tookthe speech course on our site now comeup on stage and make your speech and youknow and you might get feedback fromsomeone like jack dorsey or whoeverwhoever's listening it um that'd beinteresting to see what we could do onthat front um for public speaking rightbecause that's a forum where you need tohave it um you've got youtube all thatkind of stuff i agree with you thatgetting up in front of an actual peoplestill is is is an important skill so itmay not be a monopoly it may not be youknow it may be one of those things thatyou you you try to do you want to dothat as well but there might be otherways to do it umyou know yeah i want i want you know gumgum surgery you want to practice that ona person right um now i say theold-fashioned bio bio 101 frog lab wherewe all dissected the frog i mean thatthere's a lot of lessons in that that gobeyond identifying the parts of coursebut but at the same time nowyou've got really lovely onlinepresentations for that and so so so alot of the basic you know first-year bioand chemistry things can be done onlineuh and you know an ai is just gettingstarted right umso sosoonand also different ways tomanipulate 3d presentations of differentthings so there's going to be a lot ofthings you could you could see comingalongand of course there'll be things thatare hybrid but also think abouteconomies of scale and efficiencyyou know it's the best algebra you knowfor example in mississippi i talked tosomeone down there they don't have a lotofphysics teacherswellwhy not get the best physics person inyour state or maybe the best physicsperson in the countryto do to to do live lecturesuh and then you have the other teacherscan be can be helping out in person onthe sideso you could you could beam that youknow now some schools don't have it atall you could beam that physicspresentation to each of those schoolsand have the students studying on theirown uh with or with alocal mentorso there's a lot you know there's justso many opportunities right that canhappenuh i think you're right there's gonna bethings that are gonna be hard to moveonline things we probably don't want tomove online uh but then that also allowsyou know if you if youif you if you focus there umyou can you can get rid of a lot ofbureaucracy and andincrease your efficiency even if you area traditional university so i meanthere's a bunch of things that could bedone i think we'll see more of it umand you know it's just as it's justgonna accelerate here in the comingyearsyeah well that's very good to hearumum nathan has got a question nathan wantto go aheadhi nathanyeah jeff uh i wondered if you couldcomment onyour editing process for for developingyour courseofferingsumwhat i'm driving at is i know you justhad safe teams offering the austrianeconomicsi took i can't tell you how manykinsey and economics classes i've takeni wish i had never taken a single one itwas i didn't learn anything from themare you going to offer those kinds ofclassesandare you going to makeare you going to make a commentary aboutthathow how are you going to edit andmanage yourselvesyeah i get it that's a great question soso you're you're talking also you'rethinking your your question is broaderthan just editing right it'sumyes so and so yes we we actually aremore more governanceyeah fair enough well you know luckilyfor us you know we're pretty flat youknow i i you know michael can michaelcan text me at any moment you know andtell me i want a new course on this orthatuh and uh and we go do it but uhbut then also um we do have we do havekeynesian-based economics on our sitebecause that's what the universities inamerica are teaching so we have thoseactuallyumand and i think it's you know we i thinkinstead of just doing a commentary aboutiti think we're making a pretty bigstatement just by offering this courserightumsafety economics course right next tothem right so when you go on our siteyou'll see econ you know microeconomicsand macronomics and right next to ityou'll seeuh safety's austrian economics if youguy ii understand you know umwere talking a little bit about it uh onthe podcast the other day the austrianis a bit of a misnomer because it'sreally classical economics et cetera andlisten you talk i wonder if if weshouldn't call your course humaneconomics what do you think of that wecall it human economics versusaustrian or something like that to toto to also differentiate butjust kind of riffing a little bit onthat but yeahbut but because it's it's reallyinteresting because you know they're uhyou know we had there was some internaldiscussion we have we had a personwho was like wait a minute this is notan economics course there's no math init youand knowand of coursethat's partially true but same timeyou know the obvious resort iswell if you do the math wrong all thetime or if the math doesn't really tellyou anything what good does it do rightumand so so so you so we had you knowthere we so so the internal got you knowhad this been a traditional universityuh a lot of a lot of universities thiscourse wouldn't see the light of dayright because the faculty senate wouldvote it downumbut but we don't have that becausemichael saylor says oh gosh here's thisgreat guy out here jeff go meet sapadinesymphony's got some great courses let'sgo convert those to ours and we put youknow and that wasn't quite as simple aswe thought we we still put a bunch ofwork you know safety and steam put abunch of work inwith a couple of our people to get it uhyou know even though it's mostly thesame there's still some there's somecrew thereand matching and that stuff so so you'reright it's an interesting governancequestion uh about what we offer and soto that end at seven previewed the otherday we've got two more courses comingfrom himumi also uhwe signed a contract with anotherwell-known author in the space i don'tknow if he wants me to say his name yetbut so that's coming uh it's related tomonetary history umand so by putting these out um that justalone is making a statement yeah and andyou know and then we'll let peopleso you know we don't we don't tell youtake this course versus that course weput them all up and you're gonna findyour wayuh but you know what you're seeingalreadyas i mentioned there's a thousand peoplein this course already a thousand andseven is a few minutes ago umuh and that's just in two weeks and soas those people we already we are and wethis morning uh we tweeted i think safecell already we tweeted out a lovelyendorsement by a student already who'sbeen through the whole thing from the ukand and really gave a nice endorsementso we tweeted that out so soi haven't had anyone give a really niceendorsement of the regular economicscourse i don't believeumand i or regular i should assign theright word traditional whateverkeynesian umand so umit's you know it's it's uhjust by doing it i think we're making abit of a statement i'll say thatis that fairyes thank you uma comment on the on thephysical classroom presenceyes sir there are so many labs andresearch labs chemistry labsbiology labsresearch stations strung across theunited statesthat i i don't see thatit seemsvery plausible and easy to justhave atwo-monthlab sessionkansas university just down the streethere as a lab i just don't need kansasuniversityall i need is the lab and a teacherwell that's right you might you mightsee that right you might see that so wewe we and there are some schools that wedo that with now so our biology courseis recommended for three credits butmany schools require four credits rightso you some people takingthe non-lab portion with us and theytake the lab locally and they save youknow save a thousand bucks doing thatumand so you'll see more of that right andyou might see and you might see now youalso now you're fitting on a businessmodel rightmaybe maybe you open up a lab franchisewhere you're offering chemistryexperiments toto to kids to learnyou know uh petroleum engineering orwhatever you knowthat's where i was driving yes exactlyit needs to justit needs to go free market i thinkyou're right you i think you're rightthat at some point you could see umyou know and and it's already builtright so if i if i'm the university i'mlooking for some additional revenuethere's an opportunity right ora business could do that lots of peoplecould deliver that so it's aninteresting uh i think you're startingyou're starting to see the unbundling ofthings there's another thing you'llstart to see in university offeringsyeah they're they're like kansasuniversity right here i read the numbersbecause they're closeand the square feet of uhthe square footage of structure they'vegot that's just going to wasteis scary but the real problem with it iskeeping it alive you got to sweep it andair condition it eat itshovel the snow it's tearing them upyeah and i think natalie sent a messageto the group uh about trades i thinkthat's right natalie you'll havecarpentry and different things that arestill going to have to be doneonline but but even even theirsupplement there when i when i want tolearn to build something or i putsomething together or fix my car i oftenlook on youtube and i often see a videoon how to do it rightum i still have to do it physically buti still can get supplemental there tohelp me when i get to the when i get tothe physical space so you can do a lotof the prep timeuh and a lot of the learning uhand maybe cut down a bit on you know foreven in some of those areas that reallydo require the tactile in personyeah i mean i think there's uhthere's a lot of value for theface-to-face interaction but uhpeopleyou know if you think about it in termsof opportunity costyou can see where the case can be madefor um you know you're missing out on alittle bit of the uha personal interaction but you'regaining umyou know you're saving up in costs andin time enormouslyand i think what people miss with thisis um a lot of thea lot of things that people associatewith university they think you know ifyouif you if you learn online then you'regoing to be locked in a cage and are notallowed to interact with othersbut on the contrary when you don't haveto waste your time and your money on adegree that you could learn forpractically free online well then youhave a lot more money to go out and meetpeople and network and invest in yourbusiness and actually make good progresswith your businessso it's it'syou know the opportunity cost is veryhelpful in trying to think abouteconomic decisions and people kind ofhave this idea that you know if you missthe fun college years if you miss theparty experience from 18 to 22 that'sgoing to set you back for life if youdon't uh spend a lot of time partyingand with the same group of people over acouple of yearsthat's going to be a massive handicapbut i don't believe it iswell and think about this too so let'sjust put the covet and all the thatstuff aside for a minute and hopefullyat some point we'll be back in fullinteraction with peoplebut you know we had an office in what'scalled wework are you familiar withwework theshared space modeland i you know it was it became it'svery obvious so in just in just in ourlocation there were well over 100companies of various sizes largecompanies were present as well as smallones it's non-profits etcso if you know you could if a studentcould buy a single person membershipjust to come in not even for a dedicateddesk just to come into the space andhang out and use the free spaceum you could come to the happy hoursthereyou could network with a hundredbusinesses and you could go in thecorner and study coding or whatever youwantedonline you could actually you know thinkabout the salons and i think about youknow ancient greece where people wouldstand on the street and lecture rightand you'd hang out so so what are themodern salons what are the modern placesto hang out you know twitter spaces isone uh accent you know and and um andall that stuff but alsoyou have now you know the hybrid worksplaces are going to be hybrid learningplaces if they're not already um andbecause if i'm a university i'm puttingsomething in there i'm going to open upan officei'm going to offer some free stuff andthen i'll then i'll then i'll market youmy my other paid stuff while you'rethere right or but or if i'm a boot campi'll combine with with some place thathas a lot of people in it um so you'llsee i think one thing as things returntoum pre-covet uh or i should saypre-lockdown or pre-pre-restrictionsumi think you're gonna see more of that aswellabsolutelyall right uh well my um marquita in thechat is suggesting that you shouldcollaborate with uh miami mayor francissuarezhe seems to be all about that stuff andhe's into bitcoin and uhi think he might uh he might beinterested in thisi have two we have tweeted at him and uhi think michael knows him michael's amiami beach resident uh nearbyuh obviously and you know and and we hadlike i said we have pending uh now uhbefore the florida independentcommission for licensing aoffering for a free mba degree if i'mthe miami mayor i'd love to tell myconstituents that we have a free mbaum you know offered by one of the topceos in the world uhuh michael probably doesn't like mesaying that but you know he's prettyhe's a pretty sharp guy and uh and youknow and also too just to talk about youknow what let me talk about the mbaprogram i can't recruit for it yetbecauseuh i don't have the license but i cantell you what it's going to be like umthat's not recruiting rightwe've had 30 phds work on this alreadywe've had a handful ofnba holders as well all of whom havetaught extensively and all of whom havebusiness experience as wellso it'll beuh very ethics oriented it'll be verydata oriented and very sustainabilityoriented umand so that's kind of interesting uh aswell and it'll be freeand then if we get that approval thenthen we have the ability to start okaywhat do we build next and now now thatwe know how to do it let's go build thestatistics masters and let's go build aand maybe maybe we i'm even thinkingaboutyou know michael often talks about youknow you need a billion another anotherbillion phds to solve the world problemsumand but you can't there's no way youknow we don't have the time and money todo it the old-fashioned wayso i have a professional degree i have ajuris doctorate so i have a doctorate injurisprudence but it's not aresearch-based degree so that's why it'scalled a professional degree right sowhat if we created professional degreesin data science and inin analytics and statistics and whathave you uh so that we could offer aprofessional page a professionaldoctorate of that subject and we couldautomate probably 90 percent of that andthe other or 99 of that and the otherone percent we could reduce the cost byby 99uh so there's a lot of things we can doonce we get the you know and we'llprobably do it anyway with or withoutthe state and that creditor blessing butwe want to try to get the blessingsfirst so it so it we can helppeople understand the transitionumand and you know once we do that once weget that to go the sky's the limit umand so in fact you know we're offeringif you're not ready on day oneuh we've got all the you know for thenba we've got all the free courses andundergrad to lead you there umso sowe think that's an interesting model andone that we think um we can replicate inother areas once we get the licensingfantastic yeah that's uhthat's all very encouraging stuffum all right anybody else have any uhquestions they would like to ask jeffthis is pretty much all i had anythingelse you'd like to add jeffwell just thank you and you know againwe're excited to offer you knowa different viewpoint than a lot ofpeople have offering you know i thinkthe way you break downthe economics and the human action andwhen i know you're building on youryou're standing on the shoulders ofothers who've done that at the same timei think the way you present it is veryinterestingand it's just another you know to beable to offer that in addition to thebitcoin for everybody course the pythoncourse in addition to the whatevercourse i think you know criticalthinking i made sure we had on the sitewe didn't have it for a while we hadsome people saying you couldn't do ityou couldn't do it you can't do criticalthinking online well not only did we doit but now it's recommended for collegecredit by that body i mentioned earlierthe american council of education uh sowe found a way to do it uh and do itwell enough where a lot of people thinkit's worth college credit umso you know keep stay you know weappreciate uh all the supportuh from the bitcoin community inparticular but but umbecause know we see people retweetingour stuff and sending our links topoliticians and policymakers uh and allthat stuff and so we want umand again we don't necessarily need theendorsement of all the politicians orany of the politicians but at the sametime some of them have a constituencyand it would behoove themif you believe in fiscal responsibilityyou should tell your constituentsbecause it's low cost if you believe inaccess well we've got that too we've gotthe access equity covered because wedon't i don't care we don't care whereyou're fromwe don't care what you look like youknow you come on and you learn and ifyou do it well we give you a certificateuh and hopefully a degree soon soyou know stay tuned we're you knowyou're in some we've been around for adecade but i think that a lot of thatwas finding our way and then we foundour way i think we're just starting tohit um i think we're pre-stride we'reabout to hit our stride and i think thatumyou know we you know and andand safe here we're so excited you'realong for forwith us on at least at some level thereand more to come with a couple morecourses so umyou know thank you for that thank youfor jumping in for this experiment withus and umyou know we're just excited to keep seewhere it goes rightabsolutely thank you and yeah i i iwanted to mention this during thediscussion i also have the feeling thatyou guys are on thecusp of hitting your stride i think youknow getting to the million landmark isjust going toumget a lot of people to pay attention andalso i think you know all of the uhbitcoin related stuff and michael'sincreased profile around bitcoin andbitcoin's growing uh growinglyincreasing profile it's just going tocontinue to suck people in i you know wedid we like toliken bitcoin to a black hole becauseit's just sitting there and everybodygets drawn into it and once they'redrawn into that hole they just go thereand they don't come outandover time that black hole just continuesto engulf more things and growand so uh i think um sailor.org is uhis similar it's kind of tied to bitcointhanks to michael uh being so investedin both and i think it speaks volumesabout the fact that he findsthose two things to be so interestingand so passionate for him because ithinki agree with him on the fact thatthey truly areworld changing and i think uhhopefully yeah i think it'll uh it'llpick up very quickly over the nextcouple of years i hope sowell this is great um thanks toeverybody uh for asking questions andnatalie i saw your message as well uhthank you for thatand umyou know i i you know love to come backanother time maybe when we havesomething else to do to offer and andand of course uh safe we look to hostpost you again on spaces and not toodistant future absolutely thank you verymuch take care jeff thank you guysbye[Music]you",
