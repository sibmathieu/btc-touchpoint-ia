the nutrition coalition and theauthor of the big fat surprisean excellent book on diet and nutritionwhichhas been enormously successful it wasnamedbest book of the year by the economistthe wall street journal forbes motherjones and library journal as well as afinalist for the investigative reportersand editors annual book awardpublished in 2014 i should add sevenyears on her book continues toattract a lot of attention cause a lotof controversyand um more importantly of coursehelp a lot of people fix their health uhso we're going to talk to nina aboutum what got her into this businessof being a contrarian on nutrition anddietand then hair adventures with fiatnutrition scienceso nina thank you very much for joiningus well thank you for having mei'm really pleased to be here thank youso umi guess we could start with uh a littlebit about your background and what gotinto you what got you into theuh nutrition business and into the ideaof writing this bookright well um i'm a journalistand i really came to this whole fieldwithum no preconceptions i wasactually assigned to do a story on transfats by gourmet magazinein the early 2000s and i started to lookintothis field of dietary fat you know whichisone of the central obsessions of ournutrition recommendations or the way weall grew up thinking like do i eat lowfat non-fat good fat bad fat you knowwhat is it what do you do about fat inyour dietand that investigation for that articlewhich was a pretty groundbreakingarticle at the timeum it really plunged me into this worldof dietary fats one of the things thatinterested memost as a journalist was thatwhen i would call up professors tointerview them they were sort ofterrified to talk about the low-fat dieti just couldn't understand it you knowmy father is an engineer we have alltheserational logical conversations aboutscience and then all of a sudden i wascalling upscientists at legitimate universitiesand they were saying listen if you'regoing to talk aboutlow fat diet and if you're if you'regoing tochallenge that in any way i can't talkto you um or people would hang up on meorone woman um uhnamed mary enig was telling me storiesabout how her work on trans fats had ledtoscientists heckling her at conferencesand people trying to get herpapers he ganked from journals and ijust i couldn't really believe that thiswas the world of science that i washearing about and it also told me thatthere wasa really big story here and with alittle more readingi became convinced of that and it tookme aboutnine years to really read throughthousands and thousands and thousands ofnutrition papersand interview hundreds of nutritionscientists and others around the worldum you know when i started i wasa vegetarian like i hadn't eaten redmeat in25 or so years hadn't eaten any butterin about that amount of time i mean ijusti really did my researchjust showed me that everything i hadbeen doing was waswrong um and it was a long andand it was a difficult journey toconvince myself i mean that was one ofthe things that justtook me such a long time yeah i think uhone of my uh favorite observations ishowa lot of the uh critical thinkers alwayshave an engineering background so i'mthe leaddelight to hear that your father was anengineer and it had an impact on you iwas an engineer as welland it's very common that people fromengineering will be the firstto um call on things becausethe engineering mind makes you thinkverysystematically and you you don'tbuy these things i heard you mentionedmary eaning i i'veread her work she used to work she'spublished with the western pricefoundationright and um can you tell us a littlebit more abouther story and uh the persecution thatshe kind of uhgot into i i'm not very familiar withi've hearda little bit of details but i'm morefamiliar with her work than her storyyeah i'll try to remember as much as ican i think you know i wasum i think one of the you know lastjournalist tointerview her she was quite old when imet her but shehad been a um a serious molecularbiologist i believe atum at the university of maryland and shehad stumbled on this question of transfats whichpeople don't really even remember somuch anymore because they have been nowbanned and they're not allowed to bepart of our food supply but she wasum it was interesting she had noted thatthe jewish community in which she wasapart that theyhad much higher rates of cancer and shealso noted that they avoided dairy theywould have margarineinstead of butter for instance and theywould do that in order to keep kosherand so and they had much higher rates ofcancerand she thought maybe it was what was inthose vegetable oils orin those um that margarine which theywere eating to avoid dairyand so she did a bunch of work that wassome of thepioneering work in the late 70s on transfats wellwho makes those vegetable oils and thatmargarine those are the some of thebiggest companies in the world you knowadm monsantocargill unilever she didn't realize shewas going up against thesehuge industries and they have you knowit turns out that they have a tradeorganization and part of the work oftheir trade organizationas the head of that organization oncetold me ora former head um he said you know whatso our work was to go around and stoppeople like mary enoch because we didn'twant her toum to reveal this science so theyassigned people to heckle herconferences they whenever she wroteanythingthey would um they wouldpublish a report that was so vicious andso cruelum they were sexist they condescended tohershe really really took an extraordinarybeating forthe work that she was doing um becauseshe came up against industry and thatstoryis unfortunately has been retold andretoldi mean throughout the the it's in my thebook i sort of chart you know thevarious differentscientists um who tried to researchtrans fats and they suffered similarconsequenceswhere they really um they were justheckled out of the fieldso this is an interesting part of whatmakes nutrition science not sciencewhich is that there is thisincredible tradition of bullying thatgoes onwhere scientists really have no problemrubbishing other people's work talkingabout it inin very um derogatory waystrying to accuse people of all sorts ofthings ad hominess attacks a homonymattack sorry that is bizarrelypart of the story of nutrition scienceum and i don'treally see it in many other fields um itmight beit might be present but it is i see itin economics for sureyeah go ahead yeah i see it in economicsfor sure i mean ium i started getting these hereticthoughts about economicswhen i was doing my graduate degree atcolumbia andum it takes a very tough skin to be abletohandle the kind of um there's there's athere's a consensus way of dealing withheretics which is youlaugh you snicker you point and uh youcall themuh crazy and there's all these fixeduh you know mental toolkitthat they give them which is you know ohthis guy just oh he's one of thoseweirdos who believes in thisand um guilt by association so forinstance in economicsoh you're into hayek while hayek wasinto uhwas you know he he had a relationshipwith uh pinochet and so somehow thatdiscredits all of the ideasbecause somebody whereas you know ofcourse on the other side um thethe the mainstream ideas had uh allkinds of relationships with some of themost brutalmurderous dictators of the 20th centuryand that doesn'taffect anything for instance keynes inhis book he wrotepraising the nazi regime in the 1930sand sayingthis is more suited for the kind ofeconomic system that i'muh calling for um but that doesn't uhaffect it whereas you know on the othersidethey'll always come after and i think umumwe see this today as well with bitcoinlike a lot of the economistswhen they deal with bitcoin it's veryclear that there'sno honest uh way of approaching ityou talk to somebody like george selgenit's very obvious he's not arguing fromgood faith he's not trying to arrive ina way ofyou know how do we understand what'sgoing on he's just constantly trying topickthings um point laugh mockderide and bring up rankuse his rank to mock others he got tworeviews published for my book that wereessentially snarky stupid uh pointingfingers and laughinguh without making valid arguments it'sextremely common yeahsorry go ahead well i mean it's whatyou're talking about is that anybody whochallenges conventional wisdomi mean there is a healthy let's sayskepticism of of people who are skepticof everything you know you there's ahealthyum i think desire tonot to question everything and and notto embrace everypassing fad or fact you know that mightcome up buti mean and we face this now i mean inlike this tension with skepticism oralternative ideas that are actuallybacked bya great deal of science and and rigorousscience umor or logical thinking umso you know it's a questionable whichskeptics are you going to embrace andwhat you're not going to embrace andit's certainly true that there's anunequal playing field for people who areon the outsideum it's a completely unequal playingfieldthere's there's and that's it's largelythe kind of tactics that you're talkingaboutthey're you know their tried and trueuh communications pr tactics that weremany of them invented during the naziregime i mean there's just there's justa toolthere's a there's a bunch of tools thatyou use toum to try to marginalize people who arebringing up um contrarian uncomfortablecontradictory kinds of ideas to what thedogma the in my case the the nutritionalmedical dogmaand you know the reason for that as youknow and you've discussed you know ithink in your book and also the bookthat you have coming out which isyou know there's there's just so much atstake i mean in the case of nutritionwhat is at stake on the other side youhave it's afascinating kind of confluence of forcesthere's the ones that you wouldautomatically think of such as you knowbigfood all the new all of big food butthen there's also big pharmapharmaceutical companies uh there's nota single member of the us congress thatdoesn't take money from big pharmaand they do not profit when people arehealthy theythey do just fine in in a world whereeverybody's takingon average four or five medications aday that's their profitableworld and then um there are otherforces that are that could contribute tothis kind of sclerosis aroundideas that really don't have anyscience behind them but you know there'sthe seventh-day adventist church whichhas a religious belief that everybodyshould eatum vegan should be to eliminateall animal products from their diet thatseems crazy and bizarre but it's alsotrueyou have um animal rights activism avery well-funded movement that doesn'twant people eating animal foods they'reverynot only well funded but they're verydeeply networked intonutrition um into nutrition leadershipand um and then finally you have i thinkum what you experience in economicswhich is just that there is there'sestablished ideas there's sort of athere's akind of professional investment uhamong a class of scientists andresearcherswho have invested their whole careers incertain ideas and they reallyjust cannot they can't back out of thatum so and then i haven't even talkedabout the us governmentyeah which you know thisyeah and of course they have an infinitemoney printer which allows them tocontinue to override the rules ofeconomics and science and everything byjust continuing to subsidize whatever itis that umsuits their interests and it's true ithink in nutrition as well as inuh in economics so umin your work you discuss ansel keys asbeing a key personin uh the development of the modernnutrition dogma tell us a little bitmore about this interesting characterwell he was the most influentialnutrition scientist reallyprobably of all times and hewas working he started working reallyseriously in the 1950s he wasa pathologist from the university ofminnesota and heum was he had this tremendous faith inhis ownbeliefs he was sort of an evangelist forthem and hecame into the nutrition world at theright moment in history because he wasum in the 1950s there wasthis real rising panic about what causedheart disease i mean heart disease hadrisen from being almost non-existentum in the early 1900s although they knewhow to diagnose it and had writtentextbooks on it but they could theyreally didn't see many casesbut it had risen to be the number onekiller in america by the 1950s and soin 1955 president eisenhower himself hasa heart attack and is out of the ovaloffice for 10 daysi mean you can just imagine the focus ofthe nation on this questionwhat causes heart disease for whichthere were a number of competingexplanations you know people thought itwasnutrition vitamin deficiency peoplethought it was umrising amounts of auto exhaust umdue to more cars people thought it was atype a personality where you run aroundscreaming at everybody all day and thenyouum have a heart attack but into thisvacuum of knowledgestepped ansel keys poos and it was hisidea that it wassaturated fat and cholesterol thatcaused heart disease saturated fat byraising the cholesterol in your bloodwould eventuallyclog your arteries um and like hot oildown a coldstove pipe would fill them up andand cause a heart attack that's calledthe diet heart hypothesisand uh due to the force of hispersonalityum he would argue anyone to the deathaccording even to his friendsuh he was able to convince basically thenutritional establishment toadopt his idea and he did that mostconcretelyby getting on the nutrition committee ofthe american heart association which wasreally the only professional groupgiving advice about heart disease at thetimesuch that in 1961 the year after ancelkeyes joins that group he's able to getthemwhereas previously they had been sayinglook we just don't know it causes heartdiseasenot enough data one year later anselkeith is on that committee there's nogreater amount of data but he's able toget them to issue the first everstatement anywhere in the worldsaying that the best measure ofprevention against cardiovasculardisease was tocut down on saturated fats and dietarycholesterolthat meant cutting down eggs cuttingdownred meat dairy um and thoseideas that diet hypothesisuh exploded to i mean that grew intosort of the whole giant web of advicethat we have ideas was that was thekernel of it wasstarted with ansel keys in the americanheart associationis there truth to the uh story i'veheard on the western prizewebsite once that he used to eata lot of eggs and bacon himself and heused to say well that's uh you knowno we normal people should eatthe industrial waste but i uh i'm richand i can eat uh meat and eggsis that true you think you know i don'tremember the exact quote but i will tellyou that when he was quoted intime magazine is saying people shouldreduce on red meat he was saying theyneeded to reduce fromum uh down tojust three nights a week to have a redmeat and he was cited as enjoying youknowclassical music and candlelit dinnersand that hisbeautiful roasts and of meat and i don'tremember if itsaid that the the masses should then eatgrainsbut he was um known to be against meatand so i also have a letter from acolleague whowho writes about finding ancel keys at aconference um eating uprashers of bacon um and eggsso um you know that kind ofi suppose is a kind of hypocrisy that weprobably would see today if wecould peer into the life of more of ourvegan leading scientistsfor sure and we see the same thing ineconomics you knowpeople implementing all kinds ofhorrific economic policiesin their third world dysfunctionalkleptocraciesthey send their own money to switzerlandum where there was a gold standard untilrecentlyand where the banks are the most uhconservative andleast reckless and least inflationary sothey put their own money in switzerlandbut theyput your money in uh highly inflationaryuhand they inflate the currency in theirown countries and um yeahit makes sense i think people people areself-interested and makes sense for themto promote those ideas but it doesn'tmake sense for them toharm themselves with those ideas yeahit's interesting though i don't reallyknow if theworld's elites which have currentlyadopted sort of vegan diet for variousdifferent reasonsi'm not sure they're really aware of thenutritional deficits that theyare or will be suffering as a result ithink there is a genuine buy-infor that diet and it's the ultimateirony isof course it was the diet of thepeasantsthe poorest people were the ones whowere confined to eatgrains and and and whatever was leftover and they wouldthey were desperate for more meat i meanthe meat is what they craved most inall of the um records fromanthropologistsand researchers looking at poorpopulationsso it's this strange and deeply ironictwist that now we have the world'srichest peopleadopting the diet of peasants absolutelyyou look at bill gates i meanhe's got more than 100 billion dollarsnet worth butit's very clear he doesn't get enoughmeat and it's very clear hetruly does believe his own whenit comes toeating grains and artificial meat i'msure in my mind i'm pretty sure billgates has got some secret lab where he'sgota lot of scientists working on designingall of theseum top-secret cutting-edge fake meatsmade out of all kinds of disgustingindustrial stuff and he thinks ofhimself as you know being at theforefront of it and he's eating all thisgarbageum because he he genuinely believes thatmeat is bad for you and you can see itby looking at himum but uh yeah and i think you know youlook atgenerally people in davos and people whoarepromoting all these crazy uh anti-meatideasthey certainly look the part they do andyou know that they want to beslim and look healthy and you can see itinin movie stars movie stars who you knowthey're they're paid to be beautifulor many of them you know or maybe theydon't think that but i meanthey're supposed to be able to it's it'sjust that they they clearlybelieve what they're doing and they aresuffering ill health as a consequencesconsequence and it's um you know it'sreally a kind of tragedy idon't know when people will fully wakeup from thisyeah it is kind of a self-correctingproblem in the long run becauseum you know unfortunately people whoeat like this are just not going to livevery long and they're not going toreproduce a lot and they're not going toproduceuh healthy offspring yeah sothat's an interesting question whetheror not people will be able tochange their thinking even though theirkids have brown teethand are of short stature and they areverythin i mean to have it is if your kid isnot obeseyou feel like your kid is healthy evenif they're short andand and don't have any muscle on them imean that is the currentaesthetic um and you can certain thething aboutveganism is that it takes many years forit to show up you can certainlyreproduce in that time even if you'reyou know producing unhealthy offspringbutit's it's um it's not so immediatelyself-correcting as you might thinkand and i'm sure you encounter this aswell which is thethe ability to um to notrespond to observations that aredirectly in front of your own eyesi mean i could tell you a thousandstoriesof people going to their doctors they'velost uh you know 50 60 100 poundsall their blood markers look bettereverything their blood pressure is downeverything about them looks better theystand there in front of their doctor whooftenyou know is overweight and doesn't lookvery healthy andthe doctor says hmm that's very good i'mvery impressed that you've done that butyou know beware of that keto dietbecause it's going to kill youyes yes i've had this being told to i'vehad this told to me everybody who's lostweight on a low carb diet has hadall this concern trolling about wellwell you've got to be sure that it's notgoing to kill you because it's badfor your kidneys it's bad for this it'sbad for that and it'swhat's really amazing for me is that youknow i i used to eat very unhealthy iused to drinkabout two liters of cola every day and iused to love all of the junkand nobody was concerned about me backthen you know nobody would tell me ohyou have to watch ituh it was fine you know and when i feedthe you know everybody's feeding theirkidsall kinds of horrible uh industrialwastenobody bats an eyelid but when i tellpeople i feed my kids meatthey're like oh no you got to be carefuleverybody's suddenlyextremely concerned and of course it'snot concerned it's thatit's it hits at their cognitivedissonance that you know you can't behealthy and feeding your kids meatbecause then that would mean that i'mwrongand the only way that i can kind ofsquare that reality is to you know putit out there that you're wrong andyou're being reckless and you'reendangering your child's healthum but you know it it's your child ifyou want to kill them it's up to youum but i would advise you to get back toa diet of industrial wasteif you want to take care of your kidswell i mean it really is it's a i thinkyou know we'resort of in a state of tragedy right nowbecause thethis vegan diet is being seriouslyentertained as the global reference dietfor the entire worldby the you know it's being it's beingsort of umthere are some there's a summit on it atthe united nationsum and this global reference diet calledthe eat lancet dietis one that they want to really toimpose on the whole world if possibleum and that diet includes 0.5 ouncesof red meat per day which is like thismuchmeat i mean it's not it's a proteindeficient diet it's a diet that doesn'tmeet many nutritional requirements forhuman life and healthy reproductionum but it is i mean we're living in akind of delusionalstate that is fueled by manyyou know by multiple forces um nowincludingmultinationals that are deeply investedin the plant-based market but all theother forces that we talked about beforeas wellabsolutely um i'm curious a little bitif you could tell us a little bit moreaboutancel keys work on the mediterranean andthe seven countries study andall the myths about mediterranean dietsyou're looking amazing on thatso that is like a particularly funchapter of my book that i i do recommendfor people becauseit's it's such a it really is a windowinto the world of nutrition science andwhyit into the sloppiness of it andand just sort of how it comes up withideas so the mediterranean dietwas first sort of discovered by anselkeyesduring his work on something called theseven country study this wasthe biggest ever nutrition study thatwasat the time um in that we started in the19late 1950s and concluded in 1970it was on nearly 13 000 men only menthat would never be done today um allaround the world butmainly in europe but also in the us andjapan and hefollowed um it's called anepidemiological or observational studyso hefollowed these men he measured theircholesterol levelshe tried to capture something abouttheir diets umand he had gone into this study with thepreconceived sort of notionwhich i should call a hypothesis but hewas completely convinced of it umbefore he started his study which wasthat saturated fat and cholesterol werethe causes of heart disease and soindeed that is what he foundwhen the study came out but part of thestudyinvolved looking at the the islanderson crete um which is in southerngreece in the mediterranean and helooked at the dietsof only about 30 to 33 men on thatisland but he decided they were like hisstar subjects they ate very little meattheytoiled long days in the fields theyseemed to be very healthy they ate lotsof fruits and vegetablesand um so these became sort of the basisof these 30 to 33 men became sort of thefoundation of the mediterranean dietand he wrote a cookbook called themediterranean eating the mediterraneanway with his wifeand where he acknowledged that actuallythe diet of the mediterraneancannot be um there's noone typical diet i mean the diet inmorocco is different than spain isdifferent than southern franceand he pointed out all the differencesand how ridiculous it was to call itjust one thing buthe sort of plowed on with that and thatidea was then picked up bywalter willett who was the head of theum harvard school of public healthwho had traveled to the mediterraneanand had fallen in love with it rememberthis isthis is you know anybody who goes togreecei'm sorry but if you go to greece oritaly or any of those countries the foodis so delicious so it's really easy tofall in love withum that food which is ansel keys himselfi've done you know he was in europe postworld warii where the dollar was almighty kingthey could buy anything they wanted thefood was delicious they were coming fromminnesotaeating white bread you know you can onlyimagine that's the pleasure ofbeing in the mediterranean and so thisalso this kind of swoon of themediterranean also happened to walterwillett of harvardand he then constructed this idea of themediterranean dietand he made you know he kind ofcommercialized it he made it likemediterranean diet with a capital m thatwas the subject ofmany many books and articles and um youknow it still had this same problem thatit reallythere was no one precise definition ifyou go to italy or greece you know theyeat a lot of meatum you know meat is the mainstay of themenuand they also eat you know plant fruitsand vegetables butit's not a really a plant-based dietbut what i discovered was that thiswholethe ability to transform this diet intolike aninternational really um phenomenon wasthatthey had this series of conferences allover the mediterranean these beautifullike sun-kissedum spots and they invitedjournalists and scientists and chefs andthey had thesewonderful like these wonderful multi-dayevents and it was all fundedby the foods well principally by theeuropean olive oil councilso because they wanted to to increasethe consumption of olive oil in theunited states which they didand then it was also funded by other youknow byfruity by vegetable manufact people whohad sold vegetables and dairy andso it was all this industry-fundedseries of likebeautiful fragrant conferences and outof thatcame like scientific papers and umand this whole mediterranean diet fadand it's just an extraordinary story umthat that's the foundation of itand again it goes back to just like 30to 33 peopleand it has not been really confirmed inrandomized controlled clinical trialswhich i thinkprobably your audience knows is the goldstandard that's the way the kind ofexperiment that you need to do to showactually cause and effectum there has been really only one majorwell there have been quite a few trialsin the mediterranean diet however youdefine it butthe one that is sort of the hallmark oneis called pretty med which was done inspainagain funded entirely by the foodindustry or largely by the food industryand they seemed to show that there wassome cardiovascular benefitfrom the diet there's never been able toshow any bit that it helps you loseany kind of significant amount of weightbut there seemed to be somecardiovascular benefitbut ultimately what they found was likea 0.2 percent difference in absoluterisk which is a tinyreduction in risk which they expressedas relative risk to make itseem much bigger and and then the studywas you know was seriously questionedum whether it had actually beenrandomized and it was actuallynot properly randomized and they had toreissue it and so there's still sort ofa cloud that hangs over thatone single study that is supposed toshow the mediterranean diet isefficaciousin preventing any kind of chronicdiseaseso yeah quite a story it absolutely isand it's fascinating becauseum you know i i lived in lebanon for avery long time and there's a commonsaying there which isum some people are ghee and some peopleareoil and it's a way of saying you knowsome people are good some people are badsome people are rich some people arepoor it can be used in differentcontexts to signify essentially that youknowuh poor people are the ones who eat theoil and cook with the oiland the rich people are the ones whocook with ghee andyou know it's something that you'veheard you'd hear all your lifeand lebanese people here all their lifeand they all know itbut they still it's it's quite amazingyou know people today they still thinkyeah well you know our ancestors ateolive oil andthe reality is you know they ate oliveoil as a dressing they used it to makesoap they used it to make candlesthey use it for their hair they'd haveit as a dressingyeah for the skin but when they had tocookyou know they'd cook with animal fat andthe only time you would cook with oliveoil was if you couldn't haveanimal fat which is you know if you werereally poorand that's where the saying comes fromyou know the people who have to cookwith oilthey have to be really really poor ifyou can't afford gheeor or tallow and uh it'sit's really fascinating about it iswatching you know people in themediterranean today justhave this harvard idea of what theirancestors ateand you know today um you know people'sgrandparentsum were around in the 60s and 70s soum their diet isn't quite representativeof what their grandparents ate and wedon't talk to ouryou know the sixth generation removedgrandparents to know what they used toeat butif you look into it you know the the themeat was the heart of the diet and themeat is how peoplemanage to survive and the animal fatsandum it's it's it's it's amazing howsuccessful this has been likeand and you see this also in just howmuch people arescared of that it's amazing you know youtravel all over the worldi'll go to the most obscure little placeanywhere and people will alwayslook at you weird it doesn't matter thiscould be the richest place in the worldit could be the poorest place in theworld everybody'sno are you sure this is okay that you'reeating meat yes i'm sure humans havebeen eating it for three million yearsare you sure it's okay that you'redrinking all this uhsugary sludge that your grandparentswouldn't have recognized that they'dseen wellyour great-grandparents maybe and youknow the cognitive dissonance is justuh it's fascinatingyeah i mean i you know it'swhen you're in school you're in gradeschool there's you know they teach youthis lesson likeyou must study history so that you'renot bound to repeat it and yetwhen you talk about how you know youdon't know what yourgreat-great-grandparents ate anymoreright we just don't know whatif we don't know we have lost all of ourold recipes or old traditions we'reshocked to find an old cookbook and findthat it's full of you know recipes forhow to use various kinds of organ meatslike we've never heard of that would beunimaginable to us but it's only acouple of generations ago or i shouldsay it only takes a couple ofgenerations to forgetyeah and i don't think in in italy orgreece that they're awareas you said olive oil was not even usedas a food stuffuntil the 19th the mid to the late 1900ssorry the mid to late 19th century umit had no use for as a food item it wasonly it was mainly to anoint the bodyof the you know of the ancient greeks sowe just you know we forget at our perilpeople do not rememberand it really doesn't take long to umfor people to forget that you know didwhere does margarine even come fromyou know where it's it's you know it'sfactory produced and it goes throughmultiple steps and volleyball involvinga metal chelate and it has to bedeodorized and winterizedand degummified and it's it's anabsolutely disgusting product to see andit's disgusting i went into a vegetableoil factory you see how vegetable oilsare made i mean it really isnot appealing to see the kind of thegray sludgy product thatcomes out of pressing soybeans and thenhow that has to bedeodorized winterized and all thesethings in order to make it seem likesomething that might be palatableyeah in order to basically make it killyou slowly rather than just kill youquicklybut it was cheaper i mean all of thesethings were cheaperso again it's this irony that we'veembraced we've been told something ishealthythat is an industrial product that is acheaper productum we've been we've been sort ofbrainwashed to think that that ishealthierthan uh what uh what ourhealthy forefathers used to eat yeah andit only takesa couple of weeks for you to just youknow try to stop the stuff for a coupleof weekseat animal fats for a couple of weeksand just you'll notice the differenceimmediately butpeople are so addicted and sobrainwashed by it that they refuse toeven try itwell of course that's part of a you knowa campaign avery very successful communicationscampaign to scare people awayfrom you know a low carbohydrate higheranimal protein animal fat diet that'sbeenjust a relentless communicationscampaign andand now we have sort of global warmingthat you're considered to beum you know a denialist global warmingdenialistif you eat meat um which is i think abrillianttactic on somebody's part because youknow those arguments also don't reallypan out very well um of course you knowyou canyou should take one less airline flightorown one less car or house or somethingorin order to because all those things youcan do without damaging your healthi mean versus giving up meat which isyou knowis a health risk yeah and we've had uhpatrick moore who was one of theco-founders of greenpeace on a couple ofweeks ago to discussthe science behind climate and[Music]um you know you may agree or disagreebut i think there's a very strong caseto be made that it's as rigorous it'sprobably much less rigorous than thescience behind the mediterranean dietand the low-fat dietsum you know there's very little evidencethat umall the carbon that we've been emittinghas causedum any damage to the world and then whenyou think about just the need that wehave for emitting those things you knowwewe we emit carbon dioxide when webreathe the idea that wegoing to go get to a zero a carbondioxideworld is only possible if we justgenocideall of humanity well you know i don'tcan't enter into the into the debateabout climate science but i will saythat you know one of thevery influential ideas that um reallybeganthis this notion that we should give upmeat began in the 1970swith this idea that you know if you apound of meat was much more expensivein terms of all the inputs than a poundof plants so why should we not just thiswas the idea offrancis moore lepay and her called thediet for a small planetum when there were all these you knowthe original concerns aboutoverpopulation and how we're going tofeed everybody and what we do with ourburgeoning populationand really i mean and you know if youif you believe that a pound of meat in apound of plants deliver the samenutritionthat is a viable argument but when youstart to realize that a pound of plantsnot only is that nutritionally poorright they don't havewhat does meat have iron selenium zincum folate you know all these anda perfect protein a perfect completeprotein forthat your body can use to function makemuscleum maintain muscle plants have none ofthatand plant comes with theseanti-nutrientsthat are many people have um that createimmune responses i mean the one that weall know is gluten but there are quite afew others that plants containbecause the whole strategy of a plant toavoid being eatenum it can't run away the way an animalcan so it has to develop poisonsinside um inside of various plant foodsthat really peoplethat can be toxic um and are toxic topeopleto many people soand this this pound of plantsis all carbohydrates so you're alsotalking aboutum foodstuffs that willprovoke and drive metabolic disease sothese are not at all equali mean if this equals health if the meatequals health and thiscomes you know if the externalities thatyou want to include arechronic disease and if you just countchronic diseasethis becomes much less valuable umthan this on the on in terms of just youknow all of ouryou'd have to care you'd have to includethe entire health care system on thatcalculationyeah and in the fiat standard i uh in mynext book the fiat standard ii i argue that i think a lot of thatuh was driven by the fact that uhprices were going up you know the thereason that this kind of uh apocalypticvisionof we're consuming too muchit was driven by the fact that peoplewere seeing prices rise so muchand you know government economistsweren't going to tell you yeah you knowprices are rising because we're printingmoney to fight all these wars and tofinance all of our croniesthey're not going to say that you knowprices are rising becauseearth is angry at us and because we areabusing earth by eating meat and becausemeat is bad andgaia is going to take avenge takerevenge at us andthe answer is to stop consuming and theanswer is to have less and the answer istoyou know make do with the cheap stuffthatearl butts and the department ofagriculture had been heavily subsidizingbecauseuh you know if you get people to stopeating a lot of meat and they starteating more of the industrial stuffthat's very easy to scaleand has very umlittle responsiveness to inflationbecause it can beproduced you know the more you produceof it the lower the price becomesbecause ithas economies of scale um you can hidethe inflation quite effectively and soi don't think it's a coincidence thatall of these crazy dietary guidelines ofthe 1970s came after the inflation infact there's a storymentioned in a book called the greatinflation by umrobert samuelson in which uh the priceof eggs had gone up anduh president nixon got on uh on thephone with the surgeon general and toldhimtell people to stop eating eggs andapparently that's whereall the insane criminal hysteria abouteggs causingcholesterol and heart disease and allthat stuff comes from andjust think about how much of that is dueto the inflation and that's really thethe fascinating connection that i findherethat's super interesting i mean i mean ii know that that egg story has anotheris it's a history goes back to anselkeys as well but i think thatit's very interesting if you believe imean it's not necessarilya terrible idea to feed people moregrainsif you believe that grains if you don'tunderstand nutritionif you don't understand that you knownot all it's not just about providing acertain number of calories a daywhich is what people think but you haveit's and so if you provide that's anumber of calories maybe it's okay ifit's allsoy and sorghum and wheat and you knowrice maybe that would be okay butif you understand nutrition and youunderstand the needs of the human bodyand you understand that we need allthese nutrients and minerals to surviveand to reproduce healthy that doesn'twork at all that systemdoesn't make any sense a calorie is nota caloriedifferent calories deliver differentnutrients and i think one of thebest ideas that i know in nutrition interms of fixing one's own personalhealthis to eat four nutrientseat for protein and eat for nutrients gofor the foods that give you the mostnutrition and understand thatartificially fortified foods like theyputiron in grain so you can have likecaptain crunch and it has your ironand that's why the sweat governmentstill has to um recommend refined grainsbecause those are the ones that areenriched and fortifiedbut many people cannot absorbnutrients either from tablets pills orfrom the food that they're eating it inand they think they're getting it fromthe fortification fortified foodsbut many people can't absorb that theycan absorb it from pills yourbest way to get those nutrients in yourbody is to get them through foodsand and if you specifically meatprinciplethat will deliver a completelynutritious and healthy dietabsolutely yeah and it's uh it's uh yeahyou can't really expect politicians whoare looking to get reelected toget into uh thinking about how do wefeed people for the sake ofyou know the health of their children 20years from now how do we feed people sothat we getre-elected two years from now that's theconcern andif you you know if you manage to con toconvince them that the best food thatthey should be eating is the cheapstuff that's going to make the inflationproblem look muchless of a problem when you get into ityeah no i mean and i'll tell you there'sa verysimple structural problem why we cannothavegood dietary guidelines um maybe ishould explain what dietary guidelinesareand why they're influential if you'dlike so thisthe nonprofit that i work on is calledthe nutrition coalition which i found itand it's because they're the whole ideais that we need dietary guidelines thatarebased evidence-based or based in arigorous scientific processwhich they're not currently umand you know why should we care aboutthe dietary guidelines which is a reallygood question because nobodyeven most people don't even know aboutthem but they you know you don't knowabout them but they know about youi mean they reach out um to i meannot only are they followed by mostnations around the world in case peopleare calling in from other nations umthey're considered sort of the goldstandard umbut you know they reach uh they reachout into every sector of society they'rethey're taught by doctors and dietitiansand pretty much all health care workershave to follow the guidelines so youwhen you go to your doctor to getadvice about diet diet it comes from thedietary guidelinesthey influence all institutional foodand hospitals and cafeterias theirschool lunchesfeeding programs for the elderly themilitary's food we have a huge obesityproblem in our militaryso they're just incredibly influentialtheyexert a kind of advise like controlover our food system and our foodchoices umin in institutional settings so they'revastly influential um and theyare they're they are not reactive togood science um so ours is really theonly group in the worldthat is trying to ensure or trying toraiseawareness of these guidelinesand what's wrong with them and one ofthe basic structural problemsthat we have um is that the people whoare responsible for the food policyis as our department of agriculture theyhave norelationship with but you know incongresspeople who worry about the who overseethe department of agriculturehave no relationship with the people whoworry about the budget for health careso there's no connection there so if youfix the dietary guideline you have noincentive to fix the dietary guidelinesbecausebecause you're a member of congressyou're either in this job over here orin the job that job over there butthere'sno connection between those twono incentive to reduce health care costsin this country which are bankrupting usi mean diabetes alone are bankruptingour countryabsolutely and i think you know you sawthis with the coronavirus hysteria whereum you know it was considered okay tolock people up at home and muzzle themandum try experimental gene therapy all ofthat was just considered common senseand if you opposed ityou got called the heretic and you gotabused by all the world's idiotswhereas you know simply telling peopleto maybeyou know stop eating industrial wasteand start eating uh healthy food thatwill make youum less susceptible to the damaged wordbecausethe biggest uh confounding uh wellthe biggest comorbidity the biggestcause ofnegative outcomes for getting thecoronavirus the difference betweenhaving a bad fluand having serious damage for life ordying is almost entirely aboutobesity and diabetes and all thesemetabolic diseasesand yet there's absolutely nobody in allof the fiat authoritiesuh all the stuff like that yes i i thinki was umyes i mean i reviewed all the researchand wrote an article on this said thatthe the close the best predictor forpoor outcomes from covetafter age you know being old was wasprobablythe greatest predictor of poor outcomesthe second greatest one was your bloodsugar chronic high blood sugarwhich is found in people with obesityand diabetes and other chronic diseasesthat's why they're all linked togetherby that common feature which is that youhave excessively chronically high bloodsugar from eatingchronically um too many carbohydratesso i think i was the only person that iknow i iwrote up that a piece and it waspublished in the wall street journal asanop-ed and usually when you write anop-ed you know there's there's you getpicked up by a radio show or a tvinterview or somebody's interested inthat point of view and i got likezero interest in that idea and i reallycould it was almost unimaginable to methatyou know in the new york times or you'releading newspapers they were advertisingyou knowit's fine to binge eat and here's ourextralarge size brownies and here's my storyof eating through ahuge entire bag of tortilla chips andit's fine because it's emotionally ifthat's what we need at this timeyou know what you need emotionally is tonot die from covetwhat you need is to be as as immunewhereas you knowas healthy as you possibly can be umyeahit's it's amazing and i'm sorry tomention this one other thing but youknowyou don't hear anywhere politicianstalking about obesity and diabetesat all absolutely absolutely and andthis is one of the things that reallyinfuriates me like it'syou as you were saying earlier thatthere's definitely noum there's no genuine honest attempt toactually make an argument there's justan endless listof preconditioned uh responseswhere all right the science says thisstuff is good the science says you'rebased on a study done by a guy who wasdiscredited and theand then that one of the ones thatreally really gets me isthis one which is you know well you'rebeing really cruelon people you know they're going throughan epidemic and they're locked up athomethey're sacrificing so much they deservetheir tortillasit's it's amazing and it's it's socommon and it's soand it's always being levied at peoplewhotalk about healthy eating as if you knowtrying to tell people to stay healthyand fix their mental issues you know allthe psychological problemsof bad eating that you know fixing allof the psychological problems that comewith bad eatingwould go an enormous way in helpingpeople uh deal with all those things butsomehow all of thatis considered uh bad because there'sjustno money in it i've you know i i've beenpretty outspoken on my twitter i don'thave aforum where i can publish about healthbut i've been pretty outspoken aboutall this stuff for since since januaryreally i remembermy first tweet about covet was injanuary 31st2021 and my tweet was you knowthese people the the people that aretelling you to worry and the people thatare being hysterical about it are theworld health organizationand these are the same people who tellyou to eat vegetable oil and this is thesame people who tell you you need to eatgrains and that you need to reduce yourmeat consumptionand that you uh you know they'responsored by all of these industrialmanufacturing foodsi'm inclined to just not listen to whatthey're sayingbecause if i were to listen to whatthey're saying i'd be diabetic today ii used to be overweight i used to beprobably pre-diabeticand i you know at this point i'd beliving i'd be debilitatedum because i i went low carb about 12years ago and it completely changed mylifei'm healthier right now and i'd becompletely debilitated and i wouldn't beable to to take care of my familyi think given the trajectory of myhealth given how bad i used to eatbefore i fix thingsand so uh i i that made meskeptical of all the things that they uhpromote and it'sit's you know you don't even need tolook into the details of the crazythings that they promoteit's obvious that if they're full of because if theyweren't full of you know they'd beout there telling people to fix theirfood but they don'tyeah i mean other people here's a youknow here's some some hard factsstory on that i just want to go back andsay one thing which is that surei don't want to discount how hard it isto give upjunk food and to say that like oh it'seasy like there's no such thing asemotional eatingthat that isn't real or that isn'treally difficult to overcomeum sugar addiction is real all of thatis realand i have enormous sympathy for howhard it isto change one's diet but i think at thesame timeit is the responsibility of our publichealth officials and thosewho are leaders in the media to say thisis worthwhilebecause your very life may depend uponit umand you can dramatically improveyour just in case we have another roundof goldenyou can dramatically improve your bloodsugar and all of your cardiovascularrisk factors without necessarily losingweight those studies have been donethose clinical trials have been doneshowing youyou experience tremendous benefits evenifyou do not immediately see weight lossso that's important to knowbut to give you a really graphic exampleof just howcorrupt i would i guess i have to say umyou know oursystems are we did um an analysis of theusdietary guideline advisory committeethis is the expert committee appointedby the governmentum 15 members they're supposed to reviewall the signs to tell us you know whatwe need to eat to be healthy wellin general the national academies ofsciences says that in order toyou know if you're going to issueguidelines then nomore than less than half of thecommittee should have any kind ofconflict of interest you knowfinancial being the primary one umbut uh the u.s dietary guidelinecommittee thatthat oversaw the guidelines that justcame out at the end of last year95 almost all of them 95 of themor all but one had really seriouslong-standing conflicts of interest withthe food industry with thepharmaceutical industryum they had multiple connectionsgoing back for years with many manydifferent companiesand you know you have to be very naiveto think that they don't bringthat even if they believe they're doingtheir best they have been soinfluenced and kind of marinated in anindustryin way of thinking um thatthose views are bound to um convert ontoyou know into their advice into theirscientific reportand then at the level above that youhave the fact that the us department ofagriculture and this i know this is alsotrue of the whoyou have these companies they are youknow they'rethey're they have their debt partnershipthe whole idea of public-privatepartnerships with these publicinstitutions so that you knowour department of agriculture ispartnering with domino's pizzaand is partnering with unilever and isyou know what does that partnership dofor what is well one of the things thatit doesis that pizza is considered a vegetablein schools rightyeah with it's actually a pizza isperfectly healthy bythe government standards you know ifyou're supposed to havesix servings of grain a day so there'syour grainsand you've got tomato which is avegetable i mean actually it's a fruitbut anywayand but that's healthy so you know andcheese is dairyso i mean that's you know nutritionistsalways go around saying it's a fault ofamericans because they eat too muchpizza and sandwiches but let's reviewall of that is completely consideredhealthy and covered by the u.s dietaryguidelinesthose are health foods yeah it'sinteresting you knowthese people will have all these blatantconflicts of interest andthey'll spend 20 years making millionsof dollars from these companiesnobody mentions it and then somebodywho's talking aboutlow carb somebody like you or you knowmany of the uhfitness coaches on twitter and instagramtheywill sell a supplement or will sellsomething then you knowon their twitter and then they getcompletely bashedfor it by the media because those peopleare profiting from ityeah and i will say it or like i want tobe very clear likei don't take any money from industry andmy group takes no money from industryof any kind but there's umthere is a you know professor at nyu whohasa whole whisper campaign against me thati that i get funding from the meatindustry and that's what that's printedupin you know in a journal articleon me um soyeah not only i mean if i were actuallyto be involved with the meat industrythat wouldi'm sure attract even more press but aswe said earlier it's justthere's there's a tradition of bullyingin the field and one of thetopics is to accuse people of beingfinancially motivatedand actually that goes back to ancelkeyswho would accuse all of his competitorsfor instance there was aprofessor at the imperial college inlondon who it was his ideain the 1970s that that it was sugar thatwas drivingjohn youthkin right yeah john yudkinso ansel keys noting that this is acompetitorto his hypothesis uh he attacksjohn you can and one of the things thathe attacks him for is he says he accuseshim of being in the pocket of variousunnamed financial uh industry andunnamed industries and he went after himusing all these tactics and he used thesame tactics against an esteemedprofessor at texas am who was challenging his hypothesis andso thisis sort of this comes from the veryorigins of the fieldum and now these tactics are used i meanviciouslyum and principally by by uh the harvardum school of public health they'rethey're deeply engagedengaged in quite a bit of of this kindof these kind of bullyingattacks one of them was that they triedsimilarly to mary enigthere were papers that were published inthe annals of internal medicine that wasthe most comprehensive and rigorousreview ever doneon the subject of red meat and umand cancer and cardiovascular outcomesand other metabolic outcomes that wouldcover diabetesthere were a number of harvardprofessors and others who allsigned a letter and and and flooded theinboxof the editor-in-chief of that journalasking for uma pre-published sorry yeahpre-publication retraction of the paperi mean don't even publish it because itwill be so damaging and so confusepeopleand it will it it just it can't evenpeople should not even see ityeah i'll i just want to comment onsomething you said earlier which is thatit's hard to break the addiction to junkfoodi know it is hard but you know thehardest part of itis the fact that the authorities thatyou would look to in order to guide youin the right directionand you know the ones that would put youin the direction where you couldstart thinking about exercising yourwillpower in that directionthey're putting you in that they'returning you on to the exact oppositedirection you know thatyour your doctor tells you to stopeating meat and reduce ityour newspaper your all of those thingsall of these authorities are constantlymoving people toward the direction ofmaking things worse for themand then and and and and rationalizingthe addiction and justifying it andindulging it and thinking about it as ifit's uh asas if it's just normal and healthy youknow treat yourself and it's it'samazing like ithink in in my mind i think if we didn'thave an entirely corrupt medical systemi think you know a doctor would besomebody you would take your kidto whenever you started thinking thatyour kid is having a problem with eatingtoo much junk foodyou go to the doctor you should takeyour 14 year old kidthe doctor sits there in a very sombervoice and a very terrifying voiceand shows you pictures of people who hadtheir legs amputated because of diabetesand shows youwhat it means to get diabetes and startscaringthe little kid and making it clear tohim you know every timeyou're eating these tortillas every timeyou're eating this junkyou're choosing to not be fit enough tojoin your friends on theirsoccer team you're choosing to not beattractive to the other gender you'rechoosingto get diabetes by your 20s or 30syou're choosing to do all those thingswhat doctor does that it's almostimpossible to find doctors who do thatright and then right well remember thatthey're getting their adviceum the doctors are informed by thedietary guidelines so many well-meaningdoctorsreally do not know that when they'retelling people to eat more fruitsvegetables whole grains andand nuts and seeds and reduce their meatand and eat low-fat dairythere's they're delivering theguidelines and many doctors believe thatthat is correctso they're not all bad but you know welive in a culture wherethe um the messages of industryhave been so broadly disseminated soin our schools children are rewardedwith candy and that's howlet's have a fun challenge and and seehow many gumballsare in this jar and then we'll eat themall and then you know every birthdayparty anybody goes toone of the more damaging messages thatcomes from industry is this ideaall foods in moderation you can doanything in moderationwell um that may be true for some peoplebut for many people there is no suchthing as a moderate amount of ice creamthere's just a pintand there's no and it's very hard to domoderation when the foodshave been designed over decadesmassively addictiveone cookie it's very hard for people soand actuallyum there's uh you know they're they'rethese foods are meant to be addictiveand and if youreally have a metabolic disease likediabetes heart disease obesityyou really cannot be eating a moderateamount of sugar but you just can'tthat's notsomething that you can do anymorebecause you're you've tipped over intometabolic ill healthbut that idea of moderation is anindustry message that we havejust absorbed um yeah it'sit's one of the many zombie talkingpoints that they hit you with okay wellokay fine maybe this is bad for youbut you know don't be such a partypooper don't uh ruin the kid's childhoodletkids be kids no kidsyou know the childhood doesn't meanindulging in poisonthis notion that the indulging kidsaddiction isloving them is just absolutelydestructive and yet it's promotedeverywhere in hollywoodin movies and tv in newspapers and mostof all of coursein nutrition science where youknowit's it instead of the being the job ofthe scientists to tell people what thereality is and what the truth is the jobof the scientistis to tell people to indulge themselvesright just think about all the or thekrispy kreme roll out for getting yourumyour covid vaccine and yeah and there irememberseeing a tweet by one of the women againthese trusted experts they're supposedto be our trusted experts insteadthey'rethey're funded by food and pharmacompaniesand and she's got a box of krispy kremedonuts this is from the dietary gardencommitteesaying you know have some krispy kremesi'm wondering is she also funded bykrispy kremeyeah the krispy kreme have done a greatjob of funding nutritionists there's alot of nutritionists who show up ontwitter talking about you know youshould treat yourself to krispy kremejust one in moderation how could anybodybe against it you're such a naysayerexactly exactly yeah um i wanted to getto the american heart associationtell us about them[Music]well um because heart disease was rarerememberuh in the early 1900s there were nocardiologists um really there were noneuntilsort of the 19 teens you start to seemore of themand then um and then by the 20s there'ssort of this little tinyoffice that is that of cardiologiststhis little sort of group that comestogetherand they say let's be the american heartassociation but they have no money theyalmost have no office they have nopower in the world um and and theythey don't know what causes heartdisease well in 1948 of course this isresearch that idug up from in the process of writing mybook theyare um they're tagged by proctor andgambrelmakers of crisco oil umwhich later the american heartassociation remember would cometo recommend over uh over your saturatedfats like betterin 1948 they approached this this smalltiny american heart association juststarting out and they said that we'llmake you the designeeof this huge radio contest umthat was called the walking man contestat the time and soovernight according to the company'sofficial history that they themselveswrote the american heart associationsays we received a giantcheck for millions of dollars fromprocter and gambleum and the money just flew into ourcoffers and then overnight they becameuh just a giant with offices all overthe country they are they are still ibelievethe largest non-profit in americathey're a hugethey're just a giant and they have had aclose relationship with procter andgamble that still funds themand you remember such as in 1948 and1961 they're saying you need to havevegetable oils instead ofsaturated fat so you know no one can saythatthey're launched by procter gamble wasinfluenced that decision butthey have um at least a third of theirfundingcomes from from the food and drugmanufacturersand that's been yeah soi mean their story is really sort ofincredible that they have you know theythey're a trusted a highly trustedorganizationthey had very close relationships withum all the white houses really they werealways had theirannual um fundraiser was held at thewhite house for manyum many many years and and theythey hold a position of tremendous trustwith the public and so they're not goingto it createsmen creates real dissonance anddifficulties for themto change they're based on the basictenets of their adviceum and to be seen as flip-flopping onthe public that saidthey did actually change theirrecommendations to say that you knowwe do no longer believe in a low-fatdiet so muchso you can have you can have morevegetable oils that's what that means tothembut um they've sort of backed off theidea of a low-fat dietum but you know they still yeah did theystill warn you against cholesterol andmeatright they still you know you still haveto have low-fat dairy because of thesaturated fat so they're still againstsaturatedfats you still have to have low fatdairy and you still shouldn't be eatingred meat for those reasons you shouldhave poultry instead i meantheir basic advice has changed verylittlei think that they they used to say youshould snack on things likegumdrops and hard candy because anythingwas better thanfat like fat was the worst um so youshould have pretzels and gumdrops iactually have anamerican heart association for suresaying this is what you should eat foryour snacksso they backed away from thatunderstanding that sugar is is probablybad for health they have backed off thatbut it creates this really smallum basket of foods that they canactually recommendum you know you can you can have fishfish is unaffordable or unaccessible formost peoplein at least in the united states and umand you can eat you know fruitsvegetables whole grains but it's hardfor them becausethey need they're not that manyprocessed foods that sort ofreally they can they can promoteand what kind of foods do they promotewhat are the things that they like sothey'll get you know you can still umyou know a health food is still likea cereal any of those boxed cereals arebecause they'reyou know they're grains which is fine aslong as they're not sweetenedum the u.s tarts promotes woodpop tarts yeah i don't think theypromote pop tarts anymore they used topromote things like thatum when they were promoting a lot ofsugar but they don't do that anymorebut our us government will um has sugarycereals as part ofyou know the food that it gives away towomen and children and umand i and i think that you know nowwe're allowed by the american heartassociationone egg a day maybe umbut they are you know they're stillreally vociferously againstsaturated fats and i think another thingto note about themas a as an organization is that theyoversaw and didsome of the most important trialsclinical trialson saturated fats and those trials wereall donein the 1960s and 70s all together onmore thanum 69 000 70 000 people and ahuge number of people were tested inrandomized controlled trials trying toshowthat eating more saturated fat andcholesterol caused heart diseasetrying to test ansel cohesis hypothesisand none of those trials showed that thepeople eating more saturated fatsup to like 20 of your calories ofsaturated fatsnone of those people um died of higherrates from cardiovascular disease or anydiseaseso total mortality or cardiovascularmortalityin most cases they did not have moreheart attacks and it's a little bitharder to measure that and theamerican heart association over you knowmany other people are participating inthese studies they see the study resultscoming outand and they do nothing to respond tothat datait doesn't change and and many of thosestudies you know some of themthese are amazing stories that i youknow described in my book some of thestudies weren't published somelay languishing in basements um some youknowthey the some of them were they becamewhat's calledsilent studies where they're just nevercited or never quoted it's just theyjust sort ofthe entire community of nutritionscientists just agrees likewe don't know what to do with theseresults they don't agree with ourpreconceived notions so we're just goingtokind of say nothing about them one of myfavorite tricks that they pullis to call these results paradox youknowwell we have our theory and our theoryis obviously correctbut this thing completely flies in theface of our theory and falsifies itso we're not just going to reconsiderwhether we're wrong we're just going tocall it a paradoxand then we're going to write morepapers about you know the french paradoxand this and that paradoxand it's all over in economics there'smany examples like thisum where it's not a paradox there is noparadox there it's justyou're getting the truth and you shouldjust accept it butwhat's amazing is there's no correctivemechanism in the scientific processanymorethere's no you know no matter how manystudies the american heart associationcomes up with thatfalsify their own assumptions there'sjust no mechanism for them to back downand announce something like well maybethis shouldmaybe we're wrong why do you think thatis the case i mean i have my answersobviously but i'm curious about yourexperience ofwhy can't scientists change their mindit's been 60 years and they're stillpromoting the samething at the aha and all these otherplacesyou know it's a it's many of the thingsthat we've already talked about which isthat there are manylarge commercial interests um that fundthese scientiststhere's um and then there's all theseother interests we also talked aboutthat are in influencing nutritionscience um likethe seventh-day adventist church and theanimal rights books all of thisbut i think you know for the scientiststhemselves and i've spoken to many manypeople in the fieldthere is um well for one there arepeople who just you know when italk about these silent studies theypeople today don't know about themum so they really don't know the historyof their own fieldthey what they've read in textbooks andwhat they've kind of when they came upand got their phds they justnobody talked about any of this andnobody knows it so it's been journalistslike myselfum or gary taubes or other journalistswho've written about thisand actually sort of we're the ones totowrite these histories um and nutritionscientiststhey don't know this the ones and theones that who doare very afraid to speak up because youhave a system whereyour all of your research funding iscontrolled by the or most of it iscontrolled by the the governmentwhen government is invested in this dietright it's invested in itum not only because the nih nationalinstitutes of healththey really signed on and bought dietthe diet heart hypothesisgoing back to 1948 um they were verymuch invested in this hypothesisbut also they if their program is thedietary guidelines if the dietaryguidelines are wrongif they're making people you know sickand not healthy or if they're not you'rejustmerely not doing the job of preventingthe disease then they'reculpable or liable i mean they have alot at stake and so if you're anutrition scientistyou cannot really startveering away from sort of theestablishedmedical nutritional dogma because yourisk losing umbeing expelled from the community beingunable to get research funding and beingexpelled professionallyso i you know i've talked to many peoplewhowere expelled and and i write about themum who you're no longer invited toprofessional conferences you no longerget an invitation to speak you're nolonger considered sort of acollegial person there's somethingthat's sort of questionable about youso you know you risk just being excludedfrom your own field and being unable todo the science that you're trained forthat's also why you see in the fieldpeople doing the cutting edge sciencenow oncarbohydrate restriction on vegetableoils they comenot from the field of nutrition theycome from other fieldswho have made their have made their wayto nutritionthrough something else like exercisephysiology or some otherfield but it's very very rare to findnutrition scientistswho are um not only aware of the problembut are willing towrite papers that slightly push againstum i mean you know all of themyeah one of my favorite genres oftwitteris the jim bros and uh thepersonal trainers and uh the instagraminfluencerswho you know their business is muchcloser to the scientific process becausethey try things out and they see whatworks and they try it on their clientsand they tweet about it and they postthe before and after picture that's whatscience isand one of my favorite genres of twitteris when those people um you knowpost their results and theirrecommendations and they're obviouslygetting results andpeople are paying them money and thenyou get these fat nutrition scientistscomeand start mocking them and telling themno no you know you look great and yesyou've curedpeople from diabetes with this butthat's not scientificand you're going to ruin their kidneyswith a low carb you should listen to thescience and start looking more like meoverweight depressed miserable and it'sit's amazing it's amazing in my mind ithinkwhat i say in the fiat standard is umgovernment funding ofscience is one of those things that isyou know like motherhood and apple pielike who couldhate those things it's just you knowscience is the best thing in the worldscience is amazing and obviously we wantto have the governmenttax rich people so that we can getscience it's just one of theseno-brainer ideasbut really what it means is that you'veestablished a monopoly on science andwhat it means is that the people incharge of the funding are now isolatedfromall manner of real market feedback nomatter how many people your advice killsdoesn't matter your paycheck doesn'tcome from the people who are paying youlike the uh instagram influencers andlike the jim broswho you know have to deliver results totheir clients or else they don't getpaidif you're a fiat scientist if you're inan american university or any universityall over the world the the americansystem ofuniversities has basically uh invadedthe planetif you're a scientist in that field youknow you're just churning out papers youdon't care you just want to make sureyour papersflatter the people who assign thefunding and the people who assign thefunding you knowthat there's no way that they're goingto change the diet heart hypothesis theyhave no interest in it i thinkone thing that i say in the fiatstandard is fiat science is about whogets to decide what the null hypothesisisand so in 1948 the null hypothesis wasthat it is the diet hearthypothesis and then that's it you knowyou couldpresent mountains and mountains ofevidence against itdoesn't matter they'll ignore it they'llsmear you they'llcall you an industry shell doesn'tmatterand then they'll present the mostridiculous studies like the sevencountries studyor all these terribly design andsome of the nutrition studies are justabsolutely hilarious like you could readthemif you just know a little bit ofstatistics like you look at how theydesign it and then you look athow they interpret the result it's justso idiotic it's funny butit doesn't matter they keep churning outthese studies and they can keepconfirming their hypothesis andeverything thatcontradicts the hypothesis is ignoredand they can get away with it becausetheir fundingdoesn't come from the market yeah i meani thinkwhat you're saying is largely trueit's um you know who would oppose havinggovernment funding and yet it doescreate i mean it you know itby having a single government funder youalso createan easier situation for in industrycaptureright so you can capture it you you havea focus and a targetand that's why you know having the whois so great becauseyou companies like unileverdon't necessarily have to go aroundevery country anymore they can justfocus and targetthere's a concentration of power thatallows for greater possibility ofindustry capturei will say the null hypothesis hasslightly changedsince ancel keys um it is true that in2015 for the u.s dietary guidelines anda couple years earlier for the americanheart association they dropped theircaps on cholesterol and they didin this silent way so that theythere was no press release there's noannouncement nobody knows about itthey they sort of tiptoed away from thatumbut they did their papers actually saywe can find noevidence for continuing caps oncholesterol and that meansmainly that you can eat eggs again eggsfor the egg yolkis what you supposed to avoid the eggyolk is also where all the nutrients areincluding you know some ones that arecritically short in the diet likecholineand also nutrients their need for eyehealthand shellfish of course is the other wasthe other food that wasum that we couldn't eat due tocholesterol also incredibly high innutrients um like the like vitamin b12is is something you find in um i thinkclams is the highest concentration ofb12 anothernutrient of concern and shortage um thatmany people don't get enough of so therehas been a bit of a change in the nullhypothesisthere is an effort now to switch over tosomething called newprecision medicineand it's sort of a sideways shift awayby saying like everybody is individualunique diets and that'syou know that is something that couldn'tincorporate low carb although it'sunlikely that it will because nobodymakes any money off ofum or a few people make money off of lowcarb dietsbut it is hilarious from a scientificperspective i meanif you know about what we know aboutnutritionum you know it's like saying we're goingto designprecision garments for each and everyone of you umwhen you're your your skills insewing you haven't even invented theneedle yet you know we just don't evenhave the data to makeclothes in you know if that's the perilof nutrition much less designeverybody you know their own specifickind ofdiet i mean everybody there's so muchindividuality and we really don't evenknow things that arewe know very little at a at a basiclevel abouthow to make people healthy yeah welli mean honestly i think umuh i i might disagree with that i thinkumall of our ancestors if you go back farenough all of our ancestorsat some point ate meat only more or lessandhe ate plants or animal foods you knowanimal foodsyeah basically originally and then andand yeahand then they started essentially usingplants as uh ways of ingesting animalfats so if you run out of meat you stillkept the fat and then you cooked theplants with it and that wasnutrition and that's how most cuisinescome along soi think for the vast majority of peopleyou know that they could get 80 of theresultswith very very simple uh rules thatdon't need any individuality and i thinkthere's a lot ofpeople want to feel like they're specialand they're uniqueand but really you knowjust quit eating everything that comesin a plastic wrappermade by a giant multinational companyand get one pound of beefa day like i think ninety-nine percentof people would solve eighty percent oftheir problems if they justdid that those are pretty goodpercentagesit doesn't get you all the way there imean there really are stories there arepeople whoyou know who have all kinds of strangeum issues or people who whose metabolismhasbeen broken for so long it's very veryhard for people to recover it's hardonceyou know for as you get older it's likethere are many there's a lot ofthere is a lot of individuality butyou're right that you you need to likehead off in the right direction and weknow what that direction isyeah uh my own brother uh is a medicaldoctor he's with us todayand um him and i used to laugh at thekind of nutrition educationthat he used to get in his medicalschool umi has a question for you do you want tojump inyes hi hi thank you dean uh thank youninauh yeah what's interesting to point outi just i just finished my trainingfinished my residency as a physicianand uh what's interesting to note isjust the lack ofeducation about diet in our curriculawhichwhereas it's pretty incredible how theythey tell you everything about a diseaseand they never mention anything abouthow lifestyle can lead to this diseaseandwhat that has done at the bigger pictureis that we don't think of disease assomething related to diet so we neverask thatabout our patients and everythingrelated to diet is doneby people looking at studies and lookingat macronutrients andso they've separated uh separated thepatientfrom and their problems from the diettwo different people looking at the twoissues and sothat's why we we get to the point wheredietary recommendations just don't makeany senseyeah i mean my my understanding is thatmedical education has been largelyum has shifted to reflect the interestsof the pharmaceutical companies so whatthey're interested inis what are the conditions for which ican prescribea pill or a device or a procedure and sothere and a doctor considers it asuccessful visitif he or she is able to write outsomething on the prescription padand leave that can leave with thepatient that is a successful visitand that is you know that's theformation of the medical education ifyou go to the doctor with symptoms forwhich they do not have a pill or deviceor somethingthey're like well i mean yeah that's alli can help you with soum you know so for instance if you gowith a sleep problem your doctor is notgoing to tell you about meditationor using room darkening or having a coldroom they're going to give you sleepingpills umbecause that's what they're that's whatthe medication is designed to doso i mean it is really unfortunate thatand theyand when they do talk about nutritionand they outsource it toat least in the u.s to the dietitian sothe dietitianhas been trained but the americandietitians association was founded by aseventh-day adventistso they have like they've been trainedin this plant-based diet stuffum and that's you know plants grainwhole grainsfruit vegetables sets needs andnuts and seeds um so that's the advicethatthey're they're going to give patientsand that's how patients are taughtand then they don't get any better andso it's very interesting in the medicalprofession what you seeis they they come to the belieflegitimately that diet doesn't workthey're just like i tried diet i sendall my patients to the dietitian and wegive it a try first before we go for theyou know the procedure or whatever butdiet never worksand that's because the dietitians areprescribing the wrong dietbut it's it creates this sense among inthe medical profession that dietsdon't work yeah it's consistent withtheir observationsuh ahmed can you remember can you tellus what was what they taught you aboutdiabetes and diet in medical school idon't remember the details but could youremind usyeah so everything i all thedietary teaching that i got in fouryears of medical school was this onelecture that was 45 minutesand all they taught us was how tohow many units of insulin do you givefor each different amount ofcarbohydrates that you givethat's that's that's all i ever studiedso the only chart that i saw was just ohif you want to eat dessertgive them that many units of insulin ifyou want to eat apples give them thatmanyand that's it that's awfulthat's astonishing insulin is umprovokes weight pain which they probablydidn't tell you so it worsens thedisease because weight gainalso worsens diabetes it just sends themdown thispath of progressive diabetes and soyou know until very recently and stillinin most of the mainstream diabetes isconsidered a progressive disease likethere's just no wayit can't progress it will progress untilyou cut off your limbs and you havedialysis and you go blind and that's itand so it wasn't until really theexperiment bydr sarah hallberg and the verdict groupthat weeven really understood that diabetescould be reversedfor which they got no uh they got nopress coverageeven though that is again the diseasethat is most bankrupting nations becauseit's a very very expensive disease totreat progressivelythis is for me i think the the the realexposition of justhow absolutely corrupt this is for mostpeople i think in in most people's mindyou know the scientific process is suchthatif somebody managed to actually causediabetes to go into remissionif they managed to get a diabetic personto go back to living normally and nothave to cut off their limbsand go blind most people have the ideathat what would happenis that you know all of the world'sscientists would drop whatever it isthat they're doingand focus on this new whatever it is youknow technique or medicineor whatever it is and they focus theirattention on you know what can we learnfrom this case we haven'tone case of diabetes reversal andin this world we know we havetens of thousands probably millions ofpeople all over the world i meanyou look at these um i'm part of a bunchof facebook groupsum where you know i learned about allthis stuff you know you have groups insouth africa that have hundreds ofthousands of people so there's millionsall over the world that are fixing theirlife with all of thisand the entire scientific medicalcommunity hasexactly zero curiosity to find out whatis going onit's absolutely astonishing yeah ireally i have toi i was at a conference in geneva wheredr sarah hallberg who's one who was thehead of this large umcontrolled trial on reversing diabetesusing a low carb diet and aphone app so they could have continuousimmediate careum to go because they so rapidly go offtheir medications it's necessary to bemonitoredanyway she was on a panel with threeother scientistsum and she's talking about reversingdiabetesand nobody none of the otherpeople on the panel are even curious andi got up to sayum i had to ask a question it's like idon't know if you've heard that drnumber 17 reverse diabetesi understand that this may be anunconventional approach but are you atall curious do you have any questionsfor heri mean it was really just it'sastonishingit's just it's cognitive dissonance it'sit's it'sit's the fact that they you knoweverything that they have learned wouldbe wrongit's the knowledge in the back of theirminds that all the companies that areinvesting in themwould um you know wouldno longer invest in them i mean there itwasone of the people on the dietaryguideline committee i keep going back tobut hismajor he's you know he's got connectionswith nestle but he one of his majorum uh companies that he works withis um one of the big weight loss drugsand that's you know you prescribe thisdrug for weight lossand um and sure enough when the dietaryguideline committee got around toreviewing the science on the low-carbdiet for the first time they actuallywere charged with looking for the signsfor the low-carb diet nowany of us i'm sure any of your listenerswho's been likeeven remotely connected to this way ofeating they understand that there arethere are probably over a hundredrandomized controlled clinical trials onlow carb and this committee could onlyfindone a single one of these studiesbecause one of thecommittee members was an author and sothey they couldn'tignore the one study that actually acommittee hadmember had had been on but there wasjust they justthey um you know it's really not intheir interestto find this dietand they really you know it's like iguess it's like you know the monkey justyou knowjust do not see it absolutelyum peter has a couple questions for youpeter you want to go aheadyeah sure so um nina thanks for that iwanted to ask a questionabout your view on vitamin supplementsbecause some of the ideas that youdiscussed some of the dynamics youdiscussed regardingnutrition signs and non-mainstream viewsreminded me a little bit of the story oflinus paulingand his views about vitamin c and so iwondered what your thoughts were onuh vitamin supplements and taking uhdoses of vitamin c in particularis that something that you think thatyou've looked into and you thinkum can be beneficial you know i feellike i have not looked into that enoughto be able to say anything that i feelis reliable it seems to me that excessvitamin c is easily excreted out ofum out of your system and so there'sprobably no harm in takingvitamin c i know that the studies thatthey've done looking at multivitaminshavehave repeatedly failed to show anybenefit from taking a multivitamini know that the idea is that takingvitamin e umturned out to be harmfuland um and that taking any of those theantioxidant vitamins wereshown ultimately to have no effect or beharmful soi can't say about every single vitaminsupplementum but i know there are multiple studiesshowing thatthat getting vitamin food is isis more you absorb it better i will alsosay about vitamin c is that the need forvitamin cyou know i know people take mega dosestoto prevent colds but to take vitamin cis because you're not eating fruitsay i mean if you're having if you havea low carb dietand and you're eating meat you do nothave the same needfor um vitamin c i mean it's aninteresting question likewhy do they they inuit andnot get scurvy right they're not eatingcitrus fruitsum and the answer is that if you if thecarbohydrate impedes your vitamin cabsorption but you can get vitamin cfrom animal foods and enough of it ifyou are noteating carbohydrates which inhibit theabsorption of thatdoes that make sense i hope that answersyour question yeahi i think it does right peter yeahthat's that's great thank youyeah it's um these these examples ithink the historical examples of theinwit and the messiahare are also two favorite uh examples ofmine and it's it's another example ofjust thea complete lack of curiosity that uhscience has you know if uhif we really did need the modern uhpyramid or theeat my plate or whatever it's called howdid thesepeople survive all of these thousands ofyears inthe arctic where they couldn't growgrains and they couldn't grow fruitsand yet zero curiosity about it nobodywilltalk about it there was a study done byumwilhelm or stefansson in the 1920s youmay have heard of himhe spent a year yeah hei'm sorry i'm sorry go ahead he spent ayearuh up there and he then spent a year atthe bellevue hospitalin new york being supervised by thedoctors eating nothing butmeat and his health was better at theend of the yearthan at the beginning of the year andyet it's amazingthis is an example of just you know noamount of factscan be thrown at the fiat scientiststo get them to change their mind youknow it's you needyou need one example you need one caseto falsify a theory uh they'll all theyalways dismiss it as oh well it's nequals one it's just one case well onecase is enough to falsify the theoryone case of diabetes remission is enoughto show us that uhthere's diabetes is not a progressivedisease that is so hopelessbut there's very little curiosity aboutany of thatyeah i write about stefansson in my bookand that story about him it was him andanother man who actually had a year-longexperiment of eating nothing but meatmeat and fat and it's really it's reallyinteresting to read and everybodythought everybody was outraged at thetime even back then in1926 i think it was but i umbut i was going to say you know it's notjust falsification viayou know one clinical trial or a handfulof peoplecase studies or it's also it's also justsome basic common sense ideas i mean ilive in connecticut wherefor three quarters of the year therereally are no fruits and vegetables nofresh fruits and vegetables and you seethatbecause we have a local farmers marketand you can see it doesn't open up untilmid you know late june and then itcloses in november and the rest of thetimehistorically you would have had nofruits and vegetables so it's onlybecause we have you know we use hugeshipping containers and bring them fromall over the world and get ouravocados from ecuador or wherever thatwe are able toum live this way and that's just likethat's justthat's fairly available common senselike you just could not have your five aday fruit and vegetablesin most parts of the earthum until you know until and just moderntradeand and sorry refrigerated refrigeratedcontainers is really what it tookso there is no like there is it's whyyou know it's funny when we started outtalking about like why it's good to havean engineer's brain but in in the endyou know when i was at stanford istudiedpolitics um and in the endit's it's politics i should have studiedcommunications i should havein pr tactics i mean really it'sthis field is so much more aboutpolitics than it is about scienceabsolutely and uh you know it's uhpeople didn't have access to all thosefruits and they were much healthierlike nobody draws that connection youknow before connecticut could get alltheseavocados from ecuador and all of theseuh grains from all over the worldpeople in connecticut were muchhealthier it's amazing nobody noticeskiki has a question for youi'm sorry but your audio is uh reallybad we can't really make out what you'resayingcould she write it in the chatokay yeah she'll write it um okay welli'm gonna go with carrie's questionwhile kiki uh writes it in the chatcarrie wanted to ask you about canolaoilum what do you think of that canola oilis a it's a product of canada and it'sumit's rapeseed oil and um and it's alsocombined with um they've made it higholeic oil oleic is the kind of oil inin olive oil and it's actuallyprobably the best kind of oil if you aregoing to use oilbecause it has only um it's less likelyto be oxidizedand because it only has one double bondand i'll get into all the chemistry butit's less likely to be oxidized canolais quite similar to olive oil becausethey haveinserted this height this component ofit being high oleicso it is a less a little less likely toumoxidize oxidative oxidation umcreates inflammation which is one of thedrivers of diseaseso in general you know if you knowchemistry and you rememberin school doing your chemistryexperiments you have to you know heat upeverythingto make the chemistry experiment gofasteryou don't want to be heating and cookingwith oils in general becausethey have these double bonds thatoxidize and now that happens much morequickly and much more aggressivelywhen your oils are heated so in generali would useit's also one of the reasons that eatingout is dangerous because mostrestaurants use oilsfor their cooking and frying it'sfar better cook and fry with animal fatsandum but if you use oil for salad dressingor another cold application olive oil isprobably the best and canolais decent as well oh okayi'm wondering um there's uhthe promotion of uh olive oil inum in industry there'svery strong evidence just that the vastmajority of olive oilon the market is at least mixed withcanola and rapeseed and soybean oilrightor yeah i was i've heard it i'm not anexpert on this but orgor like nut oils various kinds of nutsand those areso those are all polyunsaturatedmultiple double bondsmuch more likely to oxidize um rightso when i say olive oil you you don'tknow if you're really getting olive oilbut um if you're doing studies of oilsjustif you if you look up the word you knowother oils saylook up oleic o l e i c and thatis the type of fatty acid that it hasonly one double bondand is the least likely to oxidize yeahi'm wondering how likely is it thatuh part of the push to promote olive oilis due to the fact thatuh soybean and canola and not oilmanufacturersare they they need people to buy oliveoil because that's how they sell theirindustrial waste they mix it in um oh idon't knowi think that in you know in this countryor in the u.si think every every country's this is adifferent story depending upon whattheir native industry ismost olive oil is not made in the unitedstates and sowe despite harvard's um promotion of thevegetaof the mediterranean diet there was akind of hard stop on promoting olive oilas part of itbecause there's no native oh there'svery little native olive oil industryso we need to um promote inour country the oils that we make whichis predominantly you knowand um highlake oils andsalsa oil sensor oil yeah all right wellkikiuh you want to go ahead and ask yourquestion hi nina i'm so glad that you'rehereand thank you for your work i have twoquestions one i'm wondering what thefocus of your group isnow or your next focus now that thesenew guidelines have come outand then also can we look forward toanother book from youyeah those are great questions so mygroupum i would urge you to visitnutritioncoalition.us and pleaseum donate because we do not exist wedon't take any industry money and wereally are supported byum by individuals by peopleum around the world and we're the onlygroup in the world who is working tomakethe guidelines more rigorous theguidance come out every five years sothere is going to beanother round of them and that's goingto come up it's going to start in abouta year and a halfand in the meantime i've been workingwith umvarious academics um sort of thosecourageous academics that are who arekind of at the end of their careers arewilling to speak out to to come up witha series of papers that are um that wewillsoon be able to publish just aboutvarious aspects of the guidelines thatare notum don't reflect the science are notrigorouswhat are some problems with themethodology and the process and our hopeis thatdue to the caliber of the sciencescientists who are who are authoringthese papersthat they actually will have um a bit ofan impactum and we also werehave been instrumental in getting a newnational academystudy mandated by congressto review the dietary guidelines um andto explain whythey are not responding better tochronic diseaseso that's been part of our work and thenumas far as writing a new book um i dowant to write a new book iuh have sort of one in the works thati'm i'mthinking about um that would really beabout this question of veganismand and and how it's been promoted sortof likepulling back the veil on this diet thatisyou know everybody has acceptedespecially young people as being sothe most healthy best option and i iwant to talk about thewhat are the nutritional problems withthat diet um how does it affect peopleand what is some of the politics againit's always the politicsthat are the most um that really havedriven nutrition and i've wanted toexplain thatso i hope you'll be interested in thattopic orgive it to the young people that youknow who are all going veganas a former veg uh vegan vegetarian for30 yearsand now a carnivore um yes i absolutelysupport a work like that so great thankyou for everything and i will donate tothe coalitionthank you well nina this is the timewhereuh i uh i assure you bitcoin if you wantto get donations you shouldconsider accepting bitcoin because uh alot of bitcoins are being going to bevery receptive to your messagebut also i think the long-term visionhere is thatbasically bitcoin fixes everything inthe world and this is a constant runningthemein our uh discussions here and i thinkumyou know my argument how it relates todiet is thatuh you know all when we were talkingabout all the science funding stuff allof that comes from the fact thatgovernment has an infinite money printerthat can financeall these things without regard tomarket feedback sothat's how they can keep telling peopleessentially murderous nutrition advicefor 70 yearsyou know no private company could getaway with that without governmentprotection and the reason the governmentis able to get away with itis because of their money printer andbitcoin takes that awayso you'll get more donations andyou will help starve the beast that uhhas been feeding people all the stuffthat has been uh making them sickokay well i'm you're going to set me upwith that after this podcastexcellent yeah and there are you knowthere are remarkable similarities i meani wish i couldfigure out what is the bitcoin ofnutritionand i think that um it's reallyi mean i sort of have a you knowtwo-part answer that which is that oneiseverybody's in control of their ownhealth so everybody can experiment onthemselves it's not likeyou know environmental pollution we haveno control over that you have controlover your own bodyyour own what goes in your mouth you cancontrol umand so we have the power of doingexperiments on ourselves which iswhich is tremendous what concerns meand is why i care about the nutritioncoalitionis that there are so many peoplewho are unable to like don't have thisknowledge or are unable to control whatthey put in their mouth i meanall of the food programs for the kids atschools and kids breakfastand people who are elderly and people inhospitals and people in prisons andyou know all of that these people reallyare what we call captive populationsthey don't have choiceand then many people who go to theirdoctors you know they just don'tunderstand thatthat is all driven by this incrediblyrigid systemso um i can't figure outhow to get around that i mean thegovernment is in the little time that isort of venturedinto trying to change policy i just youknowrealize what a tremendoustitanic of a ship it is and how hard itis to change and howand how much money there is in investedinin just keeping it just the way it isyeah ithink i'd argue that the bitcoinequivalent in nutrition is getting intouch with your local rancherand getting meat from them and justignoring everything elseignoring all these giant supply chainsthat are out theremaking people sick with all of thatmoney all the centralized foodproduction all the centralized dietaryguidelinesi mean that's what that's the equivalentof central banking essentiallyand bitcoin is the alternative to thatbitcoin is the decentralized alternativeto that so i thinkyou know uh getting a cow from yourrancher andmaking sure that you're friends withyour rancher because uhranchers and uh the meat industry as youknow are under in tremendous attackcurrently and um ultimatelyeverywhere in the world there are peopleuh growing animalsif you live in a society of more than100 peoplethere will be somebody who's growinganimals who's grazing animals and uheating their meat and selling their meatand sothe answer really is for people to justget in touch with that personum keep buying from them directly makesure that theycan stay in business because if theycan't stay in business you know you'reuh left to the the vultures of themultinational corporations to feed youtheir poisonyeah i think it's true there's a sayingpay the farmerpay the farmer not big pharmaand i and i think you know this is truethese and farmers are really underattack i mean especiallyranchers are under attack and they theyumthey in every way um there's justterrible stories i hear all the time umaboutreally you know in england they'reliterallygoing to farms and and harassing them imean you know it's reallyit really is up to people like us tosupport our local communities i thinkthat's truei mean i still have this kind ofcommunitarian sense that likewe do need to take care of people whowho are these captive populations andyou know we do have this problem whereour we don't have enough people to go toour military because we haven'tobesity problem we keep missingrecruiting targetsand then so we don't have a really afunctional military anymoreand that creates um the need forum i guess more drones and more remotekilling and i meanit's just it is a societal problem ibelieve that you shouldfix your own health and take care ofyour own community but then we have wedo have this larger societal problemthat i still you know i believewe have to somehow fixbitcointhat's a good answer yeah this is thisis where this podcast is a little bit ofa trapwe did the same thing with patrick moorewhen we were discussingcarbon dioxide and it's um yeahit also back in bitcoin it all comesback to bitcoin i mean it's uh it'sinsane how umhow much of a monomaniac you become whenyou start getting into bitcoin when youtake the orange bill as they call ityou start seeing the res the effects offiat money everywhere and you startseeing howbitcoin fixes that everywhere well i dothink it isvery powerful convener ofindependent thinkers and umand people who are open to new ideas whorespond to newum observations people who maybe haveyou know a little bit of a maverickmentality i meani see that those are also the people whoareable to or you know to open their mindsthe possibility that a different dietmight be helpful to themso i see this sort of connection andbitcoin has created thatcommunity which is hopefully i meanultimately needs to be a powerfulforce in the world umyou know it's one of the forces that isor one of themovements that is rising up against whati see isincreased corporatism and corporatecontrolabsolutely and the difference betweenbitcoin and other movementsis that bitcoin has a very very powerfulsuperpowerand secret weapon well not secret but avery powerful weapon whichis what we like to call number go uptechnologyand it basically says umessentially bitcoin is designed to go upin value so bitcointhere's no way of increasing the supplyand so over time more and more peoplekeep hearing about bitcoin but thesupply doesn'tincrease and so the only way that morepeople can get into bitcoin is if theprice goes upand so if you get into bitcoin you endupbecoming more influential over time endup having more resources becauseyou're putting your wealth you'restoring it in a superior technology foruh value storage as opposed to peoplewho are trying to make progressessentially while running on thetreadmill of fiat money which isconstantly devaluingso if you just hold money in your bankaccount you're losing purchasing powerand if you try and do other things youknow you need to turn into a full-timeasset managerat the expense of your real work to tryand manage to beat inflationand then you have to pay fees and allthat stuff and bitcoin is justum it allows you that freedom to justput the money in that thingand not worry about the fact that infive years time it's not gonna beinflated away it's not gonna bedestroyed in five years times it willalmost certainly be worth much more thanwhat it is worth today and soa it gives you more financial resourcesand bit frees you up and i think this is avery common experience among mid coinersthat umi i've spoken to many bitcoinersobviously over the years it's justonce you know that you can provide foryour future selfthen things become much more secure foryou and then your mind is clear and thenyou can use your timeto build things that matter and so iit's a much more of along-term focus on long-term approach tolife which isit it almost feels like you're you'rereplacing people's software when theymovefrom fiat money to bitcoin because theygo fromliving on a treadmill uh no mentalclarityconstantly in the horror of you know howam i gonna be able to provide for myselffive years from now into oh well thefuture is now secure and taken care ofand let me think about me let me thinkabout my career the things that i wantto build let me think about buildingthings that last over timeso um hopefully that will uhthat will uh get you on board and uhit is and it's also it's it's it's alsogreatfor me to hear that the bitcoin i was soexcited when you firstreached out to me because it wasexciting to hear thatyour community is interested in thesenutrition ideasbecause our ideas in the world ofnutritionmake no money i mean nobody makesum so in fact medical doctorsare putting themselves you know there'splenty of people who need their help butultimately youyou put yourself out of business if youmake people healthyso there needs to be i mean exactly whatyou're describing which issome other health there has to be someway toinvest in in what will make peoplehealthy without having to worry aboutthe the loss of of risk of incomethat comes with that yeah that's uhthat's the plan i'm sorryi said you've solved that problem toonow exactlywell i'm delighted that uh you're beingsold and i will definitely help you setupyour website instead of donations onyour website we'll be very glad to do itand i really wish you all the best ofluck withall of your amazing work it has beentransformativefor me personally and for many manypeople all over the world you're a herothank you so muchwell thank you very much it's reallygreat to talk to you and your audienceso thank youthank you thank you all right have agood day",
