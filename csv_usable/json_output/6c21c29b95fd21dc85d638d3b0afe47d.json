  "text": "uh we're gonna have um alex wetzky comeup to the stage uh he's gonna take fiveminutes talk about bitcoin and then handit off to a keynote speakerthank you tone yeah this is it'simpossiblei only found out that i was i only foundout that i was introducing uhsome italian guy this morning umand i don't know this italian guyi first heard him actually on tone'spodcast and i was likethis accent i like i can't get out of myhead and it's funny itit's so pervasive that even when i readuh twitter'stweets from this guy i read them in anitalian accentand umsofrom what i understand his talk where'sthe where's the topic of the talk it wassupposed to be something butapparently it's been changed to bitcoincultures andthis actually apparently stems from apodcast that he and i diduh in fact giacomo wrote a piece um ifyou haven't noticed yet his name isgiacomo this italian guyum say whatthe spoiler alert yeah apologies umhe he actually wrote a piece uh for thebitcoin times which is a publicationthat i do once uh once a year and hispiece was called uh bitcoin and the hopcycle soif you don't know the name you probablyknow the sequence which isuhstrong men create good times good timescreate weak men weak men create badtimes bad times create strongmen so hewrote an incredible little piece forthat articleandsorry for that publication and wefollowed that up with a uhwith a podcast in which we just had thisdiscussion asyou know weird people do andyou know we recorded ourselves and weput it live andin there we explored the nature of thekind of personwho seems to gravitate towards bitcoinand actually understands bitcoin becauseyou've gotpeople who are like you know i'm abitcoiner but buy my coin um you'vegotthese bitcoiners from silicon valley whoyou know believe that soy lent is likethe path toyou knowhealth and in the process growman boobs um you've got uh these otherones who like you know libertarians whobelieve in freedom and and theybelieve in the freedom to scam you outof your bitcoinum so you have all like these differentcamps of people that come into bitcoinand most of them if they're kind of toosquarely in one camp they're completely and we were trying tofigure out like where the venn diagramisof people who actually become bitcoinersandmy assumption is that a lot of you inhere kind of fit in that venn diagram umi mean i'm sure there's a few retardshere as well but we will cleanse you ofyour retardedness um so anyway withoutfurther ado umi am going to bring up this italian guywho i'm very skeptical of but apparentlyhe's a good speakerand he's going to tell you more aboutbitcoin cultures[Applause]thank you very muchi don't have such a strong accent i meanthat'sit's okay it's normalokay okay so uh after so alex justreminded you about the the origin ofthis talk of this discussion that was inthis podcast with him after thisdiscussion with him the guy on twittercreated a venn diagram uh trying tofollow up our discussion aboutintersecting overlapping bitcoincultures andand then i made a promise to order noteand i told the guy i will write anarticle about this topic for citadel 21and i will but that was four years agoso sorry uh i still haven't written thearticle but there is a presentation atleast so maybe citadel 21 you could justlink to the video of the presentationand i'm done okay solet's start withthe idea ofmulti-depletionary multidisciplinarityof bitcoin so in order to reallyunderstand bitcoin in order to reallyget bitcoin you need to understand a fewdifferent things it's not enough tounderstand just one if you don'tunderstand at least at a very high levelthe others it's likely that you willmiss some of the characteristics of thefeatures and of the value of bitcoin soof course you need engineers tounderstand bitcoin even if you aresomebody coming from a non-technicalfieldover the last months of years or anyamount of time after you started to fallin the rabbit hole you started to learngood engineering security practices opensource code the importance ofunderstanding even if you if you hearpeople talking about hardware walletsyou may not understand a thing about theelectronics of a secure element but youhave to start to at least understand todistinguish between people who are justbullshitting and people who are makingsense so you need a very high levelunderstanding of engineering and and ifyou don't have that you will find foryou will fall for any kind of pseudotechnological scam which is i mean youknow the crypto industry is full of thatthen you need revolutionaries if youapproach bitcoin just as a technologyyou will really miss its significanceand you will not understand what peopleare doing if the only point is just tomake cool software to make a cool youknow there is this meme right which isthe indian guy with the golden chain imean for the technology and the meme isfunny because the guys is obviously infor the money but even being in for thetechnology itself so there is a meet ameme even the guy making fun of the guywho is not there for the technology hedoesn't understand bitcoin as wellbecause bitcoin is not a technology thetechnology is just functional to the aimof bitcoin and the aim is highlypolitical in a sense it's a politicalbecause it's non-partisan but it'spolitical in the sense it's going toseparate the politics from money fromfrom state and so money from politics soit is highly political and you need tounderstand revolutionaries in order tounderstand bitcoin otherwise you don'tunderstand why the most developers dowhat they dowhy most of the activists of bitcoineducators do what they do they are notreally just playing around with thetechnology they are on a mission theyare on a cruise aid it's it's more thanthat and then you have to understandspeculators and i don't mean that justin the sense ofyou know degenerate gamblers oh i don'tknow if i can say that in las vegas imeangamblers and i also mean that in a verynoblesense of of mises of ludwig miseseverybody's a speculator everybody isgoing to actually speculate on thefuture trying to give up some scarceresources in exchange for other scarceresources with opportunity costcalculation so everybody is literally aspeculatorpeople actually pumping dumpingcoins is a little bit more speculativethan others but everybody is aspeculator and you don't understandbitcoin is you if your computer if youcompletely ignore the economicalincentives and the financial incentivesfor example if you are just an engineeryou may say okay now we have side chainsso you people can just stopprinting coins i mean it's uselessat the point from a technological pointof view your technological goal can besatisfied in bitcoin only so just stopprinting coins and they won't stopwhy because there is an another point tounderstand which is the point ofspeculation the point of economicincentives bitcoin will not be where itis if not for the number go up meme ifnot for the money so many people areentering for the gambling and stayingfor the revolution or for thetechnological advancement so it is agateway for people the speculation it isimportant you cannot really ignore theprice you can pretend price is notimportant price is really importantotherwise bitcoin will not be where itis so this is what you need to know inorder to understand and we werediscussing with alex that you need to beat the very center of thistrianglein order to really get the totality ofbitcoin you may not be deep into any ofthese of these fields but you need toget a little bit of of all of themuh sothe the funny thing is that if youanalyze the cultural the cultural rootsof bitcoin so the regions of bitcoin thesubcultures that generated bitcoin youand there that actuallyplayed a role in bitcoin development youwill understand that the culture werenot really dividing themselves in thisclean way in these circles but they wereactually coming from the intersectionthe very first culture uh which actuallyworked on bitcoin were where they wecalled them the cypherpunks these peoplein the 90s they were all about privacyuh privacy on speech of transaction uhprivate communication over the internetuh julian assange was one of them adambeck was one of them uh they were coolpeople they were revolutionaries theirtheir purpose was not purely technicalthey were not just playing around withcool tech they were actually trying toorganize the social revolution they theworld point wasuh what is called crypto anarchism whichis basically we cannot really achieveanarchism right now because the statehas guns and we have not but when we areonline we can achieve a level of privacythat can makedifficult and expensive for the state tohurt us for what we do so we can achievesome kind of freedom inside thecyberspace even if we don't have thatkind of freedom outside the cyberspaceso cypher panchayat ideology and cryptoanarchism and stuff like that so afterthesatoshi we don't know who they were orhe was but we know that most likelythey he were part of the cypherpunkcultural environment but then you hadbasically a handover then you started tohave engineers they may not really sharea lot of the political motives but maybesome engineers that were coming fromgoogle you remember uh the the guy whocaused the 2013 chain split mike hearnit was coming from google it was it wasa silicon valley type then it went backto the fiat war which is where itbelonged but uhfor a moment bitcoin was developed bypeople that were coming from this othersubculture that i would call the i wouldcall it the culture of the disruptorsthey are the typical silicon valley typethat alex mentioned at them they are theguys that they did the drink silent theythey disrupt the word they create thenew cool software they pitchtheir startup to you in the elevatoreven if you want to get out they're thiskind of people i mean it's good becausewe need them as well without without thebusiness model you don't have incentivesto to play around so having startupersin bitcoin is goodbut it's also cringe worth this sometimeas like i remember in 2013 2014 i was iwas it was full of these people comingto pitch the newblockchain startup so it is a little bitcringe but but it's also useful for forthe overall result and then after sobitcoin started as a revolution then itprogressed as a cool technology todisrupt the banking system and thenpeople started to reconsider seriouslyuh the austrian perspective so what ismoney what is scarcity what is timepreference and then you have scifidianwith the bitcoin standard book andeverybody is discussing these topics andstore of value and saving andbasically storing my time and timepreferences stuff like that so this isnot really something which there is thisnarrative that this stuff arrived inbitcoin later on this is not correcteven inside the cyberpunk movementthere was people like nick sabo actuallythinking aboutthis this very discussion these verytopics about how is money beingselected from society based ondurability on scarcity on uhunforgeable costliness and stuff likethat so there was a lot of austriandebate at the beginning of bitcoin butit came out mainstream later in evenhere likeinin this on this stage cypherian wasspeaking about these topics a few yearsago and and that was very important forbitcoin as well and still you cannotreally forget the other parts in orderto understand the full picture so it'sit's a it's a real uh complexinterplay of different topics uh what isinteresting is that this subdivisionwhich is the subdivision of the originalants and cult subcultures emerging intothe bitcoin culture is alsoright nowsomehow uh umvisible in the in the division of memetribes if you go for example on twitterand you check out what we do mostly ontwitter which is just twitter fightsamong bitcoiners so we just fight sothis man is wrong on the internet and ihave to stay away call tonight to fightwith him uh that's that's what we dobasically and if you actually analyzethe the topics of discussion that thethe the reasons for our wars you willfind that there are some tribes inbitcoin today and these tribes are stillbasically kind of with some exception atthe interception of these of thesecircles so one uh tribe is the ngu tribeso it's the number go up so just likefollowing the austrian economic schoolconsideration they focus on price theyfocus oncentral bank adoption adoption nationstate adoption they focus onhalving cycles they focus on store ofvalue they focus on hudal they will usememes like a huddle and they will say tothe moon and they will put on largereyes and they will also i mean some ofthem are anarchists like i i am but theywill also tolerate the head of state ifthe head of state has lazarus like likebuchela so i mean you're not perfectyou're still a politician i hate you buti also love you because you have lessereyes so there is some level of oftolerance then you have the the otherguys that that are like these are ourcore street breathing bitcoiners and iwould like to call them just to use aneconomy they know kycguys this is also very important forbecause you know kyc know your customerisabsolutely absoluteeconomic illiterate illiteracy it'sbasically ignorance so the point ofmoney is that you don't have to knowyour customer if you are if you own abookshop the point of money is that thethe client the customer has to know thatyou have good books in order to come tobuy books from you so he has to know youeven if you give them the book they haveto know that it's not actually just abrick covered as a book you you're thereto trust the vendor but the vendorcannot trust any single customerotherwise the thethe business could not scale the wholepoint of money is that the vendor shouldnot know his customer so every time youhear about kyc you know that you arespeaking with with absolutely ignorantpeople about any kind of economicinteraction knowing your customer isexactly the antithesis of the idea ofmoney so there is a lot of people thatis uh that is very uh actively fightingagainst this idea of buying bitcoin onkyc solutions andleave your private information insidethe list that get transmitted acrosstons ofchain analysis companies and governmentagencies so you remember when this isjust a little bit of topic but youremember when people started to freakout because they were buying ledger uhdevices and the ledger the list ofledger customers it leaked and so nowsome some people subbed people they hadthe list with your addressmaybe home address delivery addressanyway and the fact that you just hadanother wallet that was enough to getpeople into problems with phishingattacks uh some some other people withblackmailing attacks and even some fewluckily physical attacks so if a listjust containing your address and thefact that you both another wallet isdangerous imagine a list which containsyour name full name legal up to datedocument and andverify the home residency and theaddress of it withdrawal and exactamount of withdrawal and that's getsshared not justby one con company like ledger but itgets shared across different stateagencies and eventually it finds its wayto the dark web and to everywherebasically so kyc sucks kyc is actually ahuge danger for your personal securityand these people there they like toremind it to you and they arethey are the people that actually theyare very were very focused abouton dark dark net market they are allabout you know free ross and they wereusers of the silk road uhi was i was a user of the secret justfor research purposes of course and uhthis is important i mean this is a wholeside of of internet privacy uh theseguys they are different they havedifferent memes they don't like lazereyes they don't like well not all ofthem of course there isn't intersectionright i may be at the center and be partof both and i consider myself part ofboth but most of these guys if they areoutside of the center they will not likelarger eyes or moons they will dress upas samurais for some reason they willuse these katanas and they will talkabout all these samurai terms and uhthey will also the typical guys that wethey will you know the achtuali guy likei mean actually you don't really ownbitcoin if you if you just keep them onan exchange okay sure let me keep it outto my address actually if you don't runa node uh you're just trusting somebodyelse with your privacy so you should runa note okay yeah let's just maybe buy anembassy from star nine labs actually ifyou don't really compile the codeyourselfi mean they could just give you any kindof backdoor inside that embassy which isi mean it's true it's okay uh so let mecompile everything from scratch and thenyou get luke dasher which actually thecompiler of russ is not compatibleitself so it could be backdoor by thensa in the so that's true so eventuallyyou end up mining uh solution directlyfrom the ground to build your chips andand that's what basically where you endwhich is fine i mean uh it's it's alwaysa trade-off between ux and securityright so if you want to mine uh fromfrom the earth your metal to build youryour computer you can uh and thenyou have the intersection uh of thepeople just discussing defy you maythink that all these people are just corners but that's not the casethere are some legit bitcoinerinteresting in advancing strange crazycomplex functionalities on top ofbitcoin we were discussing a little bitin the previous panel uh about i mean uhlike justin was saying uhsomething which i agree withkind ofthat monetary function are basicallyenough and they are very important andif you get them right you don't need alot of the other stuff around but stillthere is a lot of people which wasfascinated fascinated by the idea ofhaving defy anddlc contracts with oracles and dexes andlighting network layer 3 and sphinx chaton top of lighting and all these otherkind of things which can be done in ascammy way or also in a serious way uhso this is this is thethe thing so i i told you that it's notall about coins they defy butthat's true for all of this intersectionuh there are there are some parts ofthis this uh this chart that tend to bemore coin friendly uh mostly youwill have basically these twointersection this the the no kycbra the tribe they tend to you know toanswer any question about privacy withjust use monero you know you know themright you you can see them in chatsthere are many actually they're not thatmany but they use a lot of telegram andtwitter accounts and they come on thischart and you and you say like umi don't know this guyconsolidated addresses after coinjoin soyou could anonymize him and theyanswered justice monero and uh and ithink this is becoming very noisy uh andvery problematic for this differentreason but we will discuss that and thenon the device side of course you havethe the king of coins ethereumwhere the mother of all coins anduh and and there's a lot of i meanthere's a lot of discussion about uh uhbitcoin cannot do these uh i mean rightnow every uh ethereum guy using metamaskwas just shut down by four if they werefrom the the wrong country but still youcan do touring complete stuff so it'sokay umthen you also have like manylibertarians like in the pork fest theylike be cash for some reason probablyhistorical because the roger bear andstuff so many people were verylibertarian they are in the cash scam uhand uh and and of course the peers thenyou are the pure speculators this guyhere they they don't give a aboutanything they just want money and so imeandogs cats oh i don't care i just want tobuy pump and dump and that's that's alli care for which i mean they tend totends to drive them to corner uhthese guys the the austrian so theseguys here these are basically the pureengineers they only care for tech andthey may fall for especially academicscams for example the you know the uhthe algorithm scam and usually they willtalk about blockchains uh this part theaustrians they are kind of okay even ifi i would argue thatuh is strictly kyc only bitcoin isactually coin this this isbasically a discussion about protocol soyour bitcoin protocol your bitcoin nodefollows certain rules and the rule is isa if you receive a valid bitcointransaction following the protocol thetransaction is valid and you shouldaccept it and and you should broadcastit and that's the rule of bitcoin if youinsert any additional rule which changeswhich restricts the space of validtransaction you are soft forking awayfrom bitcoin consensus you're creating asoft fork and if you are the only onecreating the software you are basicallymoving to a coin so uh if you don'tuse your valid bitcoin node to validatetransaction but if you are imposing anadditional layer of rules like you haveto to rejecttransactions which are not coming fromsome list approved by some governmentyou are actually so forking away frombitcoin consensus into a coin sothere are counters as wellsome some of these people i block themon twitter because they are cornersuh but that doesn't mean that all thepeople that are not cornered don'tget blocked by me on twitter because youcan also get blocked if you are twostates for me and where is this thisgetting basically uh so people were justuh about uh uh so we discussed thispeople that were just about engineeringand science even good engineer they tendto be okay with any form of tyranny ifit's justified by scientific purposes soi mean i i want to basically enslave youno that's bad that's very backwards buti want to enslave you for science ohplease govern me harder daddy so thesearethis is the tendency in bitcoin uh aswell and especially in the engineer campalso you know engineers tend to be finewith lockdowns because they didn't havea social life anyway soit's it's easy for them soit's not true that any engineers is islibertarian many of them are prettystatistic with the right kind of statismand then you haverevolutionaries i said that they arerevolutionaries i said that they areactivists they are politically involvedthey want to liberate the humankind butnot always with a very consistentpolitical theory about defense ofproperty right and individual freedom sosome of them may tend to be a little bituhthere is a communist in their in theirmisconception of what freedom is andindividual rights are so you can findthis kind of guys in the very activepolitical spectrum of bitcoin orcoins or crypto or whateverand then you have of course thecompliance guysthese guys again they only care formoney so uh they don't want any kind ofinconvenience uh they don't want to beinconveniented anyway uh just regulateme kyc me text me as long as you let memake money i don't care about freedom idon't care about free speech i don'tcare about individual rights propertyas long as you allow me to get richeryou can do whatever you want to me or toothers and so these are basically threetendency of statism uh cypherpunks or atleast original cypherpunks or no kycninjas they tend to be better in thisregard they are they are oftencorners but they are at least not veryoften statists so that's that's actuallygooduhthere are three kind of struggle betweenthese intersections one is the strugglebetweennumber go uptribe and the defy tribe and usuallythis fight is about changing bitcoin sothe anger the number go up tribe theydon't want to add complexity they don'twant to add cool features they want theyjust want to preserve what is working sojust keep bitcoin working i don't carefor so i have a good friend who ispresent in this room and i will not iwill not name names but this guy is amajor respected bitcoin entrepreneur andhe told me yesterday night that lightingnetwork is a coin for him uh sothis guy is a typical example ofuh of somebody who doesn't want crazystuff on bitcoin for the sake of it uhwhile there are so the struggle is let'slet's add cool features and uhand let's keep bitcoin just money anddoing what it doesin a perfect way you may think that inthe in the defy campthere may be just uh evil people butthat's not the case like if you talkwith the super respected cypherpunk uhcypherpunks like adam beck adam willactually push for a simplicity languagein order to do any kind of smartcontracts on bitcoin so there are goodbitcoin engineers and cypherpunks thatactually want to change bitcoin in verycomplex ways because they are just moreinterested in evolution than they are instability or other or other kind ofthings the second struggle isdefy versus non-kwc this is usually astruggle betweenconvenience and uxand the security and hardcore securityso just give me my easy so the thethe defy guy we just want adoption sohow can this scale to billions of peoplewe have to make it simpler we have tomake it easier we have to make it nicerand the other guy will say no nothis you actually have to compile thecode from source and that's the strugglebut then i would like to spend a fewminutes on these which is probably themost important struggle the strugglewhere even my friends right now aresomebody some sometimes fighting on onthings that i think should not becontroversial and i thinkboth reasons are very very important andshould we should actually consider themas a whole and this basically the nokiac tribe against the number go up tribeso you will have uh you will havetypically the nokia c guy reminding youthe importance of privacy and censorshipresistance and and the ngo will justremind you the importance ofuh basicallysound economics and institutionaladoption and hardest money eating up thethe softer mornings and stuff like thatand this is very important to me becausei think they are the two phases of thesame coinuh if you don't have privacy eventuallyyou cannot have bitcoin why because ifthe system if the governments of theworld if the regulatory framework of theworld can actually force you to changeyour bitcoin consensus into uhcensoring non-kyc transactions ornon-white listing transaction then withthe same kind of power it can also forceyour node to adopt and hard forkchanging the 21 million limits so thereis not there is not a scenario in whichyou change bitcoin to accommodate forkyc so they winand they don't come after you to ask youto accommodate them for 21 million limitas well if if you introduce kyc you willbe asked to introduce inflation as wellif if the the department of the statedepartment of the usa is going tocontrol your utx so set for terroriststhen the fed is eventually going tocontrol your utx asset for monetarypolicy when you will be threatening themonetary policy so there is no way youcan have a bitcoin which is which isregulated and still inflation-resistantbitcoin is inflation-resistant becauseit is unregulated otherwise you get backto e-gold which was inflation-resistantbecause it was gold but then it was justshut down by the government because itwas not private and not censorshipresistant so privacy is important but onthe other way if you don't have soundeconomics your privacy coin is justuseless it's worse than useless isharmful for people seeking privacy whybecause in order to have privacy youneed liquidity if you have the bestprivacy tech in the world but you arethe only one using it you are you haveno privacy if you have a privacy techwhich is less perfect but he has a largeanonymity set because a lot of peopleare using it you have more privacy thatis insane that using a technology whichhas a lot of cool feature but cannot beused by more than 10 people so there isa balance there and the liquidityfollows liquidity so if you have hardestmoney bitcoin bitcoin will basically eatoff the liquidity from the softer moneywhich is your privacy coin and yourprivacy will end up to be lessprivate than bitcoin right now if you sothere are people that say let's justsave bitcoin and when i have to pay formy weed i will use monero so what you'redoing is you are saving bitcoin then youare sending a transaction from yourschool storage to an exchange with usingbitcoin anonymity set which is trackableand whatever then you will enter anorder book of the exchange which a verysmall liquidity with very few peopleexchanging so that would be a hugeprivacy bottleneck reducing your privacythen you will enter a monero transactionwhich even it has very cool tech likesignal to like a ring signature andconfidential transaction still asusually alower anonymity set that the typicalbitcoin can join and then the othercounter party will have to do the otherway around so overall you will reduceyour anonymity than just sendingbitcoin immediately without any anyfurther ado maybe not connectingeuropean with uh with an external nodeand stuff like that so this thisstruggle is very important i think thatboth camps have very good arguments andi think that they are both right andthey are also bought wrong if they don'tunderstand the other the other side uhwe really we literally need both we needharmony and we need the dark money moneyis not really dark if it's not hard andthe other way aroundsoother famous topic and i'm about toclose just just one second so what abouteating meat this is mostly on the ostromi noticed that most austrian people eatmeat and uh what about guns uh it'smostly uh it's mostly the no kyc peopleuh loving guns i love both and uh i i'mtold i'm not sure where to place pokeractually so i just place it like thatfor symmetry but i'm not sure about thatand the last lies is famous example soyou have for example ragnar is a goodguy but now he's a corner becauseit's too far into the no koccamp so it's now it's a cornerwhile for example you have you have uhyou have a mata order with actually uhit's not well anyway you have goodpeople that are still bitcoins whilecaring for privacy a lot at the sametime you have people like safeidianemphasizing the hard money part a lotbut then you have like michael saylorsaying that kyc is good which is not kycis bad kyc is the shitcoin and then youhave people like eric wool i mean ericis a friend but now he's a street cornerand because it was too much into thatfield and then you have adam beckpromoting a lot of different evolutionof bitcoin of course you you can alsohave perfection you can haveabsolute total balance andi don't know who could be that perfectbut somewhere there is some guy likethat thank youthat was awesome[Applause]okay so we're gonna uh bring a lot ofaction items to you in this panel ireally want to get into your guys'sbrainsand i'm gonna separate this into twointo three separate sections the firstone is a little bit of background so wecan understand the bias that you havebecause of your background and whatyou've experienced in the pastsome current events there's a lot ofreally interesting current events thatare basically marketing tools forbitcoinand the last one is going to besuggestions and advice on some of yourfavorite bitcoin companies we'll talkabout places to move you know thiseconomic concept of voting with yourfeet being able to live where you likethe laws where do you suggest thatpeople should move to uh because youknow what's interesting is that bitcoindoes provide financial freedom but whatabout personal freedom when you live ina place that is restricting you right uhso first thing tone i'm gonna ask thequestion to you you are grew up inrussiayes okay so give us a little bit aboutyour background where you grew up andany parallels you see today betweenrussia and where you live now in the usyeah the word russia has taken on a verydifferent meetinguh really we did i think we did a goodjob not making this event political eventhough my channel has been steering inthat directionsoman a lot has changed uhyou know in my lifetime i'm thinking i'mlike you know i still have half mylifetime to go and a lot more is goingto change uhit it was weird like looking back at itthings are so different like when i wasa kid in the soviet union like you don'tfeel the communism like you don't feelthe fact that you don't own anythingthere's no ownership really and when youhave to leave the country when wefinally got permission to leave thecountry australians i think are stillworking on that but um we eventually gotpermission uh to leave the soviet unionandum when we came when we did that we wereonly allowed to leave with 100 usdollars per family membersomething around that amount i mean ahundred dollars per family member boughtyou a lot more in the late 80s than nowwhich is like the three ways governmentconfiscates your money right inflationuhtaxation or they just take itum and we're seeing all three right nowlike exponentially increasing and uhcoming to america you know yeah it'sgreat you now have ownership you came tocapitalismbutumfive or six years inmiddle school plus high schoolthen seven years liberal collegeseducationand suddenlyyou knowyou're again on that socialist communistmindset uh untilum you know you kind of grow out of itand now bitcoin is changing notcompletely so state-run education verysimilar to what we're seeing now youknow public schools are definitely thenorm uh and then also this ability forbank accounts to be shut down nowgiacomo has a different story becauseyou grew up in switzerland correct notreally in italy but you live inswitzerland now i live in switzerlandall right they both have their ownissues especially if you guys saw therecent news about switzerland and we'lltalk about that but how about yougrowing up what was that like and anybiases that brought you on to bitcoinso i grew up in italy whichuh for example recently during thiscoronationsituation the last two years was evenworse than canada or australia i mean initaly you literally had a helicopterchasing down people running along on thestreets you had people uh peoplebasically a young guy 17 being draggedby by policemen with narcotics andbrought away from school because herefused to wear a mask inside the schoolso with policemen kidnapping a guypolice entering university in venezuelato bring out a girl protesting themandates the difference with canada isthat in italy nobody cares so there's nostruggle to report so in canada you havethe trackers and you have theconfiscation of the truck in italynobody cares they just go along with anykind of dictatorship they have as atraditional habit so i think it's justnational custom to just go go along withthe dictatorship so uh in italy it waslike italy at the uh i was not in thesoviet union soi was in the country of the uh thecountry west of the of the yalta linewith the biggest communist party in thehistory of mankind so italy is likeuh the culture of learning how to getalong with the communist regime in asoft waytrying to to escape that so uh when istarted towhen i finished my university i startedto work as an entrepreneur after a fewyears as an employee i started to see onmy skin the 78total tax rate uh tax pressure 78percent on an average employ includingthesocial uh you know the social securitypart and so i moved to switzerland whichfor me was really the land of the freeswitzerland was a place of politicaldecentralization like financial privacysound money also like switzerland wasthe last country to abandon uh the thegold standard so it was a veryconservative country and just about whenit started to to move switzerlanddecided to turn into basically italy 2.0so i so i'm i'm considering that maybei'm the problem and i'm being veryvery cautious about my next movesbut it's still still better than italybutbut but not good don't mess up elsalvador exactlyso you guys are both early bitcoiners uhcould you summarize to the audience whatidea made it click for you becauseeverybody has a different moment wherethey're like wow this stuff is veryimportantthis onefavorite favorite yeah it happened in2013 with a cypress banking confiscationit was right there unconfiscated abilityfor me just like in the presentation igave yesterday it's a fortunatecoincidence you asked that that was theclick for me the fact that it wasunifying my interests that werepreviously completely disconnected sothe week i started to heard to learnabout bitcoin it was november 2012 andin the same week i was part of this proassange uh very like a little bit leftleft leaning uhmodel libertarian group very pro privacypro darken dark net markets and theseguys were actually probably starting todiscuss bitcoin as black market moneyother guys from the italian misesinstitute so austrian guys all aboutgold and motor monetary policy nooverlap with the other guys this onewhere like all the conservativegold bugs completely different they toldthey told me about bitcoin the same weekand then i was working accenture as apayment technology consultant and somecolleagues started to discuss bitcoin asa new technology and so i i started toreally hear bitcoin from threecompletely different separated part ofmy life and up to that point my life wasuh being an activist in one group thatwas despising the other group and andthe other way around and also go to workwith this boring stuff about paymentsnothing to do with my ethicalinvolvement in advocacy groups and sofor the first time there was oneunifying threat and that was the clickfor me yeah serendipity is veryimportant in a lot of things that i feellike how i live my life as well you knowi learned about bitcoin because icampaigned for ron paul for his 2012campaign and it was because you werearound that freedom-minded individualsand you were like wow maybe i don'ttechnically understand this technologybut knowing that the leaders who see thefree world in the way that i see it theyagree with this this was really thatencouragement so don't feel like youhave to understand everythingtechnically in order to take the stepforward and now it's like you know allthe the big banks are getting on boardedwhich leads me to our next topic ofcurrent events okay so in 2020 theoffice of the comptroller of currencyocc said that banks can now custodybitcoin one of the big banks that cameon board to custody bitcoin was bnymellon the oldest bank in the unitedstates i think they manage like 41trillion dollars and they're nowcustodying bitcoin for their clients uhin terms of the future of bitcoin how doyou guys see this interacting i meanthere was an argument early on stagewhere bitcoin is already a store ofvalue it's proven that its use case as astore of value is is very very good uhbut do we see bitcoin becoming acurrency like it was originally supposedtoor should it become legal tender do wewant it to become legal tender what doyou guys thinkso bitcoin already isaa store value and a medium of exchangeand the unit of count evenit just it's just not equallydistributed for example it's a store ofvalue in many cases for many people justbecause it's unconfiscatable and it'sunprintable and so it's good forinflation it's good for taxation it'sgood for confiscation which are theproblems right now for everybodyincluding first world people while it'sa medium of exchange but it's that onlyfor a subset of people that really needthat for example if you can pay withfiat usually because of gresham law youpay with fiat it's like if you're invenezuela and you can pay with bolivarinstead of dollar you just testorize thedollar and you pay with with shittybolivars and you do the same now i paywith fiat if i canso i i don't i tend not to spend bitcoinbut there are a few transactions thatyou cannot do with fiat and that's thewhole point if you want to pay over theinternet with privacy you want to pay avpn and you don't want to give up yourcredit card name then you need bitcoinif you want to pay some developer inindia and you don't want to go throughsome zwiftsuper expensive and super slow stuff youhave to pay with bitcoin if you want tobuy something that your governmentdoesn't want you to buy which could be abible in some middle east country orsome substance or somewhere i don't knowyou need bitcoin if right now even ifyou really want to just do somethingwhich is not political politicalmainstream and you get your payment ratecensored you need bitcoin asa medium of payment as a as a medium ofexchange and then bitcoin is alsoactually a unit of account because ifyou think about that uh the correlationbetween all the coin market andbitcoin is so strong that it doesn'tmake sense for a good trader to price a coin in us dollar terms the youhave to know which what is theopportunity cost for your non-bitcoinhotline so what you do is you measureyour shitcoin trading performancesmostly in bitcoin so it is immediate aunit of account too it's just thatthese three functions are not reallycoming into being at the same time forexample in order to be a medium ofexchange you need also to be a store ofvalue first because medium of exchangemeans that medium of exchange is not anyobject that you can exchange is someobject that you will exchange it thecountry party will keep it until it willbe able to exchange it with another goodor service later on so it's a delayedexchange and so you need to be a storeof value first and then in order to be aunit of account you need liquidity andso you need to be a medium of exchangeso they will take time but it's i meanwe're getting we're getting there i'llmake mine quick i'm not a huge fan ofyou know regulation that allows bank tocustody bitcoin for people because itmakes people lazy and they will letbanks hold their bitcoin which isslightly betterthan the traditional system at least themoney that the banks are holding forthem is not going to devaluebut it's like banks holding your golduh it's still confiscatableand uhif the government wants it they'll takeit souh that's the issue so for the legaltender questionit's legal tender in el salvador i thinkthere's one uh county in switzerlandthat said it could become legal tenderin the united states do you want bitcointo become legal tender that's a reallyhard question i've gone back and forthon that question a couple of times noanswer i can make an argument for andagainst i'm very happy that el salvadordid this because it brought up theconversationuh would i have rather seen el salvadorjuststart buying up bitcoin the way michaelsaylor has and not officially make itlegal tender like i don't believe thatthere needs a law they can just sayyou're we don't care like you can usebitcoin you don't have to use bitcoinyou're not going to be criminallycharged we're treating bitcoin like alike a currency so you're not going toget taxed on it you're not going to gettaxed on bitcoin pro holding bitcoinhaving to go up in value uh so it's justthere like you don't need a law for oragainst it's just thereyeah let's try to break down the conceptof legal tender in its constituencieswhich is basically three parts one partis legal tender is when your governmentacceptthat kind of money that kind of currencyfor taxes or fines or or anything elseand not others so they they create apressure uh they create an artificialdemand because that's what you in orderto pay taxes to the u.s government youneed to buy dollar first so you itcreates a demand and this kind of legaltender with bitcoin is cool i mean iflike in renaissance vital and the cityof lugano officially accept bitcoin forany kind of payment for taxes uh finesor or or town council services that'sfine i mean uh it's just a criminalorganization accepting bitcoin i meanit's okay it's adoption right it's a idon't care if it's a i don't likegovernments uh like i don't like kosanostra or camara or there's chinesetrees but if if cos and also starts toaccept bitcoin that's that's kind ofadoption i mean uh criminals use oxygento breathe uh i i that's not the problemfor oxygens right if it's useful goodpeople will use it and bad people willuse it the second kind of legal tenderis the government forces people to onlyaccept thator better they prevent people withviolence from refusing that currency asa payment this is not a good thing i'magainst this kind of legal tender theonly reason i'm not that against the uhin this el salvador case is that it'sfake like if you read the law the lawsays everybody is forced to acceptbitcoinif the payer wants to pay in bitcoinwhich almost never happens and if theguy who accept bitcoin is not likeimpossibility because of like lack ofinfrastructure which is almost alwaysthe case and if they have infrastructureand the buyer wants to to to to paybitcoin uh they can still convert the usdollar immediately using the thegovernment infrastructure so it's a fakelegal tender mostly marketing move whichis okay in switzerland is kind of thesame the city of lugano cannot impose areal legal tender so they're tryingbilateral agreements with the merchantsto to convince the merchant to acceptthis is a good kind of legal tenders notreally forcing anybody and the third oneand close very quick the third one isactually is implicit form of legaltender which is a monopoly basicallythey prevent you from using alternativeswhich is not the case in this momentthey are not preventing people like it'snot likeel salvador is preventing people fromusing erexactlyyeah and that's that thing is thatgovernment is this monopoly on forcethey use violence to get compliance andthis is what we love about bitcoin isthat there is no violence involved it isan option just like in el salvador nowone thing that's happened recently inthe news is that the eu said that banksare supposed to shut down access torussian accounts now switzerland whichis historically known for being neutralhistorically known for being the privacystandard for banking they now made itand they took that eu regulation a stepfurther and they now took awaypeople's cryptocurrency accounts thatwere banking their cryptocurrency inswitzerland now this is in contrast tocoinbase finance kraken saying we're notgoing to shut downaccounts to russia and for me i mean ilove that that's the mindset of ourpeople right i might not agree with youbut i'm not god i don't get to choosewhat's right or wrongwe're just this is what this technologywas made for now given these on-ramp andoff-ramp obstacles uh what effect do youfeel like this has on the future ofbitcoin and do you guys have suggestionson certain ways that people can obtainbitcoin without having to touch theseon-ramps and op-ramps that do havecontrol all right so i know you're fromswitzerland but i really want to gofirst on this oneumi think this um will affect switzerlanda lot more than it's going to affectbitcoinuh i'm still trying to figure out howswitzerlandmanaged to stay neutral and bankeveryone throughout the entire world wariibut facebook and twitter pressurebasicallyand probably the u.shas made them change everything likeyou're gonna tell me thattheworld war ii situation for six yearswasnot as bad as what happened hereso i think it just says a lot more aboutswitzerlandand uh switzerland's gonna be in troublebecause uh they really don't understandhow they managed toyou know not get invaded during worldwar iiand uhyeah it's crazy it's the same thing whenthey gave up the the swiss numberedaccountsuh but yeah i have to stand with krakenand other companies on this umi mean this is what uhi mean if the at this point if the worldcould cut russia off from the internetthey would try right nowuh and uh we'll see how it goes but uhi'm curious what your thoughts on thisis i i iagree i mean when binance is morecensorship resistant than you whenbinance is more vital than switzerlandyou have a problem switzerland so ithink that uh well you know when youfirstsubmit to to blackmail think aboutsomebody blackmailing you you give themmoney the first time and then there's noway to stop him basically it's it's veryunlikely that a certain point you willsay enough is enough if you if you bendyour knees first then you will just youwould just keep going and that's whathappened with switzerland they bend theknee with the us the us put this kind ofembargo a commercial embargo on them toend the bank secrecy for u.s citizensand they actually they just bent theknee and now there is no no newthere is no threshold there is no thereis no line in the sand there is no placeto stop they will keep submitting andsubmitting and surrendering andsurrendering and complying and complyingthey seem to be resistant to the to thecoronary situation at the beginning of2020 and they basically imposed an evenstricter currency rule in 2021 uh nowthey lifted it magically top down whichis also very bad for switzerlandswitzerland was used to be somethingvery bottom-up with a very local form ofgovernment with a very decentralizedform of power the all the coronationsituation all the coveted restrictionscame centrally from burn and disappearedlast week centrally from burn so it'sit's very centralized right now it'svery non-neutral right now and i don'tthink it's getting better oneencouraging signal is that just like wehave seen in lugano is that if thecentral government of switzerland isgoing to destroy switzerland neutralityand visual decentralization as visuallaw for privacy and some money maybesome local uh some local constituencieslike cities and cantons may start toto make switzerland great again uh thatsaid if they fail uh as stone saidswitzerland is bitcoin not the other wayaround uh bitcoin is the new switzerlandsoyeah yeah and it also shows how theworld's always changing like yes us is asuperpower right nowit's not gonna stay that way for anotherhundred yearsand uh switzerland was known for thisthey won't be anymore might be elsalvador who knows right but the worldwill always change uh this is why wewould never had a one-world governmentand hopefully we can uh give you guyssome tips on where those places arethey're gonna gonna become the next g7countries uh but just in terms of justvery directly any companies any placesyou can send people to uh get bitcoin onramps that are nothaving to subject you to kycaml well oneis a sponsor here it's at steko it'sgreat you go with cash in a place youbuy a a voucher and then you you buy uhyou buy bitcoin on the overthinker nokyc nothing there are somelowlet's say like light kyc platform rightlike a rely or beat pocket inswitzerland you pay with a bank accountyou don't have to kyc but you leavetraces of your bank account name so it'sa lower level of risk but still a riskfor privacy it's a similar situationwith old lodel is an exchange which isnon-custodial so you can buy without kycsorry he has an accent so yeahthank you for translating it speaking ofa stucco there's literally money on thefloor right so there are a stuccouhenvelopes under every seat so if youhaven't gotten one yet i meanyeahbasicallythere's and then there's also bisquebisque yeah bsq is even better becausethere is no central platform the onlyproblem is that it's not great for noobsbecause in order to buy on b skill youneed to have bitcoin firsti would say the easiest way is to minebitcoin you get bitcoin that are cleanuh and you get it in a i would sayslightly different way well lookeventually as uh once you start usingbitcoin you're not going back i meanmaybe mike hearn uh there's very fewexamples uh maybe rajavir like once youget on bitcoin you're staying there soas more and more people get on more andmore people are going to pay in bitcoinmore people are going to want to acceptbitcoin it'll still spread without ngyeah exactly it'll still spread so sotalking about current events againeverybody here is politically cognizantand that's what i really love about thecrypto community so we all know whathappened in canada with the truck surewith the truckers people donated to adecentralized crowdpeople donate to a centralizedcrowdfunding platform that list wasleaked that list was so leaked i havethat list of people that that donated tothis platform right now what happened isthat those people who were canadiansthey got their bank accounts shut downnow what do we think about encouragingpeople to send crypto to war-torncountries i mean is this the correct wayto go about it are we getting scrutinyby governments because of this and alsolike what happens those ut exos whenbitcoin is sent to that wallet and thething is too is like with ukraine uh ithink donations to ukraine hit anall-time high like how do we know thatthat money is even going to ukraine so iguess the overarching question is uhwhat is your sentiment for peoplesending money to war-torn countries andis that also traceableso the first question is very difficultto answer because it depends i mean howdo you know that the money will be usedfor for the for the declared purposesyou don't know you have to you have toknow people bitcoin doesn't fix that uhdoesn't at all you have to know peopleyou're sending money to you have to toverify somehow so that's remainsdifficult about true stability though isdifferent uh we we like to use simple uhblack and white on and off memes likebitcoin is unconfiscatable because it isuntraceable of course reality is allabout cost of attacking the the realityis that you can trace bitcoin even ifyou use any kind of technology ofprivacy technology if you put aconfidential transaction and zeroknowledge proof still if the governmenthas a a camera on your face and yourkeyboard and your screen 24 hours a daylike like in orwell uh there's noprivacy because even if you use bitcoinwith the great technology they justtrack youif they read your mind there is noprivacy so the point is makingmaking spying or new more expensive sois it possible for a government totarget an individual and to try hard tode-anonymize him using different kind oftechniques from from from backdoor to tospyware yes it is is it possible for thegovernment to trivially track everybodywith very low cost like they will bethey will do with the banking system noit's not if you pay with the don if youdonate with bitcoinyour name is not there unless you put iton the donation form but otherwise yourname is not there they can try to traceyou if you don't usebest technology uh best technologypractices like coinjoin and and coincontrol and avoiding kyc but even thatis very expensive because they have totarget you and if you do use the bestpractices then it's still possible to goassange or go or no one on you with thensa satellitelooking at your fingers on a cable surebut that's very expensive it's like isbitcoin confiscatable well it depends ifyou get to guantanamo and get torturedfor 10 years maybe you will reveal yourprivate keys okay but that's a bitexpensive to do on seven or sevenbillion people so not that they will notwant to but they cannot do the the froma cost cost opportunity point of view souh i would say if you donate withbitcoin your privacy is safe in primafacie uh unless you get targeted andthen you you needand the the the the better you manageyour privacy like with coinjoiningcontrol and avoiding kyc whenever youcan the better for you so he's broughtup assange twice which is a reallyreason why one of uh one of my mainfunctions of business exists because onething that happened with assange is whenassange got picked up at the airport itwas because they pulled his passport ifhe had another passport he would be fineright now he would be probably hiding insome country right but because he onlyhad one passport they weren't able imean they were able to restrict him fromleaving the country nowbitcoin does provide financialsovereignty but what about physicalsovereignty i think this is veryimportant because you can have all thebitcoins stored safely in the world butif they pick you up for whatever reasonyou know the government is a monopoly onforce then we don't have any protectionsso tone i know you know about this topicas wellbut what do you think aboutplaces people should move secondcitizenship citizen by investmentresidencies people should be located alot of it is changing i would look atcountries that had the least amount ofcoveted restrictionsuh that's basically my list it's a shortlist or countries that had you know eventhey kind of went bad but then they dida full 180. um so even a place like theuae in dubai they had a strict lockdownfor like a few months and they're likethis is insane and they stopped umthe uk took him a little longer therewas like it was insanity for like almosta year and then they're like hey that'sit done mexico never really had itso you want to look at those el salvadorsame thing never really had anythingmajor and then they went that's it doneand then there are places like hong kongand singaporethati think they'll be locked down for adecadeaustralia will eventually open up maybei don't know so that would be my listand it's not about having a a bunch ofpassports my view on a little bitdifferentum yeah you want to have just one or twopassports not eightuh because if you have eight passportsyou're now subject to eightlaw eightsets of laws that apply to you all overthe world at the same timeso you are really breaking the law allthe time in one of your passports um somy view is you try to establish as manyresidencies as you canand once you maintain those residencieslong enough it's an option it's like acall option you can call it into apassport eventually so have maybe one ortwouhand uhmaybe sorry more one have two or threepassports and try to get like eightresidencies in other places where youcan just live and convert them into apassport if you need it well iabsolutely agree with don i will justmake iti would just differ on one opinion ithink you have to match the new tendencyto uh totally totallytotalitarianism uh from kovid with theold one previous one for example uh likebelarus is a country that was perfectfor covet jurisdiction no covertrestriction at all for two yearsyetthey will not hit you because you go topro protest against uh trudeau uh butthey will hit you anyway if you go toprotest against lukashenko for they sothey didn't need a new excuse to becomeaggressive because they already were soprobably you have to balance there is aonethe very verybad thing is that the list of countriesnot terrible about chronologism is notoverlapping with the list of countriesthat were were not terrible before so uhlike i will never move to sweden i meansweden i was known to be a socialisthell with a huge taxation and now swedenwas the best in europe for for coronadoso it's complicated one last thing thati will add is that uh you should read avery old book which is pray bitcoin butvery prophetic about bitcoin which isthe sovereign individuals that startedthis this kind of idea of uh yeah againvoting with your feet as you werementioning and uhthere are there are several there areseveral ideas following this idea ofmoving around to a shop to do uh citizenshopping or residency shopping uh onething that these people uh started totheorize is the seven flag theory so youshould have this part five five oh yeahfive right well it's four now bitcointook off a flag remember exactly bankingno longer needed four flags now you mademy point uh you don't need to care forbanking anymore you just need to pay foreverything else you still have to carefor everything else but bitcoin fixedone flagand i i think that the countries weshould really be like boy are you oh i'msorry are you saying that the metaverseis not gonna fix another flagwho's plugging in to neuralink andsucking their body into the matrix notmeokay so uh in terms of the countriesthat if you can't leave the unitedstates obviously i'm a huge proponentfor miami right i need more people therewho are not umwho are freedom minded so if you guyswant to stay in the u.s miami florida isdoing very well and we want to keep makesure that that local community there isof people who are of the like-mindand then you look at yeah you look atlike the different the different regionsof florida and what the p what thepeople in power are doing there isreally meant uh to keep florida as afree state now in terms ofinternationally obviously el salvadorthey're building a citizenship byinvestment program in bitcoin thatthey're accepting um and then southamerica you know it's not too far butthe laws there are really turning to bebeneficial now uh yeah south america andafrica is i believe will be the futureuh so g7 countries you've been the nextg7 countries in this next era of theworld where do you think they arewell yeah i will agree africa and southamerica eastern europe is interestingbecause one one one criteria is to go ina place where laws are goodbut another is to go in places wherelaws are very bad and nobody cares andnobody enforces them which is also veryinteresting because it's more it's moreanti-fragile so if you go in a placewhere where like for example there arelike mexico yeah like mexico or or likeserbia or like albania croatia there aresome like eastern european baltic wherethe government doesn't have enough moneyto have this very strong monopoly andalso the culture islikeex-soviet uh cultures are immune togovernment propagandas like if you ifyou grow up in serbia you know that thegovernment is lying but as default soyou don't really care and enforcement isvery difficult and that's better becausefor example there have been moment inwhich in switzerland situation was worsethan italy because in italy laws werevery bad but they have many places notcompliant his visceral laws were betterbut everybody was complying like a ship and so it was verydifficult to to find a non-complianceisland so uh africa i think africa isgreat i mean i i struggle to imaginesomebody really following laws in africait's great i mean i always i alwaysbring up the example that there's a lotof places in the world that never putdown telephone lines and then they justimmediately skipped a generation oftechnology and they went straight tocell phones because they didn't have theinfrastructure to do so and so lookingfor countries that fit that mandate isvery important okay so i have two rapidfire questions so answer very quickly iknow you guys have big brains so there'sa lot to talk about and then i have onemore question just to leave everybody ona note of what can we do personallybecause this is a decentralized movementwhere the individual does really matterokay so first question how low doesbitcoin go to remain bullishuhvery i'm not a technical analyst liketone i i really i don't understandnumbers but instinctively if the low ofthis cycle is higher than the high ofthe last cycle i think we're finebecause what that meanslike a rule of thumb is that uh themoney entered the previous cycle learnedthe lesson and it's not going to getscared by this the bearish moment so ifbitcoin stays abovenot 20 000 but the the equivalent of 20000 at current purchasing powerwhich i guess would be around i don'tknow 27 000 i think it would be fineyeah uh my target is actually even lowerthan that as long as bitcoin doesn'tspend more than a weekbelow 20 000 i think everything is justfine do cme gaps matterthere's one at like no17 i don't think they matter at all okayum the next question is favoriteprojects in bitcoin you think everyonehere should take a look at and need alittle bit moreinfo like they need more highlighting onso there is a some effort to do easylibraries to the uh bitcoin multisig ina in a good way that could be used forinheritances and stuff like that uhkiara this morning told you about this203 multisig and stuff like that this isalready possible right now but there areeven more possibilities like having anaccount which is three or three so verysecure but it becomes two of three afterfive years and it becomes one of threeafter ten years so you can use it forinheritances and stuff like that bitcoincan already do that from a protocolpoint of view but doing that in astreamline in a very secure way withstandards it requires libraries bestpractices and tutorials andinterfaces so it will take time and bdklibrary is great for that and stuff thatthat companies like uh spectre andsparrow and nunchuck are doing is arevery very important and the secondwe're real low on timeokay real quick name the company thatyou were going to say spectre sparrowyeahlet's also follow wasabi and wasabisparrow right well other than ouramazing sponsors uh socheck out what they do uh i i reallyi i'm i've never even used it but ialways push liquid the liquid side chainbecause one of the reasons why coins like ethereum like binancesmart chain uh like open sea why thesethings are so powerful or because peoplekeep building their garbage on top ofthem uh but you can build that garbageon top of bitcoinand uh that would really suck a lot ofvalue out of them uh so liquid sidechain rgb uh the bitcoin side chains andif you really need to launch that tokeni mean at least do it on bitcoin unlessyour technology will be silent so we canonly argue the merits of your projectnot the tech of your project",
