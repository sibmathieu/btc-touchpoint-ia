John's College Santa Feas most of you know I welcome all of youthis evening to our annual steinerlecture a part of the deans lecture andconcert series which is open to thesanta fe community as well as to ourcampus community this year we areespecially pleased to offer the steinerlecture as part of our conference onliberal education which is itself partof our year-long celebration of the 50thanniversary of the santa fe campus ofst. john's the steiner lecture honorsthe memory of andrew steiner an alumnusof the college class of 1963 the AndrewSteiner visiting scholar fund has thepurpose of bringing to our campusespeople of distinction with freshperspectives on the work done at thecollege our former dean eva brand whooffered to talk for us this afternoonintroduced the first steiner lecture in1992 on our annapolis campus I wasgrateful to be present for that firstlecture and for miss brands eloquentintroduction I knew Andrew who was aclassmate and friend of my father and Ispent many hours at his home as a childhe loved st. John's College where histime as a student had opened up for himthe expansive horizons of an intelligentreflective artful and humane life Irecall him fondly as a man of gentle witgood humor curiosity generosity and warmaffection for family and friends he wasa loving family man and a successfulbusinessman but one who clung to thesense that the best of life involved thegrace of intellect art imagination andconversation all to be shared withothers there can be no better tribute tothe high purposes of a liberal educationthan such a life and our Collegecontinues to be grateful to his friendsand familyforeign dowing the steiner lecturein his honor my colleague and a tutor atthe college Michael Gallagher will nowintroduce our lecturer it is with greatpleasure and with even greaterappreciation that I introduce oursteiner lecturer dr. Roger Scruton dr.Scouten comes to us with a PhD inphilosophy from Cambridge University acouple of honorary doctorates ineducation as a barrister at the ends ofcourt London and a long teaching careerhe has authored over 40 books a body ofwork that is impressivelyinterdisciplinary I've not yet had timeto read all of these books but I wouldlike to mention one of my favoritesentitled death devoted heart sex and thesacred and vogner's Tristan and Isoldethis astonishing book through musicaland philosophical analysis allowed me toappreciate the beauty and depth ofvogner's opera like never before it didso by showing me the possibility of ametaphysical pleasure that one can takein seeing our contingency as individualsand what it would mean to be able toovercome that contingency it also showedme how music can explain the conditionof man to himself and how he might beable to embrace that condition if onlyhe were brought up in a different way Iexpect the doctor students thoughts onarchitecture will be no less meaningfuland penetrating for me at st. John's wedon't read much if anything aboutarchitecture what comes to mind is onlySchopenhauer's discussion of it which weread in the music tutorialSchopenhauer claims that the aim ofarchitecture is to quote elucidate theobjectification of the will at thelowest rate of its visibility where itshows itself as the dumb striving of themass devoid of knowledge and conformingto law perhaps dr. Scouten will in someindirect way challenge that claim whatmr. stern will directly speak about aswe know from the brief description ofhis talk is the importance ofarchitecture for a humane education onethat will allow us to settle downI find this idea intriguing and wonderif a humane education is for dr. Scrutonthe same as a liberal education or is itrather than being liberally educatedmakes it possible for us to treat othershumanely for I must admit that I findunsettling the notion that the goal ofliberal education is settling down soI'm very excited to hear what he has tosay please join me in welcoming RogerScrutonthank you Michael Gerber for that kindintroduction I'm very honored to beasked to give this lecture and I'mgrateful to the in sterling and to SanJohn's College it's my first visit hereand I must say it is the most impressiveinstitution and if it's surprising thatit's lasted 50 years it's only becausesuch a thing must arouse intenseopposition among the semi educated butnevertheless it's it's obviously goingstrong and I I wish it another thousandyears I've chose to talk aboutarchitecture for the reason that Michaelhas already hinted at that when peoplestudy liberal arts syllabus at least asI know it they tend to concentrate on onthe written word sometimes they branchout into music they have the example ofthe quadrivium the meet the medievalcurriculum which which emphasized musicas part of it but the visual tends to beoverlooked and in particular that aspectof the visual which is part of all ofour education the way in which we associal social beings try to fit ourenvironment to ourselves and ourselvesto our environment and that's what I'mgoing to be talking about today so I'llbegin from a definition of madness themad person wants a total solution evenwhen especially when there is no problemand if you think about it it's obviousthat all the most influential people inour time have been mad Lenin HitlerStalin Mao just look back at they're notjust at what are their deeds but attheir writings and you'll findunmistakable elements of paranoia butit's true too in architecture Gropiuswho founded the Bauhaus look Corbusierespecially the architecturalguru of the interwar years right down tothe starchitects as they're called todaylike liebe skinned and Richard Rogersand I'll give you an example here thecorbusier's plan for Paris there it isthere's a solution but the question iswhat was the problemoh here is the problem normal naturalhuman beings in a beautiful humaneenvironment clearly unacceptable now asyou know Lu cabooses plan was never putinto action although he put a great dealof pressure on the mayor of Paris to putit into action he was finally ableduring the war when he was architecturaladvisor to the Vichy government toimpose it on the citizens of Algiers byoverruling the the mayor of Algiers buthe never got much of it built but whatdid happen is some while sure in aminute is that a first attempt toputting into practice into practice nowthis brings me to the topic of humaneeducation what should it be obviously wemust learn not to be mad this is thehardest thing because it's this is themost tempting solution to to lifea madman doesn't have to communicatewith others he communicates only withhimself there's no limit to his schemesall he needs is the means to take overthe worldsometimes people withhold those meansbut other times or other too often theyprovide them so a madman so to overcomethis madness the first thing to do isthat we must understand boundaries thereare thing there are boundaries in our inconduct in thought in feeling inrelations beyond which we should not goor at which we must ask at leastpermission to go and humility consistsin the knowledge of these boundaries wetry to adaptbehavior and our way of life to thefabric of the actual and you saw alittle bit of that fabric in that withthat old boy on his bicycle in Paris andin literature too this is what we learnwe learn to sympathize with with otherforms of life with other people withother thoughts and we learn not to playGodprofessor Rick's made a very usefuldistinction yesterday betweenidentifying with someone andsympathizing with them he complainedthat his students only responded to awork of literature when they could sayoh yes I identify with thatbut of course identifying with somethingmeans transgressing the boundary itmeans going across from the your yourrealm into the realm of the other and toa certain extent extinguishing him realsympathy means maintaining theboundaries while also recognizing thevalidity of what's belong beyond themand in literature this meansunderstanding things like the right wordthe right and the right phrase the rightway to express a feeling or to engagewith another person and this is shown inin dialogue the great writers are thosewho can manage dialogue and inarchitecture it's shown to some extentin the with the with the experience ofthe right texture producing the textureof the city or the texture of your roomand texture of your house and this isthe little bit of Paris that did sufferfrom from local boosie's mad scheme itwas put it's not his scheme but it's thesame idea Renzo Piano and Richard Rogersmanaged to get permission from the mayorof Paris who had been forced into thisby President Pompidou because this wasto be a monument to pimpy pompidou'spresidency and a very appropriate one towhich is the Sante Pompidou in Pariswhich is supposed to be a kind of Palacedevoted to the Arts this is where youcome to see exhibitions to hearexcruciatingly modern music and so onand of course it has its defenders butthat none of them live in that part ofParis so now this brings me to a littlepiece of philosophy already ever brandin her excellent talks this afternoontouched on some of these questions inour ordinary reasoning and thinkingabout things we distinguish means andends and of course there are problemsthat we need to solve you know it's notjust that madmen have the idea ofproblems we do try and solve ourproblems and especially in the realm ofarchitecture we build things for a useas this College was built and so we domake use of instrumental reasoning butwe can reason instrumentally reason asto what is the appropriate thing toperform a certain function and so onwithout creating an entirelyinstrumentalized world in a world inwhich there everything has a function offits together like a machine but nobodycould is clear as to why you shouldbother to set the machine in motion whatare you trying to achieve by it now at acertain stage architects worried aboutthis it with the birth of the modernmodern architectural materials andmodern ways of building and inparticular Louis Sullivan the greatarchitect in himself who is his workeverybody knows from Chicago he arguedthat that in architecture function isall-important and that form followsfunction so you've got to get thefunction right and then the form willshape itself around the function and bebeautiful for that very reason butactually that is the opposite of thetruth in my view its function thatfollows form and I want to give you onetwo examples about this in a minute butjust to make a general philosophicalpoint the means that we need to achievean end are discovered but what about theend how do you get knowledge of the endsof whatyou really are trying to achieve this issurely part of what education issupposed to be giving us a sense thatsome things are worth pursuing otherthings not a sense that when havingachieved those things that are worthpursuing we have arrived at a goal whichcast credit not only on usbut on the whole process which camewhich led to this this conclusion andends are very difficult things to teachthat is they're not so much discoveredas revealed they're revealed in artthey're revealed in religion and they'rerevealed in our personal lives and inthe whole realm of intimacy and lovewhich each of us tries to create forhimself but unfortunately when weconcentrate purely on function we createa world without ends the purelyfunctionalist City and that is whatRogers and piano celebrating that workthat I just showed you this thing it'sit's a world in which even art is amachine here is just to illustrate thepoint it's a I show you the distinctionbetween means and ends in London thereare two buildings in the foreground andthree crammed together in the backgroundthe three in the background are clearlydevoted to a function harboring as manyoffice workers in a state as near tosuicide as possible for as long aspossible they have it the function isclear but there's nothing to them apartfrom that function and the result ofcourse is total ugliness they they're ablight on the city on the left hand sideis the Bank of England built for afunction but actually with all kinds ofother things going in it on in it nowbut built in particular with an eye tothe street a long colonnade on thestreet which keeps the atmosphere of thecity in place the texture of the citywithout destroying it on the right isthe old Stock Exchange building anotherclassical building neither of these canbe demolished because they are obviouslynational monuments and very beautifulinterestingly the stock exchangebuilding no longer harbours the stockexchangethere's a rather wonderful restaurantinside offices and other functions andthe thing is moving on all the timeand it's a very good illustration of thefact that in this case function followsform there is the beautiful form andpeople try to find functions to fit itthat the buildings in the backgroundwhen their function is ended they willhave to be demolished at huge financialand also an environmental cost here isanother example this is the transformerstation in Islington I'm sorry about thestop sign I couldn't remove that butthis was built as an electricity stamptransformer station and a reallywonderful piece of architecture Innis ina street fitting into the atmosphere ofthe street it now contains shopsrestaurants and offices again peopledecided to keep it and of course itbeing there has led huge queueadded huge kudos to the businessesinside you have a who flourish partlybecause of the attractiveness of thebuilding where they are right so that'svery obvious and it brings me to thequestion of aesthetic judgment what isit what is it that we do when we judgethese things some as good and some asbad and and try and make choices this isone of the great questions of philosophyto which I have devoted much of mylargely futile life are in futilebecause I'd never be able to persuadepeople that there is such a thing asaesthetic judgment even though it seemsobvious to me but in the 18th centurypeople when people first began to takean interest in this they made adistinction between the beautiful andthe sublime they said that there arethese there is an an aspect of the humancondition which causes us to make thesejudgments of things and say that we likethis we don't like that we want to bewith this we don't want to be with thatand so on but they weren't all the samekind of judgment sometimes people judgethings as beautiful when they are sereneand welcoming and comforting sometimeswhen they're frightenedand wild like a an open desert or astorm at sea we can't call thembeautiful but we still will find themaesthetically appealing and we call themsublime but and that's probably aperfectly reasonable distinction butthere are a lot of other distinctionstoo we call things dainty elegant ordumpy and and squat you know all sortsof things all sorts of words come tomind when we make these aestheticjudgments which we use to justify ourchoices and they all in the end comedown to a single set of ideas but somethings are right and some things arewrong some things fit and some thingsdon't fit and that's obvious from thatfrom the example of London isn't it thebuildings in the in the backgroundthey don't fit either to each other orto the city the one that buildings inthe foot in the foreground do seem tofit and they seem to fit to each otherso there's a city right now trying tounderstand this was something it hasbeen a huge philosophical problem overthe years and this is the only bit ofphilosophy I'll I'll impose on you butthe the greatest philosopher ofaesthetics was Immanuel Kant who arguedthat although these government thesejudgments are in some sense subject ifthey say they depend upon our responsesto things the way we feel about them weare nevertheless compelled to seekagreement we are seat suitors foragreement we want others to share ourjudgments and when they don't and whenthey impose their judgments on uswithout constant consultation we are wecan be offended more than offended wemight actually want to impose our viewupon theirs it's one reason why we havesuch complicated legislation aboutzoning and town planning and so on soaesthetic judgments are judgments to beshared we've if we think that this isnot true they know that we can all livein our own subjective views it's partlybecause we're thinking only and somenarrowarea you know where perhaps we disagreeabout paintings or about music you likepop music and I like classical and so onand who's gonna settle the argumentthat's true that in there in certainareas it's very difficult to come toagreement but there are areas in whichagreement is absolutely essential andthose are the areas where all of us aremaking judgments it's what I call theaesthetics of everyday life and here'san illustration of it children alreadymake these judgments the human beingalmost jumps from the womb with anaesthetic agenda and his mother respondsto it and he to the mother likewise andhere you see in the faces of those twochildren what Vic and shine would callthe natural expression of aestheticjudgment they're trying to get it rightthey're trying to fit those plates andcups and bowls onto the table so itlooks right and that's that's all partof arranging it for a ceremonialoccasion and they're arranging itprimarily for others you can see therole of the aesthetic judgment is notjust in in expressing the individualtaste of each of those little girls it'sin preparing the whole table for acommunity and that's one of the thingsthat people tend to forget aboutaesthetic judgment that it isessentially outward directed towardsother people and it's why aestheticeducation matters it doesn't not becauseit matters to you though it does but itbecause it matters to all of us and whatmatters here of course is is the way inwhich we make forms the way in which wecompose things will actually get thingsfitting together the form of ever of theform of things is understood because wecan understand the relation between thepart and the whole between the thecrockery on the table and the shape atthe table between the colors of eachdish and the colors of its neighbors andso on the part whole idea is absolutelyfundamental to our way of arrangingthings and in everyday life we build inthis way towards some kind ofplease as when we lay a table like thosetwo girls or when we furnish a room andwe do this that by creating forms butthese forms become apparent only throughthe the light the shade and moldingsthis is something I'm going to go ontoin a secondshadows and moldings create a kind ofgrammar of form and this this is thisgrammar irritates things that we findelsewhere in our love of beauty and ofart in every area of aesthetic judgmentwe look for some kind of regularityconvention rule guided nests in a Buhl'sus to judge and those little girls youknow they have a mathematical sense ofhow things should be arranged on eachside of the table and where the objectshould go and they're putting thingstogether according to a grammar thatthey've learned partly through beingtaught and partly instinctively here isan example of a form without grammarthis is Edmonton library anarchitectural masterpiece of recentyears well you see fluid forms whichhave no obvious part-whole relation toeach other they are simply wrappedtogether and dumped in the street thisthis is a very famous example of adeviant grammar this is MichelangeloMichelangelo staircase in the Laurentianlibrary where he uses all the forms ofBaroque architecture or what Manneristarchitecture and uses them in completelyeccentric ways you will see the thecolumns that are embedded in the wallstanding on consoles as those littlerounded things that stick out of thewall as though they didn't need to beheld up by anything in particular andthe staircase flows all over the placebut nevertheless it has an extraordinaryatmosphere of both serenity and energyand people used to teach architecture sothat so so that this basic relation ofparts to whole and part to part was partof the discipline this is what aestheticeducation was for architects in thenineteenth century this this drawingcomes from a textbook used at the PrattSchool in New York which shows obviouslycomponents of a task and column and howthey how they fit togetherhow the cornice how the architrave fitson the Capitol and so on but drawn insuch a way that the student also learnshow the light falls on itand where the shadows are cast and partof the education was to learn to drawthose shadows and there's hardly anarchitecture today I think who couldactually draw the shadow on a Corinthiancapital in the middle of the day this isa this is something requires you knowthree three months of learning but it isessential to knowing how the parts fittogether and and this is one reason whymoldings matter this is just a verysimple example of a door surround youwill see these all over architecture inAmerica right up until about 1950 andyou can probably still get from thetimber merchants these kind of moldingsif you want to put them around the doorand it is the right way to put thingsaround a door cause it creates a properedge and the edge is not created by thewood it's created by the shadows andthat's something and those shadows haveto be themselves sculpted in this waythere they come there they are as itwere created by the coming together ofparts just so to illustrate they saidthis is an a gothic molding obviouslywhere you see exactly why how the gothicarchitects use this in order toarticulate their buildings and make themglow with a sort of inner life but thatlife comes of course from the the lightsthat falls on them and here's anotherexample a very ordinary example this isa wall that on the left-hand side I'mpointing to which is some in Pragueand the wall of the garden of a palacewhere you see what would otherwise be ahuge and rather ugly expanse tamed bymolding by the cornice along the top anda string course down the middle and atiny little lamp sticking out at oneplace and a little door at another allof this gives it a sense of of being acomposition and not just a block andthis was carried over the the itsfamiliar to all of you from Manhattanall of you who've been to Manhattanwhere the architecture that was used tobuild that city in the 19th century wasentirely influenced by what architectslearned in school then which was exactlycomposing things in that way no no it'sno serious architect would say that thiswas done correctly and of course theabsurd fire regulations have made itrather hideous in one respect but evenso you can learn to block out the fireescapes and still see those those rathergay and and elaborate Corinthian columnsholding up irrelevant cornices all overthe bottom of Manhattan interestingenough although of course these thatthese are very rough-and-ready thingsthey are they do illustrate thedifference that is made by a bit ofaesthetic education the difference beingthat these buildings are now protectedand not only are they protected but theyhave a different function just aboutevery 10 years they can change usebecause as I said before a functionfollows form once you have a beautifulform people fit their life into it andalthough this form as I say it's veryordinary in many ways there's hardly aperson living in Manhattan who wouldn'tlike to live in one of these this rathercontrast this is an example from zahahadidmost famous British architect of Arakioriginswho who could creates form without thatcomposition of part and part this isobviously never been built designed at acomputer and designed really in thespirit of a motorcar it doesn't stand upif it wants to fly it has an unsettledcharacter now if you imagined a wholecity built like that you would realizethat not only would the architecture beunsettled but there people would be tooand here's an example of seriouslyunsettled architecture which is the MITbuilding in in in CambridgeMassachusetts built by Frank Gehry whichsort of speaks for itselfit is it is an extremely interestingbuilding of course nobody can deny thatit's interesting it's very eye-catchingbut the architect is now obviouslysuffering a very expensive lawsuitbecause it turns out to be unusableleaks at every joint and so on here isanother example from Norman Foster theCity Hall in London a kind of great blobof jelly thrown down by a giant childwhich and which has landed in the middleof the City of London which hascarefully is it carefully designed sothat nothing could possibly sit next toit it is there to exclude humanity andexclude residents from any space withinvicinity what there you are there it isand again of course you can't imaginethe function changing it contains civilswell civil servants who turn up thereevery day I assume right now why do wewhy have we had this sort of impositionof all these extravagant forms and whyhave we lost that old education inarchitecture were we right to have thatold education should we have held on toitoh and are these new formsreally to be preferred on a moreappropriate to the times in which welive well one of the arguments that'sconstantly made in this area is theargument from genius and originality theargument that that in all artisticendeavors originality is necessary it'sthe cynic were known but without ityou're not really engaged in seriousartistic activity at all and this meansthat that only the genius can reallytake part in itthis idea again has its origins in the18th century was very influential in thephilosophy of Kant that art is the realmwhere where genius is sovereign andwithout genius somehow you haven'tentitled yourself to enter that domainand that might be true that in in manyareas genius is required but there's anargument put forward very eloquently byTS Eliot in his famous essay ontradition and the individual talent tothe effect that although this isabsolutely true that that the that theoriginal talent must be there otherwisethe tradition will dieso master tradition be there that isit's that that provides the contextwithin which genius can be observed andwithin which originality can bepracticed just doing something thathasn't been done before when it shows nounderstanding of what has been donebefore and what has been intended bywhat have been done beforeit's not originality it's it's it'smerely unpredictability and there's akind of fake originality that ariseswhen people make no effort either tounderstand or to fit in to what alreadyexists and simply do something which istheir own thing so real originality isfounded on respect for tradition and anattempt to adapt to that tradition andto adapt the tradition to yourself andthat's the real contrast you see betweenthe Michelangelo staircase I showed youa Norman Foster's blob of jelly and Ithink this is where it'seducation really matters aestheticeducation is about embracing thattradition understanding it and definingyour own efforts in terms of it and ifit's fine to make a cult of genius asour ancestors did in the 18th and 19thcentury but they never intended by thatcult to sweep away that the inheritanceof the of the arts that they had so muchenjoyed on the country they wanted tomake an original contribution for thatinheritance and you see especially inthe art of music in the 19th century theway in which the tonal tradition alreadyin existence for a thousand years wasnot cast aside but adapted and and takento its limits now again there's anotherpoint to be made which is perhaps moreimportant for the case of architecturewhich is that it's a mistake anyway totransfer this idea to architecture andthe mistake is precisely thatarchitecture is a practical art it hasto fill it's there to fulfill functionswe all need it to be done and all of ustake part in it ok most of you are nogood at it but all of you have probablybuilt a cup a garden shed or put up ashelf if all you've all offended you'reyou're a roommate but by something orother and had to and had to realize thatyou didn't yet know you know soarchitecture is just the the largestscale of that ordinary practicalactivity which you saw exemplified bythose two school girls so it's somethingthat we all do and we know that we'renot all geniuses so it must be thereforethat there is a right way to do it whichis accessible to people who are notgeniuses and that's the majority ofarchitects and I think this is onereason again why Manhattan looks ok isbecause not know nobody with an ID withthe impression of his own genius gotround to touching it untilFrank Lloyd Wright came along with theGuggenheim Museum now there are thereare geniuses in architecture of courselike Michelangelo and in particularfavorite of mine borrow Meany yeahItalian Baroque architecture I just showyou two of his his cupola from Rome thisis the cupola son Carlo Quattro Fontaneneeded the smallest Church in Rome butin which he's managed to concentrateevery single detail with every singleliturgical significance into a spaceabout the size of that screen there andhere is his great cupola from Santiagode la serpiente but now you see there avery good illustration of why moldingsare necessary there's a building withabsolutely sharp edges where everygeometrical relation is is dramatizedbut it's only possible isn't it becauseof the shadows that cling to everyparallel line and he knew that of courseand that was what he had been taught -here's another example is this originalthis is some you know a populardiversion in a place where there aren'tmany and of course that this is likeanybody can say you know it's never beendone before to put an upside down houseand make it work so I've done it andinteresting enough you only know this isan upside-down house because it's builtaccording to the classical principles sois to say this is well you know there'san inch it's an interesting paradox thathere is a house that although it's ajoke it wouldn't have been perceived inthe way that the architect wanted if thearchitect hadn't studied how to do areal house so these examples show Ithink that the need in architecture ingenerally the need for rules andpatterns without the sense of detail wecan't learn how to compose things wecompose things by assembling parts butwe don't only assemble the parts of thebuilding to make a billwe also learn to fit a building into itssetting this is something which is veryfamiliar to people in Santa Fe becauseof course you have zoning laws and andarchitectural regulations which aredesigned to make buildings fit into thislandscape and to fit next to each otherif possible and you know with the rightcolors and shapes and Heights and so onso this is where a unique part of theUnited States where people clearly haveperceived the need for this and acted onit but it's not it's not just because itlooks nice it's because that's a way ofperpetuating the idea of settlement whenwe settle down in a home of our own it'svery rare that we do it on our own andif we did do it always on our own thehuman race would die out and rightly soso when we settle down we settle down toshare a home and if usually to to createnew human beings to share it with us tooand I think it is that this deep idea ofsettlement connected with the wholereproductive cycle of the other humanspecies is one that is embodied in ourtraditional classical and vernacularforms these are there because they'rethey're part of sharing our environmentwe build in a in the way that ourneighbors would like in a way that ourneighbors could fit to in this kind ofside-by-side relation but at a certainstage largely under the influence of themadman Corbusier people started thinkingin another way in terms of a kind ofhorizontal horizontal lines whichstretch forever and they rose our kindof tyranny of the horizontal it's veryeasy to build horizontally if you usingreinforced concrete and steel girdersand so on and this became the norm andhere on the left-hand side and not verygood picture I'm afraid this is a streetin New York there you see fairly normalPof modern rubbish in the horizontalstyle there isn't it's hardly a verticalline in it or everybody or if there isit doesn't mean anythingcompared with quite a lot of verticalswhich harmonize on the right-hand sidewhen I was when my family was inManchester the family from which I cameoriginally they were working-classfamily who lived in slums like this thisis a Birmingham which at one of thosesuch which has escaped the health andsafety regulations and this is stillstanding there you see a long Terrace ofhouses on a nice curve entirely composedout of vertical parts and and okay itneeds a bit of gentrification but itlooks ok but over most of the UnitedKingdom in a certain stage people trystarted tearing these things down andreplacing them with the horizontal stylethis is Tower Hamlets in London longstreets in the air there are a few sortof vertical struts but basically all themovement is from left to right and hereis it is with on the street who so youknow people in the street just dust binsand they needless to say this is a greatproblem estate is that has the highestconcentration of crime in all of Londonand you should contrast it with it theordinary old-fashioned street like thiswhich is all built side to side but ineach house manifests a vertical order ofits own there's no that there arecompletely different heights the windowsare at different heights nothing reallyis the same from at one house to anotherbut as you can see it's a perfectlyrelaxed and harmonious composition andthe proof of it is of course that allthe people out in the street enjoying itand I think this is a lesson that peopleare beginning to learn that you don'tbuild horizontally you build verticallyof course you have need the wholeanta lines too but you must learn thatway of standing one thing or anotherwhich is talked sounding one thing onanother which is taught by the classicalorders that I Ellis trated earlier sosome general remarks about settlement weall need to settle down and culture aspart of this we want to perpetuate thevoices that have already settled theland before us that's one reason why weread great books and we we encounterbeauty every day but it's one that weneed to learn to bring to our side weneed to to use our sense of beauty sothat our settlements are indeed communalthings things that we share from wherewe are at home from which we don'tparticularly want to to move an innergenuine settlement we are making upwe're in a position to make a gift ofthe both of the buildings that we makeand our life in those buildings a giftto the stranger as well as to the friendand I think in that way aestheticeducation is part of responding to thedeep needs of the species especially theneed to fit in and the classicalvernacular I've really been defending itis not a style it's a grammarit's like tonality and music has ahistory but it involves reaching out forpermanent permanence there were geniusesPalladio McNichol Angelo and so on andthey were very important because theymade the little parts that the rest ofus use whenever we're building our ownlittle garden shed but once the grammaris in place it is learning andtransferable and it's tied to nospecific use like those Manhattan loftsand I think those lofts and all thoseordinary buildings I've been showing youillustrate the priority of aestheticvalues once things look right we findthe way of putting them to a use it'sthey've got to look right first of alland then everything else will fit inand that's what makes an adaptable citybut of course we human beings you knowwe don't just compose the things aroundus in this way we also want to becomposed especially when dead I thinkall of us want to leave this life in afairly orderly way and be remembered assomething it's not a particularlychaotic example of the of humanexistence that's why you will find thatfuneral parlors even in this very modernbuilding will tend again to to take onboard these these classical principlesyou know moldings shadows and there isclassical lettering and so on okay it'snot it exactly as it might have been butit's something that people will beimmediately attracted to if they'relooking for somewhere to dispose oftheir bodies here but by contrast is afuneral parlor that failed and you cansee exactly why it's not just that pucecolor of supermarket color for the signsit's also this is composed out ofBauhaus details those Pilate that holdup the the canopy above the door thewindow shapes the metal framed windowsand so on and the flat roof and it's avery interesting example of how to doeverything wrong okay so I think I mightjust yes okay just the final points thatso architecture stands up it doesn'tflow but we are seeing increasingly thetriumph of the gas-station style gasstations were one of the great tragediesfor the architectural tradition that weinherited because they are all on thehorizontal horizontal canopies and theyhave to have huge billboards to attractthe cars in and so on everything aboutthem is a challenge and I think this achallenge that's never been risen toproportion however we means measuringthings and measuring means parts and andall the things that I've shown you thatI regard as acceptable are composedrather than molded the building of zahahadid I showed you is a molded form aswas that library from Edmonton much morewe notice things like edges and closeparallels and corners and the play oflight because they are what makes makebuildings stand before us and stand in aserene way but we seem to have lost theart of doing that and replaced it withwhat I call the the kitchen utensilstyle and I think we can understand alot of what's happened in modern designif we look back at kitchen utensilshere's the kettle that your grandfatherhad on on the open hearth in herfarmhouse right something like this andthe first thing you notice about it isthat it's composed isn't it composedfrom from meaningful parts the handleit's been turned the and it's held up onon brackets which have ornamentaldetails again the lid likewise has beenturned and has a kind of molded effectwith shadows everywhere and so on andit's got a string course around themiddle it's a it's like a little than asmall-scale version of what a classicalarchitect would produce but it there's ahistory here at a certain stage thiskind of design took over where peoplewanted a fluidity and a simplicity whichseemed to be more in a more inaccordance with the lifestyle of theforward-looking American housewifeit wasn't granny's kettle this was thethe the upwardly mobile mobile life's awife's kettle and it was soon replacedby this which is the mistress's kettlethere's no permanent relationship behindthis but nevertheless there's a a totalfluidity of form and we at a certainstage there arose the count of thehairdryer this idea that you takecompletely plastic forms and shape themtogether fitting them so they they moldinto each other without any details atall and all you can do is put sillyimages on them like that and this seemsto be as far as the education of thearchitect goes these days and I'veconcluded with an example this is Sloughbus station the architect doesn't evenhave a human name so that this thisexample of obviously an out of placekitchen appliance is not unusual it'sand you'll find it now you've now I'vedrawn your attention to it you'll beseeing it everywhere and the greatquestion is what do we do with thisrubbish it's not it's never going to tryand change its use even as a bus stationit doesn't work it'll have to be pulleddown and thrown away but then thequestion is what do you throw it intoyou know the landfill sites are fillingup but beyond our capacity to replacethem the only thing I think of is a aproperly classically designed dustbin sothat's that's all I have to say thankyouwe're gonna take some questions now goodevening sir thank you for your talk umit strikes me that we might havediverging views on on some of theelements present tonight and let mequote two things from the traditionsthat you've mentioned first ineighteenth-century England we have thisdefinition of beauty which is diversityin uniformity and then in can't we havethe idea that arts rules are given bynature now I agree with you that thereis absolutely no way originality geniuscan happen without rules that is forcertain however must they always betraditions rules and if that's the caseis tradition not an enclosed sort oftotal legal realm to which we adapt atotal solution if you will that we wouldbe mad to follow if we follow yourdefinition of madness and as an exampleI would like to quote two architects20th century that you've not named whichI think illustrate my point very wellGaudi in Barcelona and Frank LloydWright right who's in both cases theirworks were influenced by nature yetanswered to the settled and socialnature of humanity as well butquestioned the tradition in importantways so knowledge of the tradition isimportant but it's not sufficient toaccount for beauty right well it's avery good complex question and what Iwould say in response obviously you'recoming from the philosophical angle thefirst thing I would say is that rules inarchitecture you could put it in cancerand say they're given by Nature a betterway is to say that they are thebyproducts of successful solutions theclassical style is not a body of ruleslaid down a priori it's something it'sthe if you write the resume aof inherited knowledge so it doesn't rotit doesn't work like a convention and itdoesn't constrain like a convention itcan be adapted and and pushed in newdirections and I think that was isexactly what what was happening at acertain stage Frank Lloyd Wright is avery good example of some of theprinciples I've been talking about whobecause he was somebody who who wasutterly clear about the need for closeparallels and the need for shadows andso on and the need for for forms withwhich people felt at home and so on it'sit's a very eccentric architecturehowever you have to you can't imagine acity built by Frank Lloyd Wright you canimagine expensive houses for extremelywealthy people in the countryside whichis what he was most adept at and I thinkyou know Gaudi of course it's a veryinteresting example too but he is againsomeone who's he arose out of the nativegothic and and baroque traditions ofSpain and did his own thing and itfitted in what what my argument is notthat such geniuses should be forbiddenor even controlled provided you knowthere's there's some kind of overallconception of what they're doing butthat we should provide an education forpeople who are not geniuses that is thegreat difficulty in architecture thatmost buildings are built by people arenot geniuses and can't be entitled totake that kind of that kind of step soand that's where we need a greaterrespect for these these traditionalforms and traditional ways of buildingI'd haven't got a chairman so so don'tblame me if if I if I ignore youit's the general principle thatmicrophones don't work yes thank youthank you doctor scrutiny I enjoyed yourlecture quite a lot in your talk youvalorize sharp edges and right anglesand moldings and such and you you alsobriefly give a nod to the local pueblostyle which which I'm not a local thisis my first encounter with the Pueblostyle and I'm really quite fascinatedwith it but but it has a near come yourtotal lack of sharp edges and and rightangles and moldings and I wonder if yousee or can see a logic or a grammar inin that tradition one which is verydifferent from the classical traditionyes there is and people have tried tomaintain it in Santa Fe it's a it's agrammar for a small village really it'snot a grammar for a great town and it'severything everything is handed over tothe interior or to the windows you knowas they articulate exterior of the ofthe building but it of course it's someit's not it's not that everything has tobe done according to the things that Iwas pointing out I was simply pointingout those things that that havetraditionally been taught and which haveenabled architects to build in all sortsof places according to whatever thefunctional need isI'm just hoping to I want you to I wouldlike you to say more about theconnection between beauty and settlingand specifically I'm wondering if thereis any sense in which you think thatbeauty might be or should be unsettlingyeah this is a this is one reason whythose 18th century philosophersdistinguished the beautiful and thesublime they didn't necessarily put itin quite this that way but they theyrecognized that there are things whichwe find intensely moving and importantin the way that that beautiful thingsare which are nevertheless unsettling sothey those are the sublime things thatas it would point out to us that we'renot really at home in the worldand like this the great storm at sea thethe huge mountain and so on and unlikewise in in art there I think that thethere was tragedy as well as as well asthe ordinary narrative forms of art andtragedy has essentially disturbingquality so it's absolutely true that ouraesthetic sense isn't only devoted tothe idea of settling down but what Iwould say is this that that if we don'tsettle down nothing else really comesacross to us it's only through beingsettled down that we can be unsettledand that the sense of beauty is afundamental element in the in thegestures the gestures that are requiredto settle down it's it's a way in whichwe adjust the appearances of things sothat I and my neighbors can share themyou know beauty is all about appearancesand appearances really matter if youcreate appearances which nobody feelscomfortable with then they're going tomove on so that so that is one of thefunctions of the sense of beauty in myview thestatic census is wider than the sense ofbeauty and the sense of beauty itselfdepends upon that deeper thing thatdistinction between right and wrong thatwe make when assembling appearances forourselves where are we with themicrophone is thank you dr. Crandon thiswas great tonight I guess the onequestion I had with and looking at allthat all the modern buildingscontemporary buildings that you pointedout to us the thing that was mostpowerful to me in a way was their shapesobviously and the things you werepointing out but but also theirmonumentality and I'm just wonderingwhether there's something in a way moreegregious about what in in what you'repointing out when the buildings aremonumental as opposed to when there's akind of smallness and and the mostrecent example of a kind of David versusGoliath battle between two modernbuildings was was the MoMA dismantlingof that small was the American Folk ArtMuseum in Manhattan and and needless tosay that small museum suddenly had allthese supporters even though that wasalso a very contemporary modern buildingmaybe it had more verticality I don'tknow but I'm just curious whetherthere's something about themonumentality versus smallness you allright I didn't say another thing aboutscale and of course I should have donethe gentleman who asked me about thePueblo style here was obviouslyreferring to the something that makessense only in this sort of kind ofminiature these miniature forms in in alandscape which absorbs them if you puta great concrete block on one of thehills here I imagine that all theresidents of Santa Fe would feel exactlylike you would like people do like theNew Yorkers felt about demolition ofthat museum the yeah scales again Iwould say this thatscales have to be composed you have tobuild up to those huge things out ofparts which are independentlysignificant this is something you seevery beautifully achieved in theChrysler Building in New York thatthat's a building which stands very highvery high for its time but it stands onthe street and it's entirely composedout of meaningful architectural partswhich are echoed all the way up thebuilding and also in the interior andit's a as it were a respectable citizenof the street and it's scale becomeshorrifying when it has no detail to twoillustrative way it's composed when youwere showing the pictures of the theverticality and the examples of thatespecially the row of houses in theslums of London I really it reallybrought up for me an association withreally the uprightness of the human formand I was just wondering if that'ssomething that informs classical styleas you understand it and if so can wegeneralize some kind of aestheticprinciples from the human form itselfright well that's a good pointit goes back to the point that thegentleman raised at the beginning youcan generalize in aesthetics but only upto a pointonly because you know the you can saythese principles have shown themselvesto be acceptable and these are thesolutions that we've adopted and we canadapt them to new areas and so on itdoesn't follow there couldn't be acompletely different way of building sayelsewhere in another climate or with adifferent kind of people and it'sinteresting the traditional Japanesearchitecture is more horizontal thanvertical things slide of course they'remade of paper andbecause of the earthquake problem andall the rest completely differentproblems were being confronted althoughJapanese temples are organizedvertically like other sacred buildingsbut it's true that that the classicalarchitects that I've been referring todid begin their training by drawing thehuman figure and it was accepted fromthe Greeks I'm was inserted by aVitruvius that the you understand thecolumn by understanding the way thatpeople stand that this is thetranslation into stone of the of thestanding figure and it should have theelasticity and the readiness of thehuman body and that's something that youdo see once you once you get used to ithow did we get from there to here inother words following your examples ofthe Bank of England and the old stockexchange the only thing they have oncalm and obviously is money but when didor how did architects morph from artistsinto commerce into con artists theytricked people into thinking this ispretty good stuff well there's always amotive for faking something if there'smoney attached to the thing you knowgoing back to the buildings in Londonthose huge blocks of completelyunmodulated concrete there was a lot ofmoney involved in building those and ifyou've got planning permission to put upa building that high would you couldwalk away for it from it as amillionaire and invest your proceeds inthe nice little cottage in the countrythat you'd always wanted you know andthat's how London got destroyed and oneof the things that the Prince of Waleshas been very concerned with is how tocreate a new kind ofarchitectural education so thatarchitects don't even propose suchthings you know so that they come upwith a scheme which is designed to fitin with the city to express its itsdignity and so on and obviously that isthe way forward through education butmoney gets in the way and if you rewarduneducated things you get uneducatedbuildings you know there's two people inthe front here I just wanted to ask howdoes form follow function when theexisting structures change their usewhat it doesn't that's what I'm tryingto say that function follows form oncethe form is there as in that example Ishowed you a member of the Islingtontransformer station the form is thereand perfected and people love it and youknow the local council said that's got astay and the functions follow it theyare adapted into it so the shops have tobe fitted inside that form and therestaurants and so on and they'reincredibly popular they thought theshops and the restaurants it's just anice place to beand we shouldn't be this isn't it's justan example of illustrating of the factthat that that we we adapt our means toour ends which is how it should be andnot our ends to our means are you sayingthat the niceness the appeal is reallythe form and then the function yeah justseeks an attractive venue and fitsitself to it well it doesn't seem to bea fit between form and function in thatin that scheme really no it's of courseit's not what I am saying is that thatwhat Louis Sullivan said that functionfollows the form follows function is theopposite of the truth right that youdon't get a nice form by simplyrevealing or following the function aspiano and Rogers that pretend they'redoing in the central Pompidou you theform is something that you understandcompletely independently yeah so I'm I'mglad that mr. Krinkie asked that becauseI'm also confused about why you'resaying what you're saying about form andfunction because it seems to me that theexamples of postmodern architecture thatyou showed us are examples of formcompletely taking over any thought offunction so it becomes all about formand not about function and not aboutdwelling or not not about being in thebuilding but about being far away fromit looking at it whereas you know theexamples you pointed to in London thestock exchange and those those seem tome to be the the the beauty of the formcomes from a certain deep thinking aboutthe function the original function thedeep thinking is actually about form itsits thinking about how forms areunderstood by human beings they'reunderstood in terms of their parts andhow those parts fit together thepostmodern things that you werereferring to don't have proper parts andthe form is arbitrary as a result wedon't see the thing at the former's asit were growing out of the constructionit's simply imposed and those things areof course designed on a computer they'renot designed by somebody who's looked atsomething and drawn it and seen how itwould fit into something else that's athat's the whole thing I have in mindthe word form maybe it's not a word thatI would naturally use but it's therebecause Louie Sullivan made that remarkand I was just trying to say that thatremark is the opposite of the truthum mr. Scruton can I ask you to say moreabout architecture and death or settlingdown and and that because you I rememberyou you talked a lot or you dwelled onthe the fact that the funeral homes failor succeed based on based on the theaesthetics of how how people died theydon't want to and as and and would beremembered as living a chaotic life andthat seems to me some and which is veryinteresting for me because when I askpeople my age or people young people wholive in cities and they prefer to eventhough they prefer to live in citieswhen they're young they I ask them whatare you gonna do when you get older orwhen you retire they I find most of themsaying they want to go live in thecountry where they where they have havenice homes with the gardens going goingback to back to nature that's what Ihear them say and I was wondering aboutthis relation between what is it aboutthe latter part of your life the latterpart of your life that's close to deathand what what could settling down meanfor for a person a person about to endone's life or I just want to know moreabout that okay the funeral funeralfunerary architecture is extremely hasbeen extremely important in the historyof architecture obviously when most thenormal situation of people when theyapproach death is to become serious andto will some permanent record ofthemselves and their relatives likewiseyou don't build a monument out ofplastic or you know the monument isthere to perpetuate something okay you know it's going to decayeventually but many of the architecturalparadigms that we have are originated asmonuments and likewise as churches orwhatever places where the dead arehonored or even present so that thedeath is a very important asset forbuildings there's something which whichyou know if a building can accommodatethe dead it's achieved something thatall buildings in there are as it weredesigned for namely permanence and Ithink of course modern attitudes todeath are changing and young peopledon't think about these things and youknow there's an intervening period wherepeople want to go to the country perhapsand settle down and that's a that isperhaps not as healthy as it should bepeople the Reap one reason why our townsare so disorganized and why they losetheir centers where they don't have a acentripetal movement towards the centerwhere real life occurs is because peopledon't reproduce enough in them you knowa town should be full of children asthey as they used to be in Italy in myyouth you know and their children givesense to the residence of everybody elseand when people are buried in thatsociety they're taken out of the townthank you for your lecture I was curiousI was curious at one point in the talkyou alluded to the fact that when youhad the girls arranging the platesproperly on the table you alluded to thefact that it might also be natural thatthis kind of mathematize looking thingsmight be natural but most of your talkwas about education and how to mayberectify something so I'm wondering ifyou could elaborate on the naturalquality of it well yes we have manynatural capacities which only becomefulfilled when educated you know it'snatural in us to learn language but tolearn it properly we've got to beeducatedmusic likewise is natural to us but italso requires education to come tofruition and yeah I took that examplethose girls because it's so obvious thatthey're they don't have yet anyaesthetic principles nor have they everconsidered these questions they probablydon't have the idea of beauty and allthat but they do have it the sense ofright and wrong how it should be and howit shouldn't be and that's that's that'swhere we begin and it's also where weend do we gradually take in to thatsense you know the sense of therightness and wrongness all that we wantto build in to our shared environmentwould you please comment on the conceptof form following function as anecessityutilizing the Las Vegas Strip as anexample which in my view at leastlistening to your talk is the exactexample where form does follow functionwhere it is necessary and where as aresult the end result is implosion yeswell you won't be surprised to learnthat I've devoted quite a bit of my lifeto avoiding the Las Vegas Strip so Idon't really have any authority to talkabout it but I'm sure you're right onething that I was struck by in your talkwas your use of a lot of ethical termsto help us think through that as thatequalities things like a sense ofcommunity of friendship of regard forothers of decorum of of dignity ofhumility and I think it's interestingthe ways in which aesthetic categorieshelp us reflect on ethical categoriesbut I I also don't think it's the casethat there's a one-to-one relationshipbetween the tooth of things that areaesthetically pleasing are always rightgood and just but they sometimes aremaybe the categories help us think aboutone another so I I wonder if you couldtalk a little bit about the ways inwhich aesthetic categories and in artand architecture around us help us thinkthrough ethical issues as well and thatthose areas of overlap well yes this isum one of the great questions ofphilosophy what the relation betweenaesthetic and moral values is you can'tget far with exploring the aestheticvalue of something without falling intothe arena of ethics you're bound to beraising questions about the in the caseof architecture about the humanity ofthe environment that it creates aboutyou you attribute to it qualities of sayof restfulness or the opposite it ischallenging in some way it's energizingall these all these words automaticallycome into our mind when you try toexplain what it is that you like ordislike about a building and in makingthose using those words many of themetaphors you're making connectionsbetween the building and the rest ofyour life how you as it were receive thethe may burns felt the the the world oflife in which in which you live and thesame is true of course of literature andmusic in all the arts when if you wantto get beyond the first the firstobservations about how a poet uses acertain word as to why he should putthat word there you're straight away inthe middle of of a state of mind whichcalls upon you to evaluate it is is itis it sincere is it is he is he havinghimself on etc what to what extentshould I or should I not sympathize withthis particular presentation of this ofthe poet's ego so you know I think inevery area the aesthetic judgment beginswith a sense of how things impact on mehow I receive them through the senses orthrough the the unfolding of a drama andso on but as soon as I reflect on this Irecognize that the impact itself has amoral meaning for mesure all right hello related to I guessthat question is how and why doaesthetics judgments change and then Iguess to follow it up would be whenshould it wellaesthetic aesthetic judgments don't allchange if you mean the people's tastesare always changingthere are huge movements of taste ofcourse in the history of culture butthere are also the permanent monumentswhich are always given attributed assignificance even if that significanceisn't quite the same from generation togeneration like like the poems of Homerof canned the things that you read inthe great books program they're therebecause they have stood the test of timeand and I think we we there are thingsin our nature which are permanent andare addressed by those works of art theyaddress what is what those aspects of uswhich couldn't change without everythingelse changing now of course perhapseverything else could change too maybethe Internet has made everything elsechange or something you know people comeup with all kinds of views like that andin the everyday aesthetics the staticsof architecture clothes decoration andso onthings change much more quickly becauseof course they change with the changesin everyday life they are very much onthe surface of everyday life and that'swhy this problem has arisen the problemI have been talking about the problem ofhow you should educate the architectbecause we've lived through a period ofrapid change under the impulse of forceswhich are not aesthetic mostly economicor or simplythe effect of the madman you know andthat so we we that raises the questionfor the first time it wasn't ever raisedbefore this question of how an architectshould be educated it's just obvious youlook at the examples and you move onfrom themthanks so much I I have to say that Iwhen I look at buildings like the onesthat you showed the modern architectureI feel kind of like a crazy personmyself because I'm like this is terriblewhy did you let this be built and so nowI know I'm not alone I appreciate that alotso I want it I want to I guess myquestion is so you showed a lot ofclassical architecture in Victorianarchitecture and then some of theexamples of like the blobs and the youknow kind of horrific jumbles which werelike usually considered modernarchitecture what do you think aboutlike for example the Public Library inChicago which which is a post postmodernarchitecture that takes the moldings andand shadows that you talk about it hasverticality but then it actually makes apastiche of those yeah and ironicallyjust to describe this this PublicLibrary has a roof that has moldingsthat look like seashells but they'reenormous they're just like hundreds offeet tall and so it's a pastiche onthese like classical moldings so I justwondered just your your aestheticjudgment on kind of that that that uhthat branch of postmodern architecturethanks a lotwell my gut reaction is that is thatfacetiousness should never be acceptedand it shouldn't be accepted in thingswhich pretend to permanence like publicbuildings public buildings should not befacetious they should be dignified andespecially a library which representsfor us everything that's most serious inour inheritance but maybe over the yearspeople will get used to it III thinkthat moment in architectural historywhen postthis took all the classical details andput them in the wrong placesI think that was has gone you know itwas therepartly because people realizedarchitects had realized that modernismwas not popular so and people wantedthese details so they decided to putthese details in but but as it were as ain an abusive way so just to show theircontempt for the ordinary person in thestreet thank you and thank you what yousay provokes a kind of line ofquestioning which begins with aquizzical thought what any genius wantto live in or settle in a something thata genius architect had provided for himand the line also fans out if what yousay is true what I think it is then itwould be very characteristic of aphilosopher if he ever built a buildingor if he described in his worksuntreated architecture in one case Ithink of Descartes with the metaphor offlattening everything and replacing itmay be the first liqueur musee but thenI want to ask you what you think ofIcahn Stein the building he did inVienna right that's really two questionsthere are there are examples of geniuseswho have built houses in which they havelived paying Frank Lloyd Wright was oneof themlook how busy I'd never managed to livein anything he built nor is anybody elseas far as I know Mies van der Rohe arelikewise vacant Stein's sister for whomhe built that house never managed tolive in it it became the Embassy ofan Eastern Bloc communist country butactually everything that I've said inthis lecture is something that Vic andStein would have agreed with he didn'tlike the classical idiom but he wastotally of the view that there was sucha thing as an architectural education todo with getting things right and fittingthings together and getting parallels toto match and creating shadows and so onso he was he was the kind of cleanmodernist whom a classicist would admireprobably but you know his his hisbuilding his house in Vienna stands -classical art the architecturaltradition as the Tractatus stands - thephilosophical tradition was a dead endI I'm over here alright I'd like torevisit the idea of monumentality andthe way that you describe say the theblob in London dominates the spacearound it and whether that might be anattempt to force people to enter thefeeling of being somewhere else it mightbe an attempt to have a difference inilluminating experience but whether thatmight be an ignorance of the possibilityof encountering the other with sensibleboundaries in a more congruous City wellthe explanation of the blob in London iscomplex it's it was the architect NormanFoster never justifies anything he doeshe only insists that it should be doneand should be noticeable and you knowmany people like what he does thatparticular thing I don't know why it wasbuilt as it was but it you know it's itsappearance speaks for itself I think oneshould contrast it with the sort of bigthe large buildings that were you knowfrom the past which stand out and seemedto elbow everything away from them andthe great problem that people felt theycreated what the most important exampleis some Peter's in Rome or when Madonnahad really finished working on well hedidn't never finished very got thatfacade really in place and my clownshave done his dome it was so huge butthe city around about it was dwarfednobody knew quite what to do about itbut that they it had to be joined in ithad to be somehow brought down andmodulated into the into the tonality ofthe surroundings City so Bernini wasasked to build that colonnade is one ofthe great architectural achievementswhich totally integrated simplyinto the city of Rome and would still doso work not for the fact that mostCellini opened the that great street infront of ithi um thank you for your lecture youtalk briefly about art being somethingthat reveals the beautiful or thesublime and I guess I'm assuming thatwe're thinking of architecture as beinga type of art that can do that and I'mwondering if we can talk briefly aboutthe relationship between function andbeauty then and what role if any thefulfilment of a function plays in theexpression of the beautiful and then Iguess if functional types of art likearchitecture would then be fundamentallydifferent than others in their abilityto reveal beauty well this is very acomplex issue often we find purelyfunctional objects beautiful but usuallywe do so when their function has beenlostyou know people collect old tools andoften put them up on their wall thingsthat were were made purely for afunction and were never regarded asbeautiful by the people who made thembut you know nevertheless strike theystrike us as beautiful because there isas it were the memory of a function inthem and that memory is translated intoaesthetic values it's as though that theghosts of people past is still presentin the object and that is verycharacteristic of the aesthetic attitudegenerally we we see as it were hauntingthings the the people who can no longeruse them and I think so functionalobjects often acquire a beauty by losingtheir function doesn't mean that theydon't have the beauty when they have thefunction there are those objects whichwhich are beautiful because they are sofunctional or whose beauty is so tied upwith their function that you couldn'tseparate them aeroplanes being theobvious example I've struggled for yearswith my little sketchbooksdesign a classical airplane it's neverworked something about the moldings thatgets in the way of the hydrodynamics orthe aerodynamics on ya Nietzsche saidthat the categories of the aesthetic arelearned categories and not a priori andthat beauty and the sublime werehistorically learned and that therecould be other categories we could learnthat were aesthetic judgments that wedeveloped in traditions and in fact heproposed the interesting and the boringas aesthetic categories and the Frenchturned that into the avant-garde and theavant-garde defined the interesting asthe new or the different and often thatwas a rejection or at least a comment onthe past forms of beauty and then itbecame comments on past you attempts tobe interesting and most of the buildingsyou used to illustrate ugliness wereones that the architects intended to beinteresting knowingly not beautiful justlike your thoughts well you want me totalk about the whole of aestheticsrather than these this particularquestion that I'm raising it is truethat that the values that come or ratherthan yeah the aesthetic values that weare tempted to articulate indefinitelymany and they change from time to timeplace to placeand of course any critic can get awaywith saying it's interesting and thereare lot of things that are interestingto look at crucifixions and so on andwhich which one would want to say shouldnot be looked at only paintedcrucifixions but the roman games were aspectacle in which people took a strongvisual interest and we nowadays wouldsay that they should not even haveoccurred and that the interest was waswrong because it was an interest youknow you should turn away as soon Paulwould say but at the same time we knowthat the aesthetic frame of mind thatframe of mind is which we try toappreciate what a thing is for us in ourexperience and as it presents itself tous that frame of mind is indispensableto us and when we take up that frame ofmind all our other values are active inin both propelling our interest andwithholding it you know so and all thatnature is saying is that he Nietzschelives in a world where the things thatthat are objects of aesthetic interestare rather different you know and he hewants to to emphasize those things thathe thought the Greeks emphasized youknow the the the cruel aspect of thingsthat the the terrorized terrifyingaspects of things that essentially thethe sacred sacrifice which would haveyou know which he would was always inthe back of his mind as that as there asthe root of the of the aesthetic way oflifehang on this somebody goes we canworking forever I think yeah it'sgetting like the last movement ofHaydn's farewell symphony anyway yeah sojust one more question okay so how manyof the problems that are caused bynongenius architecture due to a lack ofskill and how many of these problems aredue to being sort of forced to channel agrammar of power economic scientific andhow would you sort of empower architectsto take more control over their work Idon't knowI would round them up though andterrorize them and by forcing them tosit through this lecture and theywouldn't be the same
