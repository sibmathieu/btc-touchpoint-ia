  "text": "hey everyone welcome to this wednesday'srelease of the show where we're talkingabout bitcoinso today's guest is probably the biggestname in the entire bitcoin space andthat's dr adam backdr back is the inventor of proof of workwhich is one of the key components ofthe bitcoin code basein fact satoshi nakamoto's originalbitcoin white paperreferenced dr bak for his keycontributions to make the blockchaineven possiblebeyond his initial contributions dr bakis the co-founder and ceo of blockstreamwhich is a company that's a leader ininnovation and foresight for the entirebitcoin ecosystemduring this discussion dr back talksabout some of his early discoverieshis opinion on proof of work and whyit's important some of the newinitiatives at blockstream to bring moremining capacity to north americahis opinion on the bitcoin contangotrade and much much moreso without further delay here's my chatwith the one and onlydr adam backthanks for having me on so adam i thinkthe question i've been dying to ask youis just your discovery of proof-of-workfor me is mind-blowing and it'smind-blowingthat this was incorporated straight intothe white papersatoshi referenced you in the whitepaper and i just try to putmyself in your shoes and going back tothe moment whereyou discovered this and kind of likewhat led up to itwhen you discovered it and you startedto write about it like what kind ofutility did you think that it hadat that time or at that moment justexplainthat moment to us as you discovered thisi was running an anonymous remailer so igot interested incryptography and privacy and basicallydeploying technology allowed users toexercise their rights and so on theonline worldand so i was running this re-mailer andat that time this is the late 90s orobviously still todaythere was a recurring problem with spamwhere people would sendbulk unsolicited mail probably with aone in a millionconversion rate but hey you know sendingan email was practically freeand it's kind of a pain you know mostpeople's anybody operating a mail serverindividually or as acompany the majority of the email thatthey were processing wasspam and it's also a nuisance for usersto sift through all this stuff to findthe actual emailsand so that was going on in thebackground but my particular concern wasoperating this remover to get privacyand it also had the ability to postto username discussion groups kind of abroadcast decentralizedkind of mailing list like technologychat forumsit seemed that there were people thatwere sending spamthrough the remailers particularly tothese discussion groups and you knowonce they hit these discussion groupsthe usenet technology broadcasts thatacross thousands of servers all over theworld sothere's actually a way to amplify adenial of service and it wasn't evencommercial spam i was just looked likerandom numbers and thingsand talking amongst people who operateremailerson a cypherpunks list our best theorywas that people that are doing thiswere you know pro-establishmentanti-privacy and just wanted toannoy the administrators of usernetserversso that they would try to blockremailers it seemed like an anti-privacykind of you know create some nuisance sothat there would be a blowback againstremovers because people were spammingwith it soanyway there's a kind of um backgroundproblem for a miller's like well what dowe do about thisand so usually what people do about spamisthey put their system administratorhound and they think welli'm the super user which is more thecase in those days you knowbig servers and not that many powerfuldesktops and laptopsand they would block ip addresses blockemail addressesbut the actual protocol and thepermissionless internet isthere isn't really any concept of youknowsuper user and regular user once you getonto the ip network everybody is thesame right soit struck me this was a bad anddangerous directionbecause it was pushing towards theinternet driver's license conceptwhich resurfaces once in a while youknow people want real names orpersonal information in order to get acell phone contract or an internetconnectionand so the whole point of remembers wasthat you should have privacy incommunicating person's person andparticularlyin discussion forums so i had to look atthespam problem in a from a differentdirection which is well theblocking identities and ip addressesisn't isn't really a solutionit's kind of losing arms race and anywaydeer is trending in a bad directionwhat's the real problemso the root problem as well email ispractically free soi was thinking well people on the cycleexplicit were already pretty excited andinterested in electronic cash but it wasdifficulties bootstrapping it because itrelied onbanking partner and that kind of thingso some of the electron captureprotocols then werecentralized you know there would be acentral server with a double spenderslike david trump's protocol and someother ones a similar designand actually you know paypal didn'texist uh getting acredit card merchant processing accountwas difficult complicatedand anyway not not a fit forsending private mails because identityandit would also exclude lots of peopleright so you know billions of people inthe world don't have credit cards andcouldn't get a credit card merchantprocessing account don't want to puttheir id on thingsand somebody's financial well-beingwhere they're happy tosend a 10 cents or a dollar to send amessage maybe that's expensive forsomebodyand we want to have a global evendiscussion on using itabout a wide range of topics and sothat's where wellwe can't use the banking rails we can'tpay themso it's complicated but could we atleast add a cost to the centerand so i had coincidentally been lookingathash collisions so there's this conceptcalled a birthday paradox whereif you if you pick a room of people andyou say what is the chance that twopeople say it sharethe same birthday it's a much lowernumber than you expectjust kind of statistical anomaly orcounter-intuitive fact so with the hashfunctions such assha-1 sha-256 similar kind of thingappliesexcept the cost you know you'd have totry lots of hashes until you findtwo that collide to the same output thework to do that isimpractical you could run all thecomputers in the world until sun buildsout and probably wouldn't find one orsomething soif you did have one if somebody from thefar future came back and gave you oneyou could instantly verify it you know afew thousand cpu cycles so i thought itwas a fascinating concept whichwhich relates right which is well youcan provethat work was expended but this is fartoo expensive so maybe we cantune it and like modify the design ofwhat's going onso that you can make it tuniblyexpensive and still instantly verifiableand so that's that's where hash cachecame fromand because it was for store and forwardlike ina communication mechanism where there'snot you know a client and a serverinteracting wherethe server says please answer thischallenge and then youyou know you solve a captcha you send itback i mean a capture being another kindof thing that's used for thisbut there's no client in server it'sbroadcast andthe reader is not online at the sametime as the sender kind of thing soit was necessary for the for the senderto make a proofusing a challenge that he chose himselfthat made it a genuine proofrather than something that convincesonly a server it's a transferable proofanybody can verifythat the person that posted thisdiscussion comment spent a centof electrical power doing so orsomething so when you saidthat you had to tune it is this reallysimilar towhat we see with the difficultyadjustment where it gets easierit gets harder depending on how muchhashing power we seeis on the network is that what you'retalking about when you're saying you hadto tune ityeah it's exactly the same so with thehash cache kind ofemail postage stamp i had set it to20 bits which is about a million triessowith and as a kind of fixed difficultybut i had the concept that the verifiershouldincrease the minimum postage they wouldacceptevery few years as cpus got faster andyou know people started to do thatand so that is the difficulty adjustmentandof course these are relatively cheapit's in the context of electronic cashcuriously you know when i posted thison the site banks list and the cryptolists in1997 there's in a context where peoplewere pretty excitedyou know electronic cash david trump'secash systemwas you know top of mind and a veryexciting potentialfor the world sort of thing kind ofbitcoin like vibe but on a far smallerscalebut it was centralized and it'sdifficult to bootstrap and so a lot ofpeople looked at thisand said wow this is this is interestingit's like artificial scarcityit's like digital gold and then startyou knowstarted having discussions about wellhow could youcontrol the inflation they were sort ofhypothesizing that with moore's lawand an incentive toyou know if you could do mining withthis to create coinsthat people would go nuts and make aridiculous amount of coins and thatwould erode and make it difficult tohave stable valueand so i think people wereand you know by 1998 there were two kindof moremore detailed proposals being way diceb-moneyand nick sabo's bit gold which both usedthis proof of work and proposedways to have a stable value as it wereor a market set valuebut in a kind of federated model withhuman market makers or sort of a councilorsupernode set of power users that woulddecide how much work was needed and orhow many coins were going to be issuedin the e-bulkthings like that so if you scrollforward to2008 when satoshi startedsharing drafts of the bitcoin paper itseemed to me thathe'd correct the one thing that peoplehadn't figured out how to do back thenwhich was you know in hindsight it lookssimple but it's to saywell let's not try to targeta stable value but let's instead targeta predictable supply curve and let themarket worry about the value andthat it turns out is technicallypossible to doinside a distributed system with new youknow humancouncils or super nodes and governanceand deciding how many coins per epochand that kind of thingit was funny this johns hopkinsprofessor that just keeps on baggingon bitcoin just published an article ithink it was in cnn just this past weekwherehe was talking about these thesegovernance structures and i'm thinkingto myselfdude the entire point of this is to nothave a governance some people involvedin the loopof managing this it's like how can howcan people not see that thisi mean bitcoin is many things but likethat is one of thechief things that like this is all aboutis nothaving that it's just crazy evensome bitcoin technologists technicalcommentators will talk aboutgovernance by which they mean the changeprocess within bitcoin but i personallytake exception to that terminologyyou know there is no governance thechange process within bitcoinis opt-in backwards compatibleoptimization and features andthere's certainly no economic or coresystem metrics that arethat there's any plausible governancediscussion to be had about so bitcoinhas no governancei would say you know yeah i meanyou know ethereum has governance becausethere's a group of people that aresort of somewhere after supply curve andit's all over the placethere's labels on it where differentpeople decided different things rightso i think actually plan bsaid something interesting as a way toexplain this becausebecause it's mathematical and softwarepeople have difficulty understanding whyit'sinvaluable like they think well you knowthe software could be changedand his analogy was that the um you knowit's it's a game of chessand third game of chess you can changethe rules but nobody will play with youif you do right so you could you couldmake a modified piece of softwarewith a different number of coins perblock or something andnobody's interested in playing that gameso the economic consensus justcontinues so adam going back tothe discovery here what is the timeframe when you get thisaha moment about proof-of-work prior toeven hashcash where you were just likei think this might solve this problemwhat where are we at in the timelinethat was in may 1997 i thinkand i'd been reading aboutthese house collisions on usenetcoincidentally ona crypto list and kind of found itinteresting was looking at themathematics of itin the background there's this ongoingspam war wagingin general email and a bit of itcreating akind of a political problem forre-mailers which i was one of theoperators of a roommateand so it occurred to me i spent i don'tknow probablytwo or three days thinking about designvariants of how to do itand then i was thinking while i could icould post this is interesting i thinkthis would be theright design variant to use and ithought well you knowin the isf process you should haverunning code firstso i showed up and wrote the code for acouple of days and i posted itand so it was you know here's the codehere's a description of how it worksand i was on a mailing list and there'slots of discussion you know peopleintegrated into remembers and actuallyintointo a lot of different things evenpseudonymssort of cost to create a persistentpseudonymwhich is a bit like vanity addresses inbitcoin andas sort of storage denial of serviceprotectionand distributive file systems andactuallyover time spam assassin which is acommonkind of isp grade anti-spam filteradded support for hash cache postagestamps in the headersso it would give you some negativescoringso it was trying to grade is this spamso i look for spamminess metricsand you know if it had make money fastplus 20 to the score this is probablyspam righti had a valid cash header in it bignegative this is not spamright so it would protect you frombeing falsely categorized to spam whichhappens too right so they did that onthe server sideand uh microsoft made system as well andintegrated intotheir whole suite of email things youknow theclients the outlook mail server orthings like that but theirtheir protocol was essentially the samething but slightly different format soit wasn'tcross-compatible that was that kind oftechnology i didn'tactually get around to writing a paperdescribing it more formallyuntil about five years later i'm moregenerally more interested inbuilding and deploying actions yeahyou're interested in action andactually doing it i love that themeabout you and i've seen you post that ontwitter from time to time it's like heywe can sit around and talk about thingswhere we can actuallycreate this and get things done andthat's a cool story that you'rethat you're kind of showing that that'swhat you did from the very early days isthat youcoded it out and you put it out therebefore you really kind of even formallydescribed what and what was actuallyhappening with the code that you werepublishingi want to summarize something and justcorrect me if my understanding of thisis wrong but when i think aboutwhat this discovery really kind of meantthis proof-of-work discoveryand especially how it applies today iwas taking thisonline course i think it was like thisfree princeton course it was like 70hours just teaching you like all thenuances of like howbitcoin works behind the scenes i don'tfully understand the encryption i knowthatthe mathematics to take shot 256 make itapplicable so that if there's fivepeoplerunning five processors and thedifficulty is being scaled downfor the shot 256. that math to do thatto me isis just a mind-blowing event like that'sjust like i can't imagine trying toprogramor work out the math on how you wouldfigure out statisticallyhow to adjust sha-256 which like you hadsaid earlieryou could have all the processors in theworld running on it until the sungoes out and you're not going to havethis event where you havewhere you're having the same uh inputproduce the same output rightso when you when you're thinking aboutscaling that difficultydown to now there's five people guessingand they canthey can figure it out in a ten minutetime period the math that's associatedwith doingthat scaling down to me is is an amazingfeatand that's pretty much what yourproof-of-workdiscovery was all about is what i justdescribed is thatan accurate description of how you wouldput it into layman's terms for peoplethat are kind of listening to what thismeans and how it how it's really kind ofapplicable to bitcoinso the i think the point is thethe full collision we know how to do itit's just too expensiveand so to make it simplerfaster and tunably expensive it'salmost definition change right so we'resaying okaywe give up we're not going to find afull collision it's not so expensive buthow about if we finda partial collision where you know thefirst10 bits or 20 bits areby chance or zero and so that's what idid andi mean you know zero is a as good as anynumber it could bea magic string could be anything butyou're you're trying to reacha target and effectively by loopingon a hash function changing a counter init yoursort of throwing 256coins and looking at the ones at thebeginningor landed heads and of course that'svery unlikelythe more heads you get right but if it's20 then it's going to take say half asecond on acpu at that time and if you want that toincreaseyou know if you want the time if youwant to stay at like a minute of workafter computers have doubled in speedthen you're probably going to want toincrease it to 21. and so with hashcashii had a kind of crude graduation of theamount of workso it would only either double or halfbut it's pretty straightforward tomake it take one and a half times longeryou justput a floating point representation of anumber in thereand say is it less than this and thatwill do it and that's that's whatbitcoin doesso i think how bitcoin targets to theintervalis more like um a control system like afeedback loop right soyou start the system you take a guess ata number you start the system runningand then you measure over a periodwhat's the average time between blocksin this you know across this 2000 blockperiodand you're saying oh it's five minutes iwant it to be ten let's doubledifficultythat'll fix it right and if it goes inthe other direction you reduce itso it's just a control system where youyou measure and adapt measure and adaptyou hear all these different narrativesyou hear all these different opinions onwhat's going to work in the long termyou hear a lot of people actually bashbitcoinbecause it's using proof of work andi've always had the opinionwhich is the polar opposite of that thatproof of workis the essence of why bitcoin bitcoin'sgonna work because youactually have to perform if we're usinga comparison to goldyou have to actually go out there withyour shovel and digthrough the earth's crust and performwork in order to find whateverprobabilityper dig let's say you got to do 100 digsto find whateveramount of ounces of gold you have to dothat workin the physical realm in order to createvalue behindwhat gold is because it's so scarce andhard to find so why would that be anydifferentwhen we move into the digital realm thatthere doesn't have to be some type ofworkperformed in order to create valuebehind the units that are being minedwhen i look at these other protocols andthey're notdoing these things and they're justthere's this this pre mine or there'sthis proof of stake and all these otherthingsto me represents more of what we'vealready got in today's society with fiatcurrenciesthan it does something that is hardsoundimmutable fungible money assuming youagreebut is there anything that you want toadd on to that ordo you believe that proof of work isreally required for this to besuccessful in the long runyeah i think so and i think the economicgame theory is counter-intuitiveeven to people with background yeahin economics right so there are somevery interesting effects hereso i mean one thing that i think there'sif you scrollthrough society's operatings he had saidsomething like yes it uses electricitybut as with gold it's far more efficientto the world to have a hard moneyversus the kind of slippage and churnthat happenswhen you have political money and thenanother comment i've heardis paul stortz made the observation thatthere is an economic incentiveto obtain money and so people arewilling to expandup to the commodity costto obtain it and if there is no cleancostthat effort will be expended in otherways i.ein political lobbying favoritismaudits physical bank securitycross-checks controls theft insiderdouble dealinginefficient political systems so wehaven't saved a thing what we've done iswe've hada messy uneven playing field i thinkanother thing that'sinteresting is eric voskwill had adiscussion with himwhere i concluded that actually he wasright in some degree thatpeople look at they look at the world asifa cost arose app initiated but there'sno cost that doesn't have an alternativeso you know they say well theelectricity was used to mine bitcoinokay but there was a foregonealternativeright instead of mining the bitcoinmaybe they would have engaged in someother consumer-ish behavior they wouldhave bought a carand so no energy was solved you knowmaybe bitcoin isprobably actually reducing a number ofpollutiveand carbon producing things in the worldfor example it'sclearly reducing gold mining because ithink people are starting to realizethatgold prices will probably be higher ifbitcoin was not monetizingin the alternative and gold you knowgold mining is extremely industrialand chemical process so i think thatthere isprobably some necessary inevitabilityfor the production of money to haveof our hard money to have an actualeconomic costso adam when we think about this andwhenever i'm looking at the price curvethe thing i just keep coming back to andthe thing ikeep asking myself is how in the worldbecausehere i am i'm a finance guy i'm lookingat stocks i love stock investingand i've never in my life seen a pricechartthat looks like bitcoin i've never seensomething that almostlooks like it grinds and has like thisperfectshape on the bottom of the price chartover a 10-year period of timeand i know a lot of people in thecommunity don't like to necessarilycall it that it looks like metcalfe'slaw for various reasons because you'recomparing something that's a little bitdifferentbut when you look at that price chartand you look at it in log terms it lookslikemetcalfe's law playing out in real timebut it's a pricechart and i'm telling myself okay whatin the hellis driving this to happen there'ssomething mechanically that's happeningin the code that's causing this to playoutand the only thing that i can arrive atisbecause when you look at the these peaksthat happen in the price action itdoesn't seem like it's boundit looks like it's it's more emotionalbut when you look at the floor of theprice actionthere's these moments where it almostseems likelike it's just grinding throughsomething that's forcing it to go upand so the only thing that i can come tothe realization and i go backand there's a there's an awesome bookcalled the book of satoshi that i'veread and it's pretty much all ofsatoshi'swritings that was pulled from online andone of the quotes in there that reallystuck with me is he really gets intosomething that you just described whichisthis labor theory of value mightactually be playing out with bitcoin andand you talk to any economist andthey'll roll their eyes at this labortheory of value they'll say that'sclearly not something that actuallyworks in reality especially when you getintospecialized services like say you're adoctor or whatever like that's just notsomething that's applicable but i thinkwhen you look at bitcoinand you look at the mining process andyou look at how commoditized the miningprocess is and how competitiveit is it's really kind of the electricalcostto mine these things that's setting theprice floorespecially when you look at the scarcitythatthat keeps getting tighter and tighterlike a noose aroundlike a collar around a dog that justkeeps gettingtighter and tighter every four years sothis is my questionis proof of work driving this pricefloorbecause of the electrical costs that areassociated withthe flow of bitcoin that's that's beingdropped into the market and how muchtighter it gets every four yearsi think the complete inelasticity of thesupply curve is interesting rightbecauseif you look at any other commodity thepeople who are extracting the ore orproducing the finishedproduct are gonna react to marketconditionsif if the price's gold is up they'llreopenmines that are have an expensive pergram production costtheir work shifts people will likerecyclereclaim gold from electronics andeverything will ramp up to the maxit take the edge off the price increasea little bit and similarlyif the price is depressed they'll shuteverything down and it willprovide some it'll take some edge out ofthe selling because it's less to bebought as well bitcoin in comparison andpeople say bitcoin doesn't carewhich is uh more insightful than itsounds right butit's uh it kind of applies here tooright you think the price is thatbitcoin doesn't know thatactually so it just keeps producingcoins and the miners of coursethey will chase a higher cost by beingeconomically incentivized to bring moreminers onlineand so forth it's an interestingquestion to what extent minerssell coins to pay electricity billsand you know a block stream and mepersonally as wellhave been doing mining for about fiveyearsnow and the conclusion is that it'sbetter like back tested likejust passionately best back tested it'sjusta better financial strategy to hold thecoins and not sell thempeople will say well how could you dothat like where does the money come fromand i say oh look you'reyou're about to invest some dollars inmining some of that's going to go intoequipment and some of it's going to gointo electricityso if you've got a hundred thousanddollars or a million dollars calculatethe ratio between the equipmentand the electricity you'll need to runit for three years and instead ofyou know spending all of your money onminers and then saying oh no i have nomoney lefti'm going to sell the coins to pay forelectricity you're better off to mine atlet's say half the sizewhere you've got half the money setaside to pay the electricity billsand you can talk about more why that isbut basicallyi think that mining hassome downside protection as compared tobuying so buying and holding is verysensitive tothe entry price and that that catchesnew people they look at the price andlike wowi've been hearing about it it's in thenews again i want to getestablished a bitcoin position but nowis this a good priceyeah should i wait for it to fall willit just go upso they get presented in decision rightand soso with mining it's interesting becauseyou don't care as much about whathappensif the price goes up rapidly you tend toget a derivative benefit becausethere'll be a shortage of miners orpeople can't manufacture new miners fastenough to bring them online so you'llget a kind ofderivative premium for a while untilthat catches up and that's that's thecurrent state of the market reallylast year minor sales were kind of weakbut this year it's reallyhard to acquire new miners without verylong forward delivery datesand if you started mining and the pricefallsyou would think that's bad but actuallywhat tends to happen isprice is falling and so some miners willswitch offbecause they fall below their break evenandso as that falls if you if you are ifyou keep mining you know you've got costbasis that allows you to keep miningor you've pre-funded the the investmentrate you've got thecapital to pay for the electricity andyou're going to mine through itobviously you're not going to mind belowthe cost of buying bitcoin withelectricity that wouldn't make sense butthere's a big hysteresis betweenthe equipment breakeven and the initialinvestmentso that's that's typically fairly faroff so you end upmining more coins than you expectthrough the bottom of the marketand then i say the market recoverssomewhat sowe did one coincidentally where when westartedthe bitcoin price was around fifteenthousand dollarsif you bought that would have been theentry price and and when we finishedwhen these machines reachedlife the price was about seven thousandfive hundred and soif you bought and hold you'd have made a50 lossin cash terms bitcoin but with mining weended up making a 25profit in dollars and you wonder likewell how could that beand so you go back test a bunch ofthings and try and figure out thepattern of what's going on hereand the point was price fell all the waydown to3 500 which gives you an indication inthis period andremind a lot of coins at prices below3500because you know you're generally miningat a discount or you stop andthen the price recovered to 7 500 andthat wasenough to push us into the discount onminingplus the fact that we got more coins weexpected because the price really fell along wayin the middle of it so i think generallywhat you see is itit's less sensitive to entry price ortimingyou have some downside protection youstill have a fairly goodupside participation like we've seenacross the periods we backtested it averaged about 60 upsideparticipationas compared to buying just buying andholding bitcoin so for the trade-offi think you know that's that's aninteresting trade-off better than beingfrozen inindecision let's say right for peoplewho are new to bitcoin are looking toestablish a position when you say 60upside that's on an annualized basisno sort of absolute return across athree-year period i meanof course there are many periods wherebuying and holding out performs i meanbitcoin's price history isnothing but exponential but it's it'salso volatileso the point being that you experienceless volatility by doing miningand there are people you could say wellyou know lookuh bitcoin has performed well over allthree previousx year periods right and that would bestatistically the case but it's stillunnerving prospects for people who arenot used to bitcoin haven't adaptedright i meanwe've both you know participated indifferent conventional marketsand there's enough volatility in thosebut but bitcoin at timestakes that to a whole different levelright so i think thereduced volatility of money versusbuyingand the prospect of this downsideprotectionand some upside participation go prettyreasonableupside participation at 60 statisticallyis something less scary thanfull bitcoin because some people wouldyou know do a mixtureand other than newcomers who don't havea bitcoin positionthe other type of investors we've seenbe interested to to do this are peoplewho actuallyalready are very deep in bitcoin almostfelt overexposed to bitcoinand so they had some doors andwere interested to do something bitcoincorrelated but with more downsideprotectionso that that made sense to them as wellbut for a very different reasoni think another reason to do mining isas we were talking about earlierbitcoin gets some of its value frombeingpermissionless and decentralized andso if mining becomes too centralizedthat couldexpose it to governance like risksright and so i think if you look at thebitcoin market capand you work out what it would takeinvested in mining what percentage ofthat it would take toon an individual basis or on a wholesystem basis it's only a couple ofpercentage pointsof the let's say 1 trillion in in marketcapas composed to a handful of billionsin mining equipment and electrical spendso you know one approach and that that'sthat was my personal philosophical pointof jumping intodoing some mining on more than a hobbybasis myself was wellmaybe i should be part of the solutionand operate some of them i meannot physically hand on but you know havea they're my miners so i cansay if something dramatic is happening ican instruct a service provider likei want you to do this with my miners andthey're going to do itthat's an interesting point and i justwant to kind of summarize especially fora lot of the finance and investing typesthat are listening to thisin short what you're really getting atis this is giving you a better sharpratioby investing because you don't have asmuch volatility and you'resaying that over a three year period oftime you have demonstrated through backtesting which doesn't necessarily meanit's going to be what it is movingforward that you've had a 60out performance so if you're having lessvariance in your priceyou're having an out performance that'sgoing to give you a higher sharp ratiothan if you would just buy theunderlyingand that's something to be said becausewhen we look at the sharpe ratio onbitcoinand i know the sharp ratio i've lookedat is over four year periods but it hasliterally outperformed everythingfinancialevery financial asset on the planetover the last uh 10 years um right whichissomething to be said so that's that's areally interestingstat well i mean i would saywhat you said is accurate but i wouldemphasize that the expected returnis lower by mining but a sharp ratiomeasuringthe trade-off between investment returnand volatilityit has reduced your volatility by morethan it has reduced yourreturn yeah and maybe that's attractiveto some people orthey'd like a little bit of a lower riskof course the other thing you obviousthing you can do with risk which iswhich is the way some people talk aboutbitcoinfor newcomers is to say well by one tofive percentfrom the point of view you know yourstock portfolio is moving aroundyou're uncertain about lots of factorsin today's world so what iswhat's the worst that can happen youcould lose one to five percent andlooking at the other factors you'relooking at including m2 money supplyexpansion andprobable double digit asset priceinflationtrying something for at a one to fivepercent ratio thatmay improve that's just an assetallocation you know mixing a high shopratio asset with higher volatility itmay repair yourreturns if things go badly so that'sthat's another thing just justasset i mean portfolio allocationso adam what are you guys doing from ablock stream lever is this allinternal as far as just you're usingyour own retained earnings in order toinvest in this is this something you'regoing to open up to the marketthat people can participate in it withyou as well through equity or throughdebt somehowwhat's your approach moving forward forthis how we started wassort of about 50 50 internal investmentuse of companies cash reservesand actually converted a bunch of usdollars into bitcoinso bitcoin holdings increased throughthat andthe other was hosting for high net worthindividuals andinstitutions so there were red hoffmannas an individual and fidelity is one ofthehosting customers and there have beenmore that have been announced over timesoa number of the recognized brand nameinstitutions in this spacewho are doing mining many of them don'thave physical operations so they willhost equipment to usuh something else we've had you knowwe're interested in decentralizationand us doing some sort of institutionalandin company mining is a form of macrodecentralization right we're doing it incanada or the uswe're a new voice so you know if thereare 50institutional miners in 49 that's asmall amount of decentralization butyou know it's not very end userdecentralizedand so we have seen a lot of ongoingrequests from individuals to say hey canican i buy ten thousand dollars worth ofmining or can i buy a hundred thousanddollars worth of moneyand that was something that we wereinterested to do but once set up to doat the beginning so we set abouttrying to address that problem and meetthat demand so more recently we haveoffered something called the blockchainmining note which tries to do that nowon a regulatory basis it's onlyavailable to non-usinvestors and there's a qualificationcriteriawhich where the minimum investment hasto exceed125 000 euros again this is for non-usinvestorsbut you know it does bring the barrierdown adam just for clarification yousaid it's a noteyeah so it's it's actually i think it'sthe first of its kind actually thewe worked with a company called stockerin europe that is a kind of regulatoryspecialistand they are the registration agent forthis it's aluxembourg's criticization vehicle andso it'sit has a foot in both worlds so it'sboth a luxembourg securitizationvehicle with a an ice in an investmentserial numberand so you know you could potentiallygive that to a brokerdeals with you know a longer tale ofassets and say how can you can you holdthis as part of my portfoliocan you margin lend against it that kindof thing is all possibleif you have a more bespoke brokerage butit's alsoan asset in a cryptocurrencytokenization senseso it's a liquid security tokenso it's an sto i love it andthis is awesome okay so the securitytoken means i mean it will imply somequite interesting thingsfor people who are able to to access itregulatoryone is that you can potentially transferotcso after the issuance phase there aresome differentlimits that apply later so it can betransferred down to 0.01 but only toqualifying users andto be a qualified user the user has toregister on stocker and they have theregistration agent for these transfersbut there's nokind of conventional stock transferagent feeany kind of network fees which arediminished and soyou could gift somebody a bmn or part ofa bmnyou could swap it otc and there are youknow smartphone wallets to let you dothatso it's kind of private otc scenario andthere are some exchanges which we areworking with that may end upbeing in a position to list stos goingforwards and soin that sense they would be a kind ofnomineeombudsman holder of these notes so thenotes the registration agent would be inthe name of that exchangeand then the exchange would reflect thequalification requirementsonto their users so it'd be accessibleto a subset of the users i.enot in the us and reaching some levelall right so i have a million questionshere so you said that it's throughstalker that you'reregistering for your ownership of thenotewhich is a token on liquid how is thematurity of this and andis there a coupon is it coupon list i'massuming it'swould this be a there would be no couponbeing paid you would just get a kind ofa payout at the maturity dateright so we we had some quite a bit ofuhinternal design discussion about the themechanismjurisdiction tax planning so there'squite a lot that goes into thisbut yes so it's coupon less so there'sno bitcoin being dividendedout of it so the bitcoins roll up insideuntil maturity then they're paid outin bitcoin to the holder on at the timeofmaturity so you hold this token what'sthe maturity on these36 months 36 monthsso i could buy it 12 months after it'salready been issuedfor whatever price it's trading for onthe open marketand then i hold it let's say i hold itthrough maturityat that time the token just disappearsand bitcoin shows up in a wallet that'sregistered withthat specific token is that how thatwould workyeah if it's on the exchange they wouldprobably take care of that for youif you are holding it in a wallet you'dprobably need to go to stockerand you know deposit the token and turnit into a bitcoinput bitcoin address kind of like youknow having aoil future you've got to take deliveryat the end rightso now are are you guys going to gothrough just one issuance are you goingto go through multiple issuancesto just kind of continue funding and itsounds to me a little bit likewhat you had previously described wherehalf of whatever you guys are generatingyou're putting into hardwareand then the other half you're retainingas payments forthe electrical expenses which is kind ofyour maybe derivativestrategy in order to make sure that yourelectrical costshave kind of like a predictable curve tothem is that how you'rekind of going about it from like astrategic sensepart of that is back tested right soso we're thinking based on our ownexperience prop miningthat this is a better way to do iteconomically as opposed tospending your capital allocation on theminers and then paying as you go orselling bitcoins as you goso we put those economics into the notebecause we want the note holdersto have a positive economic outcome sothey buy more of thembasically right so yeah win-win formulaand it's exactly like you sayso of course the the price is bundledso how you ascribe value to the cost ofthe minersversus the remaining duration on ahosting contractis is a matter for you know the uh themarketto decide ultimately and over time ofcourse it'sgot an additional makeup which is thenumber of coins per noteand then you know there's a dashboardwhere you can see that on a fairlyreal-time basisnow you asked another question which isdo we issue more so yes we areintending to issue about 100 milliondollars so 85 million euros ofthe of this series and they areso even though they're issued atdifferent times we do some clever thingsto achieve fungibility between them sothat they areyou know all interchangeable and youshouldn't care as an investor whetheryou boughtan early sales tranche versus a latersales tranche versus in the marketand that's that's quite interesting toactually achieve because you knowthese this first 12.5 million salestranche ispower update early july and let's saythere's another tranche that soldin september for that to be equal it hasto have a 33 month hosting contract andwe have to mark it bythe number of coins per note that theminers have already been running haveachieved right and so that'sthat's what we do so i would think thatyou would do it in a way wherelet's say you have your first tranchewhatever you raisethrough that initial tranche that hasdedicatedservers that are basically partitionedsaying heythis amount of processing power isdedicated to thistranche of funding and then as the nexttranche comes in whatever servers thatareassociated i'm saying servers but reallykind of processing powerand terra hashes or whatever it might beis dedicated to this trancheof of funding am i understanding itcorrectly that that's how it's how it'sbeing managedso it's so no that's it's actually allinterchangeable once think about it likepool of capital that's mining andthere's a certaineconomic makeup of the per note valueso let's say it's augustthey've been running for a while there'sa certain proportion of bitcoin per notethere's now not 36 but 35 months left torun on the contractso the the value of the hostingcontracts go down a bit the bitcoin havea market valueand the machines have you know somedepreciation scale or valueright and now it rolls over to septemberand we want to addsome more notes which areinterchangeablewith the running notes and so what we dois try to match the economiccharacteristics of the existing nodes sowe say okay let's look at the make upit has a defined number of bitcoin wecan fix that we just go market buythat many bitcoin it has 35 months leftto run on the hosting contractwe'll give it a 35 month contract i seehow you're doing itand then the machine should becomparable right but it's it's definedin terms of hash rate so even ifyou know these machine shortages meanthat sometimes you want to take what youcan get right soif the machines that come online are 42joules instead of 38 like they're lessefficientit's still fungible because thedefinition is in the hash rate targetof what it's producing right so it willmean that you know maybe we pay slightlyless for the machinesbut expense slightly more power but it'sstill interchangeable because thefinished product is the hash way you getfrom itbut at any point in time post theinitial issuancelet's say we're three months into theinto the ownership of thisi can look at how much bitcoin has beenmined that's associated with that noteis that correct right and it's actuallythe same for all of the notes becauseit's kind of uh harmonized you knowthere's a pool of hash rate so it'saveraged but there is adefined this is how many clones havebeenmined per note or in aggregate and thisis how many notes there areand you know another question people askis well what ifi want to sell the coins you knowbecause i can't extract themand so you can sort of synthesizethe equivalence of there being a bitcoincoupon byyou know if you have additional bitcoinsoutside you could just sell thoseinsteadsomething else you could do you know wewere talking earlier aboutyield strategies is you could assumingthere are exchanges whichhonor the bmn notes as collateralyou could short bitcoin using it ascollateral to the tune of the number ofcoins per noteand that would even you know that wouldbe equivalent to selling right becauseit would lock in the dollar value plusit would give you a yield typicallyresulting from you know kind of bitcoinperpetualproducts right wow so this is this isjustthis is such an interesting approach andit's so much different thanparticipating in a mining pool or justgoing out and buying equityin a mining company it really has a feelthatyou are really participating in thefunding of hardware and then getting thekickback of whatever that hardware ispumping out fascinating i'm reallycuriouswhy not in the us i think i know theanswer that you're going to say but i'mcuriouswhat's the reason that you were not ableto do this in the u.swe may be able to in future it's justthere are different regulatoryrequirements and that's that's furtherfurther processand i mean i think the other thing thatso you mentioned a couple of thingsthere one is that you are notyou know buying shares in a miningcompany so this is morelike a non-discretionary financialinstrumentso you're not relying on some managementdiscretionary decision if you put moneyinto buying shares in a prop miningcompanynow you are you know exposed to well didthey make a good decisiondid they decide to use your money toexpand a farm over thereor you know sell some coins to dollarsbecause the prices fallingor payout a management bonus or payoutdividend or not there'snone of that stuff applies right it'sall non-discretionary definedwhat's happening there's there's uh youknow extremely thindeterministic behavior and it's uh it'skind oflike a bitcoin etf but it's kind of likeand it's not an etf but it'sit's something in that direction wherethere's a defined thing that doessomething very thinly managedi'm kind of curious so let's just say ibuy a thousanddollars worth of this note when are youexpecting over that three year timeframefor the person to break even on theprinciple of the thousand dollarsbased on yes testing yes so i thinkobviously it's difficult because thereare so manyexponentials that go into the bitcoinworld you know yeah finish the price thehigh volatilitythe hash rate is is prone to like reallyuh actuallyeven exceed price because because you'vealso got a factor ofmore modern equipment being developedover time that has a higher hash rateper jouleso i think you know one one thing we cando is look at the back to testing with acaveat thatthe future doesn't doesn't guaranteethat and say that you know it hasn'tlost moneyover previous three year periods that ithas this60 upside participation as compared tobuy and holdingbut what is very defined is the shortterm becausebitcoin has a fully liquid market pricethe current difficultyis you can look at it that's verifiableand you can infer from thatwhat your you know mind bitcoin revenuewould beso for notes the list price of the noteof course that that may change based onthe inputs later is 200 000 euros sothat's actually the minimum investmentand if it were running now i would saythat wouldproduce about 20 000 euros per monthso it's if the metrics went such that itwas straight lineyou would see a break even at 12 monthsyeah about a year and that's intuitivelythat's kind of what i was expecting tohear you say it was about a year timeframeright and so of course it can it's youknow it allas it's not as volatile as bitcoin butit's still volatile so you've got tolike buckle upgoing into these things right and uhthat can go both directions right soif you scroll forward to some of thesestock to flow derived price targets orjust price targets people are thrown outor comparators between previous harbinglows and highs or cycle lows and highsthree hundred thousand dollar priceinto next year of course theprofitability is going to be throughthe roof because nobody can manufacturethat amount of equipmentin that time frame like there isn'tenough foundry capacity in the world ifyou manage toyou know seize all the capacity that'sbeing used to build smartphonechips and so forth which is hard to hardto compete within terms of their command of capacitybasicallybut of course if that were to happen ithink it's fair to sayyou would have done even better if youjust bought bitcoin and held it nowright but you know in the alternativethere's certainly people looking at themarket now and saying wow sixty thousanddollars is a high pricei'm scared to buy and and they get stuckin a decision cycleso now as an alternative to that i thinkit's ait's a pretty reasonable trade-off i'mkind of curious on the stalker thing arethey doing this with equity as wellwhere they'reassisting in the issuance of tokens forequityyeah so they've they are a a companythat specializes inthat area so they do the kyc they area luxembourg securitizationlike licensed luxembourg securitizationmanager i don't knowall the correct technology but they'reexperts in that domain and theydo fundraisers for these kind of it'scalled a non-publicinvestment in in europe and so one theydid is for asupercar called mazanti so it's anitalian kind ofbespoke custom supercar company that'sequity in the company or something likethat or equity orproportion of revenue something i didn'tlook into the details but they are doingthings like that another one is infinitefleetsyeah samsung was telling us about thisso that's how he's doing it is throughokay it makes sense now okay so let'stransition toreal fast here and i know your time islimited and i want to be respectful ofthat i just want to hearwhat is the biggest news you've seenthis year orsomething that really kind of just kindof made you go oh wowit seems like the the metrics andinstitutional so almost stampede toparticipate is you know there'ssomething new every day or tworight big fund managers big banks wherethe ceos have been skepticalit's just um the rest of the demandright they're writing stock to flowuh charts now from fidelity yeah sothat's that's kind of interesting to seei mean of course the the adoption levelis still fairly lowthe treasury and disclosures areinteresting too that michael sailorkind of encouraged people to do it'ssomething we've actually been doingsinceyou know 2014 which is when we wereincorporatedand that you know that that obviouslyworks pretty well right we got theequivalent of probably a couple ofroundsof investment through bitcoin priceappreciationand investor dollars into mining thatwas also highly profitablein in dollar terms and putting morebitcoin on the balance sheet soi think it's an interesting sort ofprecursor to transitioning toa uh bitcoin monetary base if thathappensor at least a kind of alternative storeof valueright because nobody i think sometimespeopleover emphasize that fiat currencies havefallen even the best of them 99 over 100year time frame rate butnobody in the investment space says youshould put you know cash under themattress right so it's not really ausefulcomparison so i think maybe gold is aninteresting comparisonand bitcoin may i guess in the long termdo a little birth and goldeven at the top of an s curve you knowafter fully adoptedwhatever level that is you know ifthat's a hundred trillion or 200trillionfive to ten million a coin even thenbecausethe um you know having displaced lots ofdifferentsort of artificially monetized goodslike you know stocks real estateartwork gold things where people are notbuying it for the enjoyment of it butthey're buying it topreserve capital or to in theexpectation of price appreciation byotherpeople so you can do the same thing soeven in that case i think it wouldoutperform gold because it's it's uhstrictly scarcewhere you know there's always more goldso the supply inflation should taperoff so well below gold i guess is mypoint just the sequence ofpositive news is just really keeps keepsgoingthat's pretty interesting so you and ihave exchangedsome messages with plan b in thebackground about this contango tradeand what i find fascinating is you'reseeing this pretty much onlymaterialize or these spreads these largespreadsbetween the spot and the future pricematerialize on physically settledexchangeswhen you get into the cash settledexchanges it doesn't seem like that thisis happeningbut with the size of some of thesephysically settledderivatives exchanges all over the worldwhich aremassive billions and billions inin size what is causing this is thisgoing to continue to persistespecially as the volatility gets largeras we go through this bull market we'reinand does that cause the spread to evenblow outlarger than what we're seeing right nowthe locking up ofof coins on the physically settledexchange is this almost like a secondhalvingkind of event that's playing out in realtime like give us some of your thoughtson thisi think it's a kind of submarine issueto many people or not issue i meanit's a positive driver but it's notsomething that they would becould be visible to them necessarilybecause it's kind of wrapped up inyou know some kind of advanced tradingstrategies andyou know it's kind of mysterious but itseems likeactually has the potential to bea kind of uh bitcoin monetizationdriver because people who are not eveninterested in bitcoin can get anextremely highu.s dollar interest return 30 40yeah completely bitcoin neutral and soyou know of course once theyrealize that this is the case and thatthey can do these take these kind ofmatch positionson increasingly high tier platforms moreand more money will flow into that soone theory could be that and of coursethere's enormous pools of moneyoutside of the crypto space buying30-year bonds and negative rates andthings like that right soso there's like a lot of money out thereso you would think that once the dambreaksand it flows in the yields would slowdown but i think the problem is thatit's um the universe expandingso so when you say that intuitivelyi agree with you but in order for themto continue to participate they'relocking upmore of the underlying as they come inand try to chase those spreadsand so after locking up more of theunderlying they're clawing it off themarketwhich is almost like it's supplyinganotherhaving or supply suffocation of theunderlying coins because you the onlyway you canthat you can do these these positions isyou've got to put them in escrowthe underlying right yes so soi think there's some positivereinforcement loopwhere it's a mistake to think that youknow let's say there's4 trillion dollars of demand to borrowdollarsand so you know there's only let's sayhalf a trillion that isexcellent on crypto trading platformsand sothis is sort of demand to go leveragelong because many you know the peoplethat arein bitcoin generally want more bitcoinor regretformer conservatism and so and of coursethere are speculators too but you knowthere's clearly a high demand forleverageand as a shortage of it they bid theprice up and the problem is basicallythat people who arehave doors on crypto exchanges willgenerallybe inclined to market by bitcoin andhold it so the only way you can persuadethem to lend it to youis to bid the price up and as you knowthere's an oversubscription for thatand so you would say well you know thatthere's so much demand nowthere's more than that money outside theecosystem once they overcomethere are many platforms where you can'tcount physical bitcoin as collateralso you've got to use other collateral sothat takes you know take some of the funout of it butas you said i think the thing is thatit's it's not a stationary picturebecauseit's also as more money flows in itsatisfies the demand tobuy more bitcoin and pushes the price uplocks up the physical bitcoin for theseyield strategieswhich is you know more scarcity somebodywants to institutionally buy bitcoinwhere are they gonna go right is it aperpetual machineonce you get a physically settledderivatives market that's maturein place that's the question i'm toyingwith i have no clue what the answer isand i don't know that there's any waythat we could solve orsay conclusively that that's what thisis but in a weird wayit's kind of looking like that's what'spotentially the case hereyeah i mean it does seem like there'ssome kind of hyperbitcoinizationaspect to this which is it's just aself-feeding monster that wants toabsorb all the moneyand so basically what it's doing is it'sjust you know shifting the bitcoin billexchangerate as that changes it can absorb moremoney because now the price per coin ishigherso it's not four trillion then it'seight trillion and then it's20 trillion and before you know it youknow you have full scaleglobal hyper bitcoinization or somethingso we'll see how it playsand you know the one interesting partabout it thoughis that unlike the you know the kind oftrader psychology that goes intopullbacks andduring a growth cycle like we're in nowthere havetypically been like a dozen 10 20 even30pullbacks on the way across you know100xgrowth period or something which we'veseen in the past andso you know people have to becomeaccustomed to that some people planexcelor make other mistakes over leveragethat kind of thingbut with the yield strategiesyou're immune to that these are you knowlargely immune to volatilityso long as the platform you're using issolventdoesn't get hacked and so that's wheremore mature platforms coming into playhelps then what's not to like about theyield in this environmentand so there's a reason for people tobuy bitcoin tocollateralize the yields the dollaryield collectionand so now they don't even directly careabout the pricei mean it's 10x at least 10x right nowon an annualized basis of what they'regetting on any type oftraditional government-issued long-termbond10x it's crazy right well adam i couldliterally talk to you all daythoroughly thoroughly enjoyed thisconversation and i really want to dothis again because when i posted that iwas going to be talking to you ontwitter i think i had three or 400people send me questions as to what theywanted us to talk about so i wouldreally
