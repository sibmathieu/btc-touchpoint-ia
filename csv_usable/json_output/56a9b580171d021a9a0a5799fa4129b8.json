This is a very widespread beliefin our society. It's the kind of belief system\nof people who say \"I don't believe in God,I believe in science.\" It's a belief system\nwhich has now been spread to the entire world.But there's a conflict in the heart of science\nbetween science as a method of inquiry basedon reason, evidence, hypothesis and collective\ninvestigation, and science as a belief systemor a world view. And unfortunately the world\nview aspect of science has come to inhibitand constrict the free inquiry which is the\nvery lifeblood of the scientific endeavour.Since the late nineteenth century, science\nhas been conducted under the aspect of a beliefsystem or a world view which is essentially\nthat of materialism; philosophical materialism.And the sciences are now wholly owned subsidiaries\nof the materialist world view. I think thatas we break out of it, the sciences will be\nregenerated. What I do in my book The ScienceDelusion, which is called Science Set Free\nin the United States, is take the ten dogmas,or assumptions of science, and turn them into\nquestions. Seeing how well they stand up ifyou look at them scientifically. None of them\nstand up very well.What I'm going to do is first run through\nwhat these ten dogmas are. And then I'll onlyhave time to discuss one or two of them in\na bit more detail. But essentially the tendogmas, which are the world view of most educated\npeople all over the world are:First, that nature's mechanical or machine-like.\nThe universe is like a machine, animals andplants are like machines, we're like machines.\nIn fact, we are machines. We are lumberingrobots, in Richard Dawkins' vivid phrase.\nWith brains that are genetically programmedcomputers.\nSecond, matter is unconscious. The whole universeis made up of unconscious matter. There's\nno consciousness in stars, in galaxies, inplanets, in animals, in plants, and there\nought not in any of us either, if this theory'strue. So a lot of the philosophy of mind over\nthe last hundred years has been trying toprove that we're not really conscious at all.\nSo the matter's unconscious, then the lawsof nature are fixed.\nThis is dogma three. The laws of nature arethe same now as they were at the time of the\nbig bang and they'll be the same forever.Not just the laws; but the constants of nature\nare fixed, which is why they are called constants.Dogma four: The total amount of matter and\nenergy is always the same. It never changesin total quantity, except at the moment of\nthe big bang when it all sprang into existencefrom nowhere in a single instant.\nThe fifth dogma is that nature's purposeless.There are no purposes in all nature and the\nevolutionary process has no purpose or direction.Dogma six, the biological hereditary is material.\nEverything you inheret is in your genes, orin epigenetic modifications of the genes,\nor in cytoplasmic inheritance. It's material.Dogma seven, memories are stored inside your\nbrain as material traces. Somehow everythingyou remember is in your brain in modified\nnerve endings, phosphorylated proteins, no-oneknows how it works. But nevertheless almost\neveryone in the scientific world believesit must be in the brain.\nDogma eight, your mind is inside your head.All your consciousness is the activity of\nyour brain, nothing more.Dogma nine, which follows from dogma eight,\npsychic phenomena like telepathy are impossible.Your thoughts and intentions cannot have any\neffect at a distance because your mind's insideyour head. Therefore all the apparent evidence\nfor telepathy and other psychic phenomenais illusory. People believe these things happen,\nbut it's just because they don't know enoughabout statistics, or they're deceived by coincidences,\nor it's wishful thinking.And dogma ten, mechanistic medicine is the\nonly kind that really works. That's why governmentsonly fund research into mechanistic medicine\nand ignore complementary and alternative therapies.Those can't possibly really work because they're\nnot mechanistic. They may appear to work becausepeople would have got better anyway, or because\nof the placebo effect. But the only kind thatreally works is mechanistic medicine.Well\nthis is the default world view which is heldby almost all educated people all over the\nworld. It's the basis of the educational system,the national health service, the medical research\ncouncil, governments and it's just the defaultworld view of educated people. But I think\nevery one of these dogmas is very, very questionable.And when you look at it, they fall apart.I'm\ngoing to take first the idea that the lawsof nature are fixed. This is a hangover from\nan older world view, before the 1960s, whenthe big bang theory came in. People thought\nthat the whole universe was eternal, governedby eternal mathematical laws. When the big\nbang came in, then that assumption continued,even though the big bang revealed a universe\nthat's radically evolutionary, about fourteenbillion years old. Growing and developing\nand evolving, for fourteen billion years.Growing and cooling and more structures and\npatterns appear within it. But the idea isall the laws of nature were completely fixed\nat the moment of the big bang like a cosmicNapoleonic code. As my friend Terrence McKenna\nused to say, modern science is based uponthe principle \"give us one free miracle, and\nwe'll explain the rest\". And the one freemiracle is the appearance of all the matter\nand energy in the universe and all the lawsthat govern it, from nothing, in a single\ninstant.Well, in an evolutionary universe, why shouldn't\nthe laws themselves evolve? After all, humanlaws do, and the idea of laws of nature is\nbased a metaphor with human laws. It's a veryanthropocentric metaphor; only humans have\nlaws. In fact, only civilised societies havelaws. As C.S. Lewis once said, to say that\na stone falls to earth because it's obeyinga law makes it a man, and even a citizen.\nIt's a metaphor we've got so used to we forgotit's a metaphor. In an evolving universe,\nI think a much better idea is the idea ofhabits. I think the habits of nature evolve;\nthe regularities of nature are essentiallyhabitual. This was an idea put forward at\nthe beginning of the twentieth century bythe American philosopher C.S. Pierce, and\nit's an idea which various other philosophershave entertained, and it's one which I, myself\nhave developed into a scientific hypothesis;the hypothesis of morphic resonance, which\nis the basis of these evolving habits. Accordingto this hypothesis, everything in nature has\na kind of collective memory, resonance occurson the basis of similarity.\nAs a young giraffe embryo grows in its mother'swomb, it tunes in to the morphic resonance\nof previous giraffes. It draws on that collectivememory, grows like a giraffe, and it behaves\nlike a giraffe, because it's drawing on thiscollective memory. It has to have the right\ngenes to make the right proteins. But genesin my view are grossly overrated. They only\naccount for the proteins that the organismcan make, not the form or the shape or the\nbehaviour. Every species has a kind of collectivememory. Even crystals do. This theory predicts\nthat if you make a new kind of crystal forthe first time, the very first time you make\nit, it won't have an existing habit. But onceit crystallises, then the next time you make\nit, there'll be an influence from the firstcrystals to the second ones, all over the\nworld by morphic resonance, it'll crystallisea bit easier. The third time, there'll be\nan influence from the first and second crystals.There is, in fact, good evidence that new\ncompounds get easier to crystallise all roundthe world, just as this theory would predict.\nIt also predicts that if you train animalsto learn a new trick, for example rats learn\na new trick in London, then all round theworld rats of the same breed should learn\nthe same trick quicker just because the ratshad learned it here. And surprisingly, there's\nalready evidence that this actually happens.Anyway, that's my own hypothesis in a nutshell\nof morphic resonance. Everything depends onevolving habits not on fixed laws.\nBut I want to spend a few moments on the constantsof nature too. Because these are, again, assumed\nto be constant. Things like the gravitationalconstant of the speed of light are called\nthe fundamental constants. Are they reallyconstant? Well, when I got interested in this\nquestion, I tried to find out. They're givenin physics handbooks. Handbooks of physics\nlist the existing fundamental constants, tellyou their value. But I wanted to see if they'd\nchanged, so I got the old volumes of physicalhandbooks. I went to the patent office library\nhere in London - they're the only place Icould find that kept the old volumes. Normally\npeople throw them away when the new values(volumes) come out, they throw away the old\nones. When I did this I found that the speedof light dropped between nineteen twenty-eight\nand nineteen fourty-five by about twenty kilometresper second. It's a huge drop because they're\ngiven with errors of any fractions of a second/decimalpoints of error. And yet, all over the world,\nit dropped, and they were all getting verysimilar values to each other with tiny errors.\nThen in nineteen fourty-eight, it went upagain. And then people started getting very\nsimilar values again. I was very intriguedby this and I couldn't make sense of it, so\nI went to see the head of metrology at theNational Physical Laboratory in Teddington.\nMetrology is the science in which people measureconstants.\nAnd I asked him about this, I said \"what doyou make of this drop in the speed of light\nbetween nineteen twenty-eight and nineteenfourty-five?\"\nAnd he said \"oh dear\", he said \"you've uncoveredthe most embarrassing episode in the history\nof our science.\"So I said \"well, could the speed of light\nhave actually dropped? And that would haveamazing implications if so.\"\nHe said \"no, no, of course it couldn't haveactually dropped. It's a constant!\"\n\"Oh, well then how do you explain the factthat everyone was finding it going much slower\nduring that period? Is it because they werefudging their results to get what they thought\nother people should be getting and the wholething was just produced in the minds of physicists?\"\n\"We don't like to use the word 'fudge'.\"I said \"Well, so what do you prefer?\"\nHe said \"well, we prefer to call it 'intellectualphase-locking'.\"\nSo I said \"well if it was going on then, howcan you be so sure it's not going on today?\nAnd the present values produced are by intellectualphase-locking?\"\nAnd he said \"oh we know that's not the case.\"And I said \"how do we know?\"\nHe said \"well\", he said \"we've solved theproblem.\"\nAnd I said \"well how?\"And he said \"well we fixed the speed of light\nby definition in nineteen seventy-two.\"So I said \"but it might still change.\"\nHe said \"yes, but we'd never know it, becausewe've defined the metre in terms of the speed\nof light, so the units would change with it!\"So he looked very pleased about that, they'd\nfixed that problem.But I said \"well, then what about big G?\"\nThe gravitational constant, known in the tradeas \"big G\", it was written with a capital\nG. Newton's universal gravitational constant.\"That's varied by more than 1.3% in recent\nyears. And it seems to vary from place toplace and from time to time.\"\nAnd he said \"oh well, those are just errors.And unfortunately there are quite big errors\nwith big G.\"So I said \"well, what if it's really changing?\nI mean, perhaps it is really changing.\"And then I looked at how they do it, what\nhappens is they measure it in different labs,they get different values on different days,\nand then they average them. And then otherlabs around the world do the same, they come\nout usually with a rather different average.And then the international committee of metrology\nmeets every ten years or so and average theones from labs all around the world to come\nup with the value of big G. But what if Gwere actually fluctuating? What if it changed?\nThere's already evidence actually that itchanges throughout the day and througout the\nyear. What if the earth, as it moves throughthe galactic environment went through patches\nof dark matter or other environmental factorsthat could alter it? Maybe they all change\ntogether. What if these errors are going uptogether and down together? For more than\nten years I've been trying to persuade metrologiststo look at the raw data. In fact I'm now trying\nto persuade them to put it up online, on theinternet. With the dates, and the actual measurements,\nand see if they're correlated. To see if they'reall up at one time, all down at another. If\nso, they might be fluctuating together. Andwhat would tell us something very, very interesting.\nBut no-one has done this, they haven't doneit because G is a constant. There's no point\nlooking for changes. You see, here's a verysimple example of where a dogmatic assumption\nactually inhibits enquiry. I, myself thinkthat the constants may vary quite considerably.\nWell, within narrow limits. But they may allbe varying, and I think the day will come\nwhen scientific journals like Nature havea weekly report on the constants, like stock-market\nreports in the newspapers. You know, \"thisweek, big G was slightly up, the charge on\nthe electron was down, the speed of lightheld steady, and so on.\"\nSo that's one area where I think thinkingthis dogmatically could open things up.\nOne of the biggest areas is the nature ofthe mind. This is the most unsolved problem\nas Graham just said, that science simply can'tdeal with the fact we're conscious.\nAnd it can't deal with the fact that our thoughtsdon't seem to be inside our brains. Our experiences\ndon't all seem to be inside our brain. Yourimage of me now doesn't seem to be inside\nyour brain, yet the official view is thatthere's a little Rupert somewhere inside your\nhead. And everything else in this room isinside your head; your experience is inside\nyour brain. I'm suggesting actually that visioninvolves an outward projection of images,\nwhat you're seeing is inside your mind butnot inside your head. Our minds are extended\nbeyond our brains in the simplest act of perception.I think that we project out the images we're\nseeing, and these images touch what we'relooking at. If I look at you from behind,\nyou don't know I'm there. Could I affect you?Could you feel my gaze? There's a great deal\nof evidence that people can. The sense ofbeing stared at is an extremely common experience,\nand recent experimental evidence actuallysuggests it's real.\nAnimals seem to have it too, I think it probablyevolved in the context of predator/prey relationships.\nPrey animals that could feel the gaze of apredator would survive better than those that\ncouldn't. This would lead to a whole new wayof thinking about ecological relationships\nbetween predators and prey.Also about the extent of our minds. If we\nlook at distant stars, I think our minds reachout in a sense to touch those stars, and literally\nextend out over astronomical distances. They'renot just inside our heads. Now it may seem\nastonishing that this is a topic of debatein the twenty-first century. We know so little\nabout our own minds that where our imagesare is a hot topic of debate within consciousness\nstudies right now.I don't have time to deal with any more of\nthese dogmas, but every single one of themis questionable. If one questions it, new\nforms of research, new possibilities openup. And I think as we question these dogmas\nthat have held back science so long, sciencewill undergo a reflowering, a renaissance.\nI'm a total believer in the importance ofscience. I've spent my whole life as a research\nscientist, my whole career. But I think bymoving beyond these dogmas, it can be regenerated.\nOnce again, it can become interesting, andI hope, life-affirming.\nThank you.",
