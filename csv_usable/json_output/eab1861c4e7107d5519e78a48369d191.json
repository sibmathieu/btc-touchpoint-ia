The main difference with a Bitcoin wallet is that it doesnâ€™t actually store bitcoin inside, bitcoins exist solely on the distributed ledger (blockchain). A bitcoin wallet stores the keys required sign the transactions that send bitcoin. When you sign a transaction with your wallet, you show proof that you have the right to spend those coins. This proof can be checked by anyone running a node which stops anyone cheating the system.\nThere goes a famous saying amongst Bitcoiners, â€˜not your keys, not your coinsâ€™. The phrase is aimed to drive home the fact that, if you are not the custodian of your walletâ€™s private keys, you essentially have no bitcoin. A good example of this is buying bitcoin on an exchange and leaving it there. You may have a claim to x amount of bitcoin, but the exchange is actually in control of the private keys. What you actually have is an IOU that can be taken from you, for various reasons, at any moment. By taking control of your bitcoin in a non custodial wallet, you remove this risk.\n\nContents\n\nAbout\nMobile\nDesktop\nHardware\nLightning\nCompare\n\nFeature Criteria\nFor feature consideration in this guide, a wallet must meet these base criteria.\n\nBe non custodial\nBe source viewable (Open Source preferred of course)\nBe actively maintained\nOffer a Bitcoin focused option or firmware version (Hardware wallets)\n\n\nConsiderations\nWhen choosing which type of wallet you want to use, there are a few things you should consider.
