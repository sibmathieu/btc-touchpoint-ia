Ce dernier, d√©velopp√© par le Programme pour l'Environnement de l'ONU, est un indicateur visant √† aller au del√† du PIB et mettre l'accent sur les citoyens. \n\nL'HDI est calcul√© sur la base de 3 crit√®res: le niveau d'√©ducation, le revenu par habitant, et la sant√© (https://lnkd.in/efxVitPb)\n\nLa figure ci-dessous, extraite du rapport du groupe 3 du GIEC publi√© l'an pass√©, montre la corr√©lation entre l'HDI et la consommation √©nerg√©tique (primaire par personne) ainsi que le niveau d'acc√®s √† l'√©lectricit√©. On voit une forte corr√©lation jusqu'√† un niveau d'environ 100GJ/personne (la France est √† 140, la Chine √† 110) et ensuite une forte disparit√©s. Les USA et la France ont un HDI identique mais les USA ont une consommation √©nerg√©tique par personne 2 fois sup√©rieure √† la France. Cela tient en partie au r√¥le du transport.\n\nOn voit √©galement que l'HDI est fortement corr√©l√© avec l'acc√©s √† l'√©lectricit√©. Un bon moment pour rappeler que 750 millions de personnes dans le monde n'ont pas acc√®s √† l'√©lectricit√© (https://lnkd.in/e3yNqmnb)\n\nDerni√®re remarque, ces chiffres sont en √©nergie primaire. La tendance √† l'√©lectrification va faire baisser la demande √©nerg√©tique via des gains d'efficacit√© (de m√™me pour la sobri√©t√©)\n\n#energyaccess #energytransition #climatechange \n\nSource du graphe: https://lnkd.in/exfpSsrE\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    143\n              \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n                41 Comments\n            \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Like\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n      Comment\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Share\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nCopy\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Cl√©ment Coeurdeuil üçã\n                  \nCo-fondateur @ yuzuüçã üëâ Sortez gagnant de la crypto !\n\n          \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n      10mo\n  \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Report this comment\n                    \n    \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nPassionnant...\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Like\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Reply\n    \n\n\n \n                1 Reaction\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Roseline Descout-Renier\n                  \nProfesseur agr√©g√©e de physique\n\n          \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n      10mo\n  \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Report this comment\n                    \n    \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nJ'aime bien utiliser ce graphe, car il permet de montrer qu'un pays comme le n√¥tre (parmi ceux qui consomment le plus par habitant) se situe sur l'asymptote horizontale.

La volont√© de vivre semble d'autant plus forte que la difficult√© √† survivre est importante. C'est contre-intuitif mais a √©t√© maintes fois observ√©.\n\nIl reste √©galement √† prouver que le bonheur soit un objectif pertinent. D'un point de vue biologique, seule compte la capacit√© √† transmettre les g√™nes (ce qui implique de pr√©server un environnement o√π ces g√®nes sont appropri√©s).\n\nEvidemment on n'est pas oblig√© de tout analyser du point de vu biologique, mais ca ne ferait pas de mal d'essayer d'√©tablir des indicateurs un poil plus \n\nPS) Ensuite, qu'un indicateur qui est compos√© de 3 √©l√©ments dont le PIB/habitant que l'on sait corr√©l√© √† la consommation d'√©nergie soit corr√©l√© √† la consommation d'√©nergie n'est pas vraiment une surprise. La forme de la courbe montre juste que l'√©dcation et la sant√© ne sont elle pas autant li√© √† la consommation √©nerg√©tique que le PIB.

The COP is actually a subject of intense debate given its location and presidency- and the influence of fossil fuels in the discussions (https://lnkd.in/eKGx4dgp).\n\nSpeaking of reports, the recently published ¬´¬†Production gap report¬†¬ª looks at the gap between what the global production of fossil fuels should be versus where it is headed. This is summarized in the figure below. Current plans have coal, oil, and gas production increase strongly by 2030 while stated policies show a decline for coal but a plateau for oil and gas. To respect the terms of the Paris agreement the total production should start declining quickly now‚Ä¶\n\nIn parallel the deployment of low carbon technologies is gaining pace (https://lnkd.in/eRfMNXwz\n\nOne could spend hours debating whether demand is pushing supply or the opposite (and both are true to an extent) but for now fossil fuel demand still has to decrease. In the transportation sector, it looks like EVs are soon going to push the demand down (https://lnkd.in/en6TW35x), other sectors have to follow.\n\nSource of the graph: https://lnkd.in/eUGJPNcQ\n#fossilfuels #climatechange #climateaction\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    103\n              \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n                11 Comments\n            \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Like\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n      Comment\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Share\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nCopy\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n      To view or add a comment, sign in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n              Greg De Temmerman\n            \n \n\n                Chief Science Officer at Quadrature Climate Foundation.

(https://lnkd.in/e9irEqUj).\n\nBut then I found this transcript of a great conversation between Bill Gates (that I had the pleasure to meet recently) and Hannah Ritchie (from my favorite website Our World in Data) and figured this was the perfect read for a rainy Sunday.\n\nThe content can be described by this quote ¬´¬†I think one nice framing that I like is my colleague Max Roser has this Venn diagram that shows the fact that you can hold three thoughts at the same time.\nOne, the world is awful, one the world is much better, and the third one being the world can be much better¬†¬ª. \n\nApplied to climate: yes climate change is happening and its effect are felt more and more every year,   we are making progress but could do much more. \n\nWe need to communicate on those three points without over or under emphasizing them. Yes climate change is very very bad, but no we‚Äôre not doomed. Yes we have many of the required solutions to reach net zero but we‚Äôre not going fast enough. We see way too many articles focusing on the problems or trying to demonstrate the transition won‚Äôt work.

The total primary energy demand increased by almost a factor of 4 since 1965 to reach about 600 EJ. And so far this keeps increasing, although a bit slower now.\n\nAnd more than 80% of our primary energy comes from fossil fuels- a share which has decreased very slowly over the last 60 years. But what is important is the absolute amount.\n\nThe recent World Energy Outlook from International Energy Agency (IEA) foresees that the peak of fossil fuel use could happen in the next few years (https://lnkd.in/e4hrZ3qY) before starting to decline. That decline should actually be a plunge if we are to respect the targets of the Paris agreement, a real challenge given the size of the system.\n\nObviously, talking about primary energy when discussing the energy transition is misleading as almost 2/3 of that primary energy is lost as heat before it is actually used (see our recent report on the topic https://lnkd.in/e92cVmJU but that is still a lot of energy to substitute.\n\nGraph from the author, with data from chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://lnkd.in/eWjzZ-_M\n#speedandscale #energytransition #fossilfuels \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    28\n              \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n                7 Comments\n            \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Like\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n      Comment\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Share\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nCopy\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n      To view or add a comment, sign in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n              Greg De Temmerman\n            \n \n\n                Chief Science Officer at Quadrature Climate Foundation.

And the level of global warming is directly correlated to the total cumulative amount of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere. This is nicely illustrated by this figure extracted from the latest IPCC report (https://lnkd.in/eFv6UV82). \n\nOne implication of this is the concept of carbon budget- the total amount of carbon which can be emitted to have a certain probability to remain below a certain level of warming (https://lnkd.in/eji_BbGR). When the latest IPCC report came out in 2021, the remaining carbon budget was estimated at 500 billion tons and 1400 billion tons of CO2 to stay below 1.5 and 2 degrees (50% probability), respectively (https://lnkd.in/eVZPVnhM).  \n\nSince then, humanity has emitted an additional 120 billion tons of CO2 and there has been further refinements in climate models, and so the budget has decreased quite a bit- as described in a recent paper published in Nature Climate change (https://lnkd.in/eTs-kMQJ). The budget to have a 50% chance to remain below 1.5 degrees is now 247 Gt, or 6-8 years of CO2 emissions... (https://lnkd.in/ed7dHihg)\n\nWe will soon have to start talking about that 1.5 degree target...

Or, more to the point, you will actually think of the giant ships crossing oceans with standardised containers. The concept of these containers was invented in 1956 by Malcom McLean to improve the efficiency of cargo transports- a story well described in the book \"The Box\" https://lnkd.in/dT8gzvpr\n\nToday's biggest container ships have dimensions which are hard to grasp (https://lnkd.in/dCRS4QNf). The MSC Irina and Loreto have dead weight tonnage of 240,000 tons (https://lnkd.in/dtntaFa7.). They also embark to most efficient diesel engines in the world which boast 71 MW of power (https://lnkd.in/dgfwxAxM). For more on those engines and how they developed throughout history, Vaclav Smil's \"Prime movers of globalization\" is a must-read.\n\nThe graph below shows the evolution of the energy demand from the shipping sector from 1972 to 2018- which is now around 10 EJ. Shipping is responsible for about 2% of global CO2 emissions (https://lnkd.in/dgmKMy4z). Methanol and ammonia fuels appear to be the most promising paths to decarbonise the sector (https://lnkd.in/dmHXAt-M) although a recent paper looked at the possibility to electrify part of the fleet with batteries (https://lnkd.in/d6GJyCTt)\n\nSource of the graph: https://lnkd.in/dmHXAt-M\n\n(*) let's continue with musical references\n#shipping #decarbonization #globalization #diesel \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    19\n              \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n                3 Comments\n            \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Like\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n      Comment\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Share\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nCopy\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n      To view or add a comment, sign in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n              Greg De Temmerman\n            \n \n\n                Chief Science Officer at Quadrature Climate Foundation.

The good news is that things like PV, wind, batteries are  indeed on a very fast deployment curve, although a steep acceleration is still needed (https://lnkd.in/efx-XNHK).\n\nBefore a technology can be deployed, it needs to reach a certain stage of development- which is usually captured by the Technological Readiness Level (TRL). This graph, extracted from the recent update of the IEA Net Zero by 2050 scenario, shows that development can take a very long time. The example of PV and wind are quite telling. Even Li-ion batteries took decades between invention and large scale deployment. An article published a few years ago looked at that for a wide range of technologies: https://lnkd.in/eHNZ7Skb\n\nGetting up the TRL scale requires R&D funding and trials and errors. It is usually difficult to foresee how long it takes. We're obviously in a particular situation where some technologies (think carbon removal) must be developed quickly and one can hope for some to be on a fast path.

By weight, it represents 94% of all the metals we use every year (https://lnkd.in/eazYyKcu). In 2022 around 2.6 billion tons of iron ore were produced, mainly to do steel.\n\nMetals are extracted in the form of ores which contain the metal in various concentrations. To produce 1 ton of metal one therefore needs to extract more rock and to process it. See this very interesting paper on the rock-to-metal ratio: https://lnkd.in/e-22KJn4\n\nThe graph below shows a schematic representation of the metal ore production in 2019. The top 3 is made of iron, copper, and‚Ä¶. Gold‚Ä¶ \nThis might be surprising since the 2020 production was 3200 tons (https://lnkd.in/epXxytRW) but that reflects the very low ore concentration. In comparison, copper production was around 22 million tons (https://lnkd.in/eRm9xvRR.)\n\nWhy is this important?\nAs we try to move away from fossil fuels, we will need more metals for the energy system (although in total that will mean less extraction) but most of the metals needed (nickel, lithium, etc) represents currently a very small share of the global ore production. \nAlways important to keep the full picture in mind‚Ä¶\n\nSource of the graph: https://lnkd.in/eriwTFbm\n#numbersdontlie #minerals #energytransition\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    72\n              \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n                4 Comments\n            \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Like\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n      Comment\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Share\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nCopy\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n      To view or add a comment, sign in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n              Greg De Temmerman\n            \n \n\n                Chief Science Officer at Quadrature Climate Foundation.

Per person that is almost 1 ton of coal per year (knowing that an average is a very bad way to go given the huge inequalities wrt energy access). But that is still hard to grasp because this is such a hugh amoung\n\nI tried the following analogies in a book I wrote: https://lnkd.in/eppG8qDt\n\n\"How can you imagine such quantities? If you imagine coal as a RubiksCube¬Æ, a cube with a side length of 5.7 cm, humanity burns 600,000 of them, or 253 tonnes, every second. \n\nSee the pyramid of Cheops in Egypt? With a base of 240 m and a height of 140 m, it remains without doubt the largest monument in the world with 2,600,000 m3 of stone. (...) Well, the equivalent volume of a Cheops pyramid is burned every five hours in coal, i.e. 1,700 per year: a huge volume. \nThe world‚Äôs largest open-cast coal mine, El Cerrejon in Colombia, covers an area the size of half the city of Paris. Half of the coal is produced and consumed in China. \"\n\nOur energy system is HUGE... \n\n#energy #scalematters #fossilfuels\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    83\n              \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n                9 Comments\n            \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Like\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n      Comment\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Share\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nCopy\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n      To view or add a comment, sign in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n              Greg De Temmerman\n            \n \n\n                Chief Science Officer at Quadrature Climate Foundation.

This is a lot of stuff that we then burn, and whose combustion releases CO2 and has a lot of other externalities.\n\nGetting rid of fossil fuels will require a lot of minerals (copper, lithium, nickel, etc) and the demand for many of them will sharply increase in the next decade- which poses serious concerns (https://lnkd.in/emTb7znR)\n\nWill that mean more mining moving forward?\nThis is an argument often put forward. But this is actually not the case. A paper just published in Joule looks at the ore extraction requirements in 2040 for the Net-Zero by 2050 scenario from International Energy Agency (IEA) and finds that they actually decrease significantly. This is actually a conclusion reached by several independent studies like here for example https://lnkd.in/egAdc4GB\n\nWatari et al have come to the same conclusion when looking at the total material requirement (all the things which need to be extracted to get the resource we need): https://lnkd.in/dE_Q6g3W\n\nThe metal demand can also be reduced by being more efficient (smaller cars, less cars, more recycling- although it plays on a longer timescale). And of course, there is a lot to do to make mining less environmentally damaging.\n\nLink to the paper: https://lnkd.in/dJPkABhB\n#criticalminerals #energytransition #fossilfuels \n\n(*) Sorry but the topic is an infinite source of puns\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    74\n              \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n                8 Comments\n            \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Like\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n      Comment\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Share\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nCopy\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n      To view or add a comment, sign in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n              Greg De Temmerman\n            \n \n\n                Chief Science Officer at Quadrature Climate Foundation.

Globally, EVs (battery and hybrid) represented 14% of new car sales and this number is increasing quickly (https://lnkd.in/e96RD-EU). EV adoption speed differ from country to country: while 80% of new cars sold in Norway in 2022 were electric, the number is about 20% in China (see that great piece from the World Resources Institute https://lnkd.in/dSBpkjA7.)\n\nThe scientific literature is clear: EVs are not a silver bullet for the climate BUT they are an important climate solution. There is no perfect solution- as this article from Hannah Ritchie lays out nicely https://lnkd.in/dCumaFz9 - and EVs have an environmental footprint.\n\nEVs are the topic of a big wave of disinformation about their climate impact and interest for the transition. A perfect example is that op-en from Rowan Atkinson (yes, Mr Bean...) https://lnkd.in/duVQ_5Zv\nCarbon Brief just published a great piece debunking the 21 most popular myths about electric vehicles.  Is it better to keep your old car? How long does it take for an EV to reimburse its carbon debt?
