  "text": "what I want this I mean there'sobviously a lot that we can andhopefully we'll have a chance to talkabout but one of the things that struckme when I was you know I've encounteredyou know your content your work severaltimes before I think it's great love theway you articulate yourself and Bitcoinand how it relates to the work you'redoing with with human rights but one ofthe things that struck me is I had alook at your LinkedIn page recently andyou got involved with the Human Rightsfoundation in 2007 which correct me ifI'm wrong you were probably just in yourearly 20s then right yes so at thatyoung of an age you know most of us arecoming out of university or gap yearafter high school or something like thatand you know we're not really sure whatreally sets us on fire what we want togo out and do in the world but you gotin you got stuck in in this line of workthen and obviously I've been there eversince what was it at that young age thatmotivated you to be involved in thiswork it's a great question it came downto an event actually that we produced atthe Human Rights foundation called theOslo Freedom Forum and I was veryinvolved with the initial vision andproduction execution and planning for itand it was really exciting for mebecause it allowed me to be kind of onthe ground level of something that Iknew one day would be a really big dealeven as we were just writing the firstconcept paper because the world didn'thave a Davos or Ted type arena thatwould be on the calendar decision-makersyou know squarely devoted to humanrights and civil liberties it justdidn't exist we thought it was such anobvious and important thing to do and tobe involved in that and get to play ayou know relatively creative role inhelping shape what that would laterbecome was a special opportunity that Iyou know was totally into and you knowlit me on fire basically for many yearswith with energy and enthusiasm and wewere able to grow that conference as oneof the HRF programs into somethingreally significant and it's still justan amazing thing that I love being apart of so that was like the first thingthat really kept me you knowlet's say up at night the second thingwas a series of investigations intoWestern celebrities and institutionsthat were helping dictators so over theyears I was involved with severalsignificant investigations research andadvocacy initiatives which looked intoand exposed and brought to publicattention both like think tanks as wellas PR companies and celebritiesthemselves flying out to dictatorshipsto perform for tyrants or getting hiredby tyrants to work for them and clean uptheir image so this was another thingthat I was very absorbed with did a lotof writing on you know over the yearsand and was very very into and and had abig impact and the third thing was ourwork with North Korea we started to meetthese North Korean refugees and realizedthat they need a lot of help and we wereable to assist expand their efforts withregard to getting information into NorthKorea so those are three main thingsthat I was involved with at HRF in thefirst decade there that you know reallyinspired me and kept my attention reallyhigh and then in 2016friend of ours really was the first oneto suggest that we take this communitywe'd built in some of this disruptiveenergy and and connect to the Bitcoinspace so if you months later we did ourfirst like workshop on the topic andit's it's been down the rabbit hole eversince for me so so that was kind of howmy interest evolved over time mm-hmmwhat you know and that's that's greatbut I'm wondering you started off thatexplanation by saying the Oslo FreedomForum as an as an event was kind of thefirst your first foray into this whywere you even involved in that where youwas human rights an issue for you whenyou were growing up in high school ordid it start in college or like you knowI mean what what seeded this interestfor you I mean I was always interestedin political science and politics andhistory did a lot of reading asbut it was kind of by chance I had aninternational relations degree I waspursuing and I wanted an internship inthe field and I happened to get sort oflucky and get a position of the humanrights foundation in the summer of 2007and at that time the economy was shakyand it was hard to get jobs especiallyin that line of work so I was reallyhappy to get that job and then I gotthere and it was very like startup bevery entrepreneurial it had just beenstarted you know in the previous year ortwo before and we had a lot of fun andreally captured my attention so I joinedfull-time shortly thereafter and I'vebeen working there ever since right andkind of a fun question before we go onhere but regarding you were saying youknow you dug into how celebrities areused to clean up images of various youknow unmentionables around the world orwhatever yeah what did you uncover inthat research are there particularcelebrities that just sell themselveslike way more than nails unfortunatelythere's a very long line we used to do aseries for Forbes where we did what wedo like the Oscar goes to and we'd havea list of celebrities that were likedoing good things for human rights andthen a list of the bad oneswho are the top who are the mostprominent offenders yeah Mariah Carey isup there I mean she she's performed fornumerous dictators and doesn't reallyseem to have any compunction or hedoesn't really seem to have a problemwith it and we've challenged her severaltimes and it's resulted in probably herdoing this less than she normally wouldwe had a really big one with Kanye wherehe went to Kazakhstan Leo Messi went toGumbel dictatorship in West Africa NickiMinaj there were some things that wewere involved in Hilary Swank went toChechnya and Nicolas Cage went toKazakhstan and there's a Turk JLo wentto Turkmenistan and that was a reallybig one but many of these thingsresulted in big big media campaigns thattriggered action so for example JLo wentto Turkmenistan we had this hugecampaign toget her to stop doing it and HowardStern ended up doing like a whole bit onit which was obviously listening to bylike whatever ten million people or soand a lot of people learned aboutTurkmenistan so these these are bigeducational pieces after the campaignwith Leo Messi he ended up giving allthe money he got back to charityHillary Swank ended up pledging to givethe money away to like Chechen humanrights groups over time Nicki Minajactually ended up agreeing with us andthis summer instead of going to performas she was invited to in Saudi Arabiafor the Crown Prince there she canceledand wrote a letter saying she'ssupporting LGBT and women's rights thereinstead she's a huge victory so so theprogram is exciting because it has thatkind of impact but also unlike theinstitutional side we were involved inexposing and investigating a foundationthat ended up shutting down because itwas whitewashing dictators and there'sbeen a long line of like a track recordof success of making a difference inthat area there's been organizationsthat were overtly about things likepeace but like internally they wereworking for the North Korean governmentthings like that there's been a longline of investigations that I think havemade a difference well this is the partof the issue today and of course theinternet makes this you know allows youto pierce the veil to some degree butyou know whether it's what you were justreferring to or you know the climatedebate or any number of issues you knowof course big money around the world isable to fund front organizations with areally nice sounding name and that doesall sorts of work that makes it seemlike you know there's a it makes it seemlike it's not what it is you know so itmust be hard to to continuously counterthat and I imagine correct me if I'mwrong but for a lot of the celebrities Imean I'm sure they get a lot of moneywaved at them and that's obviously theirthere you know what compels them - it'snothing else they know I know but whatI'm saying is like with with with someof them it has to be the case that theiragent or whomever comes to them and saysyou know million bucks to go to site togo to Turkmenistan and I would say thatmost celebrityhave no idea what's going on politicallyin Turkmenistan and they just say yeahsure sounds like a good gig and thenthey get all this outcry about how theirentertainment is exactly how it worksbut you know what that's not a goodexcuse because they should just googleit right hypocrisy is that look we onlywould go after people who had pledged tobe social justice warriors and humanrights warriors like they have somecharity they've set up in the UnitedStates to help harvest communities andyet they're happy to go perform for arepressor somewhere else so a lot ofthese things were like hey you're atspokesperson for Human Rights foramnesty or something why are you doingthis so we would usually go you knowwe're usually targeting people who claimto be doing good things if you're ifyour mo is that you're a bad person andyou're like a crook then yeah go aheaddo your thing but what we're going foris to expose people who claim to bedoing good things in the United Statesfor example or in the UK or in Spain butthen they think they can get away withgoing and doing this and that reallyexposes their you know inner characterin many ways right right fair enough Iwonder you know being involved in thistype of work obviously you'reencountering some of the worst people insituations on earth and you know my ownexperience and having spoken with a lotand interacted with a lot of bitcoinershere on the podcast or on Twitter or youknow many people generally who havefound the way to Bitcoin a lot of us hadpretty dystopic views of the world priorto stumbling upon Bitcoin because Ithink a lot of us are fairly well-readyou know we read about various differentindustries and governments and historyand all that kind of stuff you knowprior to falling down the Bitcoin rabbithole and it seemed like you know a veryscary impossible to turn around sort oftrend that that that's or you know levelof control let's say that's manifestingin different ways around the world andthen Bitcoin comes around and once youyou know once you can really get someclarity onto the implications of it youstart to see it as a extremely powerfultool for for lack of a better termfighting back or if we're overturningthe tideyou know what was your experienceyou know finding Bitcoin andencountering all this darkness in theworld and subsequent to fajn tounderstanding it more yeah well I fromthe beginning always knew thattechnology was kind of the key we werelooking at my summer internshipliterally was in 2007 was like puttingbackpacks together of movies Hollywoodmovies that were dubbed into Spanish andhaving them sent into the Cubanunderground library movement to fightthe censorship on the islandour entire flash drives for freedomprogram was collecting flash drives andpacking them with news and outsideinformation and sending them into NorthKorea so that people could accessoutside opinions and it would break thebrainwashing that they're subject tothere we were monitoring the dark sideas well of course with regard tocensorship the Great Firewall in Chinaat first and later now of course themassive big data analysis and AI systemsthat are you know used by the Chinesegovernment to monitor and persecute itspopulation and for years we've beenworking with like groups like theElectronic Frontier Foundation anddifferent companies to help activistsand journalists stay safe online throughencrypted messaging apps like signal andVPNs and best practices so I meanBitcoin is just you know it's just thenext step it's just such a logical kindof successor to that kind of workunderstanding that information is powernumber one an understanding number twothat defensive technology likeencryption is really important fordefending our freedoms and human rightsand then all of a sudden you're movinginto Bitcoin and understanding how pivotof Bill and how key yeah you knowencrypted decentralized money ispermissionless you decree you knowencrypted decentralized money it's justso critical for this as well and so whenyou first came across it or got moreinvolved in 2016 as you were saying wasin an immediate kind of light bulbmoment or did you sense sense orsomething there from the moment like Ihad first tweeted about Bitcoin in like2014 I'd read thishe's that mark Anderson did and I wasinterested but like you know I didn'tpenny did not drop for a long time Iactually lived on a boat with severalprominent bitcoiners for a week at athing called a femoral I think in 2014or 15 in San Francisco about 80 mileseast of the city in the Sacramento RiverDeltaBrock Pierce and a bunch of other peoplewere there number Brock had brought thislike ATM machine and he was trying toconvince us that Bitcoin was like thisthing that we should be involved withand some of them some of the peoplethere were like already really into itbut other people were like veryskeptical and I just you know I didn'tget it at the time right much to mydismay later but I was certainly likeaware of it some of my friends threwparties where we'd go and like debate itI remember this one it must have beenfall 2015my friend had this house house event athis home in Oakland and we were like hebrought it was like debate he brought insomebody to make like the bull case andthe bear case like why you should own itbut even when Bill Tai who's the guy whoconvinced me to like maybe connect it tothe human rights community we had wefinally did this workshop it wasn'treally until like the summer of 2017that I I started to really could reallyget it and you know right after we didthis workshop in the spring of 17 hadgone up past $1,000 and there was like arenewed sense of interest but thatsummer it got really interesting for meand then that just began like a now youknow to an almost three year journeyintellectually into learning about itand my that and you've probably heard amillion people say this but certainlythe starting point is Andreya sontAnnapolis and his books and videosbecause those I think resonated for mebecause he tries to approach itoftentimes from him like a human rightskind of perspective and that was reallyresonant for me and I really kind ofgrasped that and that was really helpfulhe really helped set my framework and ithelped the penny drop over time butagain it's like you reach new levels ofundersevery few months or every three sixmonths with regard to key concepts inBitcoin like you know scarce digitalscarcity is something that took a longtime for me to appreciate and I hadother people that I learned that fromlike Jimmy song is somebody that helpedme understand that through watching hisvideos and there's all different kindsof people who help you understanddifferent parts of it so it drove me totry and become an educator in the spacewas the fact that even though we haveall these great people like Andreas andJimmy and others there's not enoughthere's not enough education and there'snot enough people talking about thehuman side of it and there's not enoughpeople talking about it in a way that'slike relatable for the average personand especially for like the averagedecision-maker I feel like my goal is tokind of engage with the like eliteestablishment people runninguniversities and banks and you knownewspapers and have them under have themstart to understand this I think thatwould be cool so I've been trying tolike engage with them especially humanrights organizations so I've been doingthat through singularity University fora while I've been doing these likefeature of money talks with them acrossthe world for the last few years where Igive these like big stage talks aboutthe future of democracy with the rightof technology and surveillance and theintrusions on privacy and then I shifttalking about decentralization andBitcoin and and what it means for us andat the end of the day it's like we'reeither gonna have we chat style money orwe're gonna have Bitcoin style money andyou got to kind of choose your sideright so I give these kind of talks andthose are always fun helped me developmy public speaking and writing abilitythrough doing that over time and then werecently been getting into the actualworkshop II stuff with some really greatpeople in the Bitcoin space Jimmy ofcourseEric wall Matt Odell some other peoplewe are looking at how to actually thinkabout Bitcoin is that in a serious wayin terms of look if we're gonna if we'regonna teach it like we would signal orhow to use VPN Saudis tour like howwould you do that most securely you knowit's not of course and we're close to ananonymous system there major risks youneed to keep in mind is to use Bitcoinbut like basically how can use it assafely as possible and when I first gotinto the space there just wasn't thearsenal for doing so really but therealso wasn't really the risk right so aschain analysis has gotten more popularand well I think we're only hit the sortof tip of the iceberg with regard to howmuch more pervasive it'll get so if thetools to fight backso like BTC pay server like didn't existtwo years ago right so you knowactivists and NGOs have a thing like thehuman rights foundation does where youjust go to our website and you can kindof more privately make a donationwithout us exposing and emptyanonymizing you rightlightning is taking off in a way that Ihope will start engaging with that tooon our site but obviously like I do itin a recreational way but lightningskind of getting there and that to me isreally important because it really hurtsthe ability of people using chainanalysis right because in a world wherelike most of our transactions are mostof our small daily transactions are alloff chain and the second layer that'slike onion routed um yeah that's reallyinteresting to me so I really thinkabout it like lightning as digital cashand Bitcoin is digital gold and thesetwo systems work together and I thinkthat's kind of where we're headed andand you know that was obviously verynation like didn't didn't exist as anoperating system as a protocol when Iwhen I was first thinking about this sonow we kind of had the tools we we havemore popular use of mixing coin joinsother things like that there's even somereally interesting stuff like paintingsand things like that so a lot of it'slike too clumsy and too clunky to usefor people who don't know what Bitcoinis so the job of the engineers over thenext five years is going to be theescape that stuff just like we did itwith email like peach writing PGP is apain for a lot of people so sixsomething like signal makes that a loteasier even though there's liketrade-offs okay it's attached to a phonenumber so we're gonna have to find theright trade-offs and people are goingto make the right building decisions butthe fact is there's just like thisarsenal of new like privacy technologyfor Bitcoin which is really reallyhelpful and makes me feel like we'regoing in the right directionyou know this whole tap root thingthat's coming out like it's just reallygonna help crooks I wasn't I meanthere's this basic idea that it reallyhelped make all kind of transactionslook really similar and it'll justencourage people to do more things likeopening lightning channels multi-sig etcso there's there's a lot coming just inthe near future that's quite excitingand then at the end of the day that'skind of proceeding from an engineeringperspective but meanwhile like mostpeople aren't even - step one like itwas it took me two years to get to thepoint where I could appreciate somethinglike that right or even more let's startwith like understanding the problemswith the money system and why thereneeds to be digital scarce money and whyit's really important for us to developmoney that's not controlled bygovernments and corporations as we shiftto a cashless society like that that'sthat would be an people could understandthat piece right there that's enoughthen they're gonna be warm and open butthat piece takes a lot of explanationsure everybody's packed with this likeyou know I give these lectures to CEOsand they're like pre-programmed withthis like like anti Bitcoin thing wherethey're like it's too volatile forcriminals it's boiling the oceans allthese and they're like literally everytime I speak to a new batch completelyunrelated CEOs they they just it's likea machine on repeat just and they havethese like you know again like it's likethe prepackaged arguments that they gotknows where but that you realize thatthe media coverage of Bitcoin from2012-2013 onwards has been reallyeffective at turning people off reallyeffective and yeah been really reallyeffective at turning the average personaway from Bitcoin and away from thecryptocurrency err blocks change spacemore generally usually but then the moreinteresting or like more open-mindedpeople bend the get into like blockchainor cryptocurrency and it's like they'reeven worse off so it's like it's it'syou realize how powerfulMedia has been in terms of theirmisinterpretation or or perhaps likemalicious interpretation of what bitcoinis and it continues there was somereporter this woman who writes for theFinancial Times she wrote an articlesaying like linking trending coronavirusto Bitcoin the other day and yeah sheworks at the most prestigious financialmagazine in the english-speaking worldright that's how juvenile we are stillum and ironically you know she and theothers Martin wolf and all the others atthe FT they always like to skewerBitcoin but you know I bitcoins comingfor the system that they're defendingyou know what I mean so exactly so it'scoming for them whether they like it ornot you know Martin wolf I remember hewrote this column saying you know um youknow let's it's something like you knowmoney needs a rule system you know weneed rules with money and all this stufflike governments need to control it andyou know just the general centralbankers speak and it's like yeah he'sgonna be very scared of what's comingsure but in general like what I'm sayingI guess is that it's it takes a longtime as many steps to unlocking yourunderstanding of Bitcoin and moreeducational materials we can put out thebetter because it will take people along time to figure out why this is keyand important and to link it to like whyit matters and in the engineering is isnot it's a slow process like these theseupgrades in the network and these userdesign improvements are notinstantaneous they do take years so Ithink that development is just gonna beslower than I thought maybe two yearsago but but I think in a positive waylike I don't think it's a bad thing yeahwell that's why we create like no reasonwhy I should advance to quickly or toradically I agree and and this is why Iappreciate you know people like you whocame in you know when you were saying ohthat I thought like someone firstentering Bitcoin it's almost likethey're running through like a war zonedodging bullets and landmines and stuffbecause you got to dodge the FUD and yougot to be not pulled in the direction ofoh you know greed and you've got aforget that stuff that's fine the worstislike I'm trying to stare at this likeYouTube video explainer of what ablockchain is done by like Harvard orlike and it's just a misinformation ofall times sure like you look at it laternow that I actually understand you lookback in time it's like now that I'vecompleted my undergraduate degree I lookback at it it's just a bunch of nonsenselike it's describing the functions ofBitcoin but it doesn't use the wordBitcoin and it's claiming that allblockchains do thisit's massive just disinformation rightpackaged up in a neat little kind oflike acceptable easy to swallow formatyou know well like you said about theyou know whether they're at theFinancial Times or JP Morgan or legacyfinancial system you know this I forgetthe precise verbatim of that quotesaying like you know it's hard forsomeone to understand something whentheir income depends on notunderstanding it you know so you haveall these people in the legacy systemthey don't want change it's workingreally well for them and so when theyyou know they hear all this blockchainbrouhaha and they're like oh well we gota we don't want to seem like we're youknow behind the times we've got tointegrate this in some capacity but veryquickly I assume at least someone inthose organizations realize that itcan't be Bitcoin because Bitcoindisrupts the vast majority of a lot ofthe stuff that they're do here's thething it can be if you look at companieslike Square I mean they get it rightlike there's an internal nonprofit wellit sure and that's the way to do itthat's where that's like developing atoolkit for lightning developers likethat's amazing so right right there aresome companies like fidelity Square andmany others that understand it and theywant to they want to introduce theircustomers to this concept and others arelooking for a way that's you know theblockchain way because it's a little bitmore neat and it can be controlledbetter and you know it takes a boxdoesn't it sounds it's all gonna fail weknow that as a Oracle problem andgarbage data and garbage data out that'sthat's not going to be helpful right andthen you're seeing now how how doesdisingenuous and damaging all the AI coshave beento the retail people who bought coins atthe one percent totally smug so it'sbeen great for all the angel investorsand people who got in early like thebest example of this is um this totalscam project called Al Gore and that wastotally whitewashed by a professor whoworks at MIT so these scientists they'recalled professor coins they come outwith a project and because they're atCornell or MIT or whatever they get thislike protective coating it's like Teflonwhere they they they're sort of likeuntouchable because they're like smartand scientists and they work for someyou know prestigious institution wellthis guy Silvio our Cal yet exist in heis teaching at MIT and he was able tosort of probably without asking you knowthe MIT name was used to whitewash AlGore and and to sell it to a bunch ofearly investors who got in like 5 cents10 cents whatever in the spring of 2008and then they did their like publicauction and you know the price won thisprice was like said like $2 2008 yeahthis was a late ICA I'm not even goingback to it I'm going you mean 2018 sorry2018 I'm sorry sorry 2018 yeah so springof 2018 and um so a full year after the2017 craze people are still doing it andyeah like the price went up to $2 Ithink in June and then you know theytried to have set this thing up whereit's like this is how complicated theseschemes are to try and just takeadvantage of people they were like ohwell you can only take out one sevenhundred and twentieth of the funds everyday for like two years and thereforelike it's impossible for people to dumpand it gives commitment well what washappening is like these people were likeentering into these like saft agreementswhich then they would sell so they yeahthey weren't selling their funds off thechain you know so all these people whogot in like 5 cents 10 cents they weregetting now at the top and those werebeing those shares or whatever we'rebeing gobbled up by retailBester's who got smoked as the assetwhen all the way down and then here weare in almost February 2020 and theprice of Al Gore ins is twenty fourcents right so look all the blood allthe people who got in early are stilleven if even if their whole thing nowthey're fine because they got into fiveto ten cents right so that they they'reat three or four X or whatever but mostpeople bought it like two bucks it'shorrible so that's like just a reallygood I love telling that story becauseit encapsulates the whole ICO craze it'sgot the you know reputable institutionwhitewashing the project it's got theyou know scheme to show people that itcan't be a pump and dump it's got peoplestill defending it to this day oh wehave this vibrant developer communitylike yeah right and and then but the allyou need to look at is the price chartfor these things yeah I mean it's justso obvious that it it Peaks immediatelythen it crashes and people used it tomake a lot of money that that's likewhat this was functionally for and itwouldn't be so bad if that's what theyadmitted if they were to admit that yesthis was a machine that we inventedliterally to enrich ourselves at theexpense of others and and provide novalue to society as long as they werewilling to say that and put that ontheir shirt and wear around and be happyabout that then I'm good I'm like okaycool good good for you at least you'reacknowledging that but they walk aroundas if they're like contributingsomething positive to the world and it'sreally freaking frustrating so trying tosteer new entrants not only away fromstuff like that which has a hugemarketing budget and you know you startto enter this space and you're pushedtowards stuff like that as opposed tobig one but it doesn't have a marketingbudget doesn't have a company pushing itright and then you're like then you gotan app so you're you're first you'relike as you were describing you're inthis likerat race like this maze and like thefirst stops to color the ICOand all like the professor coins andthen okay fine you get around that andthen you've got the Bitcoin like forksyou've got the Bitcoin cashiers and VSVpeople and you gotta like figure out whythose things are scams also and thenyou're like okay well what about theblockchain stuff and then you got tofigure that out and then it's like youall the way down to realize that thatreally this whole thing is about theseparation of money from state and aboutthe fundamental changing nature in theworld of the relationship between thegovernment and the individual when itcomes to money in the economy that'swhat this is aboutthis is not about decentralization ortechnology really rice is about the waymoney is the way it exists now the wayexisted previously and what it will bein a hundred years that's what this isall about and that's like that's thething that takes so long to figure outyeah and but just I want to ask you someto follow ups but just on that you knowonce you get through that you know thatwarzone once you first come in Bitcoinlike totally a war zone right but if youmake it to the end you're like and youknow maybe very few do that start at thetop most people take they take the endsit off should we get off the whateverthey get off the altcoin ramp atwhatever point and they see you and Iare our example of if you make itthrough you become a hardened Hardwareyou get it you know it you see it withyou know a great high degree of clarityand you just you stay around and you canmake you know this is what theboom-and-bust of Bitcoin seems to havebeen like it people come in they getburnt some people stay because they getit and the cycle repeats but I want toask you two questions if you mentionedit a few minutes ago about you know inyour line of work you'll rub shoulderswith you know policy makers politiciansyou know banker is this kind of stuffyeah one as you just said this is aboutseparating money from state yeah andwhen you you know when you're minglingwith these people or giving talks orwhatever and you say that to the type ofpeople that the current circumstancelargely has benefited them it's workingfor them and they're probably not thatinterested in separating money fromstate first of all when you tell themthat that it's bigcoin not blockchain and this is whatbitcoin is about what is the reactionand number two amongst your colleaguesand people that work with you how manyof them get that that this you know ofcourse there's human rights issues allaround the world and policies are partof it but how many of them gets at thethe foundational component of the moneyis what's that's what's the linchpinhere the way I would the way I try toprefer to go after it is that I guidethe conversation in a positive way letthem ask the questions and then we goalong so if I were teaching a class anddesigning a syllabus for a cop like acollege course a year-long collegecourse we would just spend the firstmonth just discussing or maybe twomonths just discussing the creation ofBitcoin why I was created how does itwork etc and like when students wouldask questions about other stuff we wouldjust say we're gonna get to that laterin the course okay so when I do mypublic speaking I just I'd only onlytalk about Bitcoin I mean I do I do talkabout like see like the central bankdigital currencies I talk about Libra Italk about like obviously centralizedcompetitors but I don't really in the myname talks I'm not gonna get into theother cryptocurrencies or the otherblockchain tech I find I'd rather have amessage of positivity than like justgetting up there and like criticizingother people's projects all happy to doit on a podcast with you but I'm notgonna do not gonna devote my time tothat um I'm not like a consumerprotection advocate you know what I meanlike that's how I fold I'm job otherpeople should be doing that right but Iwould I would design the course in a waywe're like hopefully you you really getBitcoin first and then we go in and wedescribe what's what's happening in thespace and you can use what you'velearned to understand why these otherprojects are different look some of themmay be really valuable like some of theI mean this seems unlikely at the momentbut let's just put it this way some ofthe privacy tech being developed by thevery committed people working indcashman era of etc some of that stuffmay end up getting pulled into likesecond layer technology on Bitcoin forexample later on and they're like verycommitted to private money and I'm rightthere with them I just I kind ofdisagree on what the substrate will bebut like I respect their work in a waythat that I don't really respect youknow most people working on all coinsright but but like you start then youcan start to understand okay you caneven look at like the projects like ipfsor aetherium and then with that Bitcoinknowledge you can then look at like okaylike what did these people set out to dowhy are they having troubleaccomplishing it etc and it gives you alittle bit of a better foundation forunderstanding that and then you can gointo the digitization of fiat money youcan go into the digitization ofcorporate money and you can really startto understand like why these things maygo they may explode but in popularitybecause people are always willing totrade their privacy for convenience andto understand how dangerous that stuffis absolutely this only would like theunderstanding a Bitcoin that you reallystart to get all the other stuff in theproper and the proper framework right Iagree so you know basically maybe thequestion is so again so what I'm talkinglike a banker or somebody i usually justdon't like yeah big coin X and they'realways like what do you mean Bitcoindon't you mean like all they'relike tell me more and then okay I'llstop and I'll usually break it down tothree reasons for them I I talk aboutthe reason why bitcoins special itsdecentralized we don't know who createdit it has you know a fixed monetarysupplyso it's digitally scarce which andwhat's the response to this explanationwhen you give in yeah so I talked aboutthe decentralization I talked about thefact that it's digitally scarce and itsvalue goes up over time and I talkedabout the third important thing which isliquidity and network effect so you knowI'll go and I'll explain each of thosethings and how it sets bitcoin apart andhow other projects can't just likecreate that and you know usually thathelps a little bit but I mean after onelecture people leave with a lot morequestions than they have answers my jobis just to light the fire of curiosityif I can get them fired up about onething or another I've done my job theymay leave being a massive Bitcoinskeptic but great they're gonna go andlike read about it rightchances are they're gonna stumble acrosssomething that just leads them furtherdown the rabbit hole so when I talkedlike establishment folks that's my goalis to like get them to to realize thatthere's something here to like dig intoyou know right so these peopleexplain Bitcoin to somebody and ofcourse of course I the I was just tryingto see if people in these circles ofpower and influence or whatever they'rereceptive to what bitcoin represents youknow if not understanding fully when youfirst speak to them or they they firstwatch a speech yeah very rarely becausekyc in AML have been sold to the massesit's like a really positive thing that'sour society's safe so when I tell themthat there's gonna be a money systemthat's permissionless in parallel andnot police scible as much they're notinto that it's not something they'reexcited about no but I never that's nothow I would pitch it I would say heyimagine you're a refugee coming out ofSyria man as well and you can bring yourwealth with you without having to getfrisked at the border or imagine thatyou are a woman in a society likeAfghanistan you can actually hold yourvalue without your male family memberstaking it from you or imagine you areliving in China and all of yourfinancial activity is surveilled wellwhat if you could like have a store ofvalue that you only you had sovereigntyover so when I lead with those examplesthey're eating it up and they get itit's only later that we get into thedisagreements right there so again Idon't I try not to dwell on the negativein my talks I try to I try to be reallyclear about the negative is China'sdeset project that's what we need to beafraid of is these like digitalcentralized state crypto currencies thatwill replace cash and make surveillancea lot more pervasive that's like whatwe're up against and thankfully we havea tool to fight backI think Bitcoin didn't exist but wewould be toast you know completely toastand what's the distinction as far as youknow obviously this is a trend you knowgovernments authoritarian and democraticaround the world are exploring cryptocurrencies for their national currenciesnow what's the difference between adigital dollar and a a crypto dollarlike what's you know not it's not I'mnot talking about physical cash I'mtalking about like a wee chat RMB orvenmo dollar what's the difference Imean if you just think about a basicinterpretation of describing money inthis society like with m0 m1 etceach every time you go up the ladder themoney supply gets bigger so like emone's bigger than m0 and twos betterthan in one and it's all done on likecredit and borrowing and and that'sobviously been an engine for growth forour society for a long long time and Idon't expect that to change however whatwill change is m0 so today and zero isstill in large part in huge part in somecountries in small part in others butalways in part physical notes and andthose do provide people like someprivacywith actually a really high degree ofprivacy again even in like advancedsocieties like there's still a lot ofcache usage it's it's way down from whatit was it's could be five percent insome places 10 / 10 30 percent but it'sit's it's usually lower than 50 percentand it advanced democracy in closer toten percent in a lot of places in morerural areas it's 75 percent you know 80percent but generally speaking it's alldisappearing so once you realise thatthe transition that's happening is thatthat m0 is is is going to over the nextdecade through adoption encouragementand eventually bands like eventuallythere's gonna be like a thing incountries where there's a D monetizationprocess where governments say hey youyou have the next 18 months to hand inany paper notes that you want to getdigital credits for and people will handthem in right away they'll probably be asliding scale saying you get a hundredpercent of your value if you hand it innow and write a percent if you wait ayear so the government's gonna likeaggressively get paper and metal moneyout of the hands of people and thenafter that Windows over it'll be illegalto hold that stuff and it won't beredeemable by banks so like this isgonna happen in the next 10 years so wehave to get out ahead of it and likemake sure our systems are in placebefore that stuff goes down totallyagree but but so my what you know what Iwas wondering and it perhaps the answeris just that it transitions everybody solet's take China for example mobilepayments are enormous there's still cashin in the society but most people underthe age of 40 or whatever transactalmost exclusively in WeChat and Ali payis the transition to a crypto RMBjust to make to put did eliminate casheffectively because right because myoriginal question was what's thedifference between a database that'sdigital R and B versus a crypto R and Bbut I guess the difference is that onceit moves to a crypto R and B physicalcache is not even possible and it justit's more all-encompassing it's actuallythere's a lot of angles to it there's alot of reasons why a government wouldwant to digitize its base money but I'llgive you an example by doing so youwould then have the potential to have adirect relationship between the centralbank and the citizen so it just giveslike tighter control today like even inChina and a police state like a lot ofcitizens use me chat for their paymentsright right so if I'm the Chinesegovernment I want to spy on you andyou're using WeChat I have to go to$0.10 the parent company and ask foryour information right there's like alayer in between which functionallyspeaking I can break down but like isannoying like I would rather just likehave real-time surveillance of yourtransactions so if the base money is isindeed like chronic trouble in that wayand there are ways to tie that basemoney to the credit above it that'sbeing distributed by commercial banksetc it gives the government a muchbetter idea of what's going on so that'skind of what I would say it just givesyou a foundation to build a much moretrackable system whereas today likecommercial banks and technologycompanies even in a police state likeChina you know are sectioning off partsof the economy and the government can'treally see what's going on withoutasking so they want they don't want tohave to ask the other thing it does isit like allows them to push the buttonon like big financial initiatives so forexample if there's like a downtrend andlike the auto industry imagine justbeing it just like push a button anddeposit some credits into every autoworker to like get them to chill out youknow so they can't do that today so theywould have like this huge database foreverybody's accounts and they just havedirect in an activity with that I thinkthat's like their goal no I don't knowthere may be like economic and technicalreasons why they can't pull that off I'msure there are considerable obstaclesbut that's like their stated goal is toestablish something like that now againsame thing with social credit likewe know what their stated goal is butunclear if it'll actually get there sowe'll see but it is a major differencedigitizing the base money is is is areally big deal I mean it really reallyreally removes privacy and freedom andand it gives them just a much betterunderstanding of what's going on ineconomy and a much much better way ofcontrolling everything especially fromlike the edge cases where peopleactually do need a little bit of freedomprivacy yeah Alex listening to you speakthroughout the course of thisconversation you know knowing the workyou've done you know being critical ofyou know the nastiest people around theworld yeah how does this affect well I'msure it affects your travel to somedegree you're probably on some blacklistin certain countries wait do you do youfeel any sense of anxiety paranoiaanything like that or being so vocallyagainst people that you've seen commityou know some I'm not I mean I have tobe a little careful about where I go I'mnot planning to go to China anytime soonfor example um although probably for adifferent reason than most people at themoment but yeah I just have to be alittle careful obviously the careerchoices I've made will dictate kind oflike work where I can go and that sortof thing but no I think it's like thereare other people who are way morevisible than me who are gonna bear thebrunt of whether it's the Saudis or theRussians or the Chinese like there'speople like Bill Browder and GarryKasparov and Riot thatbetter-better like you know they'rethey're the front line or I'm see peoplelike Jamal Khashoggi or activists inSaudi or Bezos who are pushing againstSaudi Arabia they're kind of on thefront line and then you know at Chinathere's all kinds of dissidents andjournalists and whistleblowers so I'mI'm like happy to operate like behindthe front lines a little bit butcertainly certainly aware of what'sgoing on yeah one final question Alexand then I have the rapid-fire part doyou have another great ten minutes fiveminutes yeah like five minutes is fineokayyou'll have to be concise with your withyour answer cell or even or just passover but the last question before therapid-fire I want to ask you it's justthat you know today in the politicallandscape the rhetoric is very you knowthere's been a lot of rhetoric thatexpands the definition let's say ofhuman rights for certain people sohousing is a human right and you knowhey it not not a victims I hate speechis a human right how do you feel youknow having had you know or havingworked in this capacity or you a veryreal sense of a human rights or whenpeople you end up dying in certaincountries are being killed a murder howdo you feel about this expansion of theterm well I think you need to look backto the creation of the UniversalDeclaration Declaration of Human Rightsafter World War two and you need to lookat the compromise made between theDemocratic United States of America andthe totalitarian Soviet Union and uswanted like civil liberties to beingrained into this document and theSoviet Union wanted entitlements to beingrained in that document now what whatcountry did you think did a better jobof entitlements over time well obviouslythe United States not the Soviet Unionand meanwhile the Soviet Union had zerocivil liberties right so whatdictatorships always seek to do isdismiss civil liberties and say we don'tneed them anyway we're providing youknow housing and education andeverything to our people for free thereality is they're not they're lyingthey're starving their people therethere's cholera outbreaks there's allkinds of stuff but because they've beenable to get rid of the civil libertiesin the journalism and the Free Pressnobody knows so it's like kind of likethis great lie that they set up um nowI'm like very actually a progressiveperson I believe the government you knowa good government that is constrained ina reasonable way should be focusing onhow to help the most vulnerable howeverI think that the bedrock for that iscivil liberties and civil rights notentitlements first so like in and youcan just see this born out like in thecountries that have the most free pressand you know the most commitment tothings like freedom of associationproperty rights etc you have the mostrobust social welfare systems you lookacross Europe you look across democraticAsian in Latin American countries it'sthe countries that havedegrees of free press and human rightsthat also have like better actual likeverifiable entitlements for people andthat's that's something that's reallyimportant like whether you care aboutpeace or global health or you knowhelping the bottom 10% or you knowquality or whatever you care about likeit's against the countries that are likemore like liberal democracies that thatare handling those things much betterand you can just look at the top 20liberal democracies in the world versusthe bottom 20 dictatorships and you canjust look at like entitlements in rightright to housing right to food all thatstuff and like guess where you'd want tolive like there's there's a reason whyninety-five percent of refugees arefleeing dictatorships and trying to goto democracies right they're not seekingyou know like constitutional democracythey want food on the table for theirfamily and a job opportunity so it goesin one direction so that's like actuallya really important things so I'm a civilrights and civil liberties person that'swhat I've devoted my career to I'm veryinterested in and supportive ofsocieties that either throughpublic-private partnership or through agovernment program that's properlycontrolled by the citizens providingwelfare I think it's quite important indifferent areas in different ways andthat's probably what I would disagreewith some of my Bitcoin brethren but andI believe that stuff can exist in aBitcoin society for sure so it's a capit off so yeah like I'm someone who'sfighting the fight for negative rightsor whatever you want to call them civilliberties and you know I'm suspiciousdeeply of anyone who's dismissive ofthose things and and just jump straightto entitlements which would be housingas a human right or something like thatwell usually you know and usually peoplesay that and then they're using that todismiss other civil liberties so youwant to be really careful about likewell that's kind of what I meant likethe political rhetoric work thepolitical rhetoric in the u.s. today youknow many people on the perhaps furtherleft of the spectrum say things like youknow housing is a human right but manyof their you know their policy goalsseem to encroach on a right of freespeech you know becauseof you know feelings everybody's likethat on the right you had all thesepeople who want this massive nationalsecurity state with all this war andthey're like basically Wars a humanrightso everybody's taking money from theaverage person and spending it onmalicious things regardless of where youare in the political spectrum so I wasjust wondering about how that made youfeel because you operate in a fairly youknow a scope of trying to protect humanrights in a very weird where the abusesof such are literally life and deathwest of being is exha human right or notit's a tiresome debate there was a goodpiece on is access to the Internet athim in right then by Vint Cerf and he'slike well would do did in 1890 did weconsider like access to a horse a humanright like horse and carriage so thesethings are gonna change over time youwant like I think the US Constitution isa fabulous document I think theInternational Covenant on Civil andPolitical Rights is a really gooddocument you should use these as ourguiding stars as we create societies andjust be suspicious of anyone who saysthat you know government must do actsright just make sure it's legit I meanthere are a lot of very legit thingsthat government needs to do but let'sjust make sure we can like audit themproperly as citizens and that we havecontrol over them and not the other wayaroundgot it all right Alex this is the lastpart I'll skip over the rapid-firequestions and I usually just end with aquick word association it'll take 10-15seconds you ready to go so I'll say aword you just tell me the first thingthat comes to your head sure democracyfreedom the Lightning Network scalingBitcoin government the worst form ofsocial contract we have except for allthe others human rights the foundationfor our society violence the darkestunderbelly of humanity ego somethingthat needs to be constrained greedsomething that needs to be admitted andthen built around wealth something thatis built by people for futuregenerations privacyprobably the most important value toconsider in the next hundred years forhumans hate speech something that's inthe eye of the beholder gold a valuablemetal that will decrease in value in thenext hundred years guns a very trickytopic revolution something that you wantto be peaceful if you want to beeffectivesocialism usually a very bad ideafamily a very important thing for anyhuman in equality something thatdictatorships are particularly goodinflicting upon their population hellI'm not a particularly religious personLiberty a guiding value for our societyenergy something that powers us and thatwe need to study very carefully and makesure that the energy that we use is asleast harmful to our environment aspossible moving forward and finallyBitcoin it is freedom money awesome Alexfor seven
