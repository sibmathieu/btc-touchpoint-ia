finally if you'rebacking up any important bitcoin walletmake sure you get it in solid steel withthe bill foddle over at privacy pros dotio if you're just putting your backup onpaper you open yourself up to thingslike fire damage water damage or justaccidentally discarding the damn thingif you're not paying attention i'veheard horror stories give yourself somepeace of mind there and with that let'sdive into bitcoin coreso if you're looking to run a bitcoinnode the first thing you're going towant to do if you're not looking tospend any money on hardware other thanthe computer you're currently using isyou're going to want to download bitcoincore off of bitcoin.orgyou can find it there really simple whenyou click on bitcoin core there's adownload buttonforwindows for mac and forlinux so very very easy to get it therenow i have previously covered umbral andmy node uh and i'm sure i'll cover otherplug-and-play node options in the futurethe difference between them and this isthat they have often software stacks andextra uh little features and andprograms that you can run on top ofbitcoin and and next to bitcoin thatinteract with your bitcoin node butthis basically gives you a copy of thebitcoin blockchain all the rules thatgovern the network and it gives you awallet that runs on top of it you canthen connect it toother things afterwards which we'll getinto momentarily now what are thebenefits of running your own bitcoinnode well number oneyou get some greatest greater privacy uhit is run on your own network and youconnect things to it as you see fit uhnumber two you're no longer trustingsomebody else to do this for you as ialluded to in the introwhich is always a benefit don't trustverifyand finally again you can run some coolstuff alongside this now it's a littlebit more of a challenge to do it withjust bitcoin core than some of thoseplug and play options like i mentionedbefore um roll my node start nine isanother one umnautil all of those uh they've got somenice bells and whistles here but forsome bare bones stuff that you caneasily connect to and be self-sovereignbitcoin core is an easy way to go soonce we download it there's a couplelittle things to get yourself set uplet's take a look at what you will see ipreviously uploaded and synced uh thebitcoin blockchainso let's take a look at what i initiallysaw when i downloaded bitcoin coreso this is just a collection ofscreenshots from when i was downloadingand installing this so i downloaded thepackage from bitcoin.org you can see ithere on my desktop and again i'm on amac so this could be different for youif you're on windows or linuxbut either way once i opened up this ijust dragged bitcoin core into myapplicationswhen i opened up the program afterinstalling it i was greeted with thiswelcome screen and effectively it willsavebitcoin core and all of its data to aspecific place by default but if you'dlike to save it to a different locationyou can click use a custom datadirectory if it's easier for you to dothat remember where it is feel free tothis is also where you get todecide how muchspace is used upon your computer namely do you want tocontinually store the entire size of thebitcoin blockchain which at the time ofdoing this video was around 350gigabytesyou have the optionto do a pruned node and what this meansis you download all 350 gigabytes butyou only ever hold as shown here aroundtwo gigabytes of the actual data themost recent two gigabytes of data of thebitcoin blockchain so what you're doingis you're actively downloading andverifying every transaction from thebeginning of time in bitcoinbut once you get to that two gigabytethreshold it will discard the alreadyvalidated initial transactions and onlyhold two gigabytes moving forwardfrom now on and i chose this option so ichose to do a pruned node in thisinstanceuh from here once you get through thatscreen it's going to start syncing nowthis can take some timeright here you can see that uh i was 12you know obviously bitcoin's beenrunning for almost 13 years you can seeyou're at this point i was 12 years and30 weeks behind i had to catch up on allof those transactions to have the mostcurrent state of who owns what andfor me i do have a quick internetconnection um so it didn't take too longbutonce i got through thati got to this screen which we'll come toin a minute and that's when you're allfully synced up and ready to create anew wallet just for reference if youguys are wondering how long this mighttakei've heard some people where it takes aweek sometimes more so you're just goingto want to leave it running and orwhenever you get the chance leave itrunning toto download those blocks and verifythose transactionsjust for reference this was my downloadand upload speedand i am running mac os i've got like 16gigs of memory umandyeah and the m1 chip in my macbook it'sa pretty recent one from 2020. so justfor reference i've got some relativelynew and beefy laptop and i was able tosync the entirety of the bitcoinblockchain 13 years worth oftransactions in under 24 hours but ifyou're dealing with an older laptopand a slower processor and a slowerinternet connection you could be waitinguh up quite a bit longer so just keepthat in your mind but this was myexperienceso here we are with bitcoin core it isall fully synced up uh everything'sready and you can see here no wallet hasbeen loaded if you have a previouslyloaded wallet or if you have the walletfile you canopen thatbut we're going to be starting fromscratch and i'm assuming you are as wellso we're just going to go ahead andwe're going to hit create new walletyou're going to get to give this a namei'm just going to call it testnow you can encrypt this with a passwordif you hit encrypt then it will ask youto add a password to this forsimplicity's sake for this video i'm notgoing to do thatnowyou've got some options here make ablank wallet descriptor wallet disableprivate keys i'm not going to do any ofthese extra things right now again i'mjust going for simplicity to get youguys started i'm going to go ahead andhit createokay and here we are this ispretty bare bones this is exactly whatyou see when you first start bitcoincore and create a new wallet so you havean overview you have your balancesavailable and pending and total thatmeans available is everything that hasbeen officially confirmed in a bitcoinblock pending means it is pending itsfirst confirmation or depending on yoursettingsa few confirmations and the total iseverything that is technically yoursuhover on the right here you have recenttransactionsup above you have your various tabs youcan go to your send screen very simplewho are you paying do you want to add alabel for this how much are you sendingand do you want to subtract the fee fromthe amount or you can use the fullavailable balance down below you canchoose transaction fees send clear alladd a recipient so you can send tomultiple people so on and so forthuh keep going up abovereceive screen and you can hit a make alabel to it you can specify an amount uhyou canchoose whether or not you want a nativesegwit bec32 address which if you'reunfamiliar with that effectively whenyou go to send back out it will becheaper fees but if somebody's runningan old bitcoin wallet they may havecompatible compatibility issues sendingto you probably not as much of an issuethese daysany other messages in there and you canhit create receiving address to receivesome funds we'll go through all thismomentarily but i'm just giving anoverview and finally transactions thisis just acategorical list of all of yourtransactions that you can sort throughso more or less that is that let's takea look at the preferences a little bitjust to uh adjust any any settings thatyou may want to do and please do pardonthe background noise i am currently ingreece and uh recording from the balconyso just heads up on that okay so uh i'mgonna hit the preferences herenow just due to the way i am recordingthis just so you know umit's well window capture again on the goi don't have dual screens so a littlebit harder to navigate but effectivelyif you uh open go into the menus and youfind the preferences option uh then itwill bring up this options menu hereokay and so you have a few options herewe talked aboutrunning a pruned node before this youcan actually specify the amount of datayou want to keep on your computer so youcan up or down that amountagain just this is all kind of uh howmuch data are you actually going tostore hereif you click on the wallet tab you canenable coin control features which hasto do with privacyagain i'm not going to dive too deepinto the weeds here on this but if youselect that you will see all of thelittle bits of bitcoin that you'veaccepted every transaction change allthe separate amounts as if there areseparate individual bills or coins umand so if you're interested in that youcan enable that you also see the optionto spend unconfirmed change so if you'vesent out bitcoinand there's change from that transactionyou have the option to make thatunspendable until it officially confirmsorsince you already know you own it thenyou can just leave this clicked on i'mgoing to leave itthese are network options so you havethe options ofconnecting via tor so on and so forth soif you're interested in that that ishere and finally display user interfacelanguage uh units to show um bitcointhere's a lot of options millibits microbits and satsi'm partial to sats so i'm going to gowith that and thenthird-party transaction urls there's afew little things here but the onlything i really want to change is my myunit so i like sats i'm gonna hit ok tothatokay with that adjusted and we can nowsee that i'm on a sat standard here inbitcoin core i think we're ready tostart using this wall and see how itfunctions so let's go ahead and diveinto thatall right so first up let's receive somebitcoin into this wallet soright in bitcoin court we're going tohit the receive buttonwe'll give this a label uh by the waythis is gonna be coming from anotherbitcoin wallet i have sitting on mycomputer here blockstream green i'vecovered that on mobile before so ifyou'd like to learn about it be sure tocheck it out and links to that originalvideo will be in the description thereregardless i'm just going to label thisoneblock streamgreen just so i know where it's comingfrom how many sats do i want to receivelet's doi don't know 100000 setsand any message no that should be finein fact i don't even need to so you canspecify an amount that you want toreceivebut actually you know what let's not dothat just to see what that looks likei'm going to hit create a new receivingaddress so you don't have to specify anamount okay i should saynow hereit shows me a qr code i could scan thatif i had a physical wallet on my phonein front of me that i could scan withthe camerathere's a a clickable link which wouldopen up a wallet software or there'sjust simply an address here that i cancopy either by selecting or down belowthere's a button that says copy addresswhich i'm gonna do you can save theimage and send that to somebody you cancopy the uri and send that to somebodywhatever you like okaynow over in block stream green i'm justgonna quickly uh hit the send buttoni'm gonna paste that address uh i willdo the same amount of satsthat's about 50 bucks by the way at thismoment and i'm going to up the feeto make it a little bit quicker althoughfees are really low right now i'm goingto hit reviewi'm going to hit sendand i will utilizethe two-factor authentication to getthis one sent off[Music]okay that transaction has now been senti can hit ok and we'll just get out ofblock stream green i'll hit ok and youcan see there's a notification here onmy desktop that i've just received atransactionso i'm going to go over to overview andi can see in pending i have a hundredthousand sas on the way in andthere's the unconfirmed transactionright there i can click on on recenttransactions it'll take me over to thetransaction tab and give me all of thedetails about itsowe will just wait on that to confirm andwe'll practice sending back outa few moments laterso with that transaction now confirmedwe can easily send out of bitcoin coreand we will practice just that right nowso we're going to go to the send tab andjust from block stream green i will graba receiving address so i'm going to hitreceive and there's a little copy buttonright there nice and simpleand so i'm going to paste that addressin thereumwill i enter a label sure we'll put inumoutto greenand how much do i want to send out let'sdo uh 50000. so about halfand you do have the option to subtractyour fee from the amount or i could usethe entire available balance with thisbutton here i'm not going to do any ofthoseand now transaction fee i can hit chooseand at this point umyou set the uh transaction fee in termsof sats per kilobyte i'm not a hugefan of this way of denominating it i'mused to sats per byte but um you know ican leave it at that either way you dohave a confirmation time target so youcansay how long you want it toballpark take for it to confirm and thatwill either lower orbump up your fee so i'm going to put itto the lowestumor sorry the lowest here let's yeahlet's put it to aboutwell it seems all about the sameactually if i go on the the longer endof it so about a thousand sats total uhper kilobyte is fine again sas per biteis ishow most wallets denominate it but thisis just how bitcoin core does it now youhave the option to also enable replaceby fee which means if your transactionis not getting through as quickly as youwould like and you end up being in arush later you can change the fee at alater date so i'm going to leave thischecked on andi want to show you something but i'm notgoing to do it right now i can click addrecipient and there will be a secondrecipient listed here which enables meto batch transactions which can actuallyhelp you save on fees if you do soi'm not going to do that nowbut you would just enter in a secondpayee an amount so on and so forth so ican x out of that and that gets rid ofthat second recipient thereeverything here looks good to me so i'mgoing to go ahead and hit sendand it gives youone more confirmation hey are you sureyou want to send 50 000 sats out withthis note to this address transactionfee and total amount so i'm sending out100 uh sorry 50 000 sats with a 142 satfeesure that looks good to me i'm going tohit sendoff it goes and i should see that pop upin block stream green momentarily uh ican even refresh that here and we'll seeit come inwe can see here now in blockstream greenwe have a confirmation on that 50 000sats coming in and uh just so you knowif you're sitting in bitcoin core uh itwill list as umin the process of confirming uh untilyou close down and then reopen so if itseems out of sync that could be theissueso i'd like to touch on backing up yourbitcoin core wallet as well asrecovering one with a wallet fileit's a little bit different from yourtypical downloaded mobile wallet itactually is a dot dat file whichdoesn't really matter what the thesuffix is it's just a file that youwould save elsewhere now if you'veattached a an encrypted password uh orencrypted your file with a password thenthat would still apply when you reloadit uh but for now let's take a look athow to back this up within bitcoin coreyou go to file and drop down to backupwallet and then you're going to savethis wherever you like so i'm going todrop this into my desktop and i'm goingtoname it testbackup okaysave and it saves as you can see astestbackup.datnowlet's say i have a fresh install ofbitcoin core i'm going to hit i'm goingto go to file and close walletand so this would be the screen i'mlooking at when i first load up bitcoincore nowthe best way that i found to do thisreally is to stick this file into thebitcoin directory wherever you have itsaved so in my instance i went with thedefault place this was at the verybeginning when we were talking abouteither saving it to the default locationor changing that location so that it'seasier for you to access umi'm in the default location which is alittle buried on on a mac but we'll goahead and we'll do it anyways souh it's in the library under applicationsupportand there's bitcoin and it's just underwallets hereand so all i'm gonna do is i'm actuallygoing to drag this file into the walletsfolderand i'll close this folder here and nowif i go to file open wallet i can seetest backupif i open that up it's the exact samewallet we were just dealing with so thatisyour go-to for backing up this justbeware if you don't encrypt it with apassword then youcould have somebody gain access to thatfile and access to your funds so keepthat in mind if you're actually usingthe bitcoin core wallet as a walletitself and not just a nodewhich leads me to our next portion ofthis video connecting to third-partysoftwareso i will be the first to admit that idon't use bitcoin core as a regularwallet uh but i am happy that people caneasily download this sync the bitcoinblockchain and utilize it as a referenceso that they're not putting off the taskof syncing a bitcoin core node onsomebody else to do so i find this veryconvenient for those that maybe don'twant to buy extra hardware anddo one of those plug-and-play models youcan download this and then you canutilize third-party software for all ofthe features that you know and love fromregular other optionswasabi is one such wallet when youinitially boot it up you have the optionto reference bitcoin core which willeffectively askor will check for a copy of bitcoin corerunning on your machine if it's there itwill reference it by default which isnice or you can designate where thatcopy issame with spectre i've done a full videoon this as well as wasabi and same thingit will check if you're running bitcoincore or ask if you're running it and itwill look for the default location andjust automatically reference thatand the same is true of sparrow walletalso on desktop and i've also done avideo on this one uh you can referenceyour bitcoin core instance sitting onyour laptop now what does this provideyou it provides you not only all of thefeatures that all of these wallets havethat bitcoin core may not boastthings like sas per bite when choosingfees or creating multi-sig wallets orutilizing hardware alongside it um justall of the different things you may wantout of a regular bitcoin wallet whiletrusting your own node instead ofsomebody else's so i highly encourageyou if you're so inclined to downloadbitcoin core and try connecting them tosome of these alternatives of course allof the links for those tutorials forthose separate wallets outside ofbitcoin core will be in the show notesthank you guys so much for watching asalways please do hit like subscribe andshare all of those things really helpget this content in front of moreeyeballs if you want to help out theshow in another way you can of coursehit up the previously mentioned sponsorsdown below aladdin bit by bit refillkeystone bill foddle all of those are inthe links and if you really liked whatyou saw you can always drop me a bitcointip at my strike.me page that is strikedot me slash btc sessions once you getthere you type in any amount you likewhen you click on the tip button youwill be greeted with a lightning qr codeor if you click to the right a regularbitcoin qr code and you can send thisoff to your heart's content with that iam out have a wonderful day or eveningwherever you may
