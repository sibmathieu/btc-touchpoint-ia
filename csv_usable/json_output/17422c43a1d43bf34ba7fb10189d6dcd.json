May. All rights reserved.\n   See the detailed disclaimer. Use short sections under ‚Äúfair\n   use‚Äù provisions, with appropriate credit, but don‚Äôt put your\n   name on my words.\n1.2. Foreword\n\nThe Cypherpunks have existed since September, 1992. In that\n time, a vast amount has been written on cryptography, key\n escrow, Clipper, the Net, the Information Superhighway, cyber\n terrorists, and crypto anarchy. We have found ourselves (or\n placed ourselves) at the center of the storm.\nThis FAQ may help to fill in some gaps about what we‚Äôre\n about, what motivates us, and where we‚Äôre going. And maybe\n some useful knowledge on crypto, remailers, anonymity,\n digital cash, and other interesting things.\nThe Basic Issues\n    \nGreat Divide: privacy vs. compliance with laws\n        \nfree speech and privacy, even if means some criminals\n cannot be caught (a stand the U.S. Constitution was\n strongly in favor of, at one time)\n            \na man‚Äôs home is his castle‚Ä¶the essence of the Magna\n Carta systems‚Ä¶rights of the individual to be secure\n from random searches\n\n\nor invasive tactics to catch criminals, regulate\n behavior, and control the population\n            \nthe legitimate needs to enforce laws, to respond to\n situations\n\n\nthis parallels the issue of self-protection vs.\n protection by law and police\n            \nas seen in the gun debate\ncrypto = guns in the sense of being an individual‚Äôs\n preemptive protection\n\n\npast the point of no return\n\n\nStrong crypto as building material for a new age\nTransnationalism and Increased Degrees of Freedom\n        \ngovernments can‚Äôt hope to control movements and\n communications of citizens; borders are transparent\n\n\n\n\nNot all list members share all views\n    \nThis is not ‚Äúthe Official Cypherpunks FAQ.‚Äù No such thing\n can exist. This is the FAQ I wanted written. Views\n expressed are my own, with as much input from others, as\n much consensus, as I can manage. If you want a radically\n different FAQ, write it yourself.  If you don‚Äôt like this\n FAQ, don‚Äôt read it. And tell your friends not to read it.\n But don‚Äôt bog down my mailbox, or the 500 others on the\n list, with messages about how you would have worded Section\n 12.4.7.2 slightly differently, or how Section 6.9.12 does\n not fully reflect your views. For obvious reasons.\nAll FAQs are the products of a primary author, sometimes of\n a committee. For this FAQ, I am the sole author. At least\n of the version you are reading now. Future versions may\n have more input from others, though this makes me nervous\n (I favor new authors writing their own stuff, or using\n hypertext links, rather than taking my basic writing and\n attaching their name to it‚Äìit is true that I include the\n quotes of many folks here, but I do so by explicitly\n quoting them in the chunk they wrote‚Ä¶.it will be tough\n for later authors to clearly mark what Tim May wrote\n without excessively cluttering the text. The revisionist‚Äôs\n dilemma.\nThe list has a lot of radical libertarians, some anarcho-\n capitalists, and even a few socialists\nMostly computer-related folks, as might be expected. (There\n are some political scientists, classical scholars, etc.\n Even a few current or ex-lawyers.)\nDo I Speak for Others?\n        \nAs I said, no. But sometimes I make claims about what\n ‚Äúmost‚Äù list members believe, what ‚Äúmany‚Äù believe, or what\n ‚Äúsome‚Äù believe.\n‚ÄúMost‚Äù is my best judgment of what the majority believe,\n at least the vocal majority in Cypherpunks discussions\n (at the physical meetings, parties, etc.) and on the\n List. ‚ÄúMany‚Äù means fewer, and ‚Äúsome‚Äù fewer still. ‚ÄúA few‚Äù\n will mean a distinct minority. Note that this is from the\n last 18 months of activity (so don‚Äôt send in\n clarifications now to try to ‚Äúsway the vote‚Äù).\nIn particular, some members may be quite uncomfortable\n being described as anarchists, crypto anarchists, money\n launderers, etc.\n\n\n\n\nMy comments won‚Äôt please everyone\non nearly every point ever presented, some have disagreed\nfeuds, battles, flames, idee fixes\non issues ranging from gun control to Dolphin Encrypt to\n various pet theories held dearly\nSomeone once made a mundane joke about pseudonyms being\n like multiple personality disorder‚Äìand a flame came back\n saying: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not funny. I am MPD and my SO is MPD.\n Please stop immediately!‚Äù\ncan‚Äôt be helped‚Ä¶.can‚Äôt present all sides to all arguments\nFocus of this FAQ is U.S.-centric, for various reasons\n    \nmost on list are in U.S., and I am in U.S.\nNSA and crypto community is largely centered in the U.S.,\n with some strong European activities\nU.S. law is likely to influence overseas law\n\n\nWe are at a fork in the road,  a Great Divide\n    \nSurveillance vs. Freedom\nnothing in the middle‚Ä¶either strong crypto and privacy is\n strongly limited, or the things I describe here will be\n done by some people‚Ä¶.hence the ‚Äútipping factor‚Äù applies\n (point of no return, horses out of the barn)\n\n\nI make no claim to speaking ‚Äúfor the group.‚Äù If you‚Äôre\n offended, write your own FAQ. My focus on things loosely\n called ‚Äúcrypto anarchy‚Äù is just that: my focus. This focus\n naturally percolates over into something like this FAQ, just\n as someone primarily interested in the mechanics of PGP would \n devote more space to PGP issues than I have.\n    \nGary Jeffers, for example, devotes most of his ‚ÄúCEB‚Äù to\n issues surrounding PGP.\n\n\nWill leave out some of the highly detailed items‚Ä¶\n    \nClipper, LEAF, escrow, Denning, etc.\na myriad of encryption programs, bulk  ciphers, variants on\n PGP, etc. Some of these I‚Äôve listed‚Ä¶others I‚Äôve had to\n throw my hands over and just ignore. (Keeping track of\n zillions of versions for dozens of platforms‚Ä¶)\neasy to get lost in the details, buried in the bullshit\n\n\n\n1.3. Motivations\n 1.3.1. With so much material available, why another FAQ?\n 1.3.2. No convenient access to archives of the list‚Ä¶.and who could \n   read 50 MB of stuff anyway?\n 1.3.3. Why not Web? (Mosaic, Http, URL, etc.)\n\nWhy not a navigable Web document?\nThis is becoming trendy. Lots of URLs are included here, in\n fact. But making all documents into Web documents has\n downsides.\nReasons why not:\n    \nNo easy access for me.\nMany others also lack access. Text still rules.\nNot at all clear that a collection of hundreds of\n fragments is useful\nI like the structured editors available on my Mac\n (specifically, MORE, an outline editor)\n-\n 1.3.4. What the Essential Points Are\n\n\nIt‚Äôs easy to lose track of what the core issues are, what\n the really important points are. In a FAQ like this, a vast\n amount of ‚Äúcruft‚Äù is presented, that is, a vast amount of\n miscellaneous, tangential, and epiphenomenal material.\n Names of PGP versions, variants on steganograhy, and other\n such stuff, all of which will change over the next few\n months and years.\nAnd yet that‚Äôs partly what a FAQ is for. The key is just\n not to lose track of the key ideas. I‚Äôve mentioned what I\n think are the important ideas many times. To wit:\n    \nthat many approaches to crypto exist\nthat governments essentially cannot stop most of these\n approaches, short of establishing a police state (and\n probably not even then)\ncore issues of identity, authentication, pseudonyms,\n reputations, etc.\n\n\n\n1.4. Who Should Read This\n 1.4.1. ‚ÄúShould I read this?‚Äù\n\nYes, reading this will point you toward other sources of\n information, will answer the most commonly asked questions,\n and will (hopefully) head off the reappearance of the same\n tired themes every few months.\nUse a search tool if you have one. Grep for the things that\n interest you, etc. The granularity of this FAQ does not\n lend itself to Web conversion, at least not with present\n tools.\nWhat Won‚Äôt Be Covered Here\n    \nbasic cryptography\n        \nmany good texts, FAQs, etc., written by full-time\n cryptologists and educators\n            \nin particular, some of the ideas are not simple, and\n take several pages of well-written text to get the\n point across\n\n\nnot the focus of this FAQ\n\n\nbasic political rants\n\n\n\n1.5. Comments on Style and Thoroughness\n 1.5.1. ‚ÄúWhy is this FAQ not in Mosaic form?‚Äù\n\nbecause the author (tcmay, as of 7/94) does not have Mosaic\n access, and even if did, would not necessarily‚Ä¶.\nlinear text is still fine for some things‚Ä¶can be read on\n all platforms, can be printed out, and can be searched with\n standard grep and similar tools\n 1.5.2. ‚ÄúWhy the mix of styles?‚Äù\nThere are three main types of styles here:\n    \nStandard prose sections, explaining some point or listing\n things. Mini-essays, like most posts to Cypherpunks.\nShort, outline-style comments\n        \nthat I didn‚Äôt have time or willpower to expand into\n prose format\nthat work best in outline format anyway\nlike this\n\n\nQuotes from others\n        \nCypherpunks are a bright group. A lot of clever things\n have been said in the 600 days x 40 posts/day = 24,000\n posts, and I am trying to use what I can.\nSadly, only a tiny fraction can be used\n            \nbecause I simply cannot read  even a fraction of\n these posts over again (though I‚Äôve only saved\n several thousand of the posts)\nand because including too many of these posts would\n simply make the FAQ too long (it‚Äôs still too long, I\n suppose)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI hope you can handle the changes in tone of voice, in\n styles, and even in formats. It‚Äôll just too much time to\n make it all read uniformly.\n 1.5.3. Despite the length of this thing, a vast amount of stuff is\n   missing. There have been hundreds of incisive analyses by\n   Cypherpunks, dozens of survey articles on Clipper, and\n   thousands of clever remarks. Alas, only a few of them here.\nAnd with 25 or more books on the Internet, hundreds of FAQs\n and URLs, it‚Äôs clear that we‚Äôre all drowning in a sea of\n information about the Net.\nIronically, good old-fashioned books have a lot more\n relevant and timeless information.\n 1.5.4. Caveats on the completeness or accuracy of this FAQ\nnot all points are fully fleshed out‚Ä¶the outline nature\n means that nearly all points could be further added-to,\n subdivided, taxonomized, and generally fleshed-out with\n more points, counterpoints, examples\n    \nlike a giant tree‚Ä¶branches, leaves, tangled hierarchies\n\n\nIt is inevitable that conflicting points will be made in a\n document of this size\n    \nviews change, but don‚Äôt get corrected in all places\ndifferent contexts lead to different viewpoints\nsimple failure by me to be fully consistent\nand many points raised here would, if put into an essay\n for the Cypherpunks list, generate comments, rebuttals,\n debate, and even acrimony‚Ä¶.I cannot expect to have all\n sides represented fully, especially as the issues are\n often murky, unresolved, in dispute, and generally\n controversial\n\n\ninconsistencies in the points here in this FAQ\n\n1.6. Corrections and Elaborations\n\n‚ÄúHow to handle corrections or clarifications?‚Äù\n    \nWhile I have done my best to ensure accuracy, errors will\n no doubt exist. And as anyone can see from reading the\n Cypherpunks list, nearly any statement made about any\n subject can produce a flurry of rebuttals, caveats,\n expansions, and whatnot. Some subjects, such as the nature\n of money, the role of Cypherpunks, and the role of\n reputations, produce dozens of differing opinions every\n time they come up!\nSo, it is not likely that my points here will be any\n different. Fortunately, the sheer number of points here\n means that not every one of them will be disagreed with.\n But the math is pretty clear: if every reader finds even\n one thing to disagree with and then posts his rebuttal or\n elaboration‚Ä¶.disaster! (Especially if some people can‚Äôt\n trim quotes properly and end up including a big chunk of\n text.)\nRecommendations\n        \nSend corrections of fact to me\nIf you disagree with my opinion, and you think you can\n change my mind, or cause me to include your opinion as an\n elaboration or as a dissenting view, then send it. If\n your point requires long debate or is a deep\n disagreement, then I doubt I have the time or energy to\n debate. If you want your views heard, write your own FAQ!\nUltimately, send what you want. But I of course will\n evaluate comments and apply a reputation-based filter to\n the traffic. Those who send me concise, well-reasoned\n corrections or clarifications are likelier to be listened\n to than those who barrage me with minor clarifications\n and elaborations.\nIn short, this is not a group project. The ‚Äústone soup\n FAQ‚Äù is not what this is.\n\n\nMore information\n        \nPlease don‚Äôt send me e-mail asking for more information\n on a particular topic‚ÄìI just can‚Äôt handle custom\n research. This FAQ is long enough, and the Glossary at\n the end contains additional information, so that I cannot\n expand upon these topics (unless there is a general\n debate on the list). In other words, don‚Äôt assume this\n FAQ is an entry point into a larger data base I will\n generate. I hate to sound so blunt, but I‚Äôve seen the\n requests that come in every time I write a fairly long\n article.\n\n\nTips on feedback\n        \nComments about writing style, of the form ‚ÄúI would have\n written it this way,‚Äù are especially unwelcome.\n\n\n\n\nCredit issues\n    \ninevitable that omissions or collisions will occur\nideas have many fathers\nsome ideas have been ‚Äúin the air‚Äù for many years\nslogans are especially problematic\n        \n‚ÄúThey can have my‚Ä¶.‚Äù‚Ä¶I credit Barlow with this, but\n I‚Äôve heard others use it independently (I think; at least\n I used it before hearing Barlow used it)\n‚ÄúIf crypto is outlawed, only outlaws will have crypto‚Äù\n‚ÄúBig Brother Inside‚Äù\n\n\nif something really bothers you, send me a note\n\n\n\n1.7.

SUMMARY: MFAQ‚ÄìMost Frequently Asked Questions\n 2.2.1. Main Points\n\nThese are the main questions that keep coming up. Not\n necessarily the most basic question, just the ones that get\n asked a lot. What most FAQs are.\n 2.2.2. Connections to Other Sections\n 2.2.3. Where to Find Additional Information\nnewcomers to crypto should buy Bruce Schneier‚Äôs ‚ÄúApplied\n Cryptography‚Äù‚Ä¶it will save many hours worth of\n unnecessary questions and clueless remarks about\n cryptography.\nthe various FAQs publishe in the newsroups (like sci.crypt,\n alt.security.pgp) are very helpful. (also at rtfm.mit.edu)\n 2.2.4. Miscellaneous Comments\nI wasn‚Äôt sure what to include here in the MFAQ‚Äìperhaps\n people can make suggestions of other things to include.\nMy advice is that if something interests you, use your\n editing/searching tools to find the same topic in the main\n section. Usually (but not always) there‚Äôs more material in\n the main chapters than here in the MFAQ.\n\n2.3. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the ‚ÄòBig Picture‚Äô?‚Äù\n 2.3.1. Strong crypto is here. It is widely available.\n 2.3.2. It implies many changes in the way the world works. Private\n   channels between parties who have never met and who never\n   will meet are possible. Totally anonymous, unlinkable,\n   untraceable communications and exchanges are possible.\n 2.3.3. Transactions can only be voluntary, since the parties are\n   untraceable and unknown and can withdraw at any time. This\n   has profound implications for the conventional approach of\n   using the threat of force, directed against parties by\n   governments or by others. In particular, threats of force\n   will fail.\n 2.3.4. What emerges from this is unclear, but I think it will be a\n   form of anarcho-capitalist market system I call ‚Äúcrypto\n   anarchy.‚Äù (Voluntary communications only, with no third\n   parties butting in.)\n2.4. Organizational\n 2.4.1. ‚ÄúHow do I get on‚Äìand off‚Äìthe Cypherpunks list?‚Äù\n\nSend a message to ‚Äúcypherpunks-request@toad.com‚Äù\nAny auto-processed commands?\ndon‚Äôt send requests to the list as a whole‚Ä¶.this will\n mark you as ‚Äúclueless‚Äù\n 2.4.2. ‚ÄúWhy does the Cypherpunks list sometimes go down, or lose the\n   subscription list?‚Äù\nThe host machine, toad.com, owned by John Gilmore, has had\n the usual problems such machines have: overloading,\n shortages of disk space, software upgrades, etc. Hugh\n Daniel has done an admirable job of keeping it in good\n shape, but problems do occur.\nThink of it as warning that lists and communication systems\n remain somewhat fragile‚Ä¶.a lesson for what is needed to\n make digital money more robust and trustable.\nThere is no paid staff, no hardware budget for\n improvements. The work done is strictly voluntarily.\n 2.4.3. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôve just joined the Cypherpunks list, what should I do?‚Äù\nRead for a while. Things will become clearer, themes will\n emerge, and certain questions will be answered. This is\n good advice for any group or list, and is especially so for\n a list with 500 or more people on it. (We hit 700+ at one\n point, then a couple of list outages knocked the number\n down a bit.)\nRead the references mentioned here, if you can. The\n sci.crypt FAQ should be read. And purchase Bruce Schneier‚Äôs\n ‚ÄúApplied Cryptography‚Äù the first chance you get.\nJoin in on things that interest you, but don‚Äôt make a fool\n of yourself. Reputations matter, and you may come to regret\n having come across as a tedious fool in your first weeks on\n the list. (If you‚Äôre a tedious fool after the first few\n weeks, that may just be your nature, of course.)\nAvoid ranting and raving on unrelated topics, such as\n abortion (pro or con), guns (pro or con), etc. The  usual\n topics that usually generate a lot of heat and not much\n light. (Yes, most of us have strong views on these and\n other topics, and, yes, we sometimes let our views creep\n into discussions. There‚Äôs no denying that certain\n resonances exist. I‚Äôm just urging caution.)\n 2.4.4. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm swamped by the list volume; what can I do?‚Äù\nThis is a natural reaction. Nobody can follow it all; I\n spend entirely too many hours a day reading the list, and I\n certainly can‚Äôt follow it all. Pick areas of expertise and\n then follow them and ignore the rest. After all, not seeing\n things on the list can be no worse than not even being\n subscribed to the list!\nHit the ‚Äúdelete‚Äù key quickly\nfind someone who will digest it for you (Eric Hughes has\n repeatedly said anyone can retransmit the list this way;\n Hal Finney has offered an encrypted list)\nBetter mailers may help. Some people have used mail-to-news\n systems and then read the list as a local newsgroup, with\n threads.\n    \nI have Eudora, which supports off-line reading and\n sorting features, but I generally end up reading with an\n online mail program (elm).\n\n\nThe mailing list may someday be switched over to a\n newsgroup, a la ‚Äúalt.cypherpunks.‚Äù (This may affect some\n people whose sites do not carry alt groups.)\n 2.4.5. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very easy to get lost in the morass of detail here. Are\n   there any ways to track what‚Äôs really important?‚Äù\nFirst, a lot of the stuff posted in the Usenet newsgroups,\n and on the Cypherpunks list, is peripheral stuff,\n epiphenomenal cruft that will blow away in the first strong\n breeze. Grungy details about PGP shells, about RSA\n encryption speeds, about NSA supercomputers. There‚Äôs just\n no reason for people to worry about ‚Äúweak IDEA keys‚Äù when\n so many more pressing matters exist. (Let the experts\n worry.) Little of this makes any real difference, just as\n little of the stuff in daily newspapers is memorable or\n deserves to be memorable.\nSecond, ‚Äúread the sources.‚Äù Read ‚Äú1984,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Shockwave\n Rider,‚Äù ‚ÄúAtlas Shrugged,‚Äù ‚ÄúTrue Names.‚Äù Read the Chaum\n article on making Big Brother obsolete (October 1985,\n ‚ÄúCommunications of the ACM‚Äù).\nThird, don‚Äôt lose sight of the core values: privacy,\n technological solutions over legal solutions, avoiding\n taxation, bypassing laws, etc. (Not everyone will agree\n with all of these points.)\nFourth, don‚Äôt drown in the detail. Pick some areas of\n interest and follow them. You may not need to know the\n inner workings of DES or all the switches on PGP to make\n contributions in other areas. (In fact, you surely don‚Äôt.)\n 2.4.6. ‚ÄúWho are the Cypherpunks?‚Äù\nA mix of about 500-700\nCan find out who by sending message to majordomo@toad.com\n with the message body text ‚Äúwho cypherpunks‚Äù (no quotes, of\n course).\n    \nIs this a privacy flaw? Maybe.\n\n\nLots of students (they have the time, the Internet\n accounts). Lots of computer science/programming folks. Lots\n of libertarians.\nquote from Wired article, and from ‚ÄúWhole Earth Review‚Äù\n 2.4.7. ‚ÄúWho runs the Cypherpunks?‚Äù\nNobody. There‚Äôs no formal ‚Äúleadership.‚Äù No ruler = no head\n = an arch = anarchy. (Look up the etymology of anarchy.)\nHowever, the mailing list currently resides on a physical\n machine, and this machine creates some nexus of control,\n much like having a party at someon‚Äôe house. The list\n administrator is currently Eric Hughes (and has been since\n the beginning). He is helped by Hugh Daniel, who often does\n maintenance of the toad.com, and by John Gilmore, who owns\n the toad.com machine and account.\nIn an extreme situation of abuse or neverending ranting,\n these folks could kick someone off the list and block them\n from resubscribing via majordomo. (I presume they could‚Äì\n it‚Äôs never happened.)\nTo emphasize: nobody‚Äôs ever been kicked off the list, so\n far as I know. Not even Detweiler‚Ä¶he asked to be removed\n (when the list subscribes were done manually).\nAs to who sets policy, there is no policy! No charter, no\n agenda, no action items. Just what people want to work on\n themselves. Which is all that can be expected. (Some people\n get frustrated at this lack of consensus, and they\n sometimes start flaming and ranting about ‚ÄúCypherpunks\n never do anything,‚Äù but this lack of consensus is to be\n expected. Nobody‚Äôs being paid, nobody‚Äôs got hiring and\n firing authority, so any work that gets done has to be\n voluntary. Some volunteer groups are more organized than we\n are, but there are other factors that make this more\n possible for them than it is for us.

The logic goes as follows:\n    \n\nOur universe presumably has some finite number of\n particles (currently estimated to be 10^73 particles).\n This leads to the ‚Äúeven if every particle were a Cray Y-\n MP it would take‚Ä¶‚Äù sorts of thought experiments.\nBut I am considering energy here. Ignoring reversible\n computation for the moment, computations dissipate energy\n (some disagree with this point). There is some uppper\n limit on how many basic computations could ever be done\n with the amount of free energy in the universe. (A rough\n calculation could be done by calculating the energy\n output of stars, stuff falling into black holes, etc.,\n and then assuming about kT per logical operation. This\n should be accurate to within a few orders of magnitude.)\n I haven‚Äôt done this calculation, and won‚Äôt here, but the\n result would likely be something along the lines of X\n joules of energy that could be harnessed for computation,\n resulting in Y basic primitive computational steps.\nI can then find a modulus of 3000 digits or 5000 digits,\n or whatever, that takes more than this number of steps\n to factor. Therefore, unbreakable in our universe.\n\n\n\n\nCaveats:\n\n\nMaybe there are really shortcuts to factoring. Certainly\n improvements in factoring methods will continue. (But of\n course these improvements are not things that convert\n factoring into a less than exponential-in-length\n problem‚Ä¶that is, factoring appears to remain ‚Äúhard.‚Äù)\n\n\nMaybe reversible computations (a la Landauer, Bennett,\n et. al.) actually work. Maybe this means a ‚Äúfactoring\n machine‚Äù can be built which takes a fixed, or very slowly\n growing, amount of energy. In this case, ‚Äúforever‚Äù means\n Lefty is probably right.\n\n\nMaybe the quantum-mechanical idea of Peter Shor is\n possible. (I doubt it, for various reasons.)\n\n\n\n\n2.5.20. ‚ÄúHow safe is RSA?‚Äù ‚ÄúHow safe is PGP?‚Äù ‚ÄúI heard that PGP has\n   bugs?‚Äù\n\nThis cloud of questions is surely the most common sort that\n appears in sci.crypt. It sometimes gets no answers,\n sometimes gets a rude answer, and only occasionally does it\n lead to a fruiful discussion.\nThe simple anwer: These ciphers appear to be safe, to have\n no obvious flaws.\nMore details can be found in various question elsewhere in\n this FAQ and in the various FAQs and references others have\n published.\n2.5.21. ‚ÄúHow long does encryption have to be good for?‚Äù\nThis obviously depends on what you‚Äôre encrypting. Some\n things need only be safe for short periods of time, e.g., a\n few years or even less. Other things may come back to haunt\n you‚Äìor get you thrown in prison‚Äìmany years later. I can\n imagine secrets that have to be kept for many decades, even\n centuries (for example, one may fear one‚Äôs descendents will\n pay the price for a secret revealed).\nIt is useful to think now about the computer power likely\n to be available in the year 2050, when many of you reading\n this will still be around. (I‚Äôm not arguing that\n parallelism, etc., will cause RSA to fall, only that some\n key lengths (e.g., 512-bit) may fall by then. Better be\n safe and use 1024 bits or even more. Increased computer\n power makes longer keys feasible, too.).\n\n2.6. PGP\n 2.6.1. There‚Äôs a truly vast amount of information out there on PGP,\n   from current versions, to sites, to keyserver issues, and so\n   on. There are also several good FAQs on PGP, on MacPGP, and\n   probably on nearly every major version of PGP. I don‚Äôt expect\n   to compete here with these more specialized FAQs.\n\nI‚Äôm also not a PGP expert, using it only for sending and\n receiving mail, and rarely doing much more with it.\nThe various tools, for all major platforms, are a specialty\n unto themselves.\n 2.6.2. ‚ÄúWhere do I get PGP?‚Äù\n 2.6.3. ‚ÄúWhere can I find PGP?‚Äù\nWait around for several days and a post will come by which\n gives some pointers.\nHere are some sites current at this writing: (watch out for\n changes)\n 2.6.4. ‚ÄúIs PGP secure? I heard someone had‚Ä¶.‚Äù\nperiodic reports, urban legend, that PGP has been\n compromised, that Phil Z. has been ‚Äúpersuaded‚Äù to‚Ä¶.\nimplausible for several reasons\n    \nPhil Z no longer controls the source code by himself\nthe source code is available and can be inspected‚Ä¶would\n be very difficult to slip in major back doors that would\n not be apparent in the source code\nPhil has denied this, and the rumors appear to come from\n idle speculation\n\n\nBut can PGP be broken?\n    \nhas not been tested independently in a thorough,\n cryptanalytic way, yet (opinion of tcmay)\nNSA isn‚Äôt saying\nAreas for attack\n        \nIDEA\n            \nsome are saying doubling of the number of rounds\n should be donee\n\n\nthe random number generators‚Ä¶Colin Plumb‚Äôs admission\n 2.6.5. ‚ÄúShould I use PGP and other crypto on my company‚Äôs\n workstations?‚Äù\n\n\n\n\nmachines owned by corporations and universities, usually on\n networks, are generally not secure (that is, they may be\n compromised in various ways)\nironically, most of the folks who sign all their messages,\n who use a lot of encryption, are on just such machines\nPCs and Macs and other nonnetworked machines are more\n secure, but are harder to use PGP on (as of 1994)\nthese are generalizations‚Äìthere are insecure PCs and\n secure workstations\n 2.6.6. ‚ÄúI just got PGP‚Äìshould I use it for all my mail?‚Äù\nNo! Many people cannot easily use PGP, so if you wish to\n communicate with them, don‚Äôt encrypt everything. Use\n encryption where it matters.\nIf you just want more people to use encryption, help with\n the projects to better integrate crypto into existing\n mailers.\n 2.6.7. NSA is apparently worried about PGP, worried about the spread\n   of PGP to other countries, and worried about the growth of\n   ‚Äúinternal communities‚Äù that communicate via ‚Äúblack pipes‚Äù or\n   ‚Äúencrypted tunnels‚Äù that are impenetrable to them.\n\n2.7. Clipper\n 2.7.1. ‚ÄúHow can the government do this?‚Äù\n\nincredulity that bans, censorship, etc. are legal\nseveral ways these things happen\n    \nnot tested in the courts\nwartime regulations\nconflicting interpretations\n        \ne.g., ‚Äúgeneral welfare‚Äù clause used to justify\n restrictions on speech, freedom of association, etc.\nwhenever public money or facilities used (as with\n churches forced to hire Satanists)\n            \nand in this increasingly interconnnected world, it is\n sometimes very hard to avoid overlap with  public\n funding, facilities, etc.\n 2.7.2. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt Cypherpunks develop their won competing encryption\n chip?‚Äù\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany reasons not to:\n    \ncost\nfocus\nexpertise\nhard to sell such a competing standard\n\n\nbetter to let market as a whole make these choices\n 2.7.3. ‚ÄúWhy is crypto so frightening to governments?‚Äù\nIt takes away the state‚Äôs power to snoop, to wiretap, to\n eavesdrop, to control\n    \nPriestly confessionals were a major way the Church kept\n tabs on the locals‚Ä¶a worldwide, grassroots system of\n ecclesiastical narcs\n\n\nCrypto has high leverage\n    \nUnlike direct assaults with bombs, HERF and EMP attacks,\n sabotage, etc, crypto is self-spreading‚Ä¶a bootstrap\n technology\n        \npeople use it, give it to others, put it on networks\nothers use it for their own purposes\na cascade effect, growing geometrically\nand undermining confidence in governments, allowing the\n spread of multiple points of view (especially\n unapproved views)\n 2.7.4. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve just joined the list and am wondering why I don‚Äôt see\n more debate about Clipper?‚Äù\n\n\n\n\nUnderstand that people rarely write essays in response to\n questions like ‚ÄúWhy is Clipper bad?‚Äù For most of us,\n mandatory key escrow is axiomatically bad; no debate is\n needed.\nClipper was thoroughly trashed by nearly everyone within\n hours and days of its announcement, April 16, 1993.\n Hundreds of articles and editorials have condemned it.\n Cyperpunks currently has no active supporters of mandatory\n key escrow, from all indications, so there is nothing to\n debate.\n\n2.8. Other Ciphers and Crypto Products\n2.9. Remailers and Anonymity\n 2.9.1. ‚ÄúWhat are remailers?‚Äù\n 2.9.2. ‚ÄúHow do remailers work?‚Äù (a vast number of postings have\n   dealt with this)\n\nThe best way to understand them is to ‚Äújust do it,‚Äù that\n is, send a few remailed message to yourself, to see how the\n syntax works. Instructions are widely available‚Äìsome are\n cited here, and up to date instructions will appear in the\n usual Usenet groups.\nThe simple view: Text messages are placed in envelopes and\n sent to a site that has agreed to remail them based on the\n instructions it finds. Encryption is not necessary‚Äìthough\n it is of course recommended. These ‚Äúmessages in bottles‚Äù\n are passed from site to site and ultimately to the intended\n final recipient.\nThe message is pure text, with instructions contained in\n the text itself (this was a fortuitous choice of standard\n by Eric Hughes, in 1992, as it allowed chaining,\n independence from particular mail systems, etc.).\n\nA message will be something like this:\n::\n Request-Remailing-To: remailer@bar.baz\nBody of text, etc., etc. (Which could be more remailing\n instructions, digital postage, etc.)\n\nThese nested messages make no assumptions about the type of\n mailer being used, so long as it can handle straight ASCII\n text, which all mailers can of course. Each mail message\n then acts as a kind of ‚Äúagent,‚Äù carrying instructions on\n where it should be mailed next, and perhaps other things\n (like delays, padding, postage, etc.)\nIt‚Äôs very important to note that any given remailer cannot\n see the contents of the envelopes he is remailing, provided\n encryption is used. (The orginal sender picks a desired\n trajectory through the labyrinth of remailers, encrypts in\n the appropriate sequence (last is innermost, then next to\n last, etc.), and then the remailers sequentially decrypt\n the outer envelopes as they get them.  Envelopes within\n envelopes.)\n 2.9.3. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt remailers be used to harass people?‚Äù\nSure, so can free speech, anonymous physical mail (‚Äúpoison\n pen letters‚Äù), etc.\nWith e-mail, people can screen their mail, use filters,\n ignore words they don‚Äôt like, etc. Lots of options. ‚ÄúSticks\n and stones‚Äù and all that stuff we learned in Kindergarten\n (well, I‚Äôm never sure what the the Gen Xers learned‚Ä¶.).\nExtortion is made somewhat easier by anonymous mailers, but\n extortion threats can be made in other ways, such as via\n physical mail, or from payphones, etc.\nPhysical actions, threats, etc. are another matter. Not the\n domain of crypto, per se.\n\n2.10. Surveillance and Privacy\n2.10.1. ‚ÄúDoes the NSA monitor this list?‚Äù\n\nProbably. We‚Äôve been visible enough, and there are many\n avenues for monitoring or even subscribing to the List.\n Many aliases, many points of presence.\nsome concerns that Cypherpunks list has been infiltrated\n and is a ‚Äúround up list‚Äù\nThere have even been anonymous messages purporting to name\n likely CIA, DIA, and NSA spooks. (‚ÄúBe aware.‚Äù)\nRemember, the list of subscribers is not a secret‚Äìit can\n be gotten by sending a ‚Äúwho cypherpunks‚Äù message to\n majordomo@toad.com. Anyone in the world can do this.\n2.10.2. ‚ÄúIs this list illegal?‚Äù\nDepends on the country. In the U.S., there are very strong\n protections against ‚Äúprior restraint‚Äù for published\n material, so the list is fairly well -protected‚Ä¶.shutting\n it down would create a First Amendment case of major\n importance. Which is unlikely. Conspiracy and sedition laws\n are more complex to analyze; there are no indications that\n material here or on the list is illegal.\nAdvocacy of illegal acts (subversion of export laws,\n espionage, etc.) is generally legal. Even advocating the\n overthrow of the government.\nThe situation in other countries is different. Some\n countries ban unapproved encryption, so this list is\n suspect.\nPractically speaking, anyone reading this list is probably\n in a place which either makes no attempt to control\n encryption or is unable to monitor what crosses its\n borders.\n2.10.3. ‚ÄúCan keystrokes really be monitored remotely? How likely is\n   this?‚Äù\nYes. Van Eck, RF, monitors, easy (it is claimed) to build\n this\nHow likely? Depends on who you are. Ames, the KGB spy, was\n probably monitored near the end, but I doubt many of us\n are. The costs are simply too high‚Ä¶the vans outside, the\n personnel needed, etc.\nthe real hazards involve making it ‚Äúeasy‚Äù and ‚Äúalmost\n automatic‚Äù for such monitoring, such as with Clipper and\n EES. Then they essentially just flip a switch and the\n monitoring happens‚Ä¶no muss, no fuss.\n2.10.4. ‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt some crimes be stopped if the government could\n   monitor what it wanted to?‚Äù\nSure. This is an old story. Some criminals would be caught\n if their diaries could be examined. Television cameras in\n all homes would reduce crimes of ‚Ä¶. (Are you listening,\n Winston?).\nOrwell, fascism, surveillance states, what have you got to\n hide, etc.\n\n2.11. Legal\n2.11.1. ‚ÄúCan encryption be banned?‚Äù\n\nham operators, shortwave\nil gelepal, looi to waptime aolditolq\nhow is this any different from requiring speech in some\n language?\n    \nNavaho code talkers of WW2,,,,modern parallel\n2.11.2. ‚ÄúWill the government try to ban encryption?‚Äù\n\n\nThis is of course the major concern most of us have about\n Clipper and the Escrowed Encryption Standard in general.\n Even if we think the banning of crypto will ultimately be a\n failure (‚Äúworse than Prohibition,‚Äù someone has said), such\n a ban could make things very uncomfortable for many and\n would be a serious abridgement of basic liberties.\nWe don‚Äôt know, but we fear something along these lines. It\n will be difficult to enforce such a ban, as so many avenues\n for communication exist, and encrypted messages may be hard\n to detect.\nTheir goal, however, may be control and the chilling\n effect that using ‚Äúcivil forfeiture‚Äù may have on potential\n crypto users. Like the drug laws. (Whit Diffie was the\n first to emphasize this motivation.)\n2.11.3. ‚ÄúHow could encryption be banned?‚Äù\nmost likely way: restrictions on networks, a la airwaves or\n postal service\ncould cite various needs, but absent a mechanism as above,\n hard to do\nan outright  ban, enforced with civil forfeiture penalties\nwartime sorts of policies (crypto treated as sedition,\n treason‚Ä¶some high-profile prison sentences)\nscenario posted by Sandfort?\n2.11.4. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the situation about export of crypto?‚Äù\nThere‚Äôs been much debate about this, with the case of Phil\n Zimmermann possibly being an important test case, should\n charges be filed.\n    \nas of 1994-09, the Grand Jury in San Jose has not said\n anything (it‚Äôs been about 7-9 months since they started\n on this issue)\n\n\nDan Bernstein has argued that ITAR covers nearly all\n aspects of exporting crypto material, including codes,\n documentation, and even ‚Äúknowledge.‚Äù (Controversially, it\n may be in violation of ITAR for knowledgeable crypto people\n to even leave the country with the intention of developing\n crypto tools overseas.)\nThe various distributions of PGP that have occurred via\n anonymous ftp sources don‚Äôt imply that ITAR is not being\n enforced, or won‚Äôt be in the future.\n2.11.5. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the legal status of digital signatures?‚Äù\nNot yet tested in court. Ditto for most crypto protocols,\n including digital timestamping, electronic contracts,\n issues of lost keys, etc.\n2.11.6. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt I just claim I forgot my password?‚Äù\n2.11.7. ‚ÄúIs it dangerous to talk openly about these ideas?‚Äù\nDepends on your country. In some countries, perhaps no. In\n the U.S., there‚Äôs not much they can do (though folks should\n be aware that the Cypherpunks have received a lot of\n attention by the media and by policy makers, and so a vocal\n presence on this list very likely puts one on a list of\n crypto trouble makers).\nSome companies may also feel views expressed here are not\n consistent with their corporate policies. Your mileage may\n vary.\nSedition and treason laws are not likely to be applicable.\nsome Cypherpunks think so\nOthers of us take the First Amendment pretty seriously:\n that all talk is permissable\nNSA agents threatened to have Jim Bidzos killed\n2.11.8. ‚ÄúDoes possession of a key mean possession of identity?‚Äù\nIf I get your key, am I you?\nCertainly not outside the context of the cryptographic\n transaction. But within the context of a transaction, yes.\n Additional safeguards/speedbumps can be inserted (such as\n biometric credentials, additional passphrases, etc.), but\n these are essentially part of the ‚Äúkey,‚Äù so the basic\n answer remains ‚Äúyes.‚Äù (There are periodically concerns\n raised about this, citing the dangers of having all\n identity tied to a single credential, or number, or key.\n Well, there are ways to handle this, such as by adopting\n protocols that limit one‚Äôs exposure, that limits the amount\n of money that can be withdrawn, etc. Or people can adopt\n protocols that require additional security, time delays,\n countersigning, etc.)\nThis may be tested in court soon enough, but the answer for\n many contracts and crypto transactions will be that\n possession of key = possession of identity. Even a court\n test may mean little, for the types of transactions I\n expect to see.\n    \nThat is, in anonymous systems, ‚Äúwho ya gonna sue?‚Äù\n\n\nSo, guard your key.\n\n2.12. Digital Cash\n2.12.1. ‚ÄúWhat is digital money?‚Äù\n2.12.2. ‚ÄúWhat are the main uses of strong crypto for business and\n   economic transactions?‚Äù\n\nSecure communications.

That bypass local laws about what can be\n stored and what can‚Äôt (e.g., silly rules on how far back\n credit records can go).\n2.12.3. ‚ÄúWhat are smart cards and how are they used?‚Äù\nMost smart cards as they now exist are very far from being\n the anonymous digital cash of primary interest to us. In\n fact, most of them are just glorified credit cards.\n    \nwith no gain to consumers, since consumes typically don‚Äôt\n pay for losses by fraud\n(so to entice consumes, will they offer inducements?)\n\n\nCan be either small computers, typically credit-card-sized,\n or  just cards that control access via local computers.\nTamper-resistant modules, e.g., if tampered with, they\n destroy the important data or at the least give evidence of\n having been tampered with.\n    \nSecurity of manufacturing\n        \nsome variant of  ‚Äúcut-and-choose‚Äù inspection of\n premises\n\n\n\n\nUses of smart cards\n    \nconventional credit card uses\nbill payment\npostage\nbridge and road tolls\npayments for items received electronically (not\n necessarily anonymously)\n\n\n\n2.13. Crypto Anarchy\n2.13.1. ‚ÄúWhat is Crypto Anarchy?‚Äù\n\n\nSome of us believe various forms of strong cryptography\n will cause the power of the state to decline, perhaps even\n collapse fairly abruptly. We believe the expansion into\n cyberspace, with secure communications, digital money,\n anonymity and pseudonymity, and other crypto-mediated\n interactions, will profoundly change the nature of\n economies and social interactions.\nGovernments will have a hard time collecting taxes,\n regulating the behavior of individuals and corporations\n (small ones at least), and generally coercing folks when it\n can‚Äôt even tell what continent folks are on!\nRead Vinge‚Äôs ‚ÄúTrue Names‚Äù and Card‚Äôs ‚ÄúEnder‚Äôs Game‚Äù for\n some fictional inspirations. ‚ÄúGalt‚Äôs Gulch‚Äù in cyberspace,\n what the Net is rapidly becoming already.\nI call this set of ideas ‚Äúcrypto anarchy‚Äù (or ‚Äúcrypto-\n anarchy,‚Äù as you wish) and have written about this\n extensively. The magazines ‚ÄúWired‚Äù (issue 1.2), ‚ÄúWhole\n Earth Review‚Äù (Summer, 1993), and ‚ÄúThe Village Voice‚Äù (Aug.\n 6th, 1993) have all carried good articles on this.\n2.13.2. The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto\n\na complete copy of my 1988 pastiche of the Communisto\n Manifesto is included in the chapter on Crypto Anarchy.\nit needs rewriting, but for historical sake I‚Äôve left it\n unchanged.\nI‚Äôm proud that so much of it remains accurate.\n2.13.3. ‚ÄúWhat is BlackNet?‚Äù\nBlackNet ‚Äì an experiment in information markets, using\n anonymous message pools for exchange of instructions and\n items. Tim May‚Äôs experiment in guerilla ontology.\nBlackNet ‚Äì an experimental scheme devised by T. May to\n underscore the nature of anonymous information markets.\n ‚ÄúAny and all‚Äù secrets can be offered for sale via anonymous\n mailers and message pools. The experiment was leaked via\n remailer to the Cypherpunks list (not by May) and thence to\n several dozen Usenet groups by Detweiler. The authorities\n are said to be investigating it.\n2.13.4. ‚ÄúWhat effect will crypto have on governments?‚Äù\nA huge topic, one I‚Äôve been thinking about since late 1987\n when it dawned on me that public key crypto and anonymous\n digital cash systems, information markets, etc. meant the\n end of governments as we know them. (I called this\n development ‚Äúcrypto anarchy.‚Äù Not everyone is a fan of it.\n But it‚Äôs coming, and fast.)\n‚ÄúPutting the NSA out of business,‚Äù as the NYT article put\n it\nEspionage is changing. To pick one example, ‚Äúdigital dead\n drops.‚Äù Any message can be sent through an untraceable path\n with remailers‚Ä¶.and then posted in encrypted form in a\n newsgroup readable in most countries, including the Former\n Soviet Union. This means the old stand by of the microfilm\n in a Coke can left by a certain tree on a rural road‚Äìa\n method fraught with delays, dangers, and hassles‚Äìis now\n passe. The same message can be send from the comfort of\n one‚Äôs home securely and untraceably. Even with a a digital\n signature to prevent spoofing and disinformation. This spy\n can be a Lockheed worker on the Aurora program, a SIGINT\n officer at Woomera, or a disgruntled chip designer at\n Motorola.  (Yes, a countermeasure is to limit access to\n personal computers, to run only standard software that has\n no such crypto capability. Such embargoes may already apply\n to some in sensitive positions, and may someday be a\n condition of employment.)\nMoney-laundering\nTax collection. International consultants. Perpetual\n tourists. Virtual corporations.\nTerrorism, assassination, crime, Triads, Yakuza, Jamaicans,\n Russian Mafia‚Ä¶virtual networks‚Ä¶ Aryan Nation gone\n digital\n2.13.5. ‚ÄúHow quickly could something like crypto anarchy come?‚Äù\nParts of it are happening already, though the changes in\n the world are not something I take any credit for. Rather,\n there are ongoing changes in the role of nations, of power,\n and of the ability to coerce behaviors. When people can\n drop out of systems they don‚Äôt like, can move to different\n legal or tax jurisdictions, then things change.\nBut a phase change could occur quickly, just as the Berlin\n Wall was impregnable one day, and down the next.\n    \n‚ÄúPublic anger grows quietly and explodes suddenly. T.C.\n May‚Äôs ‚Äúphase change‚Äù may be closer than we think. Nobody\n in Russia in 1985 really thought the country would fall\n apart in 6 years.‚Äù [Mike Ingle, 1994-01-01]\n2.13.6. ‚ÄúCould strong crypto be used for sick and disgusting and\n dangerous purposes?‚Äù\n\n\nOf course. So can locked doors, but we don‚Äôt insist on an\n ‚Äúopen door policy‚Äù (outside of certain quaint sorority and\n rooming houses!) So do many forms of privacy allow\n plotters, molestors, racists, etc. to meet and plot.\nCrypto is in use by the Aryan Nation, by both pro- and anti-\n abortion groups, and probably by other kinds of terrorists.\n Expect more uses in the future, as things like PGP continue\n to spread.\nMany of us are explicity anti-democratic, and hope to use\n encryption to undermine the so-called democratic\n governments of the world\n2.13.7. ‚ÄúWhat is the Dining Cryptographers Problem, and why is it so\n   important?‚Äù\nThis is dealt with in the main section, but here‚Äôs David\n Chaum‚Äôs Abstract, from his 1988 paper‚Äù\n    \nAbstract: ‚ÄúKeeping confidential who sends which messages,\n in a world where any physical transmission can be traced\n to its origin, seems impossible.

It can be adapted to\n address efficiently a wide variety of practical\n considerations.‚Äù [‚ÄúThe Dining Cryptographers Problem:\n Unconditional Sender and Recipient Untraceability,‚Äù David\n Chaum, Journal of Cryptology, I, 1, 1988.]\n-\n\n\nDC-nets have yet to be implemented, so far as I know, but\n they represent a ‚Äúpurer‚Äù version of the physical remailers\n we are all so familiar with now. Someday they‚Äôll have have\n a major impact. (I‚Äôm a bigger fan of this work than many\n seem to be, as there is little discussion in sci.crypt and\n the like.)\n2.13.8. ‚ÄúWhy won‚Äôt government simply ban  such encryption methods?‚Äù\nThis has always been the Number One Issue!\n    \nraised by Stiegler, Drexler, Salin, and several others\n (and in fact raised by some as an objection to my even\n discussing these issues, namely, that action may then be\n taken to head off the world I describe)\n\n\nTypes of Bans on Encryption and Secrecy\n    \nBan on Private Use of Encryption\nBan on Store-and-Forward Nodes\nBan on Tokens and ZKIPS Authentication\nRequirement for public disclosure of all transactions\nRecent news (3-6-92, same day as Michaelangelo and\n Lawnmower Man) that government is proposing a surcharge\n on telcos and long distance services to pay for new\n equipment needed to tap phones!\n        \nS.266 and related bills\nthis was argued in terms of stopping drug dealers and\n other criminals\nbut how does the government intend to deal with the\n various forms fo end-user encryption or ‚Äúconfusion‚Äù\n (the confusion that will come from compression,\n packetizing, simple file encryption, etc.)\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Arguments Against Such Bans\n    \nThe ‚ÄúConstitutional Rights‚Äù Arguments\nThe ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Too Late‚Äù Arguments\n        \nPCs are already widely scattered, running dozens of\n compression and encryption programs‚Ä¶it is far too\n late to insist on ‚Äúin the clear‚Äù broadcasts, whatever\n those may be (is program code distinguishable from\n encrypted messages?

Often a person will become enamored of some approach,\n will write posts exhorting others to become similarly\n enamored, urging others to ‚Äúdo something!,‚Äù and will then,\n when no interest is evidenced, become irate. To be more\n concrete, this happens most often with various and sundry\n proposals for ‚Äúdigital money.‚Äù A close second is for\n various types of ‚ÄúCypherpunks activism,‚Äù with proposals\n that we get together and  collect a few million dollars to\n run Ross Perot-type advertisements urging people to use\n PGP, with calls for a ‚ÄúCypherpunks radio show,‚Äù and so on.\n (Nothing wrong with people doing these things, I suppose.\n The problem lies in the exhortation of others to do these\n things.)\nThis collective action is always hard to achieve, and\n rightly so, in my opinion. Emergent behavior is more\n natural, and more efficient. And hence better.\nthe nature of markets, agents, different agendas and goals\n    \nreal standards and markets evolve\nsometimes because of a compelling exemplar (the Walkman,\n PGP), sometimes because of hard work by standards\n committees (NTSC, electric sockets, etc.)\nbut almost never by simple appeals to correctness or\n ideological rightness\n2.14.2. ‚ÄúWhat are some of the practical limits on the deployment of\n crypto, especially things like digital cash and remailers?‚Äù\n\n\nLack of reliable services\n    \nNodes go down, students go home for the summer, downtime\n for various reasons\n\n\nLack of robustness\n2.14.3. ‚ÄúIs crypto dominated by mistrust? I get the impression that\n   everything is predicated on mutual mistrust.‚Äù\nWe lock our doors‚Ä¶does this mean we are lacking in trust?\n No, it means we understand there are some out there who\n will exploit unlocked doors. Ditto for the crypto world.\n‚ÄúTrust, but verify,‚Äù as Ronald Reagan used to say. Mutual\n mistrust can actually make for a more trustworthy\n environment, paradoxical as that may sound. ‚ÄúEven paranoids\n have enemies.‚Äù\nThe danger in a trusting environment that lacks other\n mechanisms is that ‚Äúpredators‚Äù or ‚Äúdefectors‚Äù (in game-\n theoretic terms) can exploit this trusting environment.\n Confidence games, scams, renegging on deals, and even\n outright theft.\nCrypto offers the opportunity for ‚Äúmutually suspicious\n agents‚Äù to interact without explicit ‚Äútrust.‚Äù\n2.14.4. ‚ÄúWho is Detweiler?‚Äù\nS. Boxx, an12070, ldxxyyy, Pablo Escobar, Hitler, Linda\n Lollipop, Clew Lance Simpleton, tmp@netcom.com, Jim\n Riverman\n    \noften with my sig block, or variants of it, attached\neven my phone number\nhe lost his ColoState account for such tactics‚Ä¶\n\n\nelectrocrisy\ncypherwonks\n2.14.5. ‚ÄúWho is Sternlight?‚Äù\nA retired policy analyst who is often contentious in Usenet\n groups and supportive of government policies on crypto\n policy.

Also, lots of other FAQs and Mosaic\n home pages (URLs) exist, encompassing a vast amount of\n knowledge.\nAs long as this FAQ is, it can only scratch the surface on\n many topics. (I‚Äôm especially amused when someone says\n they‚Äôve looked for a FAQ on some obscure topic. No FAQ is\n likely to answer all questions, especially obcure ones.)\nMany articles and papers are available at the\n ftp.csua.berkeley.edu\n site, in pub/cypherpunks. Look around there. The 1981 Chaum\n paper on untraceabel e-mail is not (too many equations for\n easy scanning), but the 1988 paper on Dining Cryptographers\n Nets is.

This is likely to be the case\n for many years to come, given the limitation of ASCII, the\n lack of widespread standards (yes, I know about LaTex,\n etc.), and the academic prestige associated with bound\n journals and books. Fortunately, you can all find\n universit libraries within driving range. Take my advice:\n if you do not spend at least an entire Saturday immersing\n yourself in the crypto literature in the math section of a\n large library, perusing the ‚ÄúProceeedings of the Crypto\n Conference‚Äù volumes, scanning the textbooks, then you have\n a poor foundation for doing any crypto work.\n2.15.2. ‚ÄúThings are changing quickly.

SUMMARY: Cypherpunks ‚Äì History, Organization, Agenda\n 3.2.1. Main Points\n\nCypherpunks formed in September, 1992\nformed at an opportune time, with PGP 2.0, Clipper, etc.\n hitting\nearly successes: Cypherpunks remailers, publicity\n 3.2.2. Connections to Other Sections\n 3.2.3. Where to Find Additional Information\n‚ÄúWired,‚Äù issue 1.2, had a cover story on Cypherpunks.\n‚ÄúWhole Earth Review,‚Äù Summer 1993, had a long article on\n crypto and Cypherpunks (included in the book ‚ÄúOut of\n Control,‚Äù by Kevin Kelly.\n‚ÄúVillage Voice,‚Äù August 6th (?). 1993, had cover story on\n ‚ÄúCrypto Rebels‚Äù (also reprinted in local weeklies)\nand numerous articles in various magazines\n 3.2.4. Miscellaneous Comments\nthe best way to get a feel for the List is to simply read\n it for a while; a few months should do.\n\n3.3. The Cypherpunks Group and List\n 3.3.1. What is it?\n\nFormal Rules, Charter, etc.?\n    \nno formal rules or charter\nno agreed-upon mission\n 3.3.2. ‚ÄúWho are the Cypherpunks?‚Äù\n\n\nA mix of about 500-700\nCan find out who by sending message to majordomo@toad.com\n with the message body text ‚Äúwho cypherpunks‚Äù (no quotes, of\n course).\n    \nIs this a privacy flaw? Maybe.\n\n\nLots of students (they have the time, the Internet\n accounts). Lots of computer science/programming folks. Lots\n of libertarians.\nquote from Wired article, and from ‚ÄúWhole Earth Review‚Äù\n 3.3.3. ‚ÄúHow did the Cypherpunks group get started?‚Äù\nHistory?\n    \nDiscussions between Eric Hughes and me, led to Eric‚Äôs\n decision to host a gathering\nFirst meeting was, by coincidence, the same week that PGP\n 2.0 was released‚Ä¶we all got copies that day\n        \nmorning session on basics\nsitting on the floor\nafternoon we played the ‚ÄúCrypto Game‚Äù\n            \nremailers, digital money, information for sale, etc.\n\n\n\n\nJohn Gilmore offered his site to host a mailing list, and\n his company‚Äôs offices to hold monthly meetings\nThe mailing list began almost immediately\n\n\nThe Name ‚ÄúCypherpunks‚Äù?\n 3.3.4. ‚ÄúShould I join the  Cypherpunks mailing list?‚Äù\nIf you are reading this, of course, you are most likely on\n the Cypherpunks list already and this point is moot‚Äìyou\n may instead be asking if you should_leave_  the List!\nOnly if you are prepared to handle 30-60 messages a day,\n with volumes fluctuating wildly\n 3.3.5. ‚ÄúHow can I join the Cypherpunk mailing list?‚Äù\nsend message to ‚Äúmajordomo@toad.com‚Äù with a body text of\n ‚Äúsubscribe cypherpunks‚Äù (no quote marks in either, of\n course).\n 3.3.6. ‚ÄúMembership?‚Äù\nabout 500-700 at any given time\nmany folks join, are overwhelmed, and quit\nother groups: Austin, Colorado, Boston, U.K.\n 3.3.7. ‚ÄúWhy are there so many libertarians on the Cypherpunks list?‚Äù\nThe same question is often asked about the Net in general.\n Lots of suggested reasons:\n    \nA list like Cypherpunks is going to have privacy and\n freedom advocates. Not all privacy advocates are\n libertarians (e.g., they may want laws restricting data\n collection), but many are. And libertarians naturally\n gravitate to causes like ours.\nNet grew anarchically, with little control. This appeals\n to free-wheeling types, used to making their own choices\n and building their own worlds.\nLibertarians are skeptical of central control structures,\n as are most computer programming types. They are\n skeptical that a centrally-run control system can\n coordinate the needs and desires of people. (They are of\n course more than just ‚Äúskeptical‚Äù about this.)\n\n\nIn any case, there‚Äôs not much of a coherent ‚Äúopposition\n camp‚Äù to the anarcho-capitalist, libertarian ideology.\n Forgive me for saying this, my non-libertarian friends on\n the list, but most non-libertarian ideologies I‚Äôve seen\n expressed on the list have been fragmentary, isolated, and\n not coherent‚Ä¶comments about ‚Äúhow do we take care of the\n poor?‚Äù and Christian fundamentalism, for example. If there\n is a coherent alternative to a basically libertarian\n viewpoint, we haven‚Äôt seen it on the list.\n(Of course, some might say that the libertarians outshout\n the alternatives‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt think this is really so.)\n 3.3.8. ‚ÄúHow did the mailing list get started?‚Äù\nHugh Daniel, Eric Hughes, and I discussed this the day\n after the first meeting\nmailing list brought together diverse interests\nHow to hoin?\n 3.3.9. ‚ÄúHow did Cypherpunks get so much early publicity?‚Äù\nstarted at the right time, just as PGP was gaining\n popularity, as plans for key escrow were being laid (I\n sounded an alarm in October, 1992, six months before the\n Clipper announcement), and just as ‚ÄúWired‚Äù was preparing\n its first issue\nKevin Kelly and Steven Levy attended some of our early\n meetings, setting the stage for very favorable major\n stories in ‚ÄúWired‚Äù (issue 1.2, the cover story), and ‚ÄúWhole\n Earth Review‚Äù (Summer, 1993)\na niche for a ‚Äúrenegade‚Äù and ‚Äúmonkey-wrenching‚Äù group, with\n less of a Washington focus\npublicity in ‚ÄúWired,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Whole Earth Review,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe\n Village Voice‚Äù\nClipper bombshell occupied much of our time, with some\n effect on policy\n    \nclimate of repudiation\nlinks to EFF, CPSR, etc.\n3.3.10. ‚ÄúWhy the name?‚Äù\n\n\nJude Milhon nicknames us\ncypherpunkts? (by analogy with Mikropunkts, microdots)\n3.3.11. ‚ÄúWhat were the early meetings like?‚Äù\ncypherspiel, Crypto Anarchy Game\n3.3.12. ‚ÄúWhere are places that I can meet other Cypherpunks?‚Äù\nphysical meetings\nstart your own‚Ä¶pizza place, classroom\n\nother organizations\n\n‚ÄúThese kind of meetings (DC 2600 meeting at Pentagon City\n Mall, 1st Fri. of\n        \nevery month in the food court, about 5-7pm or so) might\n be good places for\nlocal cypherpunks gatherings as well.  I‚Äôm sure there\n are a lot of other\nsuch meetings, but the DC and Baltimore ones are the\n ones I know of.  <Stanton McCandlish, 7 April 1994>\n(note that the DC area already meets‚Ä¶)\n\n\n\n\nHackers, raves\nregional meetings\n3.3.13. ‚ÄúIs the Cypherpunks list monitored? Has it been infiltrated?‚Äù\nUnknown. It wouldn‚Äôt be hard for anyone to be monitoring\n the list.\nAs to infiltration, no evidence for this. No suspicious\n folks showing up at the physical meetings, at least so far\n as I can see. (Not a very reliable indication.)\n3.3.14. ‚ÄúWhy isn‚Äôt there a recruiting program to increase the number\n   of Cypherpunks?‚Äù\nGood question. The mailing list reached about 500\n subscribers a year or so ago and has remained relatively\n constant since then; many subscribers learned of the list\n and its address in the various articles that appeared.\nInformal organizations often level out in membership\n because no staff exists to publicize, recruit, etc. And\n size is limited because a larger group loses focus. So,\n some stasis is achieved. For us, it may be at the 400-700\n level. It seems unlikely that list membership would ever\n get into the tens of thousands.\n3.3.15. ‚ÄúWhy have there been few real achievements in crypto\n   recently?‚Äù\nDespite the crush of crypto releases‚Äìthe WinPGPs,\n SecureDrives, and dozen other such programs‚Äìthe fact is\n that most of these are straightforward variants on what I\n think have been the two major product classes to be\n introduced in the last several years‚Äù\n    \nPGP, and variants.\nRemailers, and variants.\n\n\nThese two main classes account for about 98% of all product-\n or version-oriented debate on the Net, epitomized by the\n zillions of ‚ÄúWhere can I find PGP2.6ui for the Amiga?‚Äù\n sorts of posts.\nWhy is this so? Why have these dominated? What else is\n needed?\n    \nFirst, PGP gave an incredible impetus to the whole issue\n of public use of crypto. It brought crypto to the masses,\n or at least to the Net-aware masses. Second, the nearly\n simultaneous appearance of remailers (the Kleinpaste/Julf-\n style and the Cypherpunks ‚Äúmix‚Äù-style) fit in well with\n the sudden awareness about PGP and crypto issues. And\n other simultaneous factors appeared:\n        \nthe appearance of ‚ÄúWired‚Äù and its spectacular success,\n in early 1993\nthe Clipper chip firestorm, beginning in April 1993\nthe Cypherpunks group got rolling in late 1992,\n reaching public visibility in several articles in 1993.\n (By the end of ‚Äò93, we seemed to be a noun, as Bucky\n might‚Äôve said.)\n\n\nBut why so little progress in other important areas?\n        \ndigital money, despite at least a dozen reported\n projects, programs (only a few of which are really\n anything like Chaum‚Äôs ‚Äúdigital cash‚Äù)\ndata havens, information markets, etc.\nmoney-laundering schemes, etc.\n\n\n\n\nWhat could change this?\n    \nMosaic, WWW, Web\nA successful digital cash effort\n\n\n\n3.4. Beliefs, Goals, Agenda\n 3.4.1. ‚ÄúIs there a set of beliefs that most Cypherpunks support?‚Äù\n\nThere is nothing official (not much is), but there is an\n emergent, coherent set of beliefs which most list members\n seem to hold:\n    \nthat the government should not be able to snoop into our\n affairs\nthat protection of conversations and exchanges is a basic\n right\nthat these rights may need to be secured through\n technology rather than through law\nthat the power of technology often creates new political\n realities (hence the list mantra: ‚ÄúCypherpunks write\n code‚Äù)\n\n\nRange of Beliefs\n    \nMany are libertarian, most support rights of privacy,\n some are more radical in apppoach\n 3.4.2. ‚ÄúWhat are Cypherpunks interested in?‚Äù\n\n\nprivacy\ntechnology\nencryition\npolitics\ncrypto anarchy\ndigital money\nprotocols\n 3.4.3. Personal Privacy and Collapse of Governments\nThere seem to be two main reasons people are drawn to\n Cypherpunks, besides the general attractiveness of a ‚Äúcool‚Äù\n group such as ours. The first reason is personal privacy.\n That is, tools for ensuring privacy, protection from a\n surveillance society, and individual choice. This reason is\n widely popular, but is not always compelling (after all,\n why worry about personal privacy and then join a list that\n has been identified as a ‚Äúsubversive‚Äù group by the Feds?\n Something to think about.)\nThe second major is personal liberty through reducing the\n power of governments to coerce and tax. Sort of a digital\n Galt‚Äôs Gulch, as it were. Libertarians and\n anarchocapitalists are especially drawn to this vision, a\n vision which may bother conventional liberals (when they\n realize strong crypto means things counter to welfare,\n AFDC, antidiscrimination laws‚Ä¶.).\nThis second view is more controversial, but is, in my\n opinion, what really powers the list. While others may\n phrase it differently,  most of us realize we are on to\n something that will change‚Äìand already is changing‚Äìthe\n nature of the balance of power between individuals and\n larger entities.\n 3.4.4.  Why is Cypherpunks called an ‚Äúanarchy‚Äù?\nAnarchy means ‚Äúwithout a leader‚Äù (head). Much more common\n than people may think.\nThe association with bomb-throwing ‚Äúanarchists‚Äù is\n misleading.\n 3.4.5. Why is there no formal agenda, organization, etc.?\nno voting, no organization to administer such things\n‚Äúif it ain‚Äôt broke, don‚Äôt fix it‚Äù\nand it‚Äôs how it all got started and evolved\nalso, nobody to arrest and hassle, no nonsense about\n filling out forms and getting tax exemptions, no laws about\n campaign law violations (if we were a formal group and\n lobbied against Senator Foo, could be hit with the law\n limiting ‚Äúspecial interests,‚Äù conceivably)\n 3.4.6. How are projects proposed and completed?\nIf an anarchy, how do things get done?\nThe way most things get done: individual actions and market\n decisions.\n 3.4.7.

This often comes up in two contexts:\n\n\nCharges of hypocrisy because people either use\n pseudonyms or, paradoxically, that they don‚Äôt use\n pseudonyms, digital signatures\n3.4.17. ‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt crypto be regulated?‚Äù\n\n\nMany people make comparisons to the regulation of\n automobiles, of the radio spectrum, and even of guns. The\n comparison of crypto to guns is especially easy to make,\n and especially dangerous.\n  -\nA better comparison is ‚Äúuse of crypto = right to speak as\n you wish.‚Äù\n    \nThat is, we cannot demand that people speak in a language\n or form that is easily understandable by eavesdroppers,\n wiretappers, and spies.\nIf I choose to speak to my friends in Latvian, or in\n Elihiuish, or in\n        \ntriple DES, that‚Äôs my business. (Times of true war, as\n in World War\nII, may be slightly different. As a libertarian, I‚Äôm\n not advocating\nthat, but I understand the idea that in times of war\n speaking in code\nis suspect. We are not in a time of war, and haven‚Äôt\n been.)\n-\nShould we have ‚Äúspeech permits‚Äù? After all, isn‚Äôt the\n regulation of\n\nspeech consistent with the regulation of automobiles?\n\nI did a satirical essay along these lines a while back.\n I won‚Äôt\nincluded it here, though. (My speech permit for satire\n expired and I\n\nhaven‚Äôt had time to get it renewed.)\n\nIn closing, the whole comparison of cryptography to\n armaments is\nmisleading. Speaking or writing in forms not readily\n understandable to\nyour enemies, your neighbors, your spouse, the cops, or\n your local\neavesdropper is as old as humanity.\n3.4.18. Emphasize the ‚Äúvoluntary‚Äù nature of crypto\n\n\n\n\nthose that don‚Äôt want privacy, can choose not to use crypto\n    \njust as they can take the locks of their doors, install\n wiretaps on their phones, remove their curtains so as not\n to interfere with peeping toms and police surveillance\n teams, etc.\nas PRZ puts it, they can write all their letters on\n postcards, because they have ‚Äúnothing to hide‚Äù\n\n\nwhat we want to make sure doesn‚Äôt happen is others\n insisting that we cannot use crypto to maintain our own\n privacy\n‚ÄúBut what if criminals have access to crypto and can keep\n secrets?‚Äù\n    \nthis comes up over and over again\ndoes this mean locks should not exist, or‚Ä¶..?\n3.4.19. ‚ÄúAre most Cypherpunks anarchists?‚Äù\n\n\nMany are, but probably not most. The term ‚Äúanarchy‚Äù is\n often misunderstood.\nAs Perry Metzger puts it ‚ÄúNow, it happpens that I am an\n anarchist, but that isn‚Äôt what most people associated with\n the term ‚Äúcypherpunk‚Äù believe in, and it isn‚Äôt fair to\n paint them that way ‚Äì hell, many people on this mailing\n list are overtly hostile to anarchism.‚Äù [P.M., 1994-07-01]\ncomments of Sherry Mayo, others\nBut the libertarian streak is undeniably strong. And\n libertarians who think about the failure of politics and\n the implications of cryptgraphy generally come to the\n anarcho-capitalist or crypto-anarchist point of view.\nIn any case, the ‚Äúother side‚Äù has not been very vocal in\n espousing a consistent ideology that combines strong crypto\n and things like welfare, entitlements, and high tax rates.\n (I am not condemning them.

This has gotten to be more of a problem\n in recent months. (Not counting the spikes when Detweiler\n was around.)\nSeveral reasons:\n    \nthe arguments are often matters of opinion, not fact, and\n hence people just keep repeating their arguments\n        \nmade worse by the fact that many people are too lazy to\n do off-line reading, to learn about what they are\n expressing an opinion on\n\n\nsince nothing ever gets resolved, decided, vote upon,\n etc., the debates continue\nsince anyone is free to speak up at any time, some people\n will keep making the same points over and over again,\n hoping to win through repetition (I guess)\nsince people usually don‚Äôt personally know the other\n members of the list, this promotes ranting (I‚Äôve noticed\n that the people who know each other, such as the Bay Area\n folks, tend not to be as rude to each other‚Ä¶any\n sociologist or psychologist would know why this is so\n immediately).\n        \nthe worst ranters tend to be the people who are most\n isolated from the other members of the list community;\n this is generally a well-known phenomenon of the Net\n            \nand is yet more reason for regional Cypherpunks\n groups to occasionally meet, to at least make some\n social and conversational connections with folks in\n their region.\n\n\n\n\non the other hand, rudeness is often warranted; people\n who assault me and otherwise plan to deprive me of my\n property of deserving of death, not just insults [Don‚Äôt\n be worried, there are only a handful of people on this\n list I would be happy to see dead, and on none of them\n would I expend the $5000 it might take to buy a contract.\n Of course, rates could drop.]\n3.4.21.

Self-organizing Nature of Cypherpunks\n 3.5.1. Contrary to what people sometimes claim, there is no ruling\n   clique of Cypherpunks. Anybody is free to do nearly anything,\n   just not free to commit others to course of action, or\n   control the machine resources the list now runs on, or claim\n   to speak for the ‚ÄúCypherpunks‚Äù as a group (and this last\n   point is unenforceable except through reptutation and social\n   repercussions).\n 3.5.2. Another reason to be glad there is no formal Cypherpunks\n   structure, ruling body, etc., is that there is then no direct\n   target for lawsuits, ITAR vioalation charges, defamation or\n   copyright infringement claims, etc.\n3.6.

Where to Find Additional Information\nVernor Vinge‚Äôs ‚ÄúTrue Names‚Äù\nDavid Friedman‚Äôs ‚ÄúMachinery of Freedom‚Äù\n 4.2.4. Miscellaneous Comments\nMost of the list members are libertarians, or leaning in\n that direction, so the bias toward this is apparent.\n(If there‚Äôs a coherent non-libertarian ideology, that‚Äôs\n also consistent with supporting strong crypto, I‚Äôm not sure\n it‚Äôs been presented.)\n\n4.3. Why a Statement of Ideology?\n 4.3.1. This is perhaps a controversial area. So why include it? The\n   main reason is to provide some grounding for the later\n   comments on many issues.\n 4.3.2. People should not expect a uniform ideology on this list.\n   Some of us are anarcho-capitalist radicals (or ‚Äúcrypto\n   anarchists‚Äù), others of us are staid Republicans, and still\n   others are Wobblies and other assored leftists.\n4.4. ‚ÄúWelcome to Cypherpunks‚Äù\n 4.4.1. This is the message each new subscriber to the Cypherpunks\n   lists gets, by Eric Hughes:\n 4.4.2. ‚ÄúCypherpunks assume privacy is a good thing and wish there\n   were more of it.  Cypherpunks acknowledge that those who want\n   privacy must create it for themselves and not expect\n   governments, corporations, or other large, faceless\n   organizations to grant them privacy out of beneficence.\n   Cypherpunks know that people have been creating their own\n   privacy for centuries with whispers, envelopes, closed doors,\n   and couriers.  Cypherpunks do not seek to prevent other\n   people from speaking about their experiences or their\n   opinions.\n‚ÄúThe most important means to the defense of privacy is\n   encryption. To encrypt is to indicate the desire for privacy.\n   But to encrypt with weak cryptography is to indicate not too\n   much desire for privacy. Cypherpunks hope that all people\n   desiring privacy will learn how best to defend it.\n‚ÄúCypherpunks are therefore devoted to cryptography.\n   Cypherpunks wish to learn about it, to teach it, to implement\n   it, and to make more of it.  Cypherpunks know that\n   cryptographic protocols make social structures.  Cypherpunks\n   know how to attack a system and how to defend it.\n   Cypherpunks know just how hard it is to make good\n   cryptosystems.\n‚ÄúCypherpunks love to practice.  They love to play with public\n   key cryptography.  They love to play with anonymous and\n   pseudonymous mail forwarding and delivery.  They love to play\n   with DC-nets.  They love to play with secure communications\n   of all kinds.\n‚ÄúCypherpunks write code.  They know that someone has to write\n   code to defend privacy, and since it‚Äôs their privacy, they‚Äôre\n   going to write it.  Cypherpunks publish their code so that\n   their fellow cypherpunks may practice and play with it.\n   Cypherpunks realize that security is not built in a day and\n   are patient with incremental progress.\n‚ÄúCypherpunks don‚Äôt care if you don‚Äôt like the software they\n   write. Cypherpunks know that software can‚Äôt be destroyed.\n   Cypherpunks know that a widely dispersed system can‚Äôt be shut\n   down.\n‚ÄúCypherpunks will make the networks safe for privacy.‚Äù [Eric\n   Hughes, 1993-07-21 version]\n4.5. ‚ÄúCypherpunks Write Code‚Äù\n 4.5.1. ‚ÄúCypherpunks write code‚Äù is almost our mantra.\n 4.5.2. This has come to be a defining statement. Eric Hughes used it\n   to mean that Cypherpunks place more importance in actually\n   changing things, in actually getting working code out, than\n   in merely talking about how things ‚Äúought‚Äù to be.\n\nEric Hughes statement needed here:\nKarl Kleinpaste, author of one of the early anonymous\n posting services (Charcoal) said this about some proposal\n made: ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôve got serious plans for how to implement\n such a thing, please implement it at least skeletally and\n deploy it.  Proof by example, watching such a system in\n action, is far better than pontification about it.‚Äù\n [Karl_Kleinpaste@cs.cmu.edu, news.admin.policy, 1994-06-30]\n 4.5.3. ‚ÄúThe admonition, ‚ÄúCypherpunks write code,‚Äù should be taken\n   metaphorically.  I think ‚Äúto write code‚Äù means to take\n   unilateral effective action as an individual.  That may mean\n   writing actual code, but it could also mean dumpster diving\n   at Mycrotronx and anonymously releasing the recovered\n   information.  It could also mean creating an offshore digital\n   bank.  Don‚Äôt get too literal on us here.  What is important\n   is that Cypherpunks take personal responsibility for\n   empowering themselves against threats to privacy.‚Äù [Sandy\n   Sandfort, 1994-07-08]\n 4.5.4. A Cypherpunks outlook: taking the abstractions of academic\n   conferences and making them concrete\nOne thing Eric Hughes and I discussed at length (for 3 days\n of nearly nonstop talk, in May, 1992) was the glacial rate\n of progress in converting the cryptographic primitive\n operations of the academic crypto conferences into actual,\n workable code. The basic RSA algorithm was by then barely\n available, more than 15 years after invention. (This was\n before PGP 2.0, and PGP 1.0 was barely available and was\n disappointing, with RSA Data Security‚Äôs various products in\n limited niches.) All the neat stuff on digital cash, DC-\n Nets, bit commitment, olivioius transfer, digital mixes,\n and so on, was completely absent, in terms of avialable\n code or ‚Äúcrypto ICs‚Äù (to borrow Brad Cox‚Äôs phrase). If it\n took 10-15 years for RSA to really appear in the real\n world, how long would it take some of the exciting stuff to\n get out?\nWe thought it would be a neat idea to find ways to reify\n these things, to get actual running code. As it happened,\n PGP 2.0 appeared the week of our very first meeting, and\n both the Kleinpaste/Julf and Cypherpunks remailers were\n quick, if incomplete, implementations of David Chaum‚Äôs 1981\n ‚Äúdigital mixes.‚Äù (Right on schedule, 11 years later.)\nSadly, most of the abstractions of cryptology remain\n residents of academic space, with no (available)\n implementations in the real world. (To be sure, I suspect\n many people have cobbled-together versions of many of these\n things, in C code, whatever. But their work is more like\n building sand castles, to be lost when they graduate or\n move on to other projects. This is of course not a problem\n unique to cryptology.)\nToday, various toolkits and libraries are under\n development. Henry Strickland (Strick) is working on a\n toolkit based on John Ousterhout‚Äôs ‚ÄúTCL‚Äù system (for Unix),\n and of course RSADSI provides RSAREF. Pr0duct Cypher has\n ‚ÄúPGP Tools.‚Äù Other projects are underway. (My own longterm\n interest here is in building objects which act as the\n cryptography papers would have them act‚Ä¶building block\n objects. For this, I‚Äôm looking at Smalltalk of some\n flavor.)\nIt is still the case that most of the modern crypto papers\n discuss theoretical abstractions that are not even close\n to being implemented as reusable, robust objects or\n routines. Closing the gap between theoretical papers and\n practical realization is a major Cypherpunk emphasis.\n 4.5.5. Prototypes, even if fatally flawed, allow for evolutionary\n   learning and improvement. Think of it as engineering in\n   action.\n\n4.6. Technological empowerment\n 4.6.1. (more needed here‚Ä¶.)\n 4.6.2. As Sandy Sandfort notes, ‚ÄúThe real point of Cypherpunks is\n   that it‚Äôs better to use strong crypto than weak crypto or no\n   crypto at all.  Our use of crypto doesn‚Äôt have to be totally\n   bullet proof to be of value.  Let them worry about the\n   technicalities while we make sure they have to work harder\n   and pay more for our encrypted info than they would if it\n   were in plaintext.‚Äù [S.S. 1994-07-01]\n4.7. Free Speech Issues\n 4.7.1. Speech\n\n‚ÄúPublic speech is not a series of public speeches, but\n rather one‚Äôs own\n words spoken openly and without shame‚Ä¶.I desire a society\n where all may speak freely about whatever topic they will.\n I desire that all people might be able to choose to whom\n they wish to speak and to whom they do not wish to speak.\n I desire a society where all people may have an assurance\n that their words are directed only at those to whom they\n wish.  Therefore I oppose all efforts by governments to\n eavesdrop and to become unwanted listeners.‚Äù [Eric Hughes,\n 1994-02-22]\n‚ÄúThe government has no right to restrict my use of\n cryptography in any way.  They may not forbid me to use\n whatever ciphers I may like, nor may they require me to use\n any that I do not like.‚Äù [Eric Hughes, 1993-06-01]\n 4.7.2. ‚ÄúShould there be any limits whatsoever on a person‚Äôs use of\n   cryptography?‚Äù\nNo. Using the mathematics of cryptography is merely the\n manipulation of symbols. No crime is involved, ipso facto.\nAlso, as Eric Hughes has pointed out, this is another of\n those questions where the normative ‚Äúshould‚Äù or ‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt‚Äù\n invokes ‚Äúthe policeman inside.‚Äù A better way to look at is\n to see what steps people can take to make any question of\n ‚Äúshould‚Äù this be allowed just moot.\nThe ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù are actual physical acts like murder and\n kidnapping. The fact that crypto may be used by plotters\n and planners, thus making detection more difficult, is in\n no way different from the possibility that plotters may\n speak in an unusual language to each other (ciphers), or\n meet in a private home (security), or speak in a soft voice\n when in public (steganography). None of these things should\n be illegal, and none of them would be enforceable except\n in the most rigid of police states (and probably not even\n there).\n‚ÄúCrypto is thoughtcrime‚Äù is the effect of restricting\n cryptography use.\n 4.7.3. Democracy and censorship\nDoes a community have the right to decide what newsgroups\n or magazines it allows in its community? Does a nation have\n the right to do the same? (Tennessee, Iraq, Iran, France.\n Utah?)\nThis is what bypasses with crypto are all about: taking\n these majoritarian morality decisions out of the hands of\n the bluenoses. Direct action to secure freedoms.\n\n4.8. Privacy Issues\n 4.8.1. ‚ÄúIs there an agenda here beyond just ensuring privacy?‚Äù\n\nDefinitely! I think I can safely say that for nearly all\n political persuasions on the Cypherpunks list. Left, right,\n libertarian, or anarchist, there‚Äôs much more to to strong\n crypto than simple privacy. Privacy qua privacy is fairly\n uninteresting. If all one wants is privacy, one can simply\n keep to one‚Äôs self, stay off high-visibility lists like\n this, and generally stay out of trouble.\nMany of us see strong crypto as the key enabling technology\n for a new economic and social system, a system which will\n develop as cyberspace becomes more important. A system\n which dispenses with national boundaries, which is based on\n voluntary (even if anonymous) free trade. At issue is the\n end of governments as we know them today. (Look at\n interactions on the Net‚Äìon this list, for example‚Äìand\n you‚Äôll see many so-called nationalities, voluntary\n interaction, and the almost complete absence of any ‚Äúlaws.‚Äù\n Aside from their being almost no rules per se for the\n Cypherpunks list, there are essentially no national laws\n that are invokable in any way. This is a fast-growing\n trend.)\nMotivations for Cypherpunks\n    \nPrivacy. If maintaining privacy is the main goal, there‚Äôs\n not much more to say. Keep a low profile, protect data,\n avoid giving out personal information, limit the number\n of bank loans and credit applications, pay cash often,\n etc.\nPrivacy in activism.\nNew Structures. Using cryptographic constructs to build\n new political, economic, and even social structures.\n        \nPolitical: Voting, polling, information access,\n whistleblowing\nEconomic: Free markets, information markets, increased\n liquidity, black markets\nSocial: Cyberspatial communities, True Names\n\n\n\n\nPublically inspectable algorithms always win out over\n private, secret algorithms\n 4.8.2. ‚ÄúWhat is the American attitude toward privacy and\n   encryption?‚Äù\nThere are two distinct (and perhaps simultaneously held)\n views that have long been found in the American psyche:\n    \n‚ÄúA man‚Äôs home is his castle.‚Äù ‚ÄúMind your own business.‚Äù\n The frontier and Calvinist sprit of keeping one‚Äôs\n business to one‚Äôs self.\n‚ÄúWhat have you got to hide?‚Äù The nosiness of busybodies,\n gossiping about what others are doing, and being\n suspicious of those who try too hard to hide what they\n are doing.\n\n\nThe American attitude currently seems to favor privacy over\n police powers, as evidenced by a Time-CNN poll:\n    \n‚ÄúIn a Time/CNN poll of 1,000 Americans conducted last\n week by Yankelovich Partners, two-thirds said it was more\n important to protect the privacy of phone calls than to\n preserve the ability of police to conduct wiretaps. When\n informed about the Clipper Chip, 80% said they opposed\n it.‚Äù [Philip Elmer-Dewitt, ‚ÄúWho Should Keep the Keys,‚Äù\n TIME, 1994-03-04.]\n\n\nThe answer given is clearly a function of how the question\n is phrased. Ask folks if they favor ‚Äúunbreakable\n encryption‚Äù or ‚Äúfortress capabilities‚Äù for terrorists,\n pedophiles, and other malefactors, and they‚Äôll likely give\n a quite different answer. It is this tack now being taken\n by the Clipper folks. Watch out for this!\nMe, I have no doubts.\nAs Perry Metzger puts it, ‚ÄúI find the recent disclosures\n concerning U.S. Government testing of the effects of\n radiation on unknowing human subjects to be yet more\n evidence that you simply cannot trust the government with\n your own personal safety. Some people, given positions of\n power, will naturally abuse those positions, often even if\n such abuse could cause severe injury or death. I see little\n reason, therefore, to simply ‚Äútrust‚Äù the U.S. government ‚Äì\n and given that the U.S. government is about as good as they\n get, its obvious that NO government deserves the blind\n trust of its citizens. ‚ÄúTrust us, we will protect you‚Äù\n rings quite hollow in the face of historical evidence.\n Citizens must protect and preserve their own privacy ‚Äì the\n government and its centralized cryptographic schemes\n emphatically cannot be trusted.‚Äù [P.M., 1994-01-01]\n 4.8.3. ‚ÄúHow is 1994 like 1984?‚Äù\nThe television ad for Clipper: ‚ÄúClipper‚Äìwhy 1994 will be\n like 1984‚Äù\nAs Mike Ingle puts it:\n    \n1994: Wiretapping is privacy\n       Secrecy is openness\n       Obscurity is security\n 4.8.4. ‚ÄúWe anticipate that computer networks will play a more and\n more important role in many parts of our lives.  But this\n increased computerization brings tremendous dangers for\n infringing privacy.  Cypherpunks seek to put into place\n structures which will allow people to preserve their privacy\n if they choose.  No one will be forced to use pseudonyms or\n post anonymously. But it should be a matter of choice how\n much information a person chooses to reveal about himself\n when he communicates.  Right now, the nets don‚Äôt give you\n that much choice.  We are trying to give this power to\n people.‚Äù  [Hal Finney, 1993-02-23]\n 4.8.5. ‚ÄúIf cypherpunks contribute nothing else we can create a real\n privacy advocacy group, advocating means of real self-\n empowerment, from crypto to nom de guerre credit cards,\n instead of advocating further invasions of our privacy as the\n so-called privacy advocates are now doing!‚Äù [Jim Hart, 1994-\n 09-08]\n\n\n\n4.9. Education Issues\n 4.9.1. ‚ÄúHow can we get more people to use crypto?‚Äù\n\ntelling them about the themes of Cypherpunks\nsurveillance, wiretapping, Digital Telephony, Clipper, NSA,\n FinCEN, etc‚Ä¶.these things tend to scare a lot of folks\nmaking PGP easier to use, better integration with mailers,\n etc.\n(To be frank, convincing others to protect themselves is\n not one of my highest priorities.

Libertarian Issues\n4.10.1. A technological approach to freedom and privacy:\n\n‚ÄúFreedom is, practically, given as much (or more) by the\n tools we can build to protect it, as it is by our ability\n to convince others who violently disagree with us not to\n attack us.  On the Internet we have tools like anon\n remailers and PGP that give us a great deal of freedom\n from coercion even in the midst of censors. Thus, these\n tools piss off fans of centralized information control, the\n defenders of the status quo, like nothing else on the\n Internet.‚Äù  [an50@desert.hacktic.nl (Nobody),  libtech-\n l@netcom.com, 1994-06-08]\nDuncan Frissell, as usual, put it cogently:\n    \n\n‚ÄúIf I withhold my capital from some country or enterprise\n I am not  threatening to kill anyone.

However, it‚Äôs easy to get too negative on the situation, to\n   assume that a socialist state is right around the corner. Or\n   that a new Hitler will come to power. These are unlikely\n   developments, and not only because of strong crypto.\n   Financial markets are putting constraints on how fascist a\n   government can get‚Ä¶the international bond markets, for\n   example, will quickly react to signs like this. (This is the\n   theory, at least.)\n4.10.7. Locality of reference, cash, TANSTAAFL, privacy\nclosure, local computation, local benefits\nno accounting system needed\nmarkets clear\nmarket distortions like rationing, coupons, quotas, all\n require centralized record-keeping\nanything that ties economic transactions to identity\n (rationing, entitlements, insurance) implies identity-\n tracking, credentials, etc.\nNonlocality also dramatically increases the opportunities\n for fraud, for scams and con jobs\n    \nbecause something is being promised for future delivery\n (the essence of many scams) and is not verifiable locally\nbecause ‚Äútrust‚Äù is invoked\n\n\nLocality also fixes the ‚Äúpoliceman inside‚Äù problem: the\n costs of decisions are borne by the decider, not by others.\n\n4.11. Crypto Anarchy\n4.11.1. The Crypto Anarchy Principle: Strong crypto permits\n   unbreakable encrypion, unforgeable signatures, untraceable\n   electronic messages, and unlinkable pseudonomous identities.\n   This ensures that some transactions and communications can be\n   entered into only voluntarily. External force, law, and\n   regulation cannot be applied. This is ‚Äúanarchy,‚Äù in the sense\n   of no outside rulers and laws. Voluntary arrangements, back-\n   stopped by voluntarily-arranged institutions like escrow\n   services, will be the only form of rule. This is ‚Äúcrypto\n   anarchy.‚Äù\n4.11.2. crypto allows a return to contracts that governments cannot\n   breach\n\nbased on reputation, repeat business\nexample: ordering illegal material untraceably and\n anonymously,,,governments are powerless to do anything\nprivate spaces, with the privacy enforced via cryptographic\n permissions (access credentials)\nescrows (bonds)\n4.11.3. Technological solutions over legalistic regulations\nMarc Ringuette summarized things nicely:\n    \n\n‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre after is some ‚Äúcommunity standards‚Äù for\n cyberspace, and what I‚Äôm suggesting is the fairly\n libertarian standard that goes like this:\n‚Äù    Prefer technological solutions and self-protection\n solutions\n     over rule-making, where they are feasible.\n‚ÄúThis is based on the notion that the more rules there\n are, the more people will call for the ‚Äúnet police‚Äù to\n enforce them.  If we can encourage community standards\n which emphasize a prudent level of self-protection, then\n we‚Äôll be able to make do with fewer rules and a less\n intrusive level of policing.‚Äù[Marc Ringuette, 1993-03-14]\n\n\n\nHal Finney has made cogent arguments as to why we should\n not become too complacent about the role of technology vis-\n a-vis politics. He warns us not to grow to confident:\n    \n‚ÄúFundamentally, I believe we will have the kind of\n society that most people want.  If we want freedom and\n privacy, we must persuade others that these are worth\n having.  There are no shortcuts.  Withdrawing into\n technology is like pulling the blankets over your head.\n It feels good for a while, until reality catches up.  The\n next Clipper or Digital Telephony proposal will provide a\n rude awakening.‚Äù [Hal Finney, POLI: Politics vs\n Technology, 1994-01-02]\n\n\n‚ÄúThe idea here is that the ultimate solution to the low\n signal-to-noise ratio on the nets is not a matter of\n forcing people to ‚Äústand behind their words‚Äù.  People can\n stand behind all kinds of idiotic ideas.  Rather, there\n will need to be developed better systems for filtering news\n and mail, for developing ‚Äúdigital reputations‚Äù which can be\n stamped on one‚Äôs postings to pass through these smart\n filters, and even applying these reputations to pseudonyms.\n In such a system, the fact that someone is posting or\n mailing pseudonymously is not a problem, since nuisance\n posters won‚Äôt be able to get through.‚Äù  [Hal Finney, 1993-\n 02-23]\n4.11.4. Reputations\n4.11.5. I have a moral outlook that many will find unacceptable or\n   repugnant. To cut to the chase: I support the killing of\n   those who break contracts, who steal in serious enough ways,\n   and who otherwise commit what I think of as crimes.\nI don‚Äôt mean this abstractly. Here‚Äôs an example:\n    \nSomeone is carrying drugs. He knows what he‚Äôs involved\n in. He knows that theft is punishable by death. And yet\n he steals some of the merchandise.\nDealers understand that they cannot tolerate this, that\n an example must be made, else all of their employees will\n steal.\n\n\nUnderstand that I‚Äôm not talking about the state doing the\n killing, nor would I do the killing. I‚Äôm just saying such\n things are the natural enforcement mechanism for such\n markets. Realpolitik.\n(A meta point: the drug laws makes things this way.\n Legalize all drugs and the businesses would be more like\n ‚Äúordinary‚Äù businesses.)\nIn my highly personal opinion, many people, including most\n Congressrodents, have committed crimes that earn them the\n death penalty; I will not be sorry to see anonymous\n assassination markets used to deal with them.\n4.11.6. Increased espionage will help to destroy nation-state-empires\n   like the U.S., which has gotten far too bloated and far too\n   dependent on throwing its weight around; nuclear ‚Äúterrorism‚Äù\n   may knock out a few cities, but this may be a small price to\n   pay to undermine totally the socialist welfare states that\n   have launched so many wars this century.\n\n4.12. Loose Ends\n4.12.1. ‚ÄúWhy take a ‚Äúno compromise‚Äù stance?‚Äù\n\nCompromise often ends up in the death of a thousand cuts.\n Better to just take a rejectionist stance.\nThe National Rifle Association (NRA) learned this lesson\n the hard way. EFF may eventually learn it; right now they\n appear to be in the ‚Äúcoopted by the power center‚Äù mode,\n luxuriating in their inside-the-Beltway access to the Veep,\n their flights on Air Force One, and their general\n schmoozing with the movers and shakers‚Ä¶getting along by\n going along.\nLet‚Äôs not compromise on basic issues. Treat censorship as a\n problem to be routed around (as John Gilmore suggests), not\n as something that needs to be compromised on. (This is\n directed at rumblings about how the Net needs to ‚Äúpolice\n itself,‚Äù by the ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù censorship of offensive posts,\n by the ‚Äúmoderation‚Äù of newsgroups, etc. What should concern\n us is the accomodation of this view by well-meaning civil\n liberties groups, which are apparently willing to play a\n role in this ‚Äúself-policing‚Äù system. No thanks.)\n(And since people often misunderstand this point, I‚Äôm not\n saying private companies can‚Äôt set whatever policies they\n wish, that moderated newsgroups can‚Äôt be formed, etc.\n Private arrangements are just that. The issue is when\n censorship is forced on those who have no other\n obligations. Government usually does this, often aided and\n abetted by corporations and lobbying groups. This is what\n we need to fight. Fight by routing around, via technology.)\n4.12.2. The inherent evils of democracy\nTo be blunt about it, I‚Äôve come to despise the modern\n version of democracy we have. Every issue is framed in\n terms of popular sentiment, in terms of how the public\n would vote. Mob rule at its worst.\nShould people be allowed to wear blue jeans? Put it to a\n vote. Can employers have a policy on blue jeans? Pass a\n law. Should health care be provided to all? Put it to a\n vote. And so on, whittling away basic freedoms and rights.\n A travesty. The tyranny of the majority.\nDe Toqueville warned of this when he said that the American\n experiment in democracy would last only until citizens\n discovered they could pick the pockets of their neighbors\n at the ballot box.\nBut maybe we can stop this nonsense. I support strong\n crypto (and its eventual form, crypto anarchy) because it\n undermines this form of democracy. It takes some (and\n perhaps many) transactions out of the realm of popularity\n contests, beyond the reach of will of the herd. (No, I am\n not arguing there will be a complete phase change. As the\n saying goes, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt eat cyberspace.‚Äù But a lot of\n consulting, technical work, programming, etc., can in fact\n be done with crypto anarchic methods, with the money gained\n transferred in a variety of ways into the ‚Äúreal world.‚Äù\n More on this elsewhere.)\nCrypto anarchy effectively allows people to pick and choose\n which laws they support, at least in cyberspatial contexts.\n It empowers people to break the local bonds of their\n majoritarian normative systems and decide for themselves\n which laws are moral and which are bullshit.\n    \nI happen to have faith that most people will settle on a\n relatively small number of laws that they‚Äôll (mostly)\n support, a kind of Schelling point in legal space.\n4.12.3. ‚ÄúIs the Cypherpunks agenda too extreme?‚Äù\n\n\nBear in mind that most of the ‚ÄúCypherpunks agenda,‚Äù to the\n extent we can identify it, is likely to provoke ordinary\n citizens into outrage. Talk of anonymous mail, digital\n money, money laundering, information markets, data havens,\n undermining authority, transnationalism, and all the rest\n (insert your favorite idea) is not exactly mainstream.\n4.12.4. ‚ÄúCrypto Anarchy sounds too wild for me.‚Äù\nI accept that many people will find the implications of\n crypto anarchy (which follows in turn from the existence of\n strong cryptography, via the Crypto Anarchy Principle) to\n be more than they can accept.\nThis is OK (not that you need my OK!).

Why is public key cryptography so important?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chief advantage of public keys cryptosystems over\n conventional symmetric key (one key does both encryption\n and decryption) is one connectivity to recipients: one\n can communicate securely with people without exchanging key\n material.\n    \nby looking up their public key in a directory\nby setting up a channel using Diffie-Hellman key exchange\n (for example)\n5.4.11. ‚ÄúDoes possession of a key mean possession of identity?‚Äù\n\n\nIf I get your key, am I you?\nCertainly not outside the context of the cryptographic\n transaction. But within the context of a transaction, yes.\n Additional safeguards/speedbumps can be inserted (such as\n biometric credentials, additional passphrases, etc.), but\n these are essentially part of the ‚Äúkey,‚Äù so the basic\n answer remains ‚Äúyes.‚Äù (There are periodically concerns\n raised about this, citing the dangers of having all\n identity tied to a single credential, or number, or key.\n Well, there are ways to handle this, such as by adopting\n protocols that limit one‚Äôs exposure, that limits the amount\n of money that can be withdrawn, etc. Or people can adopt\n protocols that require additional security, time delays,\n countersigning, etc.)\nThis may be tested in court soon enough, but the answer for\n many contracts and crypto transactions will be that\n possession of key = possession of identity.

Any good textbook on crypto should explain it, and\n cover the math needed to unerstand it in detail. Several\n people have explained it (many times) on the list; here‚Äôs a\n short explanation by Karl Barrus:\n    \n\n‚ÄúConceptually, when you blind a message, nobody else can\n read it.  A property about blinding is that under the\n right circumstances if another party digitally signs a\n blinded message, the unblinded message will contain a\n valid digital signature.\n‚ÄúSo if Alice blinds the message ‚ÄúI owe Alice $1000‚Äù so\n that it reads (say) ‚Äúa;dfafq)(*&‚Äù or whatever, and Bob\n agrees to sign this message, later Alice can unblind the\n message Bob signed to retrieve the original.  And Bob‚Äôs\n digital signature will appear on the original, although\n he didn‚Äôt sign the original directly.\n‚ÄúMathematically, blinding a message means multiplying it\n by a number (think of the message as being a number).\n Unblinding is simply dividing the original blinding\n factor out.‚Äù [Karl Barrus, 1993-08-24]\n\n\n\nAnd another explanation by Hal Finney, which came up in the\n context of how to delink pharmacy prescriptions from\n personal identity (fears of medial dossiers(:\n    \n‚ÄúChaum‚Äôs ‚Äúblinded credential‚Äù system is intended to solve\n exactly this kind of problem, but it requires an\n extensive infrastructure.  There has to be an agency\n where you physically identify yourself.  It doesn‚Äôt have\n to know anything about you other than some physical ID\n like fingerprints.  You and it cooperate to create\n pseudonyms of various classes, for example, a ‚Äúgo to the\n doctor‚Äù pseudonym, and a ‚Äúgo to the pharmacy‚Äù pseudonym.\n These pseudonyms have a certain mathematical relationship\n which allows you to re-blind credentials written to one\n pseudonym to apply to any other.  But the agency uses\n your physical ID to make sure you only get one pseudonym\n of each kind‚Ä¶.So, when the doctor gives you a\n prescription, that is a credential applied to your ‚Äúgo to\n the doctor‚Äù pseudonym.  (You can of course also reveal\n your real name to the doctor if you want.)  Then you show\n it at the pharmacy using your ‚Äúgo to the pharmacy‚Äù\n pseudonym.  The credential can only be shown on this one\n pseudonym at the pharamacy, but it is unlinkable to the\n one you got at the doctor‚Äôs.  ‚Äú [Hal Finney, 1994-09-07]\n 5.7.2. ‚ÄúCrypto protocols are often confusing.

I‚Äôm\n including his explanation, despite its length, to help\n readers who are not cryptologists get some flavor of the\n type of math involved. The thing to notice is the use of\n exponentiations and modular arithmetic (the ‚Äúclock\n arithmetic‚Äù of our ‚Äúnew math‚Äù childhoods, except with\n really, really big numbers!). The difficulty of inverting\n the exponention (the discrete log problem) is what makes\n this a cryptographically interesting approach.\n        \n\n‚ÄúThe basic idea is simple.  Pick a large number p\n (probably a prime), and a base b that is a generator of\n the group of integers modulo p. Now, it turns out that\n given a known p, b, and (b^x) mod p, it‚Äôs extremely\n hard to find out x.  That‚Äôs known as the discrete log\n problem.\n‚ÄúHere‚Äôs how to use it.  Let two parties, X and Y, pick\n random numbers x and y, 1 < x,y < p.  They each\n calculate\n (b^x) mod p\n \nand\n     (b^y) mod p\n \nand transmit them to each other.  Now, X knows x and\n (b^y) mod p, so s/he can calculate (b^y)^x mod p =\n (b^(xy)) mod p.  Y can do the same calculation.  Now\n they both know (b^(xy)) mod p.  But eavesdroppers know\n only (b^x) mod p and (b^y) mod p, and can‚Äôt use those\n quantities to recover the shared secret.  Typically, of\n course, X and Y will use that shared secret as a key to\n a conventional cryptosystem.\n‚ÄúThe biggest problem with the algorithm, as outlined\n above, is that there is no authentication.  An attacker\n can sit in the middle and speak that protocol to each\n legitimate party.\n‚ÄúOne last point ‚Äì you can treat x as a secret key, and\n publish\n (b^X) mod p as a public key.

It may take\n millions of test samples, or even more, to establish\n randomness in set of data. For example:\n    \n‚ÄúThe standard tests for ‚Äòrandomness‚Äô utilized in govt\n systems requires 1X10^6 samples.

Ditto\n for any other field.\nIt seems to many of us that crypto is part of a larger\n study of core ideas involving: identity, proof, complexity,\n randomness, reputations, cut-and-choose protocols, zero\n knowledge, etc. In other words, the buzzwords.\n    \nBut which of these are ‚Äúcore‚Äù concepts, from which others\n are derived?\nWhy, for example, do the ‚Äúcut-and-choose‚Äù protocols work\n so well, so fairly? (That they do has been evident for a\n long time, and they literally are instances of Solomonic\n wisdom. Game theory has explanations in terms of payoff\n matrices, Nash equilibria, etc. It seems likely to me\n that the concepts of crypto will be recast in terms of a\n smaller set of basic ideas taken from these disparate\n fields of economics, game theory, formal systems, and\n ecology.

We know\n they work, but I think we don‚Äôt know fully why they work.\n (Maybe I‚Äôm wrong here, but I‚Äôve seen few papers looking at\n these issues in detail.)\nEconomics is certainly crucial, and tends to get overlooked\n in analysis of crypto protocols‚Ä¶.the various ‚ÄúCrypto\n Conference Proceedings‚Äù papers typically ignore economic\n factors (except in the area of measuring the strength of a\n system in terms of computational cost to break).\n‚ÄúAll crypto is economics.‚Äù\nWe learn what works, and what doesn‚Äôt. My hunch is that\n complex crypto systems will have emergent behaviors that\n are discovered only after deployment, or good simulation\n (hence my interest in ‚Äúprotocol ecologies‚Äù).\n 5.8.5. ‚ÄúIs it possible to create ciphers that are unbreakable in any\n   amount of time with any amount of computer power?‚Äù\nInformation-theoretically secure vs. computationally-secure\n    \nnot breakable even in principle, e.g., a one-time pad\n with random characters selected by a truly random process\n (die tosses, radioactive decay, certain types of noise,\n etc.)\n        \nand ignoring the ‚Äúbreakable by break-ins‚Äù approach of\n stealing the one-time pad, etc. (‚ÄúBlack bag\n cryptography‚Äù)\n\n\nnot breakable in ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù amounts of time with\n computers\n\n\nOf course, a one-time pad (Vernam cipher) is theoretically\n unbreakable without the key.

Our universe presumably has some finite number of\n particles (currently estimated to be 10^73 particles). This\n leads to the ‚Äúeven if every particle were a Cray Y-MP it\n would take‚Ä¶‚Äù sorts of thought experiments.\nBut I am considering energy here. Ignoring reversible\n computation for the moment, computations dissipate energy\n (some disagree with this point). There is some uppper limit\n on how many basic computations could ever be done with the\n amount of free energy in the universe. (A rough calculation\n could be done by calculating the energy output of stars,\n stuff falling into black holes, etc., and then assuming\n about kT per logical operation. This should be accurate to\n within a few orders of magnitude.) I haven‚Äôt done this\n calculation, and won‚Äôt today, but the result would likely\n be something along the lines of X joules of energy that\n could be harnessed for computation, resulting in Y basic\n primitive computational steps.\nI can then find a modulus of 3000 digits or 5000 digits, or\n whatever,that takes more than this number of steps to\n factor.\nCaveats:\n\n\nMaybe there are really shortcuts to factoring. Certainly\n improvements in factoring methods will continue. (But of\n course these improvements are not things that convert\n factoring into a less than exponential-in-length\n problem‚Ä¶that is, factoring appears to remain ‚Äúhard.‚Äù)\n\n\nMaybe reversible computations (a la Landauer, Bennett,\n et. al.) actually work. Maybe this means a ‚Äúfactoring\n machine‚Äù can be built which takes a fixed, or very slowly\n growing, amount of energy.\n\n\nMaybe the quantum-mechanical idea of Shore is possible.\n (I doubt it, for various reasons.)\n\n\nI continue to find it useful to think of very large numbers\n as creating ‚Äúforce fields‚Äù or ‚Äúbobbles‚Äù (a la Vinge) around\n data.

Specifically, the attacker will like take\n the thousand or so most popular songs, thousand or so most\n popular names, slogans, speeches, etc., and then run many\n permutations on each of them.\nbits of entropy\nlots of flaws, weaknesses, hidden factors\navoid simple words, etc.\nhard to get 100 or more bits of real entropy\nAs Eli Brandt puts it, ‚ÄúObscurity is no substitute for\n strong random numbers.‚Äù [E.B., 1994-07-03]\nCryptanalysis is a matter of deduction, of forming and\n refining hypotheses. For example, the site\n ‚Äúbitbucket@ee.und.ac.za‚Äù is advertised on the Net as a\n place to send ‚ÄúNSA food‚Äù to‚Ä¶mail sent to it gets\n discarded. So , a great place to send cover traffic to, no?\n No, as the NSA will mark this site for what it is and its\n usefulness is blown. (Unless its usefulness is actually\n something else, in which case the recursive descent has\n begun.)\nBohdan Tashchuk suggests [1994-07-04] using telephone-like\n numbers, mixed in with words, to better fit with human\n memorization habits; he notes that 30 or more bits of\n entropy are routinely memorized this way.\n 5.9.6. ‚ÄúHow can I remember long passwords or passphrases?‚Äù\nLots of security articles have tips on picking hard-to-\n guess (high entropy) passwords and passphrases.\nJust do it.\n    \nPeople can learn to memorize long sequences. I‚Äôm not good\n at this, but others apparently are. Still, it seems\n dangerous, in terms of forgetting. (And writing down a\n passphrase may be vastly more risky than a shorter but\n more easily memorized passphrase is.  I think theft\n of keys and keystroke capturing on compromised machines\n are much\n more important practical weaknesses.)\n\n\nThe first letters of long phrases that have meaning only to\n the owner.\n    \ne.g., ‚ÄúWhen I was ten I ate the whole thing.‚Äù‚Äî>\n ‚Äúwiwtiatwt‚Äù (Purists will quibble that prepositional\n phrases like ‚Äúwhen i was‚Äù have lower entropy. True, but\n better than ‚ÄúJoshua.‚Äù)\n\n\nVisual systems\n    \n\nAnother approach to getting enough entropy in\n passwords/phrases is a ‚Äúvisual key‚Äù where one mouses from\n position to position in a visual environment. That is,\n one is presented with a scene containg some number of\n nodes, perhaps representing familiar objects from one‚Äôs\n own home, and a path is chosen.  The advantage is that\n most people can remember fairly complicated\n (read: high entropy) ‚Äústories.‚Äù Each object triggers a\n memory of the next object to visit. (Example: door to\n kitchen to blender to refrigerator to ‚Ä¶.. ) This is the\n visual memory system said to be favored by Greek epic\n poets. This also gets around the keyboard-monitoring\n trick (but not necessarily the CRT-reading trick, of\n course).\nIt might be an interesting hack to offer this as a front\n end for PGP. Even a simple grid of characters which could\n be moused on could be an assist in using long\n passphrases.\n\n\n\n\n5.10. DES\n5.10.1. on the design of DES\n\nBiham and Shamir showed how ‚Äúdifferential cryptanalyis‚Äù\n could make the attack easier than brute-force search of the\n 2^56 keyspace. Wiener did a thought experiment design of a\n ‚ÄúDES buster‚Äù machine (who ya gonna call?) that could break\n a DES key in a matter of days. (Similar to the Diffie and\n Hellman analysis of the mid-70s, updated to current\n technology.)\nThe IBM designers knew about differential cryptanalyis, it\n is now clear, and took steps to optimize DES. After Shamir\n and Biham published, Don Coppersmith acknowledged this.\n He‚Äôs written a review paper:\n    \nCoppersmith, D.,  ‚ÄúThe Data Encryption Standard (DES) and\n its strength against attacks.‚Äù  IBM Journal of Research\n and Development.  38(3): 243-250.

SUMMARY: The Need For Strong Crypto\n 6.2.1. Main Points\n\nStrong crypto reclaims the power to decide for one‚Äôs self,\n to deny the ‚ÄúCensor‚Äù the power to choose what one reads,\n watches, or listens to.\n 6.2.2. Connections to Other Sections\n 6.2.3. Where to Find Additional Information\n 6.2.4. Miscellaneous Comments\nthis section is short, but is less focussed than other\n sections; it is essentially a ‚Äútransition‚Äù chapter.\n\n6.3. General Uses of and Reasons for Crypto\n 6.3.1. (see also the extensive listing of ‚ÄúReasons for Anonymity,‚Äù\n   which makes many points about the need and uses for strong\n   crypto)\n 6.3.2. ‚ÄúWhere is public key crypto really needed?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt is the case that there is relatively little need for\n asymmetric key cryptography in small closed populations.\n For example, the banks get along quite well without.  The\n advantage of public key is that it permits private\n communication in a large and open population and with a\n minimum of prearrangement.‚Äù [WHMurray, sci.crypt, 1994-08-\n 25]\nThat is, symmetric key systems (such as conventional\n ciphers, one time pads, etc.) work reasonably well by\n prearrangement between parties. And of course one time pads\n have the additional advantage of being information-\n theoretically secure. But asymmetric or public key methods\n are incredibly useful when: the parties have not met\n before, when key material has not been exchanged, and when\n concerns exist about storing the key material. The so-\n called ‚Äúkey management problem‚Äù when N people want to\n communicate pairwise with each other is well-founded.\nAnd of course public key crypto makes possible all the\n other useful stuff like digital money, DC-Nets, zero\n knowledge proofs, secret sharing, etc.\n 6.3.3. ‚ÄúWhat are the main reasons to use cryptography?‚Äù\npeople encrypt for the same reason they close and lock\n their doors\nPrivacy in its most basic forms\n    \ntext ‚Äì records, diaries, letters, e-mail\nsound ‚Äì phone conversations\nother ‚Äìvideo\nphones, intercepts, cellular, wireless, car phones,\n scanners\n        \nmaking listening illegal is useless (and wrong-headed)\n            \nand authorites are exempt from such laws\n\n\n\n\npeople need to protect, end to end\n‚ÄúHow should I protect my personal files, and my phone\n calls?‚Äù\n        \nPersonally, I don‚Äôt worry too much. But many people do.\n Encryption tools are widely available.\nCellular telephones are notoriously insecure, as are\n cordless phones (even less secure). There are laws\n about monitoring, small comfort as that may be. (And\n I‚Äôm largely opposed to such laws, for libertarian\n reasons and because it creates a false sense of\n security.)\nLaptops are probably less vulnerable to Van Eck types\n of RF monitoring than are CRTs. The trend to lower\n power, LCDs, etc., all works toward decreasing\n vulnerability. (However, computer power for extracting\n weak signals out of noise is increasing faster than RF\n are decreasing‚Ä¶.tradeoffs are unclear.)\n\n\n\n\nencrypting messages because mail delivery is so flaky\n    \nthat is, mail is misdelivered,via hosts incorrectly\n processing the addresses\nencryption obviously prevents misunderstandings (though\n it does little to get the mail delivered correctly)\n\n\nEncryption to Protect Information\n    \nthe standard reason\nencryption of e-mail is increasing\n        \nthe various court cases about employers reading\n ostensibly private e-mail will sharpen this debate (and\n raise the issue of employers forbidding encryption;\n resonances with the mostly-settled issue of reasonable\n use of company phones for private calls-more efficient\n to let some personal calls be made than to lose the\n time of employees going to public phones)\n\n\nencryption of faxes will increase, too, especially as\n technology advances and as the dangers of interception\n become more apparent\n        \nalso, tighter links between sender and receive, as\n opposed to the current ‚Äúdial the number and hope it‚Äôs\n the right one‚Äù approach, will encourage the additional\n use of encryption\n\n\n‚Äúelectronic vaulting‚Äù of large amounts of information,\n sent over T1 and T3 data networks, e.g., backup material\n for banks and large corporations\nthe miles and miles of network wiring within a\n corporation-LANs, WANs, Novell, Ethernet, TCP-IP, Banyan,\n and so on-cannot all be checked for taps‚Ä¶who would even\n have the records to know if some particular wire is going\n where it should?

Beyond Good and Evil, or, Why Crypto is Needed\n 6.7.1. ‚ÄúWhy is cryptography good? Why is anonymity good?‚Äù\n\nThese moral questions pop up on the List once in a while,\n often asked by someone preparing to write a paper for a\n class on ethics or whatnot. Most of us on the list probably\n think the answers are clearly ‚Äúyes,‚Äù but many in the public\n may not think so. The old dichotomy between ‚ÄúNone of your\n damned business‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat have you got to hide?‚Äù\n‚ÄúIs it good that people can write diaried unread by\n others?‚Äù ‚ÄúIs it good that people can talk to each other\n without law enforcement knowing what they‚Äôre saying?‚Äù ‚ÄúIs\n it good that people can lock their doors and hide from\n outsiders?‚Äù These are all essentially equivalent to the\n questions above.\nAnonymity may not be either good or not good, but the\n outlawing of anonymity would require a police state to\n enforce, would impinge on basic ideas about private\n transactions, and would foreclose many options that some\n degree of anonymity makes possible.\n‚ÄúPeople should not be anonymous‚Äù is a normative statement\n that is impractical to enforce.\n 6.7.2. Speaking of the isolation from physical threats and pressures\n   that cyberspace provides, Eric Hughes writes: ‚ÄúOne of the\n   whole points of anonymity and pseudonymity is to create\n   immunity from these threats, which are all based upon the\n   human body and its physical surroundings.  What is the point\n   of a system of anonymity which can be pierced when something\n   ‚Äúbad‚Äù happens?  These systems do not reject the regime of\n   violence; rather, they merely mitigate it slightly further\n   and make their morality a bit more explicit‚Ä¶..I desire\n   systems which do not require violence for their existence and\n   stability.  I desire anonymity as an ally to break the hold\n   of morality over culture.‚Äù [Eric Hughes, 1994-08-31]\n 6.7.3. Crypto anarchy means prosperity for those who can grab it,\n   those competent enough to have something of value to offer\n   for sale; the clueless 95% will suffer, but that is only\n   just. With crypto anarchy we can painlessly, without\n   initiation of aggression, dispose of the nonproductive, the\n   halt and the lame. (Charity is always possible, but I suspect\n   even the liberal do-gooders will throw up their hands at the\n   prospect of a nation of mostly unskilled and essentially\n   illiterate and innumerate workers being unable to get\n   meaninful, well-paying jobs.)\n 6.7.4.

Restrictions on cryptography‚Äìdifficult as they may be to\n   enforce‚Äìmay also impose severe hardships on secure operating\n   system design, Norm Hardy has made this point several times.\n\nAgents and objects inside computer systems will likely need\n security, credentials, robustness, and even digital money\n for transactions.\n 6.8.2. Proofs of identity, passwords, and operating system use\nZKIPS especially in networks, where the chances of seeing a\n password being transmitted are much greater (an obvious\n point that is not much discussed)\noperating systems and databases will need more secure\n procedures for access, for agents and the like to pay for\n services, etc.\n    \nunforgeable tokens\n 6.8.3.

Introduction\n 7.3.1. Why does PGP rate its own section?\n\nLike Clipper, PGP is too big a set of issues not to have\n its own section\n 7.3.2. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the fascination in Cypherpunks with PGP?‚Äù\nIronically, our first meeting, in September 1992, coincided\n within a few days of the release of PGP 2.0. Arthur Abraham\n provided diskettes of 2.0, complete with laser-printed\n labels. Version 2.0 was the first truly useful version of\n PGP (so I hear‚Ä¶.I never tried Version 1.0, which had\n limited distribution). So PGP and Cypherpunks shared a\n history‚Äìand Phil Zimmermann has been to some physical\n meetings.\nA practical, usable, understandable tool. Fairly easy to\n use. In contrast, many other developments are more abstract\n and do not lend themselves to use by hobbyists and\n amateurs. This alone ensures PGP an honored place (and\n might be an object lesson for developers of other tools).\n 7.3.3. The points here focus on PGP, but may apply as well to\n   similar crypto programs, such as commercial RSA packages\n   (integrated into mailers, commercial programs, etc.).\n\n7.4. What is PGP?\n 7.4.1. ‚ÄúWhat is PGP?‚Äù\n 7.4.2. ‚ÄúWhy was PGP developed?‚Äù\n 7.4.3. Who developed PGP?\n7.5. Importance of PGP\n 7.5.1. PGP 2.0 arrived at an important time\n\nin September 1992, the very same week the Cypherpunks had\n their first meeting, in Oakland, CA. (Arthur Abraham\n printed up professional-looking diskette labels for the PGO\n 2.0 diskettes distributed. A general feeling that we were\n forming at the ‚Äúright time.‚Äù)\njust 6 months before the Clipper announcement caused a\n firestorm of interest in public key cryptography\n 7.5.2. PGP has been the catalyst for major shifts in opinion\nhas educated tens of thousands of users in the nature of\n strong crypto\nhas led to other tools, including encrypted remailers,\n experiments in digital money, etc.\n 7.5.3. ‚ÄúIf this stuff is so important, how come not everyone is\n   digitally signing their messages?‚Äù\n(Me, for example. I never sign my messages, and this FAQ is\n not signed. Maybe I will, later.)\nconvenience, ease of use, ‚Äúall crypto is economics‚Äù\ninsecurity of host Unix machines (illusory)\nbetter integration with mailers needed\n 7.5.4. Ripem appears to be dead; traffic in alt.security.ripem is\n   almost zero. PGP has obviously won the hearts and minds of\n   the user community; and now that it‚Äôs ‚Äúlegal‚Äù‚Ä¶\n\n7.6. PGP Versions\n 7.6.1. PGP Versions and Implementations\n\n2.6ui is the version compatible with 2.3\nWhat is the difference between versions 2.6 and 2.6ui?\n    \n‚ÄúPGP 2.6 is distributed from MIT and is legally available\n to US and Canadian residents. It uses the RSAREF library.\n It has code that will prevent interoperation with earlier\n versions of PGP.\n ‚ÄúPGP 2.6ui is a modified version of PGP 2.3a which\n functions almost identically to MIT PGP 2.6, without the\n ‚Äúcripple code‚Äù of MIT PGP 2.6.

What versions of PGP exist?\n\n\nPGP 2.7 is ViaCrypt‚Äôs commercial version of PGP 2.6\n 7.6.3. PGP 2.6 issues\nThere has been much confusion, in the press and in\n discussion groups, about the issues surrounding 2.5, 2.6,\n 2.6ui, and various versions of these. Motivations,\n conspiracies, etc., have all been discussed. I‚Äôm not\n involved as others on our list are, so I‚Äôm often confused\n too.\nHere are some comments by Phil Zimmermann, in response to a\n misleading press report:\n    \n‚ÄúPGP 2.6 will always be able to read messages,\n signatures, and keys from olderversions, even after\n September 1st.  The older versions will not be able to\n read messages, signatures and keys produced by PGP 2.6\n after September 1st.  This is an entirely different\n situation.  There is every reason for people to switch to\n PGP 2.6, because it will be able to handle both data\n formats, while the older versions will not.  Until\n September, the new PGP will continue to produce the old\n format that can be read by older versions, but will start\n producing the new format after that date.  This delay\n allows time for everyone to obtain the new version of\n PGP, so that they will not be affected by the change.\n Key servers will still be able to carry the keys made in\n the old format, because PGP 2.6 will still read them with\n no problems. ‚Äú  [Phil Zimmermann, 1994-07-07, also posted\n to Usenet groups] [all dates here refer to 1994]\n‚ÄúI developed PGP 2.6 to be released by MIT, and I think\n this new\n arrangement is a breakthrough in the legal status of PGP,\n of benefit to\n all PGP users.  I urge all PGP users to switch to PGP\n 2.6, and abandon\n earlier versions.  The widespread replacement of the old\n versions with\n this new version of PGP fits in with future plans for the\n creation of a\n PGP standard.‚Äù  [Phil Zimmermann, 1994-07-07, also posted\n to Usenet groups]\n 7.6.4. PGP version 2.6.1\n\n\n\n‚ÄúMIT will be releasing Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) version\n 2.6.1 real soon now.  By tomorrow, I think.

The MIT FTP site is net-\n dist@mit.edu, in the pub/PGP directory.‚Äù [corrected by\n Derek Atkins to be: net-dist.mit.edu, not net-\n dist@mit.edu.]\n‚ÄúThis new version has a lot of bug fixes over version 2.6.\n I hope this is the final release of this family of PGP\n source code.  We‚Äôve been working on an entirely new version\n of PGP, rewritten from scratch, which is much cleaner and\n faster, and better suited for the future enhancements we\n have planned.  All PGP development efforts will be\n redirected toward this new code base, after this 2.6.1\n release.‚Äù [Phil Zimmermann, Cypherpunks list, 1994-09-02]\n\n\n7.7.

And a subtle bug in the random number generator\n eluded even Colin Plumb for a while.\nThe value of the source being available is that others can,\n if they wish, make the confirmation that the executable\n correspond to the source. That this can be done is enough\n for me. (Strategy: Hold on to the code for a while, wait\n for reports of flaws or holes, then use with confidence.)\nSignatures can be checked. Maybe timestamped versions,\n someday.\nFrankly, the odds are much higher that one‚Äôs messages or\n pseudonymous identity will be exposed in others ways than\n that PGP has been compromised. Slip-ups in sending messages\n sometimes reveal identities, as do inadvertent comments and\n stylistic cues.\n\n7.8. How to Use PGP\n 7.8.1. How does PGP work?\n 7.8.2. ‚ÄúHow should I store the secret part of my key? Can I memorize\n   it?‚Äù\n\nModern ciphers use keys that are far beyond memorization\n (or even typing in!). The key is usually stored on one‚Äôs\n home machine, or a machine that is reasonably secure, or on\n diskette. The passphrase should always be memorized or\n written down (ugh) in one‚Äôs wallet or other such place.\n Secure ‚Äúdongles‚Äù worn around the neck, or a ring or watch,\n may eventually be used. Smartcards and PDAs are a more\n likely intermediate solution (many PCs now have PCMCIA card\n slots).\n 7.8.3. ‚ÄúHow do I sign messages?‚Äù\ncf. the PGP docs\n\nhowever, this has come up on the List, and:\n\n\npgp -sta +clearsig=on message.txt\n\nThat‚Äôs from pgpdoc2.txt.

Use of PGP key fingerprints\n\n\n‚ÄúOne of the better uses for key fingerprints is for\n inclusion in signature files and other places that a key\n itself is too bulky.  By widespread dissemination of the\n fingerprint, the chances of a bogus key being undetected\n are decreased, since there are more channels for the\n fingerprint to get to recipients, and more channels for the\n owner of a key to see any bogus fingerprints out on the\n net.

That\n their electronic identities cannot be spoofed.\nI‚Äôm not interested in the various elm and emacs PGP\n packages (several such shells and wrappers exist). Any\n sysop can not only obtain your secret key, stored on\n hissystem, but he can also capture your passphrase as you\n feed it to the PGP program (assuming you do‚Ä¶many people\n automate this part as well). Since this sysop or one of his\n cronies can then compromise your mail, sign messages and\n contracts as ‚Äúyou,‚Äù I consider this totally unacceptable.\n Others apparently don‚Äôt.\nWhat can be done? Many of us only run PGP on home machines,\n or on machines we directly control. Some folks who use PGP\n on such machines at least take steps to better secure\n things‚Ä¶.Perry Metzger, for example, once described the\n multi-stage process he went through each day to reload his\n key material in a way he felt was quasi-safe.\nUntil the ‚ÄúInternet-in-a-box‚Äù or TIA-type products are more\n widespread, many people will be connecting home or office\n machines to other systems they don‚Äôt control. (To put this\n in sharper focus: do you want your electronic money being\n run out of an account that your sysop and his friends can\n monitor?

SUMMARY: Anonymity, Digital Mixes, and Remailers\n 8.2.1. Main Points\n\nRemailers are essential for anonymous and pseudonymous\n systems, because they defeat traffic analysis\nCypherpunks remailers have been one of the major successes,\n appearing at about the time of the Kleinpaste/Julf\n remailer(s), but now expanding to many sites\nTo see a list of sites:  finger remailer-\n list@kiwi.cs.berkeley.edu\n ( or http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~raph/remailer-list.html)\nAnonymity in general is a core idea\n 8.2.2. Connections to Other Sections\nRemailers make the other technologies possible\n 8.2.3. Where to Find Additional Information\nVery little has been written (formally, in books and\n journals) about remailers\nDavid Chaum‚Äôs papers are a start\n 8.2.4. Miscellaneous Comments\nThis remains one of the most jumbled and confusing\n sections, in my opinion. It needs a lot more reworking and\n reorganizing.\nPartly this is because of several factors\n    \na huge number of people have worked on remailers,\n contributing ideas, problems, code, and whatnot\nthere are many versions, many sites, and the sites change\n from day to day\nlots of ideas for new features\nin a state of flux\n\n\nThis is an area where actual experimentation with remailers\n is both very easy and very instructive‚Ä¶the ‚Äútheory‚Äù of\n remailers is straighforward (compared to, say, digital\n cash) and the learning experience is better than theory\n anyway.\nThere are a truly vast number of features, ideas,\n proposals, discussion points, and other such stuff. No FAQ\n could begin to cover the ground covered in the literally\n thousands of posts on remailers.\n\n8.3. Anonymity and Digital Pseudonyms\n 8.3.1. Why is anonymity so important?\n\nIt allows escape from past, an often-essential element of\n straighening out (an important function of the Western\n frontier, the French Foreign Legion, etc., and something we\n are losing as the dossiers travel with us wherever we go)\nIt allows new and diverse types of opinions, as noted below\nMore basically, anonymity is important because identity is\n not as important as has been made out in our dossier\n society. To wit, if Alice wishes to remain anonymous or\n pseudonymous to Bob, Bob cannot ‚Äúdemand‚Äù that she provide\n here ‚Äúreal‚Äù name. It‚Äôs a matter of negotiation between\n them. (Identity is not free‚Ä¶it is a credential like any\n other and cannot be demanded, only negotiated.)\nVoting, reading habits, personal behavior‚Ä¶all are\n examples where privacy (= anonymity, effectively) are\n critical. The next section gives a long list of reasons for\n anonymity.\n 8.3.2. What‚Äôs the difference between anonymity and pseudonymity?\nNot much, at one level‚Ä¶we often use the term ‚Äúdigital\n pseudonym‚Äù in a strong sense, in which the actual identity\n cannot be deduced easily\n    \nthis is ‚Äúanonymity‚Äù in a certain sense\n\n\nBut at another level, a pseudonym carries reputations,\n credentials, etc., and is not ‚Äúanonymous‚Äù\npeople use pseudonyms sometimes for whimsical reasons\n (e.g., ‚ÄúFrom spaceman.spiff@calvin.hobbes.org   Sep 6, 94\n 06:10:30‚Äù), sometimes to keep different mailing lists\n separate (different personnas for different groups), etc.\n 8.3.3. Downsides of anonymity\nlibel and other similar dangers to reputations\nhit-and-runs actions (mostly on the Net)\n    \non the other hand, such rantings can be ignored (KILL\n file)\n        \npositive reputations\n\n\n\n\naccountability based on physical threats and tracking is\n lost\nPractical issue. On the Cypherpunks list, I often take\n ‚Äúanonymous‚Äù messages less seriously.\n    \nThey‚Äôre often more bizarre and inflammatory than ordinary\n posts, perhaps for good reason, and they‚Äôre certainly\n harder to take seriously and respond to. This is to be\n expected. (I should note that some pseudonyms, such as\n Black Unicorn and Pr0duct Cypher, have established\n reputable digital personnas and are well worth replying\n to.)\n\n\nrepudiation of debts and obligations\ninfantile flames and run-amok postings\n    \nracism, sexism, etc.\nlike ‚ÄúRumormonger‚Äù at Apple?\n\n\nbut these are reasons for pseudonym to be used, where the\n reputation of a pseudonym is important\nCrimes‚Ä¶murders, bribery, etc.\n    \nThese are dealt with in more detail in the section on\n crypto anarchy, as this is a major concern (anonymous\n markets for such services)\n 8.3.4. ‚ÄúHow will privacy and anonymity be attacked?‚Äù\n\n\nthe downsides just listed are often cited as a reason we\n can‚Äôt have ‚Äúanonymity‚Äù\nlike so many other ‚Äúcomputer hacker‚Äù items, as a tool for\n the ‚ÄúFour Horsemen‚Äù: drug-dealers, money-launderers,\n terrorists, and pedophiles.\nas a haven for illegal practices, e.g., espionage, weapons\n trading, illegal markets, etc.\ntax evasion (‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt tax it if we can‚Äôt see it.‚Äù)\n    \nsame system that makes the IRS a ‚Äúsilent partner‚Äù in\n business transactions and that gives the IRS access to‚Äì\n and requires‚Äìbusiness records\n\n\n‚Äúdiscrimination‚Äù\n    \nthat it enables discrimination (this used to be OK)\nexclusionary communities, old boy networks\n 8.3.5. ‚ÄúHow will random accusations and wild rumors be controlled in\n anonymous forums?‚Äù\n\n\nFirst off, random accusations and hearsay statements are\n the norm in modern life; gossip, tabloids, rumors, etc. We\n don‚Äôt worry obsessively about what to do to stop all such\n hearsay and even false comments. (A disturbing trend has\n been the tendency to sue, or threaten suits. And\n increasingly the attitude is that one can express\n opinions, but not make statements ‚Äúunless they can be\n proved.‚Äù That‚Äôs not what free speech is all about!)\nSecond, reputations matter. We base our trust in statements\n on a variety of things, including: past history, what\n others say about veracity, external facts in our\n possession, and motives.\n 8.3.6. ‚ÄúWhat are the legal views on anonymity?‚Äù\nReports that Supreme Court struck down a Southern law\n requiring pamphlet distributors to identify themselves. 9I\n don‚Äôt have a cite on this.)\n    \n\nHowever, Greg Broiles provided this quote, from Talley\n v. State of California, 362 U.S. 60, 64-65, 80 S.Ct.\n 536, 538-539 (1960) : ‚ÄúAnonymous pamphlets, leaflets,\n brochures and even books have played an important role in\n the progress of mankind. Persecuted groups and sects from\n time to time throughout history have been able to\n criticize oppressive practices and laws either\n anonymously or not at all.‚Äù\nGreg adds: ‚ÄúIt later says ‚ÄúEven the Federalist Papers,\n written in favor of the adoption of our Constitution,\n were published under fictitious names. It is plain that\n anonymity has sometimes been assumed for the most\n constructive purposes.‚Äù [Greg Broiles, 1994-04-12]\n\n\n\nAnd certainly many writers, journalists, and others use\n pseudonyms, and have faced no legal action.\n    \nProvided they don‚Äôt use it to evade taxes, evade legal\n judgments, commit fraud, etc.\n\n\nI have heard (no cites) that ‚Äúgoing masked for the purpose\n of going masked‚Äù is illegal in many jurisdictions. Hard to\n believe, as many other disguises are just as effective and\n are presumably not outlawed (wigs, mustaches, makeup,\n etc.). I assume the law has to do with people wearning ski\n masks and such in ‚Äúinappropriate‚Äù places. Bad law, if real.\n 8.3.7. Some Other Uses for Anonymous Systems:\nGroupware and Anonymous Brainstorming and Voting\n    \nsystems based on Lotus Notes and designed to encourage\n wild ideas, comments from the shy or overly polite, etc.\nthese systems could initially start in meeting and then\n be extended to remote sites, and eventually to nationwide\n and international forums\nthe NSA may have a heart attack over these trends‚Ä¶\n\n\n‚ÄúDemocracy Wall‚Äù for encrypted messages\n    \npossibly using time-delayed keys (where even the public\n key, for reading the plaintext, is not distributed for\n some time)\nunder the cover of an electronic newspaper, with all of\n the constitutional protections that entails: letters to\n the editor can be anonymous, ads need not be screened for\n validity, advertising claims are not the responsibility\n of the paper, etc.\n\n\nAnonymous reviews and hypertext (for new types of journals)\n    \nthe advantages\n        \nhonesty\nincreased ‚Äútemperature‚Äù of discourse\n\n\ndisadvantages\n        \nincreased flames\nintentional misinformation\n\n\n\n\nStore-and-forward nodes\n    \nused to facillitate the anonymous voting and anonymous\n inquiry (or reading) systems\nChaum‚Äôs ‚Äúmix‚Äù\ntelephone forwarding systems, using digital money to pay\n for the service\n        \nand TRMs?\n\n\n\n\nFiber optics\n    \nhard to trace as millions of miles are laid, including\n virtually untraceable lines inside private buildings\n        \nsuppose government suspects encrypted packets are going\n in to the buildings of Apple‚Ä¶absent any direct\n knowledge of crimes being aided and abetted, can the\n government demand a mapping of messages from input to\n output?\nThat is, will the government demand full disclosure of\n all routings?\n\n\nhigh bandwidth means many degrees of freedom for such\n systems to be deployed\n\n\nWithin systems, i.e., user logs on to a secure system and\n is given access to his own processor\n    \nin a 288-processor system like the NCR/ATT 3600 (or even\n larger)\nunder his cryptonym he can access certain files, generate\n others, and deposit message untraceably in other mail\n locations that other agents or users can later  retrieve\n and forward‚Ä¶.\nin a sense, he can use this access to launch his own\n agent processes (anonymity is essential for many agent-\n based systems, as is digital money)\n\n\nEconomic incentives for others to carry mail to other\n sites‚Ä¶\n    \nfurther diffusion and hiding of the true functions\n\n\nBinary systems (two or more pieces needed to complete the\n message)\n    \npossibly using viruses and worms to handle the\n complexities of distributing these messages\nagents may handle the transfers, with isolation between\n the agents, so routing cannot be traced (think of scene\n in ‚ÄúDouble-Crossed‚Äù where bales of marijuana are passed\n from plane to boat to chopper to trucks to cars)\nthis protects against conspiracies\n\n\nSatellites\n    \nphysical security, in that the satellites would have to\n be shot down to halt the broadcasting\n        \nscenario: WARC (or whomever) grants broadcast rights in\n 1996 to some country or consortium, which then accepts\n any and all paying customers\n            \ncold cash\nthe BCCI of satellite operators\n\n\n\n\nVSATs, L-Band, Satellites, Low-Earth Orbit\n        \nVery Small Aperture Terminals\nL-Band‚Ä¶what frequency?\nLEO, as with Motorola‚Äôs Iridium, offers several\n advantages\n            \nlower-power receivers and smaller antennas\nlow cost to launch, due to small size and lower need\n for 10-year reliability\navoidance of the ‚Äúorbital slot‚Äù licensing morass\n (though I presume some licensing is still involved)\n\n\ncan combine with impulse or nonsinusoidal transmissions\n 8.3.8. ‚ÄúTrue Names‚Äù\n 8.3.9.

Miscellaneous Issues\nEven digital pseudonyms can get confusing‚Ä¶someone\n recently mistook ‚ÄúTommy the Tourist‚Äù for being such an\n actual digital pseudonym (when of course that is just\n attached to all posts going througha particular remailer).\n\n8.4. Reasons for Anonymity and Digital Pseudonyms (and Untraceable E-\nMail)\n 8.4.1. (Thre are so many reasons, and this is asked so often, that\n   I‚Äôve collected these various reasons here. More can be added,\n   of course.)\n 8.4.2. Privacy in general\n 8.4.3. Physical Threats\n\n‚Äúcorporate terrrorism‚Äù is not a myth: drug dealers and\n other ‚Äúmarginal‚Äù businessmen face this every day\n    \nextortion, threats, kidnappings\n\n\nand many businesses of the future may well be less\n ‚Äúgentlemanly‚Äù than the conventional view has it\n    \nwitness the bad blood between Intel and AMD, and then\n imagine it getting ten times worse\nand national rivalries, even in ostensibly legal\n businesses (think of arms dealers), may cause more use of\n violence\nMafia and other organized crime groups may try to extort\n payments or concessions from market participants, causing\n them to seek the relative protection of anonymous systems\n        \nwith reputations\n\n\nNote that calls for the threatened to turn to the police\n for protection has several problems\n        \nthe activities may be illegal or marginally illegal\n (this is the reason the Mafia can often get involved\n and why it may even sometimes have a positive effect,\n acting as the cop for illegal activities)\nthe police are often too busy to get involved, what\n with so much physical crime clogging the courts\n\n\n\n\nextortion and kidnappings can be done using these very\n techniques of cryptoanarchy, thus causing a kind of arms\n race\nbattered and abused women and families may need the\n equivalent of a ‚Äúwitness protection program‚Äù\n    \nbecause of the ease of tracing credit card purchases,\n with the right bribes and/or court orders (or even\n hacking), battered wives may seek credit cards under\n pseudonyms\n        \nand some card companies may oblige, as a kind of\n politically correct social gesture\nor groups like NOW and Women Against Rape may even\n offer their own cards\n            \nperhaps backed up by some kind of escrow fund\ncould be debit cards\n\n\n\n\n\n\npeople who participate in cyberspace businesses may fear\n retaliation or extortion in the real world\n    \nthreats by their governments (for all of the usual\n reasons, plus kickbacks, threats to close them down,\n etcl)\nripoffs by those who covet their success‚Ä¶\n 8.4.4. Voting\n\n\nWe take it for granted in Western societies that voting\n should be ‚Äúanonymous‚Äù‚Äìuntraceable, unlinkable\nwe don‚Äôt ask people ‚ÄúWhat have you got to hide?‚Äù or tell\n them ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre doing something anonymously, it must be\n illegal.‚Äù\nSame lesson ought to apply to a lot of things for which the\n government is increasingly demanding proof of identity for\nAnonymous Voting in Clubs, Organizations, Churches, etc.\n    \na major avenue for spreading CA methods: ‚Äúelectronic\n blackballing,‚Äù weighted voting (as with number of shares)\n        \ne.g., a corporation issues ‚Äúvoting tokens,‚Äù which can\n be used to vote anonymously\n            \nor even sold to others (like selling shares, except\n selling only the voting right for a specific election\n is cheaper, and many people don‚Äôt much care about\n elections)\n\n\na way to protect against deep pockets lawsuits in, say,\n race discrimination cases\n            \nwherein a director is sued for some action the\n company takes-anonymity will give him some legal\n protection, some ‚Äúplausible deniability‚Äù\n\n\nis possible to set up systems (cf. Salomaa) in which\n some ‚Äúsupervotes‚Äù have blackball power, but the use of\n these vetos is indistinguishable from a standard\n majority rules vote\n            \ni.e., nobody, except the blackballer(s), will know\n whether the blackball was used!\nwill the government seek to limit this kind of\n protocol?\n                \nclaiming discrimination potential or abuse of\n voting rights?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwill Justice Department (or SEC) seek to overturn\n anonymous voting?\n        \nas part of the potential move to a ‚Äúfull disclosure‚Äù\n society?\nrelated to antidiscrimination laws, accountability,\n etc.\n\n\nAnonymous Voting in Reputation-Based Systems (Journals,\n Markets)\n        \ncustomers can vote on products, on quality of service,\n on the various deals they‚Äôve been involved in\n            \nnot clear how the voting rights would get distributed\nthe idea is to avoid lawsuits, sanctions by vendors,\n etc. (as with the Bose suit)\n\n\nJournals\n            \na canonical example, and one which I must include, as\n it combines anonymous refereeing (already standard,\n in primitive forms), hypertext (links to reviews),\n and basic freedom of speech issues\nthis will likely be an early area of use\n\n\nthis whole area of consumer reviews may be a way to get\n CA bandwidth up and running (lots of PK-encrypted\n traffic sloshing around the various nets)\n 8.4.5. Maintenance of free speech\n\n\n\n\nprotection of speech\navoiding retaliation for controversial speech\n    \nthis speech may be controversial, insulting, horrific,\n politically incorrect, racist, sexist, speciesist, and\n other horrible‚Ä¶but remailers and anonymity make it all\n impossible to stop\n\n\nwhistleblowing\npolitical speech\n    \nKKK, Aryan Resistance League, Black National Front,\n whatever\ncf. the ‚Äúdebate‚Äù between ‚ÄúLocke‚Äù and ‚ÄúDemosthenes‚Äù in\n Orson Scott Card‚Äôs novel, ‚ÄúEnder‚Äôs Game.‚Äù\n\n\n(Many of these reasons are also why ‚Äòdata havens‚Äô will\n eventually be set up‚Ä¶indeed, they already exist‚Ä¶homolka\n trial, etc.)\n 8.4.6. Adopt different personnas, pseudonyms\n 8.4.7.

Anonymity in Requesting Information, Services, Goods\n\n\na la the controversy over Caller ID and 900 numbers: people\n don‚Äôt want their telephone numbers (and hence identities)\n fed into huge consumer-preference data banks\n    \nof the things they buy, the videos they rent, the books\n they read. etc. (various laws protect some of these\n areas, like library books, video

anonymously\n\n\nsome examples of ‚Äúsensitive‚Äù services that anonymity may be\n desired in (especially related to computers, modems, BBSes)\n    \nreading unusual or sensitive groups: alt.sex.bondage,\n etc.\n        \nor posting to these groups!\nrecent controversy over NAMBLA may make such\n protections more desirable to some (and parallel calls\n for restrictions!)\n\n\nposting to such groups, especially given that records are\n perpetual and that government agencies read and file\n postings (an utterly trivial thing to do)\nrequesting help on personal issues (equivalent to the\n ‚ÄúName Witheld‚Äù seen so often)\ndiscussing controversial political issues (and who knows\n what will be controversial 20 years later when the poster\n is seeking a political office, for example?)\n        \ngiven that some groups have already (1991) posted the\n past postings of people they are trying to smear!\n\n\nNote: the difference between posting to a BBS group or\n chat line and writing a letter to an editor is\n significant\n        \npartly technological: it is vastly easier to compile\n records of postings than it is to cut clippings of\n letters to editors (though this will change rapidly as\n scanners make this easy)\npartly sociological: people who write letters know the\n letters will be with the back issues in perpetuity,\n that bound issues will preserve their words for many\n decades to come (and could conceivably come back to\n haunt them), but people who post to BBSes probably\n think their words are temporary\nand there are some other factors\n            \nno editing\nno time delays (and no chance to call an editor and\n retract a letter written in haste or anger)\nand letters can, and often are, written with the\n ‚ÄúName Witheld‚Äù signature-this is currently next to\n impossible to do on networks\n                \nthough some ‚Äúforwarding‚Äù services have informally\n sprung up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBusinesses may wish to protect themselves from lawsuits\n over comments by their employees\n    \nthe usual ‚ÄúThe opinions expressed here are not those of\n my employer‚Äù may not be enough to protect an employer\n from lawsuits\n        \nimagine racist or sexist comments leading to lawsuits\n (or at least being brought up as evidence of the type\n of ‚Äúattitude‚Äù fostered by the company, e.g., ‚ÄúI‚Äôve\n worked for Intel for 12 years and can tell you that\n blacks make very poor engineers.‚Äù)\n\n\nemployees may make comments that damage the reputations\n of their companies\n        \nNote: this differs from the current situation, where\n free speech takes priority over company concerns,\n because the postings to a BBS are carried widely, may\n be searched electronically (e.g., AMD lawyers search\n the UseNet postings of 1988-91 for any postings by\n Intel employees besmirching the quality or whatever of\n AMD chips),\n\n\nand so employees of corporations may protect themselves,\n and their employers, by adopting pseudonyms\n\n\nBusinesses may seek information without wanting to alert\n their competitors\n    \nthis is currently done with agents, ‚Äúexecutive search\n firms,‚Äù and lawyers\nbut how will it evolve to handle electronic searches?\nthere are some analogies with filings of ‚ÄúFreedom of\n Information Act‚Äù requests, and of patents, etc.\n        \nthese ‚Äúfishing expeditions‚Äù will increase with time, as\n it becomes profitable for companies to search though\n mountains of electronically-filed materials\n            \nenvironmental impact studies, health and safety\n

One of the simplest and least\n controversial would be to defeat traffic analysis on\n ordinary email‚Ä¶..Two people who wish to communicate\n privately can use PGP or some other encryption system to\n hide the content of their messages.  But the fact that\n they are communicating with each other is still visible\n to many people: sysops at their sites and possibly at\n intervening sites, as well as various net snoopers.  It\n would be natural for them to desire an additional amount\n of privacy which would disguise who they were\n communicating with as well as what they were saying.\n‚ÄúAnonymous remailers make this possible.  By forwarding\n mail between themselves through remailers, while still\n identifying themselves in the (encrypted) message\n contents, they have even more communications privacy than\n with simple encryption.\n‚Äú(The Cypherpunk vision includes a world in which\n literally hundreds or thousands of such remailers\n operate.  Mail could be bounced through dozens of these\n services, mixing in with tens of thousands of other\n messages, re-encrypted at each step of the way.  This\n should make traffic analysis virtually impossible.  By\n sending periodic dummy messages which just get swallowed\n up at some step, people can even disguise when they are\n communicating.)‚Äù [Hal Finney, 1993-02-23]\n‚ÄúThe more controversial vision associated with anonymous\n remailers is expressed in such science fiction stories as\n ‚ÄúTrue Names‚Äù, by Vernor\n Vinge, or ‚ÄúEnder‚Äôs Game‚Äù, by Orson Scott Card.  These\n depict worlds in which computer networks are in\n widespread use, but in which many people choose to\n participate through pseudonyms.  In this way they can\n make unpopular arguments or participate in frowned-upon\n transactions without their activities being linked to\n their true identities.  It also allows people to develop\n reputations based on the quality of their ideas, rather\n than their job, wealth, age, or status.‚Äù [Hal Finney,\n 1993-02-23]\n\n\n\n‚ÄúOther advantages of this approach include its extension to\n electronic on-line transactions.  Already today many\n records are kept of our financial dealings - each time we\n purchase an item over the phone using a credit card, this\n is recorded by the credit card company.  In time, even more\n of this kind of information may be collected and possibly\n sold. One Cypherpunk vision includes the ability to engage\n in transactions anonymously, using ‚Äúdigital cash‚Äù, which\n would not be traceable to the participants.  Particularly\n for buying ‚Äúsoft‚Äù products, like music, video, and software\n (which all may be deliverable over the net eventually), it\n should be possible to engage in such transactions\n anonymously.

Why aren‚Äôt signatures stripped off by\n remailers?‚Äù\n    \n‚ÄúThe reason to build mailers that faithfully pass on the\n entire body of\n the message, without any kind of alteration, is that it\n permits you to\n send ANY body through that mailer and rely on its\n faithful arrival at the\n destination.‚Äù [John Gilmore, 93-01-01]\nThe ‚Äú::‚Äù special form is an exception\nSignature blocks at the end of message bodies\n specifically should not be stripped, even though this\n can cause security breaches if they are accidentally left\n in when not intended. Attempting to strip sigs, which\n come in many flavors, would be a nightmare and could\n strip other stuff, too. Besides, some people may want a\n sig attached, even to an encrypted message.\nAs usual, anyone is of course free to have a remailer\n which munges message bodies as it sees fit, but  I expect\n such remailers will lose customers.\nAnother possibility is another special form, such as\n ‚Äú::End‚Äù, that could be used to delimit the block to be\n remailed. But it‚Äôll be hard getting such a ‚Äúfrill‚Äù\n accepted.\n\n\n‚ÄúHow do remailers handle subject lines?‚Äù\n    \nIn various ways. Some ignore it, some preserve it, some\n even can accept instructions to create a new subject line\n (perhaps in the last remailer).\nThere are reasons not to have a subject line propagated\n through a chain of remailers: it tags the message and\n hence makes traffic analysis trivial. But there are also\n reasons to have a subject line‚Äìmakes it easier on the\n recipient‚Äìand so these schemes to add a subject line\n exist.\n\n\n‚ÄúCan nicknames or aliases be used with the Cypherpunks\n remailers?‚Äù\n    \nCertainly digitally signed IDs are used (Pr0duct Cypher,\n for example), but not nicknames preserved in fields in\n the remailing and mail-to-Usenet gateways.\nThis could perhaps be added to the remailers, as an extra\n field. (I‚Äôve heard the mail fields are more tolerant of\n added stuff than the Netnews fields are, making mail-to-\n News gateways lose the extra fields.)\nSome remailer sites support them\n        \n‚ÄúIf you want an alias assigned at vox.hacktic.nl, one -\n only- needs to send some empty mail to\n ping@vox.hacktic.nl and the adress the mail was send\n from will be inculded in the data-base‚Ä¶..Since\n vox.hacktic.nl is on a UUCP node the reply can take\n some time, usually something like 8 to 12 hours.‚Äù[Alex\n de Joode, usura@vox.hacktic.nl, 1994-08-29]\n\n\n\n\n‚ÄúWhat do remailers do with the various portions of\n messages? Do they send stuff included after an encrypted\n block? Should they? What about headers?‚Äù\n    \nThere are clearly lots of approaches that may be taken:\n        \nSend everything as is, leaving it up to the sender to\n ensure that nothing incriminating is left\nMake certain choices\n\n\nI favor sending everything, unless specifically told not\n to, as this makes fewer assumptions about the intended\n form of the message and thus allows more flexibility in\n designing new functions.\nFor example, this is what Matthew Ghio had to to say\n about his remailer:\n        \n‚ÄúEverything after the encrypted message gets passed\n along in the clear. If you don‚Äôt want this, you can\n remove it using the cutmarks feature with my remailer.\n (Also, remail@extropia.wimsey.com doesn‚Äôt append the\n text after the encrypted message.)  The reason for this\n is that it allows anonymous replies.  I can create a\n pgp message for a remailer which will be delivered to\n myself.  I send you the PGP message, you append some\n text to it, and send it to the remailer.  The remailer\n decrypts it and remails it to me, and I get your\n message.

Dealing with Remailer Abuse\nThe Hot Potato\n    \na remailer who is being used very heavily, or suspects\n abuse, may choose to distribute his load to other\n remailers. Generally, he can instead of remailing to the\n next site, add sites of his own choosing. Thus, he can\n both reduce the spotlight on him and also increase cover\n traffic by scattering some percentage of his traffic to\n other sites (it never reduces his traffic, just lessens\n the focus on him).\n\n\nFlooding attacks\n    \ndenial of service attacks\nlike blowing whistles at sports events, to confuse the\n action\nDC-Nets, disruption (disruptionf of DC-Nets by flooding\n is a very similar problem to disruption of remailers by\n mail bombs)\n\n\n‚ÄúHow can remailers deal with abuse?‚Äù\n    \nSeveral remailer operators have shut down their\n remailers, either because they got tired of dealing with\n the problems, or because others ordered them to.\nSource level blocking\nPaid messages: at least this makes the abusers pay  and\n stops certain kinds of spamming/bombing attacks.\nDisrupters are dealt with in anonymous ways in Chaum‚Äôs DC-\n Net schemes; there may be a way to use this here.\n\n\nKarl Kleinpaste was a pioneer (circa 1991-2) of remailers.\n He has become disenchanted:\n    \n‚ÄúThere are 3 sites out there which have my software:\n anon.penet.fi, tygra, and uiuc.edu.

Remailer Features\nThere are dozens of proposed variations, tricks, and\n methods which may or may not add to overall remailer\n security (entropy, confusion). These are often discussed on\n the list, one at a time. Some of them are:\n    \nUsing one‚Äôs self as a remailer node. Route traffic back\n through one‚Äôs own system.\n        \neven if all other systems are compromised‚Ä¶\n\n\nRandom delays, over and above what is needed to meet\n reordering requirements\nMIRVing, sending a packet out in multiple pieces\nEncryption is of course a primary feature.\nDigital postage.\n        \nNot so much a feature as an incentive/inducement to get\n more remailers and support them better.\n\n\n\n\n‚ÄúWhat are features of a remailer network?‚Äù\n    \nA vast number of features have been considered; some are\n derivative of other, more basic features (e.g., ‚Äúrandom\n delays‚Äù is not a basic feature, but is one proposed way\n of achieving ‚Äúreordering,‚Äù which is what is really\n needed. And ‚Äúreordering‚Äù is just the way to achieve\n ‚Äúdecorrelation‚Äù of incoming and outgoing messages).\nThe ‚ÄúIdeal Mix‚Äù is worth considering, just as the ‚Äúideal\n op amp‚Äù is studied by engineers, regardless of whether\n one can ever be built.\n        \na black box that decorrelates incoming and outgoing\n packets to some level of diffusion\ntamper-proof, in that outside world cannot see the\n internal process of decorrelation (Chaum envisioned\n tamper-resistant or tamper-responding circuits doing\n the decorrelation)\n\n\nFeatures of Real-World Mixes:\n        \nDecorrelation of incoming and outgoing messages. This\n is the most basic feature of any mix or remailer:\n obscuring the relationship between any message entering\n the mix and any message leaving the mix. How this is\n achieve is what most of the features here are all\n about.\n            \n‚ÄúDiffusion‚Äù is achieved by batching or delaying\n (danger: low-volume traffic defeats simple, fixed\n delays)\nFor example, in some time period, 20 messages enter a\n node. Then 20 or so (could be less, could be\n more‚Ä¶there is no reason not to add messages, or\n throw away some) messages leave.\n\n\nEncryption should be supported, else the decorrelation\n is easily defeated by simple inspection of packets.\n            \npublic key encryption, clearly, is preferred (else\n the keys are available outside)\nforward encryption, using D-H approaches, is a useful\n idea to explore, with keys discarded after\n transmission‚Ä¶.thus making subpoenas problematic\n (this has been used with secure phones, for example).\n\n\nQuanitzed packet sizes. Obviously the size of a packet\n (e.g., 3137 bytes) is a strong cue as to message\n identity. Quantizing to a fixed size destroys this cue.\n            \nBut since some messages may be small, and some large,\n a practical compromise is perhaps to quantize to one\n of several standards:\n                \nsmall messages, e.g., 5K\nmedium messages, e.g., 20K\nlarge messages‚Ä¶.handled somehow (perhaps split\n up, etc.)\n\n\nMore analysis is needed.\n\n\nReputation and Service\n            \nHow long in business?\nLogging policy? Are messages logged?\nthe expectation of operating as stated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Basic Goals of Remailer Use\n    \ndecorrelation of ingoing and outgoing messages\n        \nindistinguishability\n‚Äúremailed messages have no hair‚Äù (apologies to the\n black hole fans out there)\n            \nno distinguishing charateristics that can be used to\n make correlations\nno ‚Äúmemory‚Äù of previous appearance\n\n\n\n\nthis means message size padding to quantized sizes,\n typically\n        \nhow many distinct sizes depends on a lot fo things,\n like traffic, the sizes of other messages, etc.\n\n\n\n\nEncryption, of course\n    \nPGP\notherwise, messages are trivially distinguishable\n\n\nQuantization or Padding: Messages\n    \npadded  to standard sizes, or dithered in size to obscure\n oringinal size. For example, 2K for typical short\n messages, 5K for typical Usenet articles, and 20K for\n long articles. (Messages much longer are hard to hide in\n a sea of much shorter messages, but other possibilities\n exist: delaying the long messages until N other long\n messages have been accumulated, splitting the messages\n into smaller chunks, etc.)\n‚ÄúWhat are the quanta for remailers? That is, what are the\n preferred packet sizes for remailed messages?‚Äù\n        \nIn the short term, now, the remailed packet sizes are\n pretty much what they started out to be, e.g, 3-6KB or\n so. Some remailers can pad to quantized levels, e.g.,\n to 5K or 10K or more. The levels have not been settled\n on.\nIn the long term, I suspect much smaller packets will\n be selected. Perhaps at the granularity of ATM packets.\n ‚ÄúATM Remailers‚Äù are likely to be coming. (This changes\n the nature of traffic analyis a bit, as the number of\n remailed packets increases.\nA dissenting argument: ATM networks don‚Äôt give sender\n the control over packets‚Ä¶\nWhatever, I think packets will get smaller, not larger.\n Interesting issues.\n\n\n‚ÄúBased on Hal‚Äôs numbers, I would suggest a reasonable\n quantization for message sizes be a short set of\n geometrically increasing values, namely, 1K, 4K, 16K,\n 64K.  In retrospect, this seems like the obvious\n quantization, and not arithmetic progressions.‚Äù [Eric\n Hughes, 1994-08-29]\n(Eudora chokes at 32K, and so splits messages at about\n 25K, to leave room for comments without further\n splitting.

Since software is by nature never\n secure (can always be taken apart), the issues are\n complicated. The security may be gotten by arranging\n with the remailers in the return path to do certain\n things to certain messages.\n            \nsender sends instructions to remailers on how to\n treat messages of certain types\nthe recipient who is replying cannot deduce the\n identity, because he has no access to the\n instructions the remailers have.\nThink of this as Alice sending to Bob sending to\n Charles‚Ä¶.sending to Zeke.

Miscellaneous Aspects of Remailers\n‚ÄúHow many remailer nodes are actually needed?‚Äù\n    \nWe strive to get as many as possible, to distribute the\n process to many jurisdictions and with many opeators.\nCuriously, as much theoretical diffusivity can occur with\n a single remailer (taking in a hundred messages and\n sending out a hundred, for example) as with many\n remailers. Our intuition is, I think, that many remailers\n offer better diffusivity and better hiding. Why this is\n so (if it is) needs more careful thinking than I‚Äôve seen\n done so far.\nAt a meta-level, we think multiple remailers lessens the\n chance of them being compromised (this, however, is not\n directly related to the diffusivity of a remailer network-\n -important, but not directly related).\n(By the way, a kind of sneaky idea is to try to always\n declare one‚Äôs self to be a remailer. If messages were\n somehow traced back to one‚Äôs own machine, one could\n claim: ‚ÄòYes, I‚Äôm a remailer.‚Äù In principle, one could be\n the only remailer in the universe and still have high\n enough diffusion and confusion. In practice, being the\n only remailer would be pretty dangerous.)\nDiffusion and confusion in remailer networks\n        \nConsider a single node, with a message entering, and\n two messages leaving; this is essentially the smallest\n ‚Äúremailer op‚Äù\n            \nFrom a proof point of view, either outgoing message\n could be the one\nand yet neither one can be proved to be\n\n\nNow imagine those two messages being sent through 10\n remailers‚Ä¶no additional confusion is added‚Ä¶why?\nSo, with 10 messages gong into a chain of 10 remailers,\n if 10 leave‚Ä¶\nThe practical effect of N remailers is to ensure that\n compromise of some fraction of them doesn‚Äôt destroy\n overall security\n\n\n\n\n‚ÄúWhat do remailers do with misaddressed mail?‚Äù\n    \nDepends on the site. Some operators send notes back\n (which itself causes concern), some just discard\n defective mail. This is a fluid area. At least one\n remailer (wimsey) can post error messages to a message\n pool‚Äìthis idea can be generalized to provide ‚Äúdelivery\n receipts‚Äù and other feedback.\nIdeal mixes, a la Chaum, would presumably discard\n improperly-formed mail, although agents might exist to\n prescreen mail (not mandatory agents, of course, but\n voluntarily-selected agents)\nAs in so many areas, legislation is not needed, just\n announcement of policies, choice by customers, and the\n reputation of the remailer.\nA good reason to have robust generation of mail on one‚Äôs\n own machine, so as to minimize such problems.\n\n\n‚ÄúCan the NSA monitor remailers?

Whether they do\n is unknown.\n        \nThere have been several rumors or forgeries claiming\n that NSA is routinely linking anonymous IDs to real IDs\n at the penet remailer.\nCypherpunks remailers are, if used properly, more\n secure in key ways:\n            \nmany of them\nnot used for persistent, assigned IDs\nsupport for encryption: incoming and outgoing\n messages look completely unlike\nbatching, padding, etc. supported\n\n\n\n\nAnd properly run remailers will obscure/diffuse the\n connection between incoming and outgoing messages‚Äìthe\n main point of a remailer!\n\n\nThe use of message pools to report remailer errors\n    \nA good example of how message pools can be used to\n anonymously report things.\n\n‚ÄúThe wimsey remailer has an ingenious method of returning\n error messages anonymously.  Specify a subject in the\n message sent to wimsey that will be meaningful to you,\n but won‚Äôt identify you (like a set of random letters).\n This subject does not appear in the remailed message.\n Then subscribe to the mailing list\nerrors-request@extropia.wimsey.com\nby sending a message with Subject: subscribe.

Legal Issues with Remailers\n 8.9.1. What‚Äôs the legal status of remailers?\n\nThere are no laws against it at this time.\nNo laws saying people have to put return addresses on\n messages, on phone calls (pay phones are still legal), etc.\nAnd the laws pertaining to not having to produce identity\n (the ‚Äúflier‚Äù case, where leaflet distributors did not have\n to produce ID) would seem to apply to this form of\n communication.\nHowever, remailers may come under fire:\n    \nSysops, MIT case\n        \npotentially serious for remailers if the case is\n decided such that the sysop‚Äôs creation of group that\n was conducive to criminal pirating was itself a\n crime‚Ä¶that could make all  involved in remailers\n culpable\n 8.9.2. ‚ÄúCan remailer logs be subpoenaed?‚Äù\n\n\n\n\nCount on it happening, perhaps very soon. The FBI has been\n subpoenaing e-mail archives for a Netcom customer (Lewis De\n Payne), probably because they think the e-mail will lead\n them to the location of uber-hacker Kevin Mitnick. Had the\n parties used remailers, I‚Äôm fairly sure we‚Äôd be seeing\n similar subpoenas for the remailer logs.\nThere‚Äôs no exemption for remailers that I know of!\nThe solutions are obvious, though:\n    \nuse many remailers, to make subpoenaing back through the\n chain very laborious, very expensive, and likely to fail\n (if even one party won‚Äôt cooperate, or is outside the\n court‚Äôs jurisdiction, etc.)\noffshore, multi-jurisdictional remailers (seleted by the\n user)\nno remailer logs kept‚Ä¶destroy them (no law currently\n says anybody has to keep e-mail records!

How will remailers be harassed, attacked, and challenged?\n 8.9.4. ‚ÄúCan pressure be put on remailer operators to reveal traffic\n logs and thereby allow tracing of messages?‚Äù\n\n\nFor human-operated systems which have logs, sure. This is\n why we want several things in remailers:\n    \nno logs of messages\nmany remailers\nmultiple legal jurisdictions, e.g., offshore remailers\n (the more the better)\nhardware implementations which execute instructions\n flawlessly (Chaum‚Äôs digital mix)\n 8.9.5. Calls for limits on anonymity\n\n\nKids and the net will cause many to call for limits on\n nets, on anonymity, etc.\n    \n‚ÄúBut there‚Äôs a dark side to this exciting phenomenon, one\n that‚Äôs too rarely understood by computer novices.\n Because they\n offer instant access to others, and considerable\n anonymity to\n participants, the services make it possible for people -\n especially computer-literate kids - to find themselves in\n unpleasant, sexually explicit social situations‚Ä¶.  And\n I‚Äôve gradually\n come to adopt the view, which will be controversial among\n many online\n users, that the use of nicknames and other forms of\n anonymity\n must be eliminated or severly curbed to force people\n online into\n at least as much accountability for their words and\n actions as\n exists in real social encounters.‚Äù [Walter S. Mossberg,\n Wall Street Journal, 6/30/94, provided by Brad Dolan]\nEli Brandt came up with a good response to this: ‚ÄúThe\n sound-bite response to this: do you want your child‚Äôs\n name, home address, and phone number available to all\n those lurking pedophiles worldwide?  Responsible parents\n encourage their children to use remailers.‚Äù\n\n\nSupreme Court said that identity of handbill distributors\n need not be disclosed, and pseudonyms in general has a long\n and noble tradition\nBBS operators have First Amendment protections (e.g..\n registration requirements would be tossed out, exactly as\n if registration of newspapers were to be attempted)\n 8.9.6. Remailers and Choice of Jurisdictions\nThe intended target of a remailed message, and the subject\n material, may well influence the set of remailers used,\n especially for the very important ‚Äúlast remailer‚Äô (Note: it\n should never be necessary to tell remailers if they are\n first, last, or others, but the last remailer may in fact\n be able to tell he‚Äôs the last‚Ä¶if the message is in\n plaintext to the recipient, with no additional remailer\n commands embedded, for example.)\nA message involving child pornography might have a remailer\n site located in a state like Denmark, where child porn laws\n are less restrictive. And a message critical of Islam might\n not be best sent through a final remailer in Teheran. Eric\n Hughes has dubbed this ‚Äúregulatory arbitrage,‚Äù and to\n various extents it is already common practice.\nOf course, the sender picks the remailer chain, so these\n common sense notions may not be followed. Nothing is\n perfect, and customs will evolve. I can imagine schemes\n developing for choosing customers‚Äìa remailer might not\n accept as a customer certain abusers, based on digital\n pseudonyms < hairy).\n 8.9.7. Possible legal steps to limit the use of remailers and\n   anonymous systems\nhold the remailer liable for content, i.e., no common\n carrier status\ninsert provisions into the various ‚Äúanti-hacking‚Äù laws to\n criminalize anonymous posts\n 8.9.8. Crypto and remailers can be used to protect groups from ‚Äúdeep\n   pockets‚Äù lawsuits\nproducts (esp. software) can be sold ‚Äúas is,‚Äù or with\n contracts backed up by escrow services (code kept in an\n escrow repository, or money kept there to back up\n committments)\njurisdictions, legal and tax, cannot do ‚Äúreach backs‚Äù which\n expose the groups to more than they agreed to\n    \nas is so often the case with corporations in the real\n world, which are taxed and fined for various purposes\n (asbestos, etc.)\n\n\n(For those who panic at the thought of this, the remedy for\n the cautious will be to arrange contracts with the right\n entities‚Ä¶probably paying more for less product.)\n 8.9.9. Could anonymous remailers be used to entrap people, or to\n   gather information for investigations?\nFirst, there are so few current remailers that this is\n unlikely. Julf seems a non-narc type, and he is located in\n Finland. The Cypherpunks remailers are mostly run by folks\n like us, for now.\nHowever, such stings and set-ups have been used in the past\n by narcs and ‚Äúred squads.‚Äù Expect the worse from Mr.\n Policeman. Now that evil hackers are identified as hazards,\n expect moves in this direction. ‚ÄúCryps‚Äù are obviously\n ‚Äúcrack‚Äù dealers.\nBut use of encryption, which CP remailers support (Julf‚Äôs\n does not), makes this essentially moot.\n\n8.10. Cryptanalysis of Remailer Networks\n8.10.1. The Need for More Detailed Analysis of Mixes and Remailers\n\n‚ÄúHave remailer systems been adequately cryptanalyzed?‚Äù\n    \nNot in my opinion, no. Few calculations have been done,\n just mostly some estimates about how much ‚Äúconfusion‚Äù has\n been created by the remailer nodes.\nBut thinking that a lot of complication and messiness\n makes a strong crypto system is a basic mistake‚Ä¶sort of\n like thinking an Enigma rotor machine makes a good cipher\n system, by today‚Äôs standards, just because millions of\n combinations of pathways through the rotor system are\n possible. Not so.\n\n\nDeducing Patterns in Traffic and Deducing Nyms\n    \nThe main lesson of mathematical cryptology has been that\n seemingly random things can actually be shown to have\n structure. This is what cryptanalysis is all about.\nThe same situation applies to ‚Äúseemingly random‚Äù message\n traffic, in digital mixes, telephone networks, etc.\n ‚ÄúCryptanalysis of remailers‚Äù is of course possible,\n depending on the underlying model. (Actually, it‚Äôs always\n possible, it just may not yield anything, as with\n cryptanalysis of ciphers.)\non the time correlation in remailer cryptanalysis\n        \nimagine Alice and Bob communicating through\n remailers‚Ä¶an observer, unable to follow specific\n messages through the remailers, could still notice\n pairwise correlations between messages sent and\n received by these two\nlike time correlations between events, even if the\n intervening path or events are jumbled\n            \ne.g., if within a few hours of every submarine‚Äôs\n departure from Holy Loch a call is placed to Moscow,\n one may make draw certain conclusions about who is a\n Russian spy, regardless of not knowing the\n intermediate paths\nor, closer to home, correlating withdrawals from one\n bank to deposits in another, even if the intervening\n transfers are jumbled\n\n\njust because it seems ‚Äúrandom‚Äù does not mean it is\n            \nScott Collins speculates that a ‚Äúdynamic Markov\n compressor‚Äù could discern or uncover the non-\n randomness in remailer uses\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCryptanalysis of remailers has been woefully lacking. A\n huge fraction of posts about remailer improvements make\n hand-waving arguments about the need for more traffic,\n longer delays, etc. (I‚Äôm not pointing fingers, as I make\n the same informal, qualitative comments, too. What is\n needed is a rigorous analysis of remailer security.)\nWe really don‚Äôt have any good estimates of overall security\n as a function of number of messages circulating, the\n latency ( number of stored messages before resending), the\n number of remailer hops, etc. This is not cryptographically\n ‚Äúexciting‚Äù work, but it‚Äôs still needed. There has not been\n much focus in the academic community on digital mixes or\n remailers, probably because David Chaum‚Äôs 1981 paper on\n ‚ÄúUntraceable E-Mail‚Äù covered most of the theoretically\n interesting material. That, and the lack of commercial\n products or wide usage.\nTime correlations may reveal patterns that individual\n messages lack. That is, repeated communicatin between Alice\n and Bob, even if done through remailers and even if time\n delays/dwell times are built-in, may reveal nonrandom\n correlations in sent/received messages.\n    \nScott Collins speculates that a dynamic Markov compressor\n applied to the traffic would have reveal such\n correlations. (The application of such tests to digital\n cash and other such systems would be useful to look at.)\nAnother often overlooked weakness is that many people\n send test messages to themselves, a point noted by Phil\n Karn: ‚ÄúAnother way that people often let themselves be\n caught is that they inevitably send a test message to\n themselves right before the forged message in question.\n This shows up clearly in the sending system‚Äôs sendmail\n logs. It‚Äôs a point to consider with remailer chains too,\n if you don‚Äôt trust the last machine on the chain.‚Äù [P.K.,\n 1994-09-06]\n\n\nWhat‚Äôs needed:\n    \naggreement on some terminology (this doesn‚Äôt require\n consensus, just a clearly written paper to de facto\n establish the terminology)\na formula relating degree of untraceability to the major\n factors that go into remailers: packet size and\n quantization, latency (# of messages), remailer policies,\n timing, etc.\nAlso, analysis of how deliberate probes or attacks might\n be mounted to deduce remailer patterns (e.g., Fred always\n remails to Josh and Suzy and rarely to Zeke).\n\n\nI think this combinatorial analysis would be a nice little\n monograph for someone to write.\n8.10.2. A much-needed thing. Hal Finney has posted some calculations\n   (circa 1994-08-08), but more work is sorely needed.\n8.10.3. In particular, we should be skeptical of hand-waving analyses\n   of the ‚Äúit sure looks complicated to follow the traffic‚Äù\n   sort. People think that by adding ‚Äúmessy‚Äù tricks, such as\n   MIRVing messages, that security is increased. Maybe it is,\n   maybe it isn‚Äôt. But it needs formal analysis before claims\n   can be confidantly believed.\n8.10.4. Remailers and entropy\nWhat‚Äôs the measure of ‚Äúmixing‚Äù that goes on in a mix, or\n remailer?\nHand=waving about entropy and reordering may not be too\n useful.\nGoing back to Shannon‚Äôs concept of entropy as measuring the\n degree of uncertainty‚Ä¶\n    \ntrying to ‚Äúguess‚Äù or ‚Äúpredict‚Äô where a message leaving\n one node will exit the system\n        \nnot having clear entrance and exit points adds to the\n difficulty, somewhat analogously to having a password\n of unknown length (an attacker can‚Äôt just try all 10-\n character passwords, as he has no idea of the length)\nthe advantages of every node being a remailer, of\n having no clearly identified sources and sinks\n\n\n\n\nThis predictability may depend on a series of messages\n sent between Alice and Bob‚Ä¶how?\n    \nit seems there may be links to Persi Diaconis‚Äô work on\n ‚Äúperfect shuffles‚Äù (a problem which seemed easy, but\n which eluded solving until recently‚Ä¶should give us\n comfort that our inability to tackle the real meat of\n this issue is not too surprising\n8.10.5. Scott Collins believes that remailer networks can be\n cryptanalyzed roughly the same way as pseudorandom number\n generators are analyzed, e.g., with dynamic Markov\n compressors (DNCs). (I‚Äôm more skeptical: if each remailer is\n using an information-theoretically secure RNG to reorder the\n messages, and if all messages are the same size and (of\n course) are encypted with information-theoretically secure\n (OTP) ciphers, then it seems to me that the remailing would\n itself be information-theoretically secure.)\n\n\n\n8.11.

SUMMARY: Policy: Clipper,Key Escrow, and Digital Telephony\n 9.2.1. Main Points\n\nClipper has been a main unifying force, as 80% of all\n Americans, and 95% of all computer types, are opposed.\n‚ÄúBig Brother Inside‚Äù\n 9.2.2. Connections to Other Sections\nthe main connections are legal\nsome possible implications for limits on crypto\n 9.2.3. Where to Find Additional Information\nThere have been hundreds of articles on Clipper, in nearly\n all popular magazines. Many of these were sent to the\n Cypherpunks  list and may be available in the archives. (I\n have at least 80 MB of Cypherpunks list stuff, a lot of it\n newspaper and magazine articles on Clipper!)\nmore Clipper information can be found at:\n    \n‚ÄúA good source is the Wired Online Clipper Archive.

Miscellaneous Comments\n\n\nAs with a couple of other sections, I won‚Äôt try to be as\n complete as some might desire. Just too many thousands of\n pages of stuff to consider.\n\n9.3. Introduction\n 9.3.1. What is Clipper?\n\ngovernment holds the skeleton keys\nanalogies to other systems\n 9.3.2. Why do most Cypherpunks oppose Clipper?\nfear of restrictions on crypto, derailing so many wonderful\n possibilities\n 9.3.3. Why does Clipper rate its own section?\nThe announcement of the ‚ÄúEscrowed Encryption Standard,‚Äù\n EES, on April 16, 1993, was a galvanizing event for\n Cypherpunks and for a large segment of the U. S.\n population. The EES was announced originally as ‚ÄúClipper,‚Äù\n despite the use of the name Clipper by two major products\n (the Intergraph CPU and a dBase software tool), and the\n government backed off on the name. Too late, though, as the\n name ‚ÄúClipper‚Äù had become indelibly linked to this whole\n proposal.\n 9.3.4. ‚ÄúIs stopping Clipper the main goal of Cypherpunks?‚Äù\nIt certainly seems so at times, as Clipper has dominated\n the topics since the Clipper announcement in April, 1993.\nit has become so, with monkeywrenching efforts in several\n areas\n    \nlobbying and education against it (though informal, such\n lobbying has been successful‚Ä¶look at NYT article)\n‚ÄúBig Brother Inside‚Äù and t-shirts\ntechnical monkeywrenching (Matt Blaze‚Ä¶hesitate to claim\n any credit, but he has been on our list, attended a\n meeting, etc.)\n\n\nAlthough it may seem so, Clipper is just one\n aspect‚Ä¶step‚Ä¶initiative.\nDeveloping new software tools, writing code, deploying\n remailers and digital cash are long-range projects of great\n importance.\nThe Clipper key escrow proposal came along (4-93) at an\n opportune time for Cypherpunks and became a major focus.\n Emergency meetings, analyses, etc.\n\n9.4. Crypto Policy Issues\n 9.4.1. Peter Denning on crypto policy:\n\nprovided by Pat Farrell, 1994-08-20; Denning comments are\n 1992-01-22, presented at Computers, Freedom, and Privacy 2.\n Peter D. uses the metaphor of a ‚Äúclearing,‚Äùas in a forest,\n for the place where people meet to trade, interact, etc.\n What others call markets, agoras, or just ‚Äúcyberspace.‚Äù\n    \n‚ÄúInformation technology in producing a clearing in which\n individuals and corporations are key players besides\n government. Any attempt by government to control the flow\n of information over networks will be ignored or met with\n outright hostility.  There is no practical way that\n government can control information except information\n directly involved in the business of governing.  It\n should not try.‚Äù [Peter Denning, PUBLIC POLICY FOR THE\n 21ST CENTURY, DRAFT 1/22/92]\n\n\nNo word on how this view squares with his wife‚Äôs control\n freak views.\n 9.4.2. Will government and NSA in particular attempt to acquire some\n   kind of control over crypto companies?\nspeculations, apparently unfounded, that RSA Data Security\n is influenced by NSA wishes\n    \nweaknesses in the DES keys picked?\n\n\nand companies may be dramatically influenced by contracts\n (and the witholding of them)\n 9.4.3.

Motivations for Crypto Laws\n 9.5.1. ‚ÄúWhat are the law enforcement and FBI worries?‚Äù\n\n\n‚ÄúFBI Director Louis Freeh is worried. The bad guys are\n beginning to see the light, and it is digital. ‚Ä¶ Freeh\n fears some pretty nasty folks have discovered they can\n commit highway robbery and more, without even leaving home.\n Worse, to Freeh and other top cops, by using some pretty\n basic technologies, savvy criminals can do their crimes\n without worrying about doing time.\n‚ÄúSome crooks, spies, drug traffickers, terrorists and\n frauds already use the tools of the information age to\n outfox law enforcement officers. Hackers use PBXs to hide\n their tracks as they rip off phone companies and poke\n around in other people‚Äôs files. Reprogrammed cellular\n phones give cops fits.‚Äù [LAN Magazine,‚ÄùIs it 1984?,‚Äù by Ted\n Bunker, August 1994]\n\nTheir fears have some validity‚Ä¶in the same way that the\n rulers in Gutenberg‚Äôs time could have some concerns about\n the implications of books (breaking of guilds, spread of\n national secrets, pornography, atheism, etc.).\n 9.5.2. ‚ÄúWhat motivated Clipper? What did the Feds hope to gain?‚Äù\nostensibly to stop terrorists (only the unsophisticated\n ones, if alternatives are allowed)\nto force a standard on average Americans\npossibly to limit crypto development\nPhil Karn provides an interesting motivation for Clipper:\n ‚ÄúKey escrow exists only because the NSA doesn‚Äôt want to\n risk blame if some terrorist or drug dealer were to use an\n unescrowed NSA-produced ‚Ä¶..The fact that a terrorist or\n drug dealer can easily go elsewhere and obtain other strong\n or stronger algorithms without key escrow is irrelevant.\n The NSA simply doesn‚Äôt care as long as they can‚Äôt be\n blamed for whatever happens. Classic CYA, nothing\n more‚Ä¶..A similar analysis applies to the export control\n regulations regarding cryptography.‚Äù [Phil Karn, 1994-08-\n 31]\n    \nBill Sommerfeld notes: ‚ÄúIf this is indeed the case, Matt\n Blaze‚Äôs results should be particularly devastating to\n them.‚Äù [B.S., 1994-09-01]\n 9.5.3. Steve Witham has an interesting take on why folks like\n Dorothy Denning and Donn Parker support key escrow so\n ardently:\n\n\n\n‚ÄúMaybe people like Dot and Don think of government as a\n systems-administration sort of job.  So here they are,\n security experts advising the sys admins on things like‚Ä¶\nsetting permissions\n allocating quotas\n registering users and giving them passwords‚Ä¶..\n deciding what utilities are and aren‚Äôt available\n deciding what software the users need, and installing it\n          (grudgingly, based on who‚Äôs yelling the loudest)\n setting up connections to other machines\n deciding who‚Äôs allowed to log in from ‚Äúforeign hosts‚Äù\n getting mail set up and running\n buying new hardware from vendors\n specifying the hardware to the vendors\n ‚Ä¶\n‚ÄúThese are the things computer security experts advise on.\n Maybe hammer experts see things as nails.\n‚ÄúOnly a country is not a host system owned and administered\n by the government, and citizens are not guests or users.‚Äù\n [Steve Witham, Government by Sysadmin, 1994-03-23]\n\n\n9.5.4. Who would want to use key escrow?\n 9.5.5. ‚ÄúWill strong crypto really thwart government plans?‚Äù\n\nYes, it will give citizens the basic capabilities that\n foreign governments have had for many years\nDespite talk about codebreakes and the expertise of the\n NSA, the plain fact is that no major Soviet ciphers have\n been broken for many years\n    \nrecall the comment that NSA has not really broken any\n Soviet systems in many years\n        \nexcept for the cases, a la the Walker case, where\n plaintext versions are gotten, i.e., where human\n screwups occurred\n\n\n\n\nthe image in so many novels of massive computers breaking\n codes is absurd: modern ciphers will not be broken (but the\n primitive ciphers used by so many Third World nations and\n their embassies will continue to be child‚Äôs play, even for\n high school science fair projects‚Ä¶could be a good idea\n for a small scene, about a BCC student who has his project\n pulled)\n 9.5.6. ‚ÄúWhy does the government want short keys?‚Äù\nCommercial products have often been broken by hackers. The\n NSA actually has a charter to help businesses protect their\n secrets; just not so strongly that the crypto is\n unbreakable by them. (This of course has been part of the\n tension between the two sides of the NSA for the past\n couple of decades.)\nSo why does the government want crippled key lengths?\n    \n‚ÄúThe question is: how do you thwart hackers while\n permitting NSA access? The obvious answer is strong\n algorithm(s) and relatively truncated keys.‚Äù [Grady Ward,\n sci.crypt, 1994-08-15]\n\n\n\n9.6. Current Crypto Laws\n 9.6.1. ‚ÄúHas crypto been restricted in countries other than the\n   U.S.?‚Äù\n\nMany countries have restrictions on civilian/private use of\n crypto. Some even insist that corporations either send all\n transmissions in the clear, or that keys be provided to the\n government. The Phillipines, for example. And certainly\n regimes in the Communists Bloc, or what‚Äôs left of it, will\n likely have various laws restricting crypto. Possibly\n draconian laws‚Ä¶.in many cultures, use of crypto is\n tantamount to espionage.\n\n9.7. Crypto Laws Outside the U.S.\n 9.7.1. ‚ÄúInternational Escrow, and Other Nation‚Äôs Crypto Policies?‚Äù\n\nThe focus throughout this document on U.S. policy should\n not lull non-Americans into complacency. Many nations\n already have more Draconian policies on the private use of\n encryption than the U.S. is even contemplating\n (publically). France outlaws private crypto, though\n enforcement is said to be problematic (but I would not want\n the DGSE to be on my tail, that‚Äôs for sure). Third World\n countries often have bans on crypto, and mere possession of\n random-looking bits may mean a spying conviction and a trip\n to the gallows.\nThere are also several reports that European nations are\n preparing to fall in line behind the U.S. on key escrow\n    \nNorway\nNetherlands\nBritain\n\n\nA conference in D.C. in 6/94, attended by Whit Diffie (and\n reported on to us at the 6/94 CP meeting) had internation\n escrow arrangements as a topic, with the crypto policy\n makers of NIST and NSA describing various options\n    \nbad news, because it could allow bilateral treaties to\n supercede basic rights\ncould be plan for getting key escrow made mandatory\nthere are also practical issues\n        \nwho can decode international communications?\n            \ndo we really want the French reading Intel‚Äôs\n communications?

Lots of evidence of compliance.\n 9.7.3. ‚ÄúIs Europe Considering Key Escrow?‚Äù\nYes, in spades. Lots of signs of this, with reports coming\n in from residents of Europe and elsewhere. The Europeans\n tend to be a bit more quiet in matters of public policy (at\n least in some areas).\n\n‚ÄúThe current issue of `Communications Week International‚Äô\n informs us that the European Union‚Äôs Senior Officials Group\n for Security of Information Systems has been considering\n plans for standardising key escrow in Europe.\n‚ÄúAgreement had been held up by arguments over who should\n hold the keys. France and Holland wanted to follow the\n NSA‚Äôs lead and have national governments assume this role;\n other players wanted user organisations to do this.‚Äù [\n rja14@cl.cam.ac.uk (Ross Anderson), sci.crypt, Key Escrow\n in Europe too, 1994-06-29]\n 9.7.4. ‚ÄúWhat laws do various countries have on encryption and the\n   use of encryption for international traffic?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúHas France really banned encryption?‚Äù\n    \nThere are recurring reports that France does not allow\n unfettered use of encryption.\nHard to say.

PTTs, local rules about modem use\n 9.7.7. ‚ÄúWhat are the European laws on ‚ÄúData Privacy‚Äù and why are\n   they such a terrible idea?‚Äù\nVarious European countries have passed laws about the\n compiling of computerized records on people without their\n explicit permission. This applies to nearly all\n computerized records‚Äìmailing lists, dossiers, credit\n records, employee files, etc.‚Äìthough some exceptions exist\n and, in general, companies can find ways to compile records\n and remain within the law.\nThe rules are open to debate, and the casual individual who\n cannot afford lawyers and advisors, is likely to be\n breaking the laws repeatedly. For example, storing the\n posts of people on the Cypherpunks list in any system\n retrievable by name would violate Britain‚Äôs Data Privacy\n laws. That almost no such case would ever result in a\n prosecution (for practical reasons) does not mean the laws\n are acceptable.\nTo many, these laws are a ‚Äúgood idea.‚Äù But the laws miss\n the main point, give a false sense of security (as the real\n dossier-compilers are easily able to obtain exemptions, or\n are government agencies themselves), and interfere in what\n people do with information that properly and legally comes\n there way. (Be on the alert for ‚Äúcivil rights‚Äù groups like\n the ACLU and EFF to push for such data privacy laws. The\n irony of Kapor‚Äôs connection to Lotus and the failed\n ‚ÄúMarketplace‚Äù CD-ROM product cannot be ignored.)\nCreating a law which bans the keeping of certain kinds of\n records is an invitation to having ‚Äúdata inspectors‚Äù\n rummaging through one‚Äôs files. Or some kind of spot checks,\n or even software key escrow.\n(Strong crypto makes these laws tough to enforce. Either\n the laws go, or the counties with such laws will then have\n to limit strong crypto‚Ä¶.not that that will help in the\n long run.)\nThe same points apply to well-meaning proposals to make\n employer monitoring of employees illegal. It sounds like a\n privacy-enhancing idea, but it tramples upon the rights of\n the employer to ensure that work is being done, to\n basically run his business as he sees fit, etc. If I hire a\n programmer and he‚Äôs using my resources, my network\n connections, to run an illegal operation, he exposes my\n company to damages, and of course he isn‚Äôt doing the job I\n paid him to do. If the law forbids me to monitor this\n situation, or at least to randomly check, then he can\n exploit this law to his advantage and to my disadvantage.\n (Again, the dangers of rigid laws, nonmarket\n solutions,(lied game theory.)\n 9.7.8. on the situation in Australia\nMatthew Gream [M.Gream@uts.edu.au] informed us that the\n export situation in Oz is just as best as in the U.S. [1994-\n 09-06] (as if we didn‚Äôt know‚Ä¶much as we all like to dump\n on Amerika for its fascist laws, it‚Äôs clear that nearly all\n countries are taking their New World Order Marching Orders\n from the U.S., and that many of them have even more\n repressive crypto laws alredy in place‚Ä¶they just don‚Äôt\n get the discussion the U.S. gets, for apparent reasons)\n    \n‚ÄúWell, fuck that for thinking I was living under a less\n restrictive regime ‚Äì and I can say goodbye to an\n international market for my software.]\n(I left his blunt language as is, for impact.)\n 9.7.9. ‚ÄúFor those interested, NIST have a short document for FTP,\n ‚ÄòIdentification & Analysis of Foreign Laws & Regulations\n Pertaining to the Use of Commercial Encryption Products for\n Voice & Data Communications‚Äô.

Digital Telephony\n 9.8.1. ‚ÄúWhat is Digital Telephony?‚Äù\n\nThe Digital Telephony Bill, first proposed under Bush and\n again by Clinton, is in many ways much worse than Clipper.\n It has gotten less attention, for various reasons.\nFor one thing,  it is seen as an extension by some of\n existing wiretap capabilities. And, it is fairly abstract,\n happening behind the doors of telephone company switches.\nThe implications are severe: mandatory wiretap and pen\n register (who is calling whom) capaibilities, civil\n penalties of up to $10,000 a day for insufficient\n compliance, mandatory assistance must be provided, etc.\nIf it is passed, it could dictate future technology. Telcos\n who install it will make sure that upstart technologies\n (e.g., Cypherpunks who find ways to ship voice over\n computer lines) are also forced to ‚Äúplay by the same\n rules.‚Äù Being required to install government-accessible tap\n points even in small systems would of course effectively\n destroy them.\nOn the other hand, it is getting harder and harder to make\n Digital Telephony workable, even by mandate. As Jim\n Kallstrom of the FBI puts it:  ‚Äú‚ÄúToday will be the cheapest\n day on which Congress could fix this thing,‚Äù Kallstrom\n said. ‚ÄúTwo years from now, it will be geometrically more\n expensive.‚Äù‚Äù  [LAN Magazine,‚ÄùIs it 1984?,‚Äù by Ted Bunker,\n August 1994]\nThis gives us a goal to shoot for: sabotage the latest\n attempt to get Digital Telephony passed into law and it may\n make it too intractable to ever be passed.\n‚ÄúToday will be the cheapest day on which\n    \nCongress could fix this thing,‚Äù Kallstrom said. ‚ÄúTwo\n years from now,\nit will be geometrically more expensive.‚Äù\n\n\nThe message is clear: delay Digital Telephony. Sabotage it\n in the court of public opinion, spread the word, make it\n flop. (Reread your ‚ÄúArt of War‚Äù for Sun Tsu‚Äôs tips on\n fighting your enemy.)\n  -\n 9.8.2. ‚ÄúWhat are the dangers of the Digital Telephony Bill?‚Äù\nIt makes wiretapping invisible to the tappee.\nIf passed into law, it makes central office wiretapping\n trivial, automatic.\n    \n‚ÄúWhat should worry people is what isn‚Äôt in the news (and\n probably never will until it‚Äôs already embedded in comm\n systems). A true ‚ÄòClipper‚Äô will allow remote tapping on\n demand. This is very easily done to all-digital\n communications systems.

If real secure encryption makes it\n into mass market communications products, Clipper will\n have failed.  The whole point is not to get a few\n Clippers used by cops; the point is to make it a\n worldwide standard, rather than having 3-key triple-DES\n with RSA and Diffie-Hellman become the worldwide\n standard.\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôd have decent encryption in digital cellular phones\n now, except for the active intervention of Jerry\n Rainville of NSA, who `hosted‚Äô a meeting of the standards\n committee inside Ft. Meade, lied to them about export\n control to keep committee documents limited to a small\n group, and got a willing dupe from Motorola, Louis\n Finkelstein, to propose an encryption scheme a child\n could break.  The IS-54 standard for digital cellular\n doesn‚Äôt describe the encryption scheme ‚Äì it‚Äôs described\n in a separate document, which ordinary people can‚Äôt get,\n even though it‚Äôs part of the official accredited\n standard.  (Guess who accredits standards bodies though -\n\nthat‚Äôs right, the once pure NIST.)\n\n‚ÄúThe reason it‚Äôs secret is because it‚Äôs so obviously\n weak.  The system generates a 160-bit ‚Äúkey‚Äù and then\n simply XORs it against each block of the compressed\n speech.  Take any ten or twenty blocks and recover the\n key by XORing frequent speech patterns (like silence, or\n the letter ‚ÄúA‚Äù) against pieces of the blocks to produce\n guesses at the key.  You try each guess on a few blocks,\n and the likelihood of producing something that decodes\n like speech in all the blocks is small enough that you‚Äôll\n know when your guess is the real key.\n‚ÄúNSA is continuing to muck around in the Digital Cellular\n standards committee (TR 45.3) this year too.  I encourage\n anyone who‚Äôs interested to join the committee, perhaps as\n an observer.  Contact the Telecommunications Industry\n Association in DC and sign up.  Like any standards\n committee, it‚Äôs open to the public and meets in various\n places around the country.  I‚Äôll lend you a lawyer if\n you‚Äôre a foreign national, since the committee may still\n believe that they must exclude foreign nationals from\n public discussions of cryptography.

SUMMARY: Legal Issues\n10.2.1. Main Points\n10.2.2. Connections to Other Sections\n\nSad to say, but legal considerations impinge on nearly\n every aspect of crypto\n10.2.3. Where to Find Additional Information\n10.2.4. Miscellaneous Comments\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm a scientist, Jim, not an attorney.‚Äù Hence, take my\n legal comments here with a grain of salt, representing only\n hints of the truth as I picked them up from the discussions\n on the various forums and lists.\n\n10.3. Basic Legality of Encryption\n10.3.1. ‚ÄúIs this stuff legal or illegal?‚Äù\n\nCertainly the talking about it is mostly legal, at least\n in the U.S. and at the time of this writing. In other\n countries, you prison term may vary.\nThe actions resulting from crypto, and crypto anarchy, may\n well be illegal. Such is often the case when technology is\n applied without any particular regard for what the laws say\n is permitted. (Pandora‚Äôs Box and all that.)\n    \nCypherpunks really don‚Äôt care much about such ephemera as\n the ‚Äúlaws‚Äù of some geographic region. Cypherpunks make\n their own laws.\n\n\nThere are two broad ways of getting things done:\n    \nFirst, looking at the law and regulations and finding\n ways to exploit them. This is the tack favored by\n lawyers, of whic$are many in this country.\nSecond, ‚Äújust do it.‚Äù In areas where the law hasn‚Äôt\n caught up, this can mean unconstrained technological\n developement. Good examples are the computer and chip\n business, where issues of legality rarely arose (except\n in the usual areas of contract enforcement, etc.). More\n recently the chip business has discovered lawyering, with\n a vengeance.\nIn other areas, where the law is centrally involved,\n ‚Äújust do it‚Äù can mean many technical violations of the\n law. Examples: personal service jobs (maids and\n babysitters), contracting jobs without licenses,\n permissions, etc., and so on. Often these are ‚Äúillegal\n markets,‚Äù putatively.\n\n\nAnd bear in mind that the legal system can be used to\n hassle people, to pressure them to ‚Äúplead out‚Äù to some\n charges, to back off, etc. (In the firearms business, the\n pressures and threats are also used to cause some\n manufacturers, like Ruger, to back off on a radical pro-gun\n stance, so as to be granted favors and milder treatment.\n Pressure on crypto-producing companies are probably very\n similar. Play ball, or we‚Äôll run you over in the parking\n lot.)\n10.3.2. ‚ÄúWhy is the legal status of crypto so murky?‚Äù\nFirst, it may be murkier to me than it it to actual lawyers\n like Mike Godwin and Michael Froomkin, both of whom have\n been on our list at times. (Though my impression from\n talking to Godwin is that many or even most of these issues\n have not been addressed in the courts, let alone resolved\n definitively.)\nSecond, crypto issues have not generally reached the\n courts, reflecting the nascent status of most of the things\n talked about it here. Things as ‚Äútrivial‚Äù as digital\n signatures and digital timestamping have yet to be\n challenged in courts, or declared illegal, or anything\n similar that might produce a precedent-setting ruling. (Stu\n Haber agrees that such tests are lacking.)\nFinally, the issues are deep ones, going to the heart of\n issues of self-incrimination (disclosure of keys,\n contempt), of intellectual property and export laws (want\n to jail someone for talking about prime numbers?), and the\n incredibly byzantine world of money and financial\n instruments.\nA legal study of crypto‚Äìwhich I hear Professor Froomkin is\n doing‚Äìcould be very important.\n10.3.3. ‚ÄúHas the basic legality of crypto and laws about crypto been\n   tested?‚Äù\nAs usual, a U.S. focus here. I know little of the situation\n in non-U.S. countries (and in many of them the law is\n whatever the rulers say it is).\nAnd I‚Äôm not a lawyer.\nSome facts:\n    \nno direct Constitutional statement about privacy (though\n many feel it is implied)\ncrypto was not a major issue (espionage was, and was\n dealt with harshly, but encrypting things was not a\n problem per se)\nonly in the recent past has it become important‚Ä¶and it\n will become much more so\n        \nas criminals encrypt, as terrorists encrypt\nas tax is avoided via the techniques described here\ncollusion of business (‚Äúcrypto interlocking\n directorates,‚Äù price signalling)\nblack markets, information markets\n\n\n\n\nLawrence Tribe..new amendment\n    \nscary, as it may place limits‚Ä¶. (but unlikely to\n happen)\n\n\nCrypto in Court\n    \nmostly untested\ncan keys be compelled?\nExpect some important cases in the next several years\n10.3.4. ‚ÄúCan authorities force the disclosure of a key?‚Äù\n\n\nMike Godwin, legal counsel for the EFF, has been asked this\n queston many times:\n    \n‚ÄúNote that a court could cite you for contempt for not\n complying with a subpoena duces tecum (a subpoena\n requiring you to produce objects or documents) if you\n fail to turn over subpoenaed backups‚Ä¶.To be honest, I\n don‚Äôt think any security measure is adequate against a\n government that‚Äôs determined to overreach its authority\n and its citizens‚Äô rights, but crypto comes close.‚Äù [Mike\n Godwin, 1993-06-14]\n\n\nTorture is out (in many countries, but not all). Truth\n serum, etc., ditto.\n    \n‚ÄúRubber hose cryptography‚Äù\n\n\nConstitutional issues\n    \nself-incrimination\n\n\non the ‚ÄúYes‚Äù side:\n    \nis same, some say,  as forcing combination to a safe\n containing information or stolen goods\n        \nbut some say-and a court may have ruled on this-that\n the safe can always be cut open and so the issue is\n mostly moot\nwhile forcing key disclosure is compelled testimony\n\n\nand one can always claim to have forgotten the key\ni.e., what happens when a suspect simply clams up?\nbut authorities can routinely demand cooperation in\n investigations, can seize records, etc.\n\n\non the ‚ÄúNo‚Äù side:\n    \ncan‚Äôt force a suspect to talk, whether about where he hid\n the loot or where his kidnap victim is hidden\npractically speaking, someone under indictment cannot be\n forced to reveal Swiss bank accounts‚Ä¶.this would seem\n to be directly analogous to a cryptographic key\nthus, the key to open an account would seem to be the\n same thing\na memorized key cannot be forced, says someone with EFF\n or CPSR\n\n\n‚ÄúSafe‚Äù analogy\n    \nYou have a safe, you won‚Äô tell the combination\n        \nyou just refuse\nyou claim to have forgotten it\nyou really don‚Äôt know it\n\n\ncops can cut the safe open, so compelling a combination\n is not needed\n‚Äúinterefering with an investigation‚Äù\n\n\non balance, it seems clear that the disclosure of\n cryptographic keys cannot be forced (though the practical\n penalty for nondisclosure could be severe)\nCourts\n    \ncompelled testimony is certainly common\n        \nif one is not charged, one cannot take the 5th (may be\n some wrinkles here)\ncontempt\n\n\n\n\nWhat won‚Äôt immunize disclosure:\n    \nclever jokes about ‚ÄúI am guilty of money laundering‚Äù\n        \ncan it be used?\ndoes judge declaring immunity apply in this case?\nEric Hughes has pointed out that the form of the\n statement is key: ‚ÄúMy key is: ‚ÄúI am a murderer.‚Äù‚Äù is\n not a legal admission of anything.\n\n\n(There may be some subtleties where the key does contain\n important evidence‚Äìperhaps the location of a buried body-\n -but I think these issues are relatively minor.)\n\n\nbut this has not really been tested, so far as I know\nand many people say that such cooperation can be\n demanded‚Ä¶\nContempt, claims of forgetting\n10.3.5. Forgetting passwords, and testimony\nThis is another area of intense speculation:\n    \n‚ÄúI forgot. So sue me.‚Äù\n‚ÄúI forgot. It was just a temporary file I was working on,\n and I just can‚Äôt remember the password I picked.‚Äù (A less\n in-your-face approach.)\n‚ÄúI refuse to give my password on the grounds that it may\n tend to incriminate me.‚Äù\n        \nCanonical example: ‚ÄúMy password is: ‚ÄòI sell illegal\n drugs.‚Äô‚Äù\n            \nEric Hughes has pointed out this is not a real\n admission of guilt, just a syntactic form, so it is\n nonsense to claim that it is incriminating. I agree.\n I don‚Äôt know if any court tests have confirmed this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSandy Sandfort theorizes that this example might work, or\n at least lead to an interesting legal dilemma:\n    \n\n‚ÄúAs an example, your passphrase could be:\n     I shot a cop in the back and buried his body  under\n     the porch at 123 Main St., anywhere USA.  The gun  is\n     wrapped in an oily cloth in my mother's attic.\n \n‚ÄúI decline to answer on the grounds that my passphrase is\n a statement which may tend to incriminate me.  I will\n only give my passphrase if I am given immunity from\n prosecution for the actions to which it alludes.‚Äù\n‚ÄúToo cute, I know, but who knows, it might work.‚Äù [S.S.,\n 1994-0727]\n10.3.6. ‚ÄúWhat about disavowal of keys? Of digital signatures? Of\n contracts?\n\n\n\nIn the short term, the courts are relatively silent, as few\n of these issues have reached the courts. Things like\n signatures and contract breaches would likely be handled as\n they currently are (that is, the judge would look at the\n circumstances, etc.)\nClearly this is a major concern. There are two main avenues\n of dealing with this‚Äù\n    \nThe ‚Äúpurist‚Äù approach. You are your key. Caveat emptor.\n Guard your keys. If your signature is used, you are\n responsible. (People can lessen their exposure by using\n protocols that limit risk, analogous to the way ATM\n systems only allow, say, $200 a day to be withdrawn.)\nThe legal system can be used (maybe) to deal with these\n issues. Maybe. Little of this has been tested in courts.\n Conventional methods of verifying forged signatures will\n not work. Contract law with digital signatures will be a\n new area.\n\n\nThe problem of repudiation or disavowal was recognized\n early on in cryptologic circles. Alice is confronted with a\n digital signature, or whatever. She says; ‚ÄúBut I didn‚Äôt\n sign that‚Äù or ‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs my old key‚Äìit‚Äôs obsolete‚Äù or ‚ÄúMy\n sysadmin must have snooped through my files,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI guess\n those key escrow guys are at it again.‚Äù\nI think that only the purist stance will hold water in the\n long run.(A hint of this: untraceable cash means, for most\n transactions of interest with digital cash, that once the\n crypto stuff has been handled, whether the sig was stolen\n or not is moot, because the money is gone‚Ä¶no court can\n rule that the sig was invalid and then retrieve the cash!)\n10.3.7. ‚ÄúWhat are some arguments for the freedom to encrypt?‚Äù\nbans are hard to enforce, requiring extensive police\n intrusions\nprivate letters, diaries, conversations\nin U.S., various provisions\nanonymity is often needed\n10.3.8. Restrictions on anonymity\n‚Äúidentity escrow‚Äù is what Eric Hughes calls it\nlinits on mail drops, on anonymous accounts, and‚Äìperhaps\n ultimately‚Äìon cash purchases of any and all goods\n10.3.9. ‚ÄúAre bulletin boards and Internet providers ‚Äúcommon carriers‚Äù\n   or not?‚Äù\nNot clear. BBS operators are clearly held more liable for\n content than the phone company is, for example.\n10.3.10. Too much cleverness is passing for law\nMany schemes to bypass tax laws, regulations, etc., are, as\n the British like to say, ‚Äútoo cute by half.‚Äù For example,\n claims that the dollar is defined as 1/35th of an ounce of\n gold and that the modern dollar is only 1/10th of this. Or\n that Ohio failed to properly enter the Union, and hence all\n laws passed afterward are invalid. The same could be said\n of schemes to deploy digital cash be claiming that ordinary\n laws do not apply. Well, those who try such schemes often\n find out otherwise, sometimes in prison. Tread carefully.\n10.3.11. ‚ÄúIs it legal to advocate the overthrow of governments or the\n   breaking of laws?‚Äù\nAlthough many Cypherpunks are not radicals, many others of\n us are, and we often advocate ‚Äúcollapse of governments‚Äù and\n other such things as money laundering schemes, tax evasion,\n new methods for espionage, information markets, data\n havens, etc. This rasises obvious concerns about legality.\nFirst off, I have to speak mainly of U.S. issues‚Ä¶the laws\n of Russia or Japan or whatever may be completely different.\n Sorry for the U.S.-centric focus of this FAQ, but that‚Äôs\n the way it is. The Net started here, and still is\n dominantly here, and the laws of the U.S. are being\n propagated around the world as part of the New World Order\n and the collapse of the other superpower.\nIs it legal to advocate the replacement of a government? In\n the U.S., it‚Äôs the basic political process (though cynics\n might argue that both parties represent the same governing\n philosophy). Advocating the violent overthrow of the U.S.\n government is apparently illegal, though I lack a cite on\n this.\nIs it legal to advocate illegal acts in general? Certainly\n much of free speech is precisely this: arguing for drug\n use, for boycotts, etc.\n    \nThe EFF gopher site has this on ‚ÄúAdvocating Lawbreaking,\n Brandenburg v. Ohio. ‚Äú:\n        \n‚ÄúIn the 1969 case of Brandenburg v. Ohio, the Supreme\n Court struck down the conviction of a Ku Klux Klan\n member under a criminal syndicalism law and established\n a new standard: Speech may not be suppressed or\n punished unless it is intended to produce ‚Äòimminent\n lawless action‚Äô and it is ‚Äòlikely to produce such\n action.‚Äô Otherwise, the First Amendment protects even\n speech that advocates violence.

Here is a graphic one from Sandy\n Sandfort:\n    \n\n‚ÄúRemember the instructions for cooking a live frog.  The\n government does not intend to stop until they have\n effectively eliminated your privacy.\nSTEP 1:  Clipper becomes the de facto encryption\n standard.\nSTEP 2:  When Cypherpunks and other ‚Äúcriminals‚Äù eschew\n Clipper in favor of trusted strong crypto, the government\n is ‚Äúforced‚Äù to ban non-escrowed encryption systems.\n (Gotta catch those pedophiles, drug dealers and\n terrorists, after all.)\nSTEP 3:  When Cypherpunks and other criminals use\n superencryption with Clipper or spoof LEAFs, the\n government will regretably be forced to engage in random\n message monitoring to detect these illegal techniques.\nEach of these steps will be taken because we wouldn‚Äôt\n passively accept such things as unrestricted wiretaps and\n reasonable precautions like\n digital telephony.  It will portrayed as our fault.\n Count on it.‚Äù [Sandy Sandfort, 6-14-94]\n\n\n\n\n10.4.6. Can the flow of bits be stopped?

The MIT 2.6 negotiations seem to have\n buried all such rancor. At least officially. I hear there‚Äôs\n still animosity, but it‚Äôs no longer at the surface. (And\n RSADSI is now facing lawsuits and patent suits.)\n\n10.6. Legal Issues with Remailers\n 8.9.1. What‚Äôs the legal status of remailers?\n\nThere are no laws against it at this time.\nNo laws saying people have to put return addresses on\n messages, on phone calls (pay phones are still legal), etc.\nAnd the laws pertaining to not having to produce identity\n (the ‚Äúflier‚Äù case, where leaflet distributors did not have\n to produce ID) would seem to apply to this form of\n communication.\nHowever, remailers may come under fire:\n    \nSysops, MIT case\n        \npotentially serious for remailers if the case is\n decided such that the sysop‚Äôs creation of group that\n was conducive to criminal pirating was itself a\n crime‚Ä¶that could make all  involved in remailers\n culpable\n 8.9.2. ‚ÄúCan remailer logs be subpoenaed?‚Äù\n\n\n\n\nCount on it happening, perhaps very soon. The FBI has been\n subpoenaing e-mail archives for a Netcom customer (Lewis De\n Payne), probably because they think the e-mail will lead\n them to the location of uber-hacker Kevin Mitnick. Had the\n parties used remailers, I‚Äôm fairly sure we‚Äôd be seeing\n similar subpoenas for the remailer logs.\nThere‚Äôs no exemption for remailers that I know of!\nThe solutions are obvious, though:\n    \nuse many remailers, to make subpoenaing back through the\n chain very laborious, very expensive, and likely to fail\n (if even one party won‚Äôt cooperate, or is outside the\n court‚Äôs jurisdiction, etc.)\noffshore, multi-jurisdictional remailers (seleted by the\n user)\nno remailer logs kept‚Ä¶destroy them (no law currently\n says anybody has to keep e-mail records! This may\n change‚Ä¶.)\n‚Äúforward secrecy,‚Äù a la Diffie-Hellman forward secrecy\n 8.9.3. How will remailers be harassed, attacked, and challenged?\n 8.9.4. ‚ÄúCan pressure be put on remailer operators to reveal traffic\n logs and thereby allow tracing of messages?‚Äù\n\n\nFor human-operated systems which have logs, sure. This is\n why we want several things in remailers:\n    \nno logs of messages\nmany remailers\nmultiple legal jurisdictions, e.g., offshore remailers\n (the more the better)\nhardware implementations which execute instructions\n flawlessly (Chaum‚Äôs digital mix)\n 8.9.5. Calls for limits on anonymity\n\n\nKids and the net will cause many to call for limits on\n nets, on anonymity, etc.\n    \n‚ÄúBut there‚Äôs a dark side to this exciting phenomenon, one\n that‚Äôs too rarely understood by computer novices.\n Because they\n offer instant access to others, and considerable\n anonymity to\n participants, the services make it possible for people -\n especially computer-literate kids - to find themselves in\n unpleasant, sexually explicit social situations‚Ä¶.  And\n I‚Äôve gradually\n come to adopt the view, which will be controversial among\n many online\n users, that the use of nicknames and other forms of\n anonymity\n must be eliminated or severly curbed to force people\n online into\n at least as much accountability for their words and\n actions as\n exists in real social encounters.‚Äù [Walter S. Mossberg,\n Wall Street Journal, 6/30/94, provided by Brad Dolan]\nEli Brandt came up with a good response to this: ‚ÄúThe\n sound-bite response to this: do you want your child‚Äôs\n name, home address, and phone number available to all\n those lurking pedophiles worldwide?  Responsible parents\n encourage their children to use remailers.‚Äù\n\n\nSupreme Court said that identity of handbill distributors\n need not be disclosed, and pseudonyms in general has a long\n and noble tradition\nBBS operators have First Amendment protections (e.g..\n registration requirements would be tossed out, exactly as\n if registration of newspapers were to be attempted)\n 8.9.6. Remailers and Choice of Jurisdictions\nThe intended target of a remailed message, and the subject\n material, may well influence the set of remailers used,\n especially for the very important ‚Äúlast remailer‚Äô (Note: it\n should never be necessary to tell remailers if they are\n first, last, or others, but the last remailer may in fact\n be able to tell he‚Äôs the last‚Ä¶if the message is in\n plaintext to the recipient, with no additional remailer\n commands embedded, for example.)\nA message involving child pornography might have a remailer\n site located in a state like Denmark, where child porn laws\n are less restrictive. And a message critical of Islam might\n not be best sent through a final remailer in Teheran. Eric\n Hughes has dubbed this ‚Äúregulatory arbitrage,‚Äù and to\n various extents it is already common practice.\nOf course, the sender picks the remailer chain, so these\n common sense notions may not be followed. Nothing is\n perfect, and customs will evolve. I can imagine schemes\n developing for choosing customers‚Äìa remailer might not\n accept as a customer certain abusers, based on digital\n pseudonyms < hairy).\n 8.9.7. Possible legal steps to limit the use of remailers and\n   anonymous systems\nhold the remailer liable for content, i.e., no common\n carrier status\ninsert provisions into the various ‚Äúanti-hacking‚Äù laws to\n criminalize anonymous posts\n 8.9.8. Crypto and remailers can be used to protect groups from ‚Äúdeep\n   pockets‚Äù lawsuits\nproducts (esp. software) can be sold ‚Äúas is,‚Äù or with\n contracts backed up by escrow services (code kept in an\n escrow repository, or money kept there to back up\n committments)\njurisdictions, legal and tax, cannot do ‚Äúreach backs‚Äù which\n expose the groups to more than they agreed to\n    \nas is so often the case with corporations in the real\n world, which are taxed and fined for various purposes\n (asbestos, etc.)\n\n\n(For those who panic at the thought of this, the remedy for\n the cautious will be to arrange contracts with the right\n entities‚Ä¶probably paying more for less product.)\n 8.9.9. Could anonymous remailers be used to entrap people, or to\n   gather information for investigations?\nFirst, there are so few current remailers that this is\n unlikely. Julf seems a non-narc type, and he is located in\n Finland. The Cypherpunks remailers are mostly run by folks\n like us, for now.\nHowever, such stings and set-ups have been used in the past\n by narcs and ‚Äúred squads.‚Äù Expect the worse from Mr.\n Policeman. Now that evil hackers are identified as hazards,\n expect moves in this direction. ‚ÄúCryps‚Äù are obviously\n ‚Äúcrack‚Äù dealers.\nBut use of encryption, which CP remailers support (Julf‚Äôs\n does not), makes this essentially moot.\n\n10.7.

And what‚Äôs\n   the implication for digital cash of various forms?\nTokens, coupons, gift certificates are allowed, but face\n various regulations. Casino chips were once treated as\n cash, but are now more regulated (inter-casino conversion\n is no longer allowed).\nAny attempt to use such coupons as an alternative currency\n face obstacles.  The coupons may be allowed, but heavily\n regulated (reporting requirements, etc.).\nPerry Metzger notes, bearer bonds are now illegal in the\n U.S. (a bearer bond represented cash, in that no name was\n attached to the bond‚Äìthe ‚Äúbearer‚Äù could sell it for cash\n or redeem it‚Ä¶worked great for transporting large amounts\n of cash in compact form).\nNote: Duncan Frissell claims that bearer bonds are not\n illegal.\n    \n‚ÄúUnder the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of\n 1982 (TEFRA), any interest payments made on new issues\n of domestic bearer bonds are not deductible as an\n ordinary and necessary business expense so none have been\n issued since then.

The maze of regulations,\n restrictions, tax laws, and legal rulings is daunting. Eric\n Hughes spent a lot of time reading up on the laws regarding\n banks, commercial paper, taxes, etc., and concluded much\n the same. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs impossible‚Äìindeed, I believe\n it will someday happen, in some form‚Äìbut the obstacles are\n formidable.\nSome issues:\n    \nWill such an operation be allowed to be centered or based\n in the U.S.?\n        \nWhat states? What laws? Bank vs. Savings and Loan vs.\n Credit Union vs. Securities Broker vs. something else?\n\n\nWill customers be able to access such entities offshore,\n outside the U.S.?\n        \nstrong crypto makes communication possible, but it may\n be difficult, not part of the business fabric, etc.\n (and hence not so useful‚Äìif one has to send PGP-\n encrypted instructions to one‚Äôs banker, and can‚Äôt use\n the clearing infrastructure‚Ä¶.)\n\n\nTax collection, money-laundering laws, disclosure laws,\n ‚Äúknow your customer‚Äù laws‚Ä¶.all are areas where a\n ‚Äúdigital bank‚Äù could be shut down forthwith. Any bank not\n filling out the proper forms (including mandatory\n reporting of transactions of certain amounts and types,\n and the Social Security/Taxpayer Number of customers)\n faces huge fines, penalties, and regulatory sanctions.\n        \nand the existing players in the banking and securities\n business will not sit idly by while newcomers enter\n their market; they will seek to force newcomers to jump\n through the same hoops they had to (studies indicate\n large corporations actually like red tape, as it\n helps them relative to smaller companies)\n\n\n\n\nConcluson: Digital banks will not be ‚Äúlaunched‚Äù without a\n lot of work by lawyers, accountants, tax experts,\n lobbyists, etc. ‚ÄúLemonade stand digital banks‚Äù (TM) will\n not survive for long. Kids, don‚Äôt try this at home!\n(Many new industries we are familiar with‚Äìsoftware,\n microcomputers‚Äìhad very little regulation, rightly so. But\n the effect is that many of us are unprepared to understand\n the massive amount of red tape which businesses in other\n areas, notably banking, face.)\n10.8.9. Legal obstacles to digital money. If governments don‚Äôt want\n   anonymous cash, they can make things tough.\nAs both Perry Metzger and Eric Hughes have said many times,\n regulations can make life very difficult. Compliance with\n laws is a major cost of doing business.\n    \n~‚ÄùThe cost of compliance in a typical USA bank is 14% of\n operating costs.‚Äù~ [Eric Hughes, citing an ‚ÄúAmerican\n Banker‚Äù article, 1994-08-30]\n\n\nThe maze of regulations is navigable by larger\n institutions, with staffs of lawyers, accountants, tax\n specialists, etc., but is essentially beyond the\n capabilities of very small institutions, at least in the\n U.S.\n    \nthis may or may not remain the case, as computers\n proliferate. A ‚Äúbank-in-a-box‚Äù program might help. My\n suspicion is that a certain size of staff is needed just\n to handle the face-to-face meetings and hoop-jumping.\n\n\n‚ÄúNew World Order‚Äù\n    \nU.S. urging other countries to ‚Äúplay ball‚Äù on banking\n secrecy, on tax evasion extradition, on immigration, etc.\nthis is closing off the former loopholes and escape\n hatches that allowed people to escape repressive\n taxation‚Ä¶the implications for digital money banks are\n unclear, but worrisome.\n\n\n\n10.9. Legality of Digital Banks and Digital Cash?\n10.9.1. In terms of banking laws, cash reporting regulations, money\n   laundering statutes, and the welter of laws connected with\n   financial transactions of all sorts, the Cypherpunks themes\n   and ideas are basically illegal. Illegal in the sense that\n   anyone trying to set up his own bank, or alternative currency\n   system, or the like would be shut down quickly. As an\n   informal, unnoticed experiment, such things are reasonably\n   safe‚Ä¶until they get noticed.\n10.9.2. The operative word here is ‚Äúlaunch,‚Äù in my opinion. The\n   ‚Äúlaunch‚Äù of the BankAmericard (now VISA) in the 1960s was not\n   done lightly or casually‚Ä¶it required armies of lawyers,\n   accountants, and other bureacrats to make the launch both\n   legal and successful. The mere ‚Äòidea‚Äù of a credit card was\n   not enough‚Ä¶that was essentially the easiest part of it all.\n   (Anyone contemplating the launch of a digital cash system\n   would do well to study BankAmericard as an example‚Ä¶and\n   several other examples also.)\n10.9.3. The same will be true of any digital cash or similar system\n   which intends to operate more or less openly, to interface\n   with existing financial institutions, and which is not\n   explicity intended to be a Cypherpunkish underground\n   activity.\n10.10. Export of Crypto, ITAR, and Similar Laws\n10.10.1. ‚ÄúWhat are the laws and regulations about export of crypto,\n   and where can I find more information?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThe short answer is that the Department of State, Office\n of Defense Trade Controls (DOS/DTC) and the National\n Security Administration (NSA) won‚Äôt allow unrestricted\n export (like is being done with WinCrypt) for any\n encryption program that the NSA can‚Äôt crack with less than\n a certain amount (that they are loathe to reveal) of\n effort.

There‚Äôs been a lot of media attention given to this,\n   especially pedophilia (pedophilia is not the same thing as\n   porn, of course, but the two are often discussed in articles\n   about the Net).

The fact is, the two are made for each other. The\n   untraceability of remailers, the unbreakability of strong\n   crypto if the files are intercepted by law enforcement, and\n   the ability to pay anonymously, all mean the early users of\n   commercial remailers will likely be these folks.\n10.12.3.

Much of Usenet traffic presumably\n   violates various laws in Iran, China, France, Zaire, and the\n   U.S., to name f ew places which have laws about what thoughts\n   can be expressed.\n10.13.3. Will this ever result in attempts to shut down Usenet, or at\n   least the feeds into various countries?\n10.13.4. On the subject of Usenet possibly being shut-down in the U.K.\n   (a recent rumor, unsubstantiated), this comment: ‚Äú What you\n   have to grasp is that USENET type networks and the whole\n   structure of the law on publshing are fundamentally\n   incompatiable.

After all, if one encrypts, one must have\n   something to hide, and that could expose the university to\n   legal action from some group that feels aggrieved.\n10.17.3. Free speech is under assault across the country. The tort\n   system is being abused to stifle dissenting views (and lest\n   you think I am only a capitalist, only a free marketeer, the\n   use of ‚ÄúSLAPP suits‚Äù‚Äì‚ÄúStrategic Lawsuits Against Public\n   Participation‚Äù‚Äìby corporations or real estate developers to\n   threaten those who dare to publicly speak against their\n   projects is a travesty, a travesty that the courts have only\n   recently begun to correct).\nWe are becoming a nation of sheep, fearing the midnight raid,\n   the knock on the door.

They are not held liable for the contents of\n phone calls, for the contents of packages (drugs,\n pornography, etc.), or for illegal acts connected with\n their services. One of the deals is that common carriers\n not examine the insides of packages.  Common carriers\n essentially agree to take all traffic that pays the fee and\n not to discriminate based on content. Thus, a phone service\n will not ask what the subject of a call is to be, or listen\n in, to decide whether to make the connection.\nSome say that to be a common carrier requires a willingness\n to work with law enforcement. That is, Federal Express is\n not responsible for contents of packages, but they have to\n cooperate in reasonable ways with law enforcement to open\n or track suspicious packages. Anybody have a cite for this?\n Is it true?\nCommon carrier status is also cited for bookstores, which\n are not presumed to have read each and every one of the\n books they sell‚Ä¶so if somebody blows their hand off in a\n an experiment, the bookstore is not liable.  (The\n author/publisher may be, but that‚Äôs aÔøΩnt issue.)\nHow does one become a common carrier? Not clear. One view\n is that a service should ‚Äúbehave like‚Äù a common carrier and\n then hope and pray that a court sees it that way.\nAre computer services common carriers? A topic of great\n interest.\n    \n‚ÄúAccording to a discussion I had with Dave Lawrence\n (postmaster at UUNET, as well as moderator of\n news.admin.newgroups), UUNET is registered with the FCC\n as an ‚ÄúEnhanced Service Provider,‚Äù which, according to\n Dave, amounts to similar protection as ‚ÄúCommon Carrier.‚Äù\n (‚ÄúCommon Carrier‚Äù seems to not be appropriate yet, since\n Congress is so behind the tech curve).‚Äù [L. Todd Masco,\n 1994-08-11]\n\n\nAs for remailer networks being treated as common carriers,\n totally unclear at this time. Certainly the fact that\n packets are fully encrypted and unreadabel goes to part of\n the issue about agreeing not to screen.\nMore on the common carrier debate:\n    \n‚ÄúAh, the eternal Common Carrier debate.  The answer is\n the same as the last few times. ‚ÄúCommon Carrier‚Äù status\n has little to do with exemption from liability.  It has\n most to do with being unable to reject passengers, goods,\n or phone calls‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Plenty of non-common carrier entities\n are immune from prosecution for ideas that they\n unkowingly communicate ‚Äì bookstores for example (unless\n they are knowingly porno bookstores in the wrong\n jurisdiction)‚Ä¶.Compuserve was held not liable for an\n (alleged) libel by one of its sysops.  Not because of\n common carrier but because they had no knowledge or\n control‚Ä¶.Remailers have no knowledge or control hence\n no scienter (guilty knowledge) hence no liability as a\n matter of law‚Äînot a jury question BTW.‚Äù [Duncan\n Frissell, 1994-08-11]\n\n\n\n10.19. Credentials\n10.19.1. ‚ÄúAre credentials needed? Will digital methods be used?‚Äù\n10.19.2. I  take a radical view. Ask yourself why credentials are\n   ever needed. Maybe for driving a car, and the like, but in\n   those cases anonymity is not needed, as the person is in the\n   car, etc.\nCredentials for drinking age? Why? Let the parents enforce\n   this, as the argument goes about watching sex and violence on\n   t.v. (If one accepts the logic of requiring bars to enforce\n   children‚Äôs behavior, then one is on a slippery slope toward\n   requiring television set makers to check smartcards of\n   viewers, or of requiring a license to access the Internet,\n   etc.)\nIn almost no cases do I see the need to carry ‚Äúpapers‚Äù with\n   me. Maybe a driver‚Äôs license, like I said. In other areas,\n   why?\n10.19.3. So Cypherpunks probably should not spend too much time\n   worrying about how permission slips and ‚Äúhall passes‚Äù will be\n   handled. Little need for them.\n10.19.4. ‚ÄúWhat about credentials for specific job performance, or for\n   establishing time-based contracts?‚Äù\n\nCredentials that prove one has completed certain classes,\n or reached certain skill levels, etc.?\n\nIn transactions where ‚Äúfuture performance‚Äù is needed, as in\n a contract to have a house built, or to do some similar\n job, then of course the idea of on-line or immediate\n clearing is bogus‚Ä¶like paying a stranger a sum of money\n on his promise that he‚Äôll be back the next day to start\n building you a house.\nParties to such long-term, non-locally-cleared cases may\n contract with an escrow agent, as I described above. This\n is like the ‚Äúprivately-produced law‚Äù we‚Äôve discussed so\n many times. The essence: voluntary arrangements.\nMaybe proofs of identity will be needed, or asked for,\n maybe not. But these are not the essence of the deal.\n\n\n10.20. Escrow Agents\n10.20.1. (the main discussion of this is under Crypto Anarchy)\n10.20.2. Escrow Agents as a way to deal with contract renegging\n\nOn-line clearing has the possible danger implicit in all\n trades that Alice will hand over the money, Bob will verify\n that it has cleared into hisaccount (in older terms, Bob\n would await word that his Swiss bank account has just been\n credited), and then Bob will fail to complete his end of\n the bargain. If the transaction is truly anonymous, over\n computer lines, then of course Bob just hangs up his modem\n and the connection is broken. This situation is as old as\n time, and has always involved protcols in which trust,\n repeat business, etc., are factors. Or escrow agents.\nLong before the ‚Äúkey escrow‚Äù of Clipper, true escrow was\n planned. Escrow as in escrow agents. Or bonding agents.\nAlice and Bob want to conduct a transaction. Neither trusts\n the other;\n indeed, they are unknown to each other. In steps ‚ÄúEsther‚Äôs\n Escrow Service.‚Äù She is also utraceable, but has\n established a digitally-signed presence and a good\n reputation for fairness. Her business is in being an escrow\n agent, like a bonding agency, not in ‚Äúburning‚Äù either\n party. (The math of this is interesting: as long as the\n profits to be gained from any small set of transactions is\n less than her ‚Äúreputation capital,‚Äù it is in her interest\n to forego the profits from burning and be honest. It is\n also possible to arrange that Esther cannot profit from\n burning either Alice or Bob or both of them, e.g., by\n suitably encrypting the escrowed stuff.)\nAlice can put her part of the transaction into escrow with\n Esther, Bob can do the same, and then Esther can release\n the items to the parties when conditions are met, when both\n parties agree, when adjudication of some sort occurs, etc.\n (There a dozen issues here, of course, about how disputes\n are settled, about how parties satisfy themselves that\n Esther has the items she says she has, etc.)\n\n10.21. Loose Ends\n10.21.1. Legality of trying to break crypto systems\n\n‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the legality of breaking cyphers?‚Äù\n    \nSuppose I find some random-looking bits and find a way to\n apparently decrease their entropy, perhaps turning them\n into the HBO or Playboy channel? What crime have I\n committed?\n‚ÄúTheft of services‚Äù is what they‚Äôll get me for. Merely\n listening to broadcasts can now be a crime (cellular,\n police channels, satellite broadcasts). In my view, a\n chilling developemt, for practical reasons (enforcement\n means invasive monitoring) and for basic common sense\n ethics reasons: how can listening to what lands on your\n property be illegal?\nThis also opens the door for laws banning listening to\n certain ‚Äúoutlaw‚Äù or ‚Äúunlicensed‚Äù braodcast stations.\n Shades of the Iron Curtain. (I‚Äôm not talking about FCC\n licensing, per se.)\n\n\n‚ÄúCould it ever be illegal to try to break an encryption\n scheme, even if the actual underlying data is not\n ‚Äústolen‚Äù?‚Äù\n    \nCriminalizing tools rather than actions\n        \nThe U.S. is moving in the direction of making mere\n possession of certain tools and methods illegal, rather\n than criminalizing actual actions. This has been the\n case‚Äìor so I hear, though I can‚Äôt cite actual laws‚Äì\n with ‚Äúburglar tools.‚Äù (Some dispute this, pointing to\n the sale of lockpicks, books on locksmithing, etc.\n Still, see what happens if you try to publish a\n detailed book on how to counterfeit currency.)\nBlack‚Äôs law term for this?\n\n\nTo some extent, it already is. Video encryption is this\n way. So is cellular.\n        \nattendees returning from a Bahamas conference on pirate\n video methods (guess why it was in the Bahamas) had\n their papers and demo materials seized by Customs\n\n\nCounterfeiting is, I think, in this situation, too.\n Merely exploring certain aspects is verboten. (I don‚Äôt\n claim that all aspects are, of course.)\nInterception of broadcast signals may be illegal‚Äì\n satellite or cellular phone traffic (and Digital\n Telephony Act may further make such intercepts illegal\n and punishable in draconian ways)\n\n\nOutlawing of the breaking of encryption, a la the\n broadcast/scanner laws\n    \n(This came up in a thread with Steve Bellovin)\nAspects\n        \nPPL side‚Ä¶hard to convince a PPL agent to ‚Äúenforce‚Äù\n this\n            \nbut market sanctions against those who publically use\n the information are of course possible, just as with\n those who overhear conversations and then gossip\n widely (whereas the act of overhearing is hardly a\n crime)\n\n\nstatutory enforcement leads to complacency, to below-\n par security\nis an unwelcome expansion of power of state to enforce\n laws against decryption of numbers\n            \nand may lead to overall restrictions on crypto use\n10.21.2. wais, gopher, WWW, and implications\n\n\n\n\n\n\nborders more transparent‚Ä¶not clear where searches are\n taking place, files being transferrred, etc. (well, it is\n deterministic, so some agent or program presumably knows,\n but it‚Äôs likely that humans don‚Äôt)\n10.21.3. ‚ÄúWhy are so many prominent Cypherpunks interested in the\n   law?‚Äù\nBeats me. Nothing is more stultfyingly boring to me than\n the cruft and ‚Äúfound items‚Äù nature of the law.\nHowever,, for a certain breed of hacker, law hacking is the\n ultimate challenge. And it‚Äôs important for some Cypherpunks\n goals.\n10.21.4. ‚ÄúHow will crypto be fought?‚Äù\nThe usual suspects: porn, pedophilia, terrorists, tax\n evaders, spies\nClaims that ‚Äúnational security‚Äù is at stake\n    \nAs someone has said, ‚ÄúNational security is the root\n password to the Constitution‚Äù\n\n\nclaims of discrimination\n    \nas but one example, crypto allows offshore bank accounts,\n a la carte insurance, etc‚Ä¶these are all things that\n will shake the social welfare systems of many nations\n10.21.5.

Any message can be turned into any other\n message, with the proper XOR intermediate message.\n Implications for stego as well as for legal proof\n (difficulty of). As bits leave no fingerprints, the mere\n presence of a particular XOR pad on a defendant‚Äôs disk is\n no proof that he put it there‚Ä¶the cops could have planted\n the incriminating key, which turns ‚Äúgi6E2lf7DX01jT$‚Äù into\n ‚ÄúDope is ready.‚Äù (I see issues of ‚Äúchain of evidence‚Äù\n becoming even more critical, perhaps with use of\n independent ‚Äútimestamping authorities‚Äù to make hashes of\n seized evidence‚Äìhashes in the cryptographic sense and not\n hashes in the usual police sense.)\n10.21.9. ‚ÄúWhat are the dangers of standardization and official\n   sanctioning?‚Äù\nThe U.S. has had a disturbing tendency to standardize on\n some technology and then punish deviations from the\n standard. Examples: telephones, cable (franchises granted,\n competitors excluded)\nFranchises, standards‚Ä¶\nMy concern: Digital money will be blessed‚Ä¶home banking,\n Microsoft, other banks, etc. The Treasury folks will sign\n on, etc.\n    \nCompetitors will have a hard time, as government throws\n roadblocks in front of them, as the U.S. makes\n international deals with other countries, etc.\n10.21.10. Restrictions on voice encryption?\n\n\nmay arise for an ironic reason: people can use Net\n connections to talk worldwide for $1 an hour or less,\n rather than $1 a minute; this may cause telcos to clamor\n for restrictions\n    \nenforcing these restrictions then becomes problematic,\n unless channel is monitored\nand if encrypted‚Ä¶\n10.21.11. Fuzziness of laws\n\n\nIt may seem surprising that a nation so enmeshed in\n complicated legalese as the U.S., with more lawyers per\n capita than any other large nation and with a legal code\n that consists of hundreds of thousands of pages of\n regulations and interpretations, is actually a nation with\n a legal code that is hard to pin down.\nAny  system with formal, rigid rules can be ‚Äúgamed against‚Äù\n be an adversary. The lawmakers know this, and so the laws\n are kept fuzzy enough to thwart mechanistic gaming; this\n doesn‚Äôt stop there from being an army of lawyers (in fact,\n it guarantees it). Some would say that the laws are kept\n fuzzy to increase the power of lawmakers and regulators.\n\n‚ÄúBank regulations in this country are kept deliberately\n somewhat vague.  The regulator‚Äôs word is the deciding\n principle, not a detailed interpretation of statute.  The\n lines are fuzzy, and because they are fuzzy, the banks\n don‚Äôt press on them nearly as hard as when there‚Äôs clear\n statutory language available to be interpreted in a court.\n‚ÄúThe uncertainty in the regulatory environment increases\n the hold the regulators have over the banks.  And the\n regulators are known for being decidedly finicky.  Their\n decisions are largely not subject to appeal (except for the\n flagrant stuff, which the regulators are smart enough not\n to do too often), and there‚Äôs no protection against cross-\n linking issues.  If a bank does something untoward in, say,\n mortgage banking, they may find, say, their interstate\n branching possibilities seem suddenly much dimmer.\n‚ÄúThe Dept. of Treasury doesn‚Äôt want untraceable\n transactions.‚Äù [Eric Hughes, Cypherpunks list, 1994-8-03]\n\nAttempts to sneak around the laws, especially in the\n context of alternative currencies, Perry Metzger notes:\n ‚ÄúThey are simply trying to stop you from playing games. The\n law isn‚Äôt like geometry ‚Äì there aren‚Äôt axioms and rules\n for deriving one thing from another. The general principle\n is that they want to track all your transactions, and if\n you make it difficult they will either use existing law to\n jail you, or will produce a new law to try to do the same.‚Äù\n [Perry Metzger, 1994-08-10]\nThis fuzziness and regulatory discretion is closely related\n to those wacky schemes to avoid taxes by claiming , for\n example, that the ‚Äúdollar‚Äù is defined as 1/35th of an ounce\n of gold (and that hence one‚Äôs earnings in ‚Äúreal dollars‚Äù\n are a tiny fraction of the ostensible earnings), that Ohio\n did not legally enter the Union and thus the income tax was\n never properly ratified,, etc. Lots of these theories have\n been tested‚Äìand rejected. I mention this because some\n Cypherpunks show signs of thinking ‚Äúdigital cash‚Äù offers\n similar opportunities. (And I expect to see similar scams.)\n(A related example. Can one‚Äôs accumulation of money be\n taken out of the country? Depending on who you ask, ‚Äúit\n depends.‚Äù Taking it out in your suitcase rasises all kind\n of possibilies of seizure (violation of currency export\n laws, money laundering, etc.). Wiring it out may invoke\n FinCEN triggers. The IRS may claim it is ‚Äúcapital flight‚Äù\n to avoid taxes‚Äìwhich it may well be. Basically, your own\n money is no longer yours. There may be ways to do this‚ÄìI\n hope so‚Äìbut the point remains that the rules are fuzzy,\n and the discretionary powers to seize assets are great.\n Seek competent counsel, and then pray.)\n10.21.12. role of Uniform Commercial Code (UCC)\nnot discussed in crypto circles much, but the ‚Äúrules of the\n road‚Äù\nin many  way, an implementation of anarcho-capitalism, in\n that the UCC is a descendant (modulo some details) of the\n ‚ÄúLaw Merchant‚Äù that handled relations between sovereign\n powers, trade at sea, etc.\nthings like electronic funds transfere, checks, liablities\n for forged sigs, etc.\nI expect eventual UCC involvement in digital money schemes\n10.21.13. ‚ÄúWhat about the rush to legislate, to pass laws about\n   cyberspace, the information superduperhighway, etc.?\nThe U.S. Congress feels it has to ‚Äúdo something‚Äù about\n things that many of us feel don‚Äôt need regulation or ‚Äúhelp‚Äù\n from Congress.\n    \ncrypto legislation\nset-top boxes, cable access, National Information\n Infrastructure (Cable Version)\ninformation access, parental lock-outs, violence ratings,\n sexually explicit materials, etc.\n\n\nRelated to the ‚Äúdo something!‚Äù mentality on National Health\n Care, guns, violence, etc.\nWhy not just not do anything?\nScary possibilities being talked about:\n    \ngiving television sets unique IDs (‚ÄúV chips‚Äù) with cable\n access through these chips\n        \ntying national ID cards to these, e.g., Joe Citizen, of\n Provo, Utah, would be ‚Äúallowed‚Äù to view an NC-17\n violence-rated program\nThis would be disastrous: records, surveillance,\n dossiers, permission, centralization\n\n\n\n\nThe ‚Äúhow can we fix it?‚Äù mindset is very damaging.

We‚Äôve come a long way from Secretary of State Stimpson‚Äôs\n   famous ‚ÄúGentlemen do not read other gentlemen‚Äôs mail‚Äù\n   statement. It is now widely taken for granted that Americans\n   are to be monitored, surveilled, and even wiretapped by the\n   various intelligence agencies. The FBI, the National Security\n   Agency, the CIA, the National Reconnaissance Office, etc.\n   (Yes, these groups have various charters telling them who\n   they can spy on, what legalities they have to meet, etc. But\n   they still spy.

Determining if they have or not is another\n issue, but various ideas suggest themselves (John Gilmore\n says he often joins groups under variants of his name, to\n see who is selling his name to mailing lists.)\nAbsent any laws which forbid them, privacy-preserving\n credit card companies will likely spring up if there‚Äôs a\n market demand.

Police States and Informants\n11.10.1. Police states need a sense of terror to help magnify the\n   power or the state, a kind of ‚Äúshrechlichkeit,‚Äù as the Nazis\n   used to call it. And lots of informants. Police states need\n   willing accomplices to turn in their neighbors, or even their\n   parents, just as little Pavel Morozov became a Hero of the\n   Soviet People by sending his parents to their deaths in\n   Stalin‚Äôs labor camps for the crime of expressing negative\n   opinions about the glorious State.\n\n(The canonization of Pavel Morozov was recently repudiated\n by current Russian leaders‚Äìmaybe even by the late-Soviet\n era leades, like Gorbachev‚Äìwho pointed out the corrosive\n effects of encouraging families to narc on each\n other‚Ä¶something the U.S. has forgotten‚Ä¶will it be 50\n years before our leaders admit that having children turn in\n Daddy for using ‚Äúillegal crypto‚Äù was not such a good idea?)\n11.10.2. Children are encouraged in federally-mandated D.A.R.E.\n   programs to become Junior Narcs, narcing their parents out to\n   the cops and counselors who come into their schools.\n11.10.3. The BATF has a toll-free line (800-ATF-GUNS) for snitching on\n   neighbors who one thinks are violating the federal gun laws.\n   (Reports are this is backfiring, as gun owners call the\n   number to report on local liberal politicians and gun-\n   grabbers.)\n11.10.4. Some country we live in, eh? (Apologies to non-U.S. readers,\n   as always.)\n11.10.5. The implications for use of crypto, for not trusting others,\n   etc., are clear\n11.10.6.

Privacy Laws\n11.11.1. Will proposed privacy laws have an effect?\n\nI suspect just the opposite: the tangled web of laws-part\n of the totalitarian freezeout-will ‚Äúmarginalize‚Äù more\n people and cause them to seek ways to protect their own\n privacy and protect themselves from sanctions over their\n actions\n    \nfree speech vs. torts, SLAPP suits, sedition charges,\n illegal research, etc.\n        \nfree speech is vanishing under a torrent of laws,\n licensing requirements, and even zoning rules\n\n\noutlawing of work on drugs, medical procedures, etc.\n        \nagainst the law to disseminate information on drug use\n (MDMA case at Stanford), on certain kinds of birth\n control\n\n\n‚ÄúIf encrytion is outlawed, only outlaws will have\n encryption.‚Äù\n\n\nprivacy laws are already causing encryption (‚Äúfile\n protection‚Äù) to be mandatory in many cases, as with medical\n records, transmission of sensitive files, etc.\n    \nby itself this is not in conflict with the government\n requirement for tappable access, but the practical\n implementation of a two-tier system-secure against\n civilian tappers but readable by national security\n tappers-is a nightmare and is likely impossible to\n achieve\n11.11.2. ‚ÄúWhy are things like the ‚ÄúData Privacy Laws‚Äù so bad?‚Äù\n\n\nMost European countries have laws that limit the collection\n of computerized records, dossiers, etc., except for\n approved uses (and the governments themselves and their\n agents).\nAmericans have no such laws. I‚Äôve heard calls for this,\n which I think is too bad.\nWhile we may not like the idea of others compiling dossiers\n on us, stopping them is an even worse situation. It gives\n the state the power to enter businesses, homes, and examine\n computers (else it is completely unenforceable). It creates\n ludicrous situations in which, say, someone making up a\n computerized list of their phone contacts is compiling an\n illegal database! It makes e-mail a crime (those records\n that are kept).\nthey are themselves major invasions of privacy\nare you going to put me in jail because I have data bases\n of e-mail, Usenet posts, etc.?\nIn my opinion, advocates of ‚Äúprivacy‚Äù are often confused\n about this issue, and fail to realize that laws about\n privacy often take away the privacy rights of others.\n (Rights are rarely in conflict‚Äìcontract plus self-privacy\n take care of 99% of situations where rights are purported\n to be in conflict.)\n11.11.3. on the various ‚Äúdata privacy laws‚Äù\nmany countries have adopted these data privacy laws,\n involving restrictions on the records that can be kept, the\n registration of things like mailing lists, and heavy\n penalties for those found keeping computer files deemed\n impermissable\nthis leads to invasions of privacy‚Ä¶.this very Cypherpunks\n list would have to be ‚Äúapproved‚Äù by a bureaucrat in many\n countries‚Ä¶the oportunites (and inevitabilities) of abuse\n are obvious\n\n‚ÄúThere is a central contradiction running through the\n dabase regulations proposed by many so-called ‚Äúprivacy\n advocates‚Äù.  To be enforceable they require massive\n government snooping into database activities on our\n workstatins and PCs,  especially the activities of many\n small at-home businesses (such as mailing list\n entrepreneurs who often work out of the home).\n‚ÄúThus, the upshot of these so-called ‚Äúprivacy‚Äù regulations\n is to destroy our last shreds of privacy against\n government, and calm us into blindly letting even more of\n the details of our personal lives into the mainframes of\n the major government agencies and credit reporting\n agenices, who if they aren‚Äôt explicitly excepted from the\n privacy laws (as is common) can simply evade them by using\n offshore havesn, mutual agreements with foreign\n investigators, police and intelligence agencies.‚Äù  [Jim\n Hart, 1994-09-08]\n11.11.4. ‚ÄúWhat do Cypherpunks think about this?‚Äù\n\ndivided minds‚Ä¶while no one likes being monitored, the\n question is how far one can go to stop others from being\n monitored\n    \n‚ÄúData Privacy Laws‚Äù as a bad example: tramples on freedom\n to write, to keep one‚Äôs computer private\n11.11.5.

Scenario for introduction of national ID cards\nImagine that vehicle registrations require presentation of\n this card (gotta get those illegals out of their cars, or,\n more benignly, the bureaucracy simply makes the ID cars\n part of their process).\nInstantly this makes those who refuse to get an ID card\n unable to get valid license tags. (Enforcement is already\n pretty good‚Ä¶.I was pulled over a couple of times for\n either forgetting to put my new stickers on, or for driving\n with Oregon expired tags.)\nThe ‚ÄúNational Benefits Card,‚Äù for example, is then required\n to get license plate tags.and maybe other things, like car\n and home insurance, etc. It would be very difficult to\n fight such a card, as one could not drive, could not pay\n taxes (‚ÄúAwhh!‚Äù I hear you say, but consider the penalties,\n the tie-ins with employers, etc. You can run but you can‚Äôt\n hide.)\n    \nthe national ID card would presumably be tied in to\n income tax filings, in various ways I won‚Äôt go into here.\n The Postal Service, aiming to get into this area I guess,\n has floated the idea of electronic filing, ID systems,\n etc.\n11.12.8. Comments on national ID cards\n\n\nThat some people will be able to skirt the system, or that\n the system will ultimately be unenforceable, does not\n lessen the concern. Things can get real tough in the\n meantime.\nI see great dangers here, in tying a national ID card to\n transactions we are essentially unable to avoid in this\n society: driving, insurance (and let‚Äôs not argue\n insurance‚Ä¶I mean it is unavoidable in the sense of legal\n issues, torts, etc.), border crossings, etc. Now how will\n one file taxes without such a card if one is made mandatory\n for interactions with the government? Saying ‚Äútaxes are not\n collectable‚Äù is not an adequate answer. They may not be\n collectible for street punks and others who inhabit the\n underground economy, but they sure are for most of us.\n\n11.13. National Health Care System Issues\n11.13.1. Insurance and National Health Care will Produce the ‚ÄúNational\n   ID‚Äù that will be Nearly Unescapable\n\nhospitals and doctors will have to have the card‚Ä¶cash\n payments will  evoke suspicion and may not even be feasible\n11.13.2.

Credentials\n11.14.1. This is one of the most overlooked and ignored aspects of\n   cryptology, especially of Chaum‚Äôs work. And no one in\n   Cypherpunks or anywhere else is currently working on ‚Äúblinded\n   credentials‚Äù for everyday use.\n11.14.2. ‚ÄúIs proof of identity needed?‚Äù\n\nThis question is debated a lot, and is important. Talk of a\n national ID card (what wags call an ‚Äúinternal passport‚Äù) is\n in the air, as part of health care, welfare, and\n immigration legislation. Electronic markets make this also\n an issue for the ATM/smart card community. This is also\n closely tied in with the nature of anonymous reamailers\n (where physical identity is of course generally lacking).\nFirst, ‚Äúidentity‚Äù can mean different things:\n    \nConventional View of Identity: Physical person, with\n birthdate, physical characteristics, fingerprints, social\n security numbers, passports, etc.‚Äìthe whole cloud of\n ‚Äúidentity‚Äù items. (Biometric.)\nPseudonym View of Identity:  Persistent personnas,\n mediated with cryptography. ‚ÄúYou are your key.‚Äù\nMost of us deal with identity as a mix of these views: we\n rarely check biometric credentials, but we also count on\n physical clues (voice, appearance, etc.). I assume that\n when I am speaking to ‚ÄúDuncan Frissell,‚Äù whom I‚Äôve never\n met in person, that he is indeed Duncan Frissell. (Some\n make the jump from this expectation to wanting the\n government enforce this claim, that is, provided I.D.)\n\n\nIt is often claimed that physical identity is important in\n order to:\n    \ntrack down cheaters, welchers, contract breakes, etc.\npermit some people to engage in some transactions, and\n forbid others to (age credentials, for drinking, for\n example, or‚Äîless benignly‚Äìwork permits in some field)\ntaxation, voting, other schemes tied to physical\n existence\n\n\nBut most of us conduct business with people without ever\n verifying their identity credentials‚Ä¶mostly we take their\n word that they are ‚ÄúBill Stewart‚Äù or ‚ÄúScott Collins,‚Äù and\n we never go beyond that.\n    \nthis could change as digital credentials proliferate and\n as interactions cause automatic checks to be made (a\n reason many of us have to support Chaum‚Äôs ‚Äúblinded\n credentials‚Äù idea‚Äìwithout some crypto protections, we‚Äôll\n be constantly tracked in all interactions).\n\n\nA guiding principle: Leave this question of whether to\n demand physical ID  credentials up to the parties\n involved. If Alice wants to see Bob‚Äôs ‚Äúis-a-person‚Äù\n credential, and take his palmprint, or whatever, that‚Äôs an\n issue for them to work out. I see no moral reason, and\n certainly no communal reason, for outsiders to interfere\n and insist that ID be produced (or that ID be forbidden,\n perhaps as some kind of ‚Äúcivil rights violation‚Äù). After\n all, we interact in cyberspace, on the Cypherpunks list,\n without any such external controls on identity.\n    \nand business contracts are best negotiated locally, with\n external enforcement contracted by the parties (privately-\n produced law, already seen with insurance companies,\n bonding agents, arbitration arrangements, etc.)\n\n\nPractically speaking, i.e., not normatively speaking,\n people will find ways around identity systems. Cash is one\n way, remailers are another. Enforcement of a rigid identity-\n based system is difficult.\n11.14.3. ‚ÄúDo we need ‚Äúis-a-person‚Äù credentials for things like votes\n   on the Net?‚Äù\nThat is, any sysadmin can easily create as many user\n accounts as he wishes. And end users can sign up with\n various services under various names. The concern is that\n this Chicago-style voting (fictitious persons) may be used\n to skew votes on Usenet.\nSimilar concerns arise elsewhere.\nIn my view, this is a mighty trivial reason to support ‚Äúis-\n a-person‚Äù credentials.\n11.14.4. Locality, credentials, validations\nConsider the privacy implications of something so simple as\n a parking lot system. Two main approaches:\n    \nFirst Approach. Cash payment. Car enters lot, driver pays\n cash, a ‚Äúvalidation‚Äù is given. No traceability exists.\n (There‚Äôs a small chance that one driver can give his\n sticker to a new driver, and thus defraud the parking\n lot. This tends not to happen, due to the inconveniences\n of making a market in such stickers (coordinating with\n other car, etc.) and because the sticker is relatively\n inexpensive.)\nSecond Approach. Billing of driver, recording of license\n plates. Traceability is present, especially if the local\n parking lot is tied in to credit card companies, DMV,\n police, etc. (these link-ups are on the wish list of\n police agencies, to further ‚Äúfreeze out‚Äù fugitives, child\n support delinquents, and other criminals).\n\n\nThese are the concerns of a society with a lot of\n electronic payments but with no mechanisms for preserving\n privacy. (And there is currently no great demand for this\n kind of privacy, for a variety of reasons, and this\n undercuts the push for anonymous credential methods.)\nAn important property of true cash (gold, bank notes that\n are well-trusted) is that it settles immediately, requiring\n no time-binding of contracts (ability to track down the\n payer and collect on a bad transaction)\n\n11.15. Records of all UseNet postings\n11.15.1. (ditto for CompuServe, GEnie, etc.) will exist\n11.15.2. ‚ÄúWhat kinds of monitoring of the Net is possible?‚Äù\n\nArchives of all Usenet traffic. This is already done by\n commercial CD-ROm suppliers, and others, so this would be\n trivial for various agencies.\nMail archives. More problematic, as mail is ostensibly not\n public. But mail passes through many sites, usually in\n unencrypted form.\nTraffic analysis. Connections monitored. Telnet, ftp, e-\n mail, Mosaid, and other connections.\nFiltered scans of traffic, with keyword-matched text stored\n in archives.\n11.15.3. Records: note that private companies can do the same thing,\n   except that various ‚Äúright to privacy‚Äù laws may try to\n   interfere with this\nwhich causes its own constitutional privacy problems, of\n course\n11.15.4. ‚ÄúHow can you expect that something you sent on the UseNet to\n   several thousand sites will not be potentially held against\n   you? You gave up any pretense of privacy when you broadcast\n   your opinions-and even detailed declarations of your\n   activities-to an audience of millions. Did you really think\n   that these public messages weren‚Äôt being filed away?

Effects of Surveillance on the Spread of Crypto\n11.16.1. Surveillance and monitoring will serve to increase the use of\n   encryption, at first by people with something to hide, and\n   then by others\n\na snowballing effect\nand various government agencies will themselves use\n encryption to protect their files and their privacy\n11.16.2. for those in sensitive positions, the availability of new\n   bugging methods will accelerate the conversion to secure\n   systems based on encrypted telecommunications and the\n   avoidance of voice-based systems\n11.16.3. Surveillance Trends\nTechnology is making citizen-unit surveillance more and\n more trivial\n    \nvideo cameras on every street corners are technologically\n easy to implement, for example\n        \nor cameras in stores, in airports, in other public\n places\ntraffic cameras\n\n\ntracking of purchases with credit cards, driver‚Äôs\n licenses, etc.\nmonitoring of computer emissions (TEMPEST issues, often a\n matter of paranoid speculation)\ninterception of the Net‚Ä¶wiretapping, interception of\n unencrypted communications, etc.\n        \nand compilation of dossier entries based on public\n postings\n\n\n\n\nThis all makes the efforts to head-off a person-tracking,\n credentials-based society all the more urgent.\n Monkeywrenching, sabotage, public education, and\n development of alternatives are all needed.\n    \nIf the surveillance state grows as rapidly as it now\n appears to be doing, more desperate measures may be\n needed. Personally, I wouldn‚Äôt shed any tears if\n Washington, D.C. and environs got zapped with a terrorist\n nuke; the innocents would be replaced quickly enough, and\n the death of so many political ghouls would surely be\n worth it. The destruction of Babylon.\nWe need to get the message about ‚Äúblinded credentials‚Äù\n (which can show some field, like age, without showing all\n fields, including name and such) out there. More\n radically, we need to cause people to question why\n credentials are as important as many people seem to\n think.\n        \nI argue that credentials are rarely needed for mutually\n agreed-upon transactions\n\n\n\n\n\n11.17.

Many forms of digital money. Just as there are dozens of\n   major forms of instruments, so too will there be many forms\n   of digital money. Niches will be filled.\n12.3.4. The deep nature of money is unclear to me. There are days\n   when I think it‚Äôs just a giant con game, with value in money\n   only because others will accept it. Other days when I think\n   it‚Äôs somewhat tied to ‚Äúreal things‚Äù like gold and silver. And\n   other days when I‚Äôm just unconcerned (so long as I have it,\n   and it works).\n12.3.5. The digital cash discussions get similarly confused by the\n   various ideas about money. Digital cash is not necessarily a\n   form of currency, but is instead a transfer mechanism. More\n   like a ‚Äúdigital check,‚Äù in fact (though it may give rise to\n   new currencies, or to wider use of some existing\n   currency‚Ä¶at some point, it may become indistinguishable\n   from a currency).\n12.3.6. I advise that people not worry overly much about the true and\n   deep nature of money, and instead think about digital cash as\n   a transfer protocol for some underlyng form of money, which\n   might be gold coins, or Swiss francs, or chickens, or even\n   giant stone wheels.\n12.3.7. Principle vs. Properties of Money\nPhysical coins, as money, have certain basic properties:\n difficult to counterfeit, pointless to counterfeit if made\n of gold or silver, fungibility, immediate settling (no need\n to clear with a distant bank, no delays, etc.),\n untraceability, etc.\nDigital cash, in various flavors, has dramatically\n different properties, e.g., it may require clearing, any\n single digtital note is infinitely copyable, it may allow\n traceability, etc. A complicated mix of properties.\nBut why is physical money (specie) the way it is? What\n properties account for this? What are the core principles\n that imply these properties?\n    \nhardware (specie like gold) vs. software (bits, readily\n copyable)\nimmediale, local clearing, because of rational faith that\n the money will clear\nlimits on rate of transfer of physical money set by size,\n weight of money, whereas ‚Äúwire fraud‚Äù and variants can\n drain an account in seconds\n\n\nMy notion is that we spend too much time thinking about the\n principles (such as locality, transitivity, etc.) and\n expect to then derive the properties. Maybe we need to\n instead focus on the objects, the sets of protocol-\n derived things, and examine their emergent properties. (I\n have my own thinking along these lines, involving ‚Äúprotocol\n ecologies‚Äù in which agents bang against each other, a la\n Doug Lenat‚Äôs old ‚ÄúEurisko‚Äù system, and thus discover\n weaknesses, points of strength, and even are genetically\n programmed to add new methods which increase security.\n This, as you can guess, is a longterm, speculative\n project.)\n12.3.8. ‚ÄúCan a ‚Äúdigital coin‚Äù be made?‚Äù\nThe answer appears to be ‚Äúno‚Äù\nSoftware is infinitely copyable, which means a software\n representation of digital money could be replicated many\n times\n    \nthis is not to say it could be spent many times,\n depending on the clearing process‚Ä¶but then this is not\n a ‚Äúcoin‚Äù in the sense we mean\n\n\nSoftware is trivially replicable, unlike gold or silver\n coins, or even paper currency.

Smart Cards\n12.4.1. ‚ÄúWhat are smart cards and how are they used?‚Äù\n\nMost smart cards as they now exist are very far from being\n the anonymous digital cash of primary interest to us.

David Chaum‚Äôs ‚ÄúDigiCash‚Äù\n12.5.1. ‚ÄúWhy is Chaum so important to digital cash?‚Äù\n\nChaum‚Äôs name appears frequently in this document, and in\n other Cypherpunk writings. He is without a doubt the\n seminal thinker in this area, having been very nearly the\n first to write about several areas: untraceable e-mail,\n digital cash, blinding, unlinkable credentials, DC-nets,\n etc.\nI spoke to him at the 1988 ‚ÄúCrypto‚Äù conference, telling him\n about my interests, my ‚Äòlabyrinth‚Äô idea for mail-forwarding\n (which he had anticipated in 1981, unbeknownst to me at the\n time), and a few hints about ‚Äúcrypto anarchy.‚Äù It was clear\n to me that Chaum had thought long and deeply about these\n issues.\nChaum‚Äôs articles should be read by all interested in this\n area. (No, his papers are not ‚Äúon-line.‚Äù Please see the\n ‚ÄúCrypto‚Äù Proceedings and related materials.)\n[DIGICASH PRESS RELEASE, ‚ÄúWorld‚Äôs first electronic cash\n payment over computer networks,‚Äù 1994-05-27]\n12.5.2. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs his motivation?‚Äù\nChaum appears to be a libertarian, at least on social\n issues, and is very worried about ‚ÄúBig Brother‚Äù sorts of\n concerns (recall the title of his 1985 CACM article).\nHis work in Europe has mostly concentrated on unlinkable\n credentials for toll road payments, electronic voting, etc.\n His company, DigiCash, is working on various aspects of\n digital cash.\n12.5.3. ‚ÄúHow does his system work?‚Äù\nThere have been many summaries on the Cypherpunks list. Hal\n Finney has written at least half a dozen, and others have\n been contributed by Eric Hughes, Karl Barrus, etc. I won‚Äôt\n be including any of them here‚Ä¶.it just takes too many\n pages to explain how digital cash works in detail.\n(The biggest problem people have with digital cash is in\n not taking the time to understand the basics of the math,\n of blinding, etc. They wrongly assume that ‚Äúdigital cash‚Äù\n can be understood by common-sense reasoning about existing\n cash, etc. This mistake has been repeated in several of the\n half-assed proposals for ‚Äúnet cash‚Äù and ‚Äúdigi dollars.‚Äù)\nHere‚Äôs the opening few paragraphs from one of Hal‚Äôs\n explanations, to provide a glimpse:\n    \n\n‚ÄúMike Ingle asks about digicash.  The simplest system I\n know of that is anonymous is the one by Chaum, Fiat, and\n Naor, which we have discussed here a few times.  The idea\n is that the bank chooses an RSA modulus, and a set of\n exponents e1, e2, e3, ‚Ä¶, where each exponent ei\n represents\n a denomination and possibly a date.  The exponents must\n be relatively prime to (p-1)(q-1).  PGP has a GCD routine\n which can be used to check for valid exponents..\n‚ÄúAs with RSA, to each public exponent ei corresponds a\n secret exponent di, calculated as the multiplicative\n inverse of ei mod (p-1)(q-1).  Again, PGP has a routine\n to calculate multiplicative inverses.\n‚ÄúIn this system, a piece of cash is a pair (x, f(x)^di),\n where f() is a one-way function.  MD5 would be a\n reasonable choice for f(), but notice that it produces a\n 128-bit result.  f() should take this 128-bit output of\n MD5 and ‚Äúreblock‚Äù it to be an multi-precision number by\n padding it; PGP has a ‚Äúpreblock‚Äù routine which does this,\n following the PKCS standard.\n‚ÄúThe way the process works, with the blinding, is like\n this.  The user chooses a random x.  This should probably\n be at least 64 or 128 bits, enough to preclude exhaustive\n search.  He calculates f(x), which is what he wants the\n bank to sign by raising to the power di.  But rather than\n sending f(x) to the bank directly, the user first blinds\n it by choosing a random number r, and calculating D=f(x)\n\nr^ei.  (I should make it clear that ^ is the power\n operator, not xor.)  D is what he sends to the bank,\n along with some information about what ei is, which tells\n the denomination of the cash, and also information about\n his account number.‚Äù  [Hal Finney, 1993-12-04]\n12.5.4. ‚ÄúWhat is happening with DigiCash?‚Äù\n\n\n\n\n‚ÄúPayment from any personal computer to any other\n workstation, over email or Internet, has been demonstrated\n for the first time, using electronic cash technology. ‚ÄúYou\n can pay for access to a database, buy software or a\n newsletter by email, play a computer game over the net,\n receive $5 owed you by a friend, or just order a pizza. The\n possibilities are truly unlimited‚Äù according to David\n Chaum, Managing Director of DigiCash TM, who announced and\n demonstrated the product during his keynote address at the\n first conference on the World Wide Web, in Geneva this\n week.‚Äù [DIGICASH PRESS RELEASE, ‚ÄúWorld‚Äôs first electronic\n cash payment over computer networks,‚Äù 1994-05-27]\nDigiCash is David Chaum‚Äôs company, set up to commercialize\n this work.

The Complexities of Digital Cash\nThere is no doubt as to the complexity: many protocols,\n semantic confusion, many parties, chances for collusion,\n spoofing, repudiation, and the like. And many derivative\n entities: agents, escrow services, banks.\nThere‚Äôs no substitute for thinking hard about various\n scenarios. Thinking about how to arrange off-line clearing,\n how to handle claims of people who claim their digital\n money was stolen, people who want various special kinds of\n services, such as receipts, and so on. It‚Äôs an ecology\n here, not just a set of simple equations.\n\n12.6. Online and Offline Clearing, Double Spending\n12.6.1. (this section still under construction)\n12.6.2. This is one of the main points of division between systems.\n12.6.3. Online Clearing\n\n(insert explanation)\n12.6.4. Offline Clearing\n(insert explanation)\n12.6.5. Double spending\nSome approaches involve constantly-growing-in-size coins at\n each transfer, so who spent the money first can be deduced\n (or variants of this). And N. Ferguson developed a system\n allowing up to N expenditures of the same coin, where N is\n a parameter. [Howard Gayle reminded me of this, 1994-08-29]\n‚ÄúWhy does everyone think that the law must immediately be\n invoked when double spending is detected?‚Ä¶.Double\n spending is an informational property of digital cash\n systems. Need we find malicious intent in a formal\n property?  The obvious moralism about the law and double\n spenders is inappropriate.  It evokes images of revenge and\n retribution, which are stupid, not to mention of negative\n economic value.‚Äù [Eric Hughes, 1994-08-27]  (This also\n relates to Eric‚Äôs good point that we too often frame crypto\n issue in terms of loaded terms like ‚Äúcheating,‚Äù ‚Äúspoofing,‚Äù\n and ‚Äúenemies,‚Äù when more neutral terms would carry less\n meaning-obscuring baggage and would not give our ‚Äúenemies‚Äù\n (:-}) the ammunition to pass laws based on such terms.)\n12.6.6. Issues\nChaum‚Äôs double-spending detection systems\n    \nChaum went to great lengths to develop system which\n preserve anonymity for single-spending instances, but\n which break anonymity and thus reveal identity for double-\n spending instances. I‚Äôm not sure what market forces\n caused him to think about this as being so important, but\n it creates many headaches. Besides being clumsy, it\n require physical ID, it invokes a legal system to try to\n collect from ‚Äúdouble spenders,‚Äù and it admits the\n extremely serious breach of privacy by enabling stings.\n For example, Alice pays Bob a unit of money, then quickly\n Alice spends that money before Bob can‚Ä¶Bob is then\n revealed as a ‚Äúdouble spender,‚Äù and his identity revealed\n to whomver wanted it‚Ä¶Alice, IRS, Gestapo, etc. A very\n broken idea. Acceptable mainly for small transactions.\n\n\nMulti-spending vs. on-line clearing\n    - I favor on-line clearing. Simply put: the first spending\n  is the only spending. The guy who gets to the train\n  locker where the cash is stored is the guy who gets it.\n  This ensure that the burden of maintaining the secret is\n  on the secret holder.\n    - When Alice and Bob transfer money, Alice makes the\n  transfer, Bob confirms it as valid (or verifies that his\n  bank has received the deposit), and the transaction is\n  complete.\n    - With network speeds increasing dramatically, on-line\n  clearing should be feasible for most transactions. Off-\n  line systems may of course be useful, especially for\n  small transactions, the ones now handled with coins and\n  small bills.\n  -\n12.6.7. ‚ÄúHow does on-line clearing of anonymous digital cash work?‚Äù\nThere‚Äôs a lot of math connected with blinding,\n exponentions, etc. See Schneier‚Äôs book for an introduction,\n or the various papers of Chaum, Brands, Bos, etc.\nOn-line clearing is similar to two parties in a transaction\n exchanging goods and money. The transaction is clearled\n locally, and immediately. Or they could arrange transfer of\n funds at a bank, and the banker could tell them over the\n phone that the transaction has cleared‚Äìtrue ‚Äúon-line\n clearing.‚Äù Debit cards work this way, with money\n transferred effectively immediately out of one account and\n into another. Credit cards have some additional wrinkles,\n such as the credit aspect, but are basically still on-line\n clearing.\nConceptually, the guiding principle idea is simple: he who\n gets to the train locker where the cash is stored first\n gets the cash. There can never be ‚Äúdouble spending,‚Äù only\n people who get to the locker and find no cash inside.\n Chaumian blinding allows the ‚Äútrain locker‚Äù (e.g., Credit\n Suisse) to give the money to the entity making the claim\n without knowing how the number correlates to previous\n numbers they ‚Äúsold‚Äù to other entities. Anonymity is\n preserved, absolutely. (Ignoring for this discussion issues\n of cameras watching the cash pickup, if it ever actually\n gets picked up.)\nOnce the ‚Äúhandshaking‚Äù of on-line clearing is accepted,\n based on the ‚Äúfirst to the money gets it‚Äù principle, then\n networks of such clearinghouses can thrive, as each is\n confident about clearing. (There are some important things\n needed to provide what I‚Äôll dub ‚Äúclosure‚Äù to the circuit.\n People need to ping the system, depositing and withdrawing,\n to establish both confidence and cover. A lot like remailer\n networks. In fact, very much like them.)\nIn on-line clearing, only a number is needed to make a\n transfer. Conceptually, that is. Just a number. It is up to\n the holder of the number to protect it carefully, which is\n as it should be (for reasons of locality, or self-\n responsibility, and because any other option introduces\n repudiation, disavowal, and the ‚ÄúTwinkies made me do it‚Äù\n sorts of nonsense). Once the number is transferred and\n reblinded, the old number no longer has a claim on the\n money stored at Credit Suisse, for example. That money is\n now out of the train locker and into a new one. (People\n always ask, ‚ÄúBut where is the money, really?‚Äù I see digital\n cash as claims on accounts in existing money-holding\n places, typically banks. There are all kinds of ‚Äúclaims‚Äù‚Äì\n Eric Hughes has regaled us with tales of his explorations\n of the world of commericial paper. My use of the term\n ‚Äúclaim‚Äù here is of the ‚ÄúYou present the right number, you\n get access‚Äù kind. Like the combination to a safe. The train\n locker idea makes this clearer, and gets around the\n confusion about ‚Äúdigimarks‚Äù of ‚Äúe$‚Äù actually being any\n kind of money it and of itself.)\n\n12.7.

Other Digital Money Systems\n12.8.1. ‚ÄúThere seem to be many variants‚Ä¶.what‚Äôs the story?‚Äù\n\nLots of confusion. Lots of systems that are not at all\n anonymous, that are just extensions of existing systems.\n The cachet of digital cash is such that many people are\n claiming their systems are ‚Äúdigital cash,‚Äù when of course\n they are not (at least not in the Chaum/Cypherpunk sense).\nSo, be careful. Caveat emptor.\n12.8.2. Crypto and Credit Cards (and on-line clearing)\nCryptographically secure digital cash may find a major use\n in effectively extending the modality of credit cards to\n low-level, person-to-person transactions.\n    \nThat is, the convenience of credit cards is one of their\n main uses (others being the advancing of actual credit,\n ignored here). In fact, secured credit cards and debit\n cards don‚Äôt offer this advancement of credit, but are\n mainly used to accrue the ‚Äúorder by phone‚Äù and ‚Äúavoid\n carrying cash‚Äù advantages.\nChecks offer the ‚Äúdon‚Äôt carry cash‚Äù advantage, but take\n time to clear. Traveller‚Äôs checks are a more pure form of\n this.\nBut individuals (like Alice and Bob) cannot presently use\n the credit card system for mutual transactions. I‚Äôm not\n sure of all the reasons. How might this change?\nCrypto can allow unforgeable systems, via some variant of\n digital signatures. That is, Alice can accept a phoned\n payment from Bob without ever being able to sign Bob‚Äôs\n electronic signature herself.\n\n\n‚ÄúCrypto Credit Cards‚Äù could allow end users (customers, in\n today‚Äôs system) to handle transactions like this, without\n having merchants as intermediaries.\nI‚Äôm sure the existing credit card outfits would have\n something to say about this, and there may be various\n roadblocks in the way. It might be best to buy off the VISA\n and MasterCard folks by working through them. (And they\n probably have studied this issue; what may change their\n positions is strong crypto, locally available to users.)\n(On-line clearing‚Äìto prevent double-spending and copying\n of cash‚Äìis an important aspect of many digital cash\n protocols, and of VISA-type protocols. Fortunately,\n networks are becoming ubiquitous and fast. Home use is\n still a can of worms, though, with competing standards\n based on video cable, fiber optics, ISDN, ATM, etc.)\n12.8.3.

Nick Szabo:\n\n\n‚ÄúInternet commercialization in itself is a huge issue\n full of pitfall and  opportunity: Mom & Pop BBS‚Äôs,\n commercial MUDs, data banks, for-profit pirate and porn\n boards, etc. are springing  up everywhere like weeds,\n opening a vast array of both needs of privacy and ways to\n abuse privacy.

If governments don‚Äôt want\n   anonymous cash, they can make things tough.\nAs both Perry Metzger and Eric Hughes have said many times,\n regulations can make life very difficult.

Prospects for Digital Cash Use\n12.10.1. ‚ÄúIf digital money is so great, why isn‚Äôt it being used?‚Äù\n\nHasn‚Äôt been finished. Protocols are still being researched,\n papers are still being published. In any single area, such\n as toll road payments, it may  be possible to deploy an\n application-specific system, but there is no ‚Äúgeneral‚Äù\n solution (yet). There is no ‚Äúdigital coin‚Äù or unforgeable\n object representing value, so the digital money area is\n more similar to the similarly nonsimple markets in\n financial instruments, commercial papers, bonds, warrants,\n checks, etc. (Areas that are not inherently simple and that\n have required lots of computerization and communications to\n make manageable.)\nFlakiness of Nets. Systems crash, mail gets delayed\n inexplicably, subscriptions to lists get lunched, and all\n sorts of other breakages occur. Most interaction on the\n Nets involves a fair amount of human adaptation to changing\n conditions, screwups, workarounds, etc. These are not\n conditions that inspire confidence in automated money\n systems!\nHard to Use. Few people will use systems that require\n generating code, clients, etc. Semantic gap (generating\n stuff on a Unix workstation is not at all like taking one‚Äôs\n checkbook out). Protocols in crypto are generally hard to\n use and confusing.\nLack of compelling need. Although people have tried various\n experiments with digital money tokens or coupons (Magic\n Money/Tacky Tokens, the HeX market, etc.), there is little\n real world incentive to experiment with them. And most of\n the denominated tokens are for truly trivial amounts of\n money, not for anything worth spending time learning. No\n marketplace for buyers to ‚Äúwander around in.‚Äù (You don‚Äôt\n buy what you don‚Äôt see.)\nLegal issues. The IRS does not look favorably on\n alternative currencies, especially if used in attempts to\n bypass ordinary tax collection schemes. This and related\n legal issues (redemptions into dollars) put a roadblock in\n front of serious plans to use digital money.\nResearch Issues. Not all problems resolved. Still being\n developed, papers being published. Chaum‚Äôs system does not\n seem to be fully ready for deployment, certainly not\n outside of well-defined vertical markets.\n12.10.2. ‚ÄúWhy isn‚Äôt digital money in use?‚Äù\nThe Meta Issue: what digital money? Various attempts at\n digital cash or digital money exist, but most are flawed,\n experimental, crufty, etc. Chaum‚Äôs DigiCash was announced\n (Web page, etc.), but is apparently not even remotely\n usable.\nPractical Reasons:\n    \nnothing to buy\nno standard systems that are straightforward to use\nadvantages of anonymity and untraceability are seldom\n exploited\n\n\nThe Magic Money/Tacky Tokens experiment on the Cypherpunks\n list is instrucive.

And the ‚Äúmessage in a bottle‚Äù\n nature fits in with anonymous remailers (with\n latency/delay), with message pools, and with other\n schemes to make traffic analysis harder. A ‚Äúclosed-\n loop,‚Äù responsive system is likelier to be traffic-\n analyzed by correlation of packets, etc.\nbut the sender does not know if it gets through (return\n receipts not commonly implemented‚Ä¶might be a nice\n feature to incorporate; agent-based systems\n (Telescript?) will certainly do this)\nthis open-loop nature makes protocols, negotiation,\n digital cash very tough to use‚Äìtoo much human\n intervention needed\nNote: These comments apply mainly to mail systems,\n which is where most of us have experimented with these\n ideas. Non-mail systems, such as Mosaic or telnet or\n the like, have better or faster feedback mechanisms and\n may be preferable for implementation of Cypherpunks\n goals. It may be that the natural focus on mailing\n lists, e-mail, etc., has distracted us. Perhaps a focus\n on MUDs, or even on ftp, would have been more\n fruitful‚Ä¶but we‚Äôre a mailing list, and most people\n are much more familiar with e-mail than with archie or\n gopher or WAIS, etc.\n\n\nThe legal and regulatory obstacles to a real system, used\n for real transactions, are formidable. (The obstacles to\n a ‚Äúplay‚Äù system are not so severe, but then play systems\n tend not to get much developer attention.)\n12.10.7. Scenario for deployment of digital cash\n\n\nEric Hughes has spent time looking into this. Too many\n issues to go into here, but he had this interesting\n scenario, repeated almost in toto here:\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very unlikely that a USA bank will be the one to\n deploy anonymous digital dollars first.  It‚Äôs much more\n likely that the first dollar digital cash will be issued\n overseas, possibly London.  By the same token, the non-\n dollar regulation on banks in this country is not the same\n as the dollar regulation, so it‚Äôs quite possible that the\n New York banks may be the first issuers of digital cash, in\n pounds sterling, say.\n‚ÄúThere will be two stages in actually deploying digital\n cash.  By digital cash, here, I mean a retail phenomenon,\n available anybody. The first will be to digitize money, and\n the second will be to anonymize it.  Efforts are already\n well underway to make more-or-less secure digital funds\n transfers with reasonably low transaction fees (not\n transaction costs, which are much more than just fees).\n These efforts, as long as they retain some traceability,\n will almost certainly succeed first in the marketplace,\n because (and this is vital) the regulatory environment\n against anonymity is not compromised.\n‚ÄúOnce, however, money has been digitized, one of the\n services available for purchase can be the anonymous\n transfer of funds.  I expect that the first digitization of\n money won‚Äôt be fully fungible.  For example, if you allow\n me to take money out of your checking account by automatic\n debit, there is risk that the money won‚Äôt be there when I\n ask for it.  Therefore that kind of money won‚Äôt be\n completely fungible, because money authorized from one\n person won‚Äôt be completely identical with money from\n another.  It may be a risk issue, it may be a timeliness\n issue, it may be a fee issue; I don‚Äôt know, but it‚Äôs\n unlikely to be perfect.\n‚ÄúNow, as the characteristic size of a business decreases,\n the relative costs of dealing with whatever imperfection\n there is will be greater. To wit, the small player will\n still have some problem getting paid, although certainly\n less than now.  Digital cash solves many of these problems.\n The clearing is immediate and final (no transaction\n reversals).  The number of entities to deal with is greatly\n reduced, hopefully to one.  The need and risk and cost of\n accounts receivables is eliminated.  It‚Äôs anonymous.  There\n will be services which will desire these advantages, enough\n to support a digital cash infrastructure.

Cypherpunks Experiments (‚ÄúMagic Money‚Äù)\n12.12.1. What is Magic Money?\n\n\n‚ÄúMagic Money is a digital cash system designed for use over\n electronic mail. The system is online and untraceable.\n Online means that each transaction involves an exchange\n with a server, to prevent double-spending. Untraceable\n means that it is impossible for anyone to trace\n transactions, or to match a withdrawal with a deposit, or\n to match two coins in any way.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThe system consists of two modules, the server and the\n client. Magic Money uses the PGP ascii-armored message\n format for all communication between the server and client.\n All traffic is encrypted, and messages from the server to\n the client are signed. Untraceability is provided by a\n Chaum-style blind signature. Note that the blind signature\n is patented, as is RSA. Using it for experimental purposes\n only shouldn‚Äôt get you in trouble.\n‚ÄúDigicash is represented by discrete coins, the\n denominations of which are chosen by the server operator.\n Coins are RSA-signed, with a different e/d pair for each\n denomination. The server does not store any money. All\n coins are stored by the client module. The server accepts\n old coins and blind- signs new coins, and checks off the\n old ones on a spent list.‚Äù\n [‚Ä¶rest of excellent summary elided‚Ä¶highly recommended\n that you dig it up (archives, Web site?) and read it]\n [Pr0duct Cypher, Magic Money Digicash System, 1992-02-04]\n\nMagic Money\n    \nftp://csn.org/pub/mpj/crypto_XXXXXX (or something like\n that) <Derek Atkins, 4-7-94>\nftp:csn.org//mpj/I_will_not_export/crypto_???????/pgp_too\n ls  <Michael Paul Johnson, 4-7-94>\n12.12.2.

Practical Issues and Concerns with Digital Cash\n12.13.1. ‚ÄúIs physical identity proof needed for on-line clearing?‚Äù\n\nNo, not if the cash outlook is taken. Cash is cash. Caveat\n emptor.\nThe ‚Äúfirst to the locker‚Äù approach causes the bank not to\n particularly care about this, just as a Swiss bank will\n allow access to a numbered account by presentation of the\n number, and perhaps a key. Identity proof may be needed,\n depending on the ‚Äúprotocol‚Äù they and the customer\n established, but it need not be. And the last thing the\n bank is worried about is being able to ‚Äúfind and prosecute‚Äù\n anyone, as there is no way they can be liable for a double\n spending incident. The beauties of local clearing! (Which\n is what gold coins do, and paper money if we really think\n we can pass it on to others.)\n12.13.2. ‚ÄúIs digital cash traceable?‚Äù\nThere are several flavors of ‚Äúdigital cash,‚Äù ranging from\n versions of VISA cards to fully untraceable (Chaumian)\n digital cash.\nThis comes up a lot, with people in Net newsgroups even\n warning others not to use digital cash because of the ease\n of traceability. Not so.\n‚ÄúNot the kind proposed by David Chaum and his colleagues in\n the Netherlands. The whole thrust of their research over\n the last decade has been the use of cryptographic\n techniques to make electronic transactions secure from\n fraud while at the same time protecting personal privacy.\n They, and others, have developed a number of schemes for\n UNTRACEABLE digital cash.‚Äù [Kevin Van Horn,\n talk.politics.crypto, 1994-07-03]\n12.13.3. ‚ÄúIs there a danger that people will lose the numbers that\n   they need to redeem money? That someone could steal the\n   number and thus steal their money?‚Äù\nSure. There‚Äôs the danger that I‚Äôll lose my bearer bonds, or\n forget my Swiss bank account number, or lose my treasure\n map to where I buried my money (as Alan Turing supposedly\n did in WW II).\nPeople can take steps to limit risk. More secure computers.\n Dongles worn around their necks. Protocols that involve\n biometric authentication to their local computer or key\n storage PDA, etc. Limits on withdrawals per day, etc.\n People can store key numbers with people they trust,\n perhaps encrypted with other keys, can leave them with\n their lawyers, etc. All sorts of arrangements can be made.\n Personal identification is but one of these arrangements.\n Often used, but not essential to the underlyng protocol.\n Again, the Swiss banks (maybe now the Liechtenstein\n anstalts are a better example) don‚Äôt require physical ID\n for all accounts. (More generally, if Charles wants to\n create a bank in which deposits are made and then given out\n to the first person who sings the right tune, why should we\n care? This extreme example is useful in pointing out that\n contractual arrangements need not involve governmental or\n societal norms about what constitutes proof of identity.)\n\n12.14. Cyberspace and Digital Money\n12.14.1. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt eat cyberspace, so what good is digital money?‚Äù\n\nThis comes up a lot. People assume there is no practical\n way to transfer assets, when in fact it is done all the\n time. That is, money flows from the realm of the purely\n ‚Äúinformational‚Äù realm to the physcial realm Consultants,\n writers, traders, etc., all use their heads and thereby\n earn real money.\nSame will apply to cyberspace.\n12.14.2. ‚ÄúHow can I remain anonymous when buying physical items using\n   anonymous digital cash?‚Äô\nVery difficult. Once you are seen, and your picture can be\n taken( perhaps unknown to you), databases will have you.\n Not much can be done about this.\nPeople have proposed schemes for anonymous shipment and\n pickup, but the plain fact is that physical delivery of any\n sort compromises anonymity, just as in the world today.\nThe purpose of anonymous digital cash is partly to at least\n make it more difficult, to not give Big Brother your\n detailed itinerary from toll road movements, movie theater\n payments, etc. To the extent that physical cameras can\n still track cars, people, shipments, etc., anonymous\n digital cash doesn‚Äôt solve this surveillance problem.\n\n12.15. Outlawing of Cash\n12.15.1. ‚ÄúWhat are the motivations for outlawing cash?‚Äù\n\n(Note: This has not happened. Many of us see signs of it\n happening. Others are skeptical.)\nReasons for the Elimination of Cash:\n    \nWar on Drugs‚Ä¶.need I say more?\nsurface the underground economy, by withdrawing paper\ncurrency and forcing all monetary transaction into forms\nthat can be easily monitored, regulated, and taxed.\ntax avoidance, under the table economy (could also be\n motive for tamper-resistant cash registers, with spot\n checks to ensure compliance)\nwelfare, disability, pension, social security auto-\n deposits\n        \nfraud, double-dipping\nreduce theft of welfare checks, disability payments,\n etc‚Ä¶.a problem in some locales, and automatic\n deposit/cash card approaches are being evaluated.\n\n\ngeneral reduction in theft, pickpockets\nreduction of paperwork: all transfers electronic (could\n be part of a ‚Äúreinventing government‚Äù initiative)\nillegal immigrants, welfare cheats, etc. Give everyone a\nNational Identity Card (they‚Äôll call it something\ndifferent. to make it more palatable, such as ‚ÄúSocial\nServices Portable Inventory Unit‚Äù or ‚ÄúHealth Rights\nDocument‚Äù).\n(Links to National Health Care Card, to Welfare Card,\n to other I.D. schemes designed to reduce fraud, track\n citizen-units, etc.)\nrationing systems that depend on non-cash transactions\n (as explained elsewhere, market distortions from\n rationing systems generally require identification,\n correlation to person or group, etc.)\n        \nthis rationing can included subsidized prices, denial\n of access (e.g., certain foods denied to certain\n people)\n12.15.2. Lest this be considered paranoid ranting, let me point out\n that many actions have already been taken that limit the form\n of money (banking laws, money laundering, currency\n restrictions‚Ä¶even the outlawing of competing currencies\n itself)\n12.15.3. Dangers of outlawing cash\n\n\n\n\nWould freeze out all transactions, giving Big Brother\n unprecedented power (unless the non-cash forms were\n anonymous, a la Chaum and the systems we support)\nWould allow complete traceability‚Ä¶.like the cellular\n phones that got Simpson\n666, Heinlein, Shockwave Rider, etc.\n12.15.4. Given that there is no requirement for identity to be\n   associated with money, we should fight any system which\n   proposed to link the two.\n12.15.5. The value of paying cash\nmakes a transaction purely local, resolved on the spot\nthe alternative, a complicated accounting system involving\n other parties, etc., is much less attractive\ntoo many transactions these days are no longer handled in\n cash, which increases costs and gets other parties involved\n where they shouldn‚Äôt be involved.\n12.15.6. ‚ÄúWill people accept the banning of cash?‚Äù\nThere was a time when I would‚Äôve said Americans, at least,\n would‚Äôve rejected such a thing. Too many memories of\n ‚ÄúPapieren, bitte. Macht schnell!‚Äù But I now think most\n Americans (and Europeans) are so used to producing\n documents for every transaction, and so used to using VISA\n cards and ATM cards at gas stations, supermarkets, and even\n at flea markets, that they‚Äôll willingly‚Äìeven eagerly‚Äì\n adopt such a system.\n\n12.16. Novel Opportunities\n12.16.1. Encrypted open books, or anonymous auditing\n\nEric Hughes has worked on a scheme using a kind of blinding\n to do ‚Äúencrypted open books,‚Äù whereby observers can verify\n that a bank is balancing its books without more detailed\n looks at individual accounts. (I have my doubts about\n spoofs, attacks, etc., but such are always to be considered\n in any new protocol.)\n\n‚ÄúKent Hastings wondered how an offshore bank could provide\n assurances to depositors.  I wondered the same thing a few\n months ago, and started working on what Perry calls the\n anonymous auditing problem.  I have what I consider to be\n the core of a solution.\n ‚Ä¶The following is long‚Ä¶. [TCM Note: Too long to include\n here. I am including just enough to convince readers that\n some new sorts of banking ideas may come out of\n cryptography.]\n‚ÄúIf we use the contents of the encrypted books at the\n organizational boundary points to create suitable legal\n opbligations, we can mostly ignore what goes on inside of\n the mess of random numbers.  That is, even if double books\n were being kept, the legal obligations created should\n suffice to ensure that everything can be unwound if needed.\n This doesn‚Äôt prevent networks of corrupt businesses from\n going down all at once, but it does allow networks of\n honest businesses to operate with more assurance of\n honesty.‚Äù [Eric Hughes,  PROTOCOL: Encrypted Open Books,\n 1993-08-16]\n12.16.2. ‚ÄúHow can software components be sold, and how does crypto\n   figure in?‚Äù\n\nReusable Software, Brad Cox, Sprague, etc.\n    \ngood article in ‚ÄúWired‚Äù (repeated in ‚ÄúOut of Control‚Äù)\n\n\nFirst, certainly software is sold. The issues is why the\n ‚Äúsoftware components‚Äù market has not yet developed, and why\n such specific instances of software as music, art, text,\n etc., have not been sold in smaller chunks.\nInternet commerce is a huge area of interest, and future\n development.\n    \ncurrently developing very slowly\nlots of conflicting information‚Ä¶several mailing\n lists‚Ä¶lots of hype\n\n\nDigital cash is often cited as a needed enabling tool, but\n I think the answer is more complicated than that.\n    \nissues of convenience\nissues of there being no recurring market (as there is\n in, say, the chip business‚Ä¶software doesn‚Äôt get bought\n over and over again, in increasing unit volumes)\n\n\n\n12.17. Loose Ends\n12.17.1. Reasons to have no government involvement in commerce\n\nEven a small involvement, through special regulations,\n granted frachises, etc., produces vested interests. For\n example, those in a community who had to wait to get\n building permits want others to wait just as long, or\n longer. Or, businesses that had to meet certain standard,\n even if unreasonable, will demand that new businesses do so\n also. The effect is an ever-widening tar pit of rules,\n restrictions, and delays. Distortions of the market result.\nLook at how hard it is for the former U.S.S.R. to\n disentangle itself from 75 years of central planning. They\n are now an almost totally Mafia-controlled state (by this I\n mean that ‚Äúprivatization‚Äù of formerly non-private\n enterprises benefitted those who had amassed money and\n influence, and that these were mainly the Russian Mafia and\n former or current politicians‚Ä¶the repercussions of this\n ‚Äúcorrupt giveaway‚Äù will be felt for decades to come).\n    \nAn encouraging sign: The thriving black market in Russia-\n -which all Cypherpunks of course cheer‚Äìwill gradually\n displace the old business systems with new ones, as in\n all economies. Eventually the corruptly-bought businesses\n will sink or swim based on merit, and newly-created\n enterprises will compete with them.\n12.17.2. ‚ÄúPurist‚Äù Approach to Keys, Cash, Responsibility\n\n\nThere are two main approaches to the issue:\n    \nKey owner is responsible for uses of his key\nor, Others are responsible\n\n\nThere may be mixed situations, such as when a key is\n stolen‚Ä¶but this needs also to be planned-for by the key\n owner, by use of protocols that limit exposure. For\n example, few people will use a single key that accesses\n immediately their net worth‚Ä¶most people will partition\n their holding and their keyed access in such a way as to\n naturally limit exposure if any particular key is lost or\n compromised. Or forgotten.\n    \ncould involve their bank holding keys, or escrow agents\nor n-out-of-m voting systems\n\n\nContracts are the essence‚Ä¶what contracts do people\n voluntarily enter into?\nAnd locality‚Äìwho better to keep keys secure than the\n owner? Anything that transfers blame to ‚Äúthe banks‚Äù or to\n ‚Äúsociety‚Äù breaks the feedback loop of responsibility,\n provides an ‚Äúout‚Äù for the lazy, and encourages fraud\n (people who disavow contracts by claiming their key was\n stolen).\n\n\nActivism and Projects\n\n13.1. copyright\n   THE  CYPHERNOMICON: Cypherpunks FAQ and More, Version 0.666,\n   1994-09-10, Copyright Timothy C.

SUMMARY: Activism and Projects\n13.2.1. Main Points\n13.2.2. Connections to Other Sections\n13.2.3. Where to Find Additional Information\n13.2.4. Miscellaneous Comments\n13.3. Activism is a Tough Job\n13.3.1. ‚Äúherding cats‚Äù..trying to change the world through\n   exhortation seems a particulary ineffective notion\n13.3.2. There‚Äôs always been a lot of wasted time and rhetoric on the\n   Cypherpunks list as various people tried to get others to\n   follow their lead, to adopt their vision. (Nothing wrong with\n   this, if done properly. If someone leads by example, or has a\n   particularly compelling vision or plan, this may naturally\n   happen. Too often, though, the situation was that someone‚Äôs\n   vague plans for a product were declared by them to be the\n   standards that others should follow. Various schemes for\n   digital money, in many forms and modes, has always been the\n   prime example of this.)\n13.3.3. This is related also to what Kevin Kelley calls ‚Äúthe fax\n   effect.‚Äù When few people own fax machines, they‚Äôre not of\n   much use. Trying to get others to use the same tools one has\n   is like trying to convince people to buy fax machines so that\n   you can communicate by fax with them‚Ä¶it may happen, but\n   probably for other reasons. (Happily, the interoperability of\n   PGP provided a common communications medium that had been\n   lacking with previous platform-specific cipher programs.)\n13.3.4. Utopian schemes are also a tough sell. Schemes about using\n   digital money to make inflation impossible, schemes to\n   collect taxes with anonymous systems, etc.\n13.3.5. Harry Browne‚Äôs ‚ÄúHow I Found Freedom in an Unfree World‚Äù is\n   well worth reading; he advises against getting upset and\n   frustrated that the world is not moving in the direction one\n   would like.\n13.4. Cypherpunks Projects\n13.4.1. ‚ÄúWhat are Cypherpunks projects?‚Äù\n\nAlways a key part‚Äìperhaps the key part‚Äìof Cypherpunks\n activity. ‚ÄúCypherpunks write code.‚Äù From work on PGP to\n remailers to crypto toolkits to FOIA requests, and a bunch\n of other things, Cypherpunks hack the system in various\n ways.\nMatt Blaze‚Äôs LEAF blower, Phil Karn‚Äôs ‚ÄúswIPe‚Äù system, Peter\n Wayner‚Äôs articles‚Ä¶.all are examples. (Many Cypherpunks\n projects are also done, or primarily done, for other\n reasons, so we cannot in all cases claim credit for this\n work.)\n13.4.2. Extensions to PGP\n13.4.3.

Eric Blossom\n even showed a\n        \nPCB of one at a Cypherpunks meeting, using an\n inexpensive DSP chip.\n-\nSoftware-only versions, with some compromises in speech\n quality\n            \nprobably, are also underway. Phil Zimmermann\n described his progress at\n\nthe last Cypherpunks meeting.\n\n(‚ÄúSoftware-only‚Äù can mean using off-the-shelf, widely-\n available DSP\n\nboards like SoundBlasters.)\n\nAnd I know of at least two more such projects.\n Whether any will\n\nmaterialize is anyone‚Äôs guess.\n\nAnd various hacks have already been done. NeXT users\n have had\nvoicemail for years, and certain Macs now offer\n something similar.\n\nAdding encryption is not a huge obstacle.\n\nA year ago, several Cypherpunks meeting sites around\n the U.S. were\nlinked over the Internet using DES encryption. The\n sound quality was\npoor, for various reasons, and we turned off the DES\n in a matter of\nminutes. Still, an encrypted audio conference call.\n13.4.8.

Coincidence?\n\n\nInformal Explanation\n        \nNote: I‚Äôve posted this explanation, and variants,\n several times since I first wrote it in mid-1992. In\n fact, I first posted it on the ‚ÄúExtropians‚Äù mailing\n list, as ‚ÄúCypherpunks‚Äù did not then exist.\n\nThree Cypherpunks are having dinner, perhaps in Palo\n Alto. Their waiter tells them that their bill has\n already been paid, either by the NSA or by one of them.\n The waiter won‚Äôt say more. The Cypherpunks wish to know\n whether one of them paid, or the NSA paid. But they\n don‚Äôt want to be impolite and force the Cypherpunk\n payer to ‚Äòfess up, so they carry out this protocol (or\n procedure):\nEach Cypherpunk flips a fair coin behind a menu placed\n upright between himself and the Cypherpunk on his\n right. The coin is visible to himself AND to the\n Cypherpunk on his left. Each Cypherpunk can see his own\n coin and the coin to his right. (STOP RIGHT HERE!\n Please take the time to make a sketch of the situation\n I‚Äôve described. If you lost it here, all that follows\n will be a blur. It‚Äôs too bad the state of the Net today\n cannot support figures and diagrams easily.)\nEach Cypherpunk then states out loud whether the two\n coins he can see are the SAME or are DIFFERENT, e.g.,\n ‚ÄúHeads-Tails‚Äù means DIFFERENT, and so forth. For now,\n assume the Cypherpunks are truthful. A little bit of\n thinking shows that the total number of ‚ÄúDIFFERENCES‚Äù\n must be either 0 (the coins all came up the same), or\n\nOdd parity is impossible.\n\nNow the Cypherpunks agree that if one of them paid, he\n or she will SAY THE OPPOSITE of what they actually see.\n Remember, they don‚Äôt announce what their coin turned up\n as, only whether it was the same or different as their\n neighbor.\nSuppose none of them paid, i.e., the NSA paid. Then\n they all report the truth and the parity is even\n (either 0 or 2 differences). They then know the NSA\n paid.\nSuppose one of them paid the bill. He reports the\n opposite of what he actually sees, and the parity is\n suddenly odd. That is, there is 1 difference reported.\n The Cypherpunks now know that one of them paid. But can\n they determine which one?\nSuppose you are one of the Cypherpunks and you know you\n didn‚Äôt pay. One of the other two did. You either\n reported SAME or DIFFERENT, based on what your neighbor\n to the right (whose coin you can see) had. But you\n can‚Äôt tell which of the other two is lying! (You can\n see you right-hand neighbor‚Äôs coin, but you can‚Äôt see\n the coin he sees to his right!)\nThis all generalizes to any number of people. If none\n of them paid, the parity is even. If one of them paid,\n the parity is odd. But which one of them paid cannot be\n deduced. And it should be clear that each round can\n transmit a bit, e.g., ‚ÄúI paid‚Äù is a ‚Äú1‚Äù. The message\n ‚ÄúAttack at dawn‚Äù could thus be ‚Äúsent‚Äù untraceably with\n multiple rounds of the protocol.\n\nThe ‚ÄúCrypto Ouija Board‚Äù: I explain this to people as a\n kind of ouija board. A message, like ‚ÄúI paid‚Äù or a more\n interesting ‚ÄúTransfer funds from‚Ä¶..,‚Äù just ‚Äúemerges‚Äù\n out of the group, with no means of knowing where it\n came from. Truly astounding.\n\n\nProblems and Pitfalls\n        \nIn Chaum‚Äôs paper, the explanation above is given\n quickly, in a few pages. The rest of the paper is\n then devoted to dealing with the many ‚Äúgotchas‚Äù and\n attacks that come up and that must be dealt with before\n the DC protocol is even remotely possible. I think all\n those interested in protocol design should read this\n paper, and the follow-on papers by Bos, Pfitzmann,\n etc., as object lessons for dealing with complex crypto\n protocols.\nThe Problems:\n            \n\n\n\nCollusion. Obviously the Cypherpunks can collude\n to deduce the payer. This is best dealt with by\n creating multiple subcircuits (groups doing the\n protocol amongst themselves). Lots more stuff here.\n Chaum devotes most of the paper to these kind of\n issues and their solutions.\n\n\nWith each round of this protocol, a single bit is\n transmitted. Sending a long message means many coin\n flips. Instead of coins and menus, the neighbors\n would exchange lists of random numbers (with the\n right partners, as per the protocol above, of course.\n Details are easy to figure out.)\n\n\nSince the lists are essentially one-time pads, the\n protocol is unconditionally secure, i.e., no\n assumptions are made about the difficulty of\n factoring large numbers or any other crypto\n assumptions.\n\n\nParticipants in such a ‚ÄúDC-Net‚Äù (and here we are\n coming to the heart of the ‚Äúcrypto anarchy‚Äù idea)\n could exchange CD-ROMs or DATs, giving them enough\n ‚Äúcoin flips‚Äù for zillions of messages, all\n untraceable! The logistics are not simple, but one\n can imagine personal devices, like smart card or\n Apple ‚ÄúNewtons,‚Äù that can handle these protocols\n (early applications may be for untraceable\n brainstorming comments, secure voting in corportate\n settings, etc.)\n\n\nThe lists of random numbers (coin flips) can be\n generated with standard cryptographic methods,\n requiring only a key to be exchanged between the\n appropriate participants. This eliminates the need\n for the one-time pad, but means the method is now\n only cryptographically secure, which is often\n sufficient. (Don‚Äôt think ‚Äúonly cryptographically\n secure‚Äù means insecure‚Ä¶.the messages may remain\n encrypted for the next billion years)\n\n\nCollisions occur when multiple messages are sent\n at the same time. Various schemes can be devised to\n handle this, like backing off when you detect another\n sender (when even parity is seen instead of odd\n parity). In large systems this is likely to be a\n problem. Deliberate disruption, or spamming, is a\n major problem‚Äìa disruptor can shut down the DC-net\n by sending bits out. As with remailes, anonymity\n means freedom from detection. (Anonymous payments to\n send a message may help, but the details are murky to\n me.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUses\n        \n\n\nUntraceable mail. Useful for avoiding censorship, for\n avoiding lawsuits, and for all kinds of crypto anarchy\n things.\n\n\n\n\nFully anonymous bulletin boards, with no traceability\n of postings or responses. Illegal materials can be\n offered for sale (my 1987 canonical example, which\n freaked out a few people: ‚ÄúStealth bomber blueprints\n for sale. Post highest offer and include public key.‚Äù).\n Think for a few minutes about this and you‚Äôll see the\n profound implications.\n\n\n\n\nDecentralized nexus of activity. Since messages\n ‚Äúemerge‚Äù (a la the ouija board metaphor), there is no\n central posting area. Nothing for the government to\n shut down, complete deniability by the participants.\n\n\n\n\nOnly you know who your a partners are‚Ä¶.in any given\n circuit. And you can be in as many circuits as you\n wish. (Payments can be made to others, to create a\n profit motive. I won‚Äôt deal with this issue, or with\n the issue of how reputations are handled, here.)\n\n\n\n\nIt should be clear that DC-nets offer some amazing\n opportunities. They have not been implemented at all, and\n have received almost no attention compared to ordinary\n Cypherpunks remailers. Why is this? The programming\n complexity (and the underlying cryptographic primitives\n that are needed) seems to be the key. Several groups have\n announced plans to imlement some form of DC-net, but\n nothing has appeared.\n\n\nsoftware vs. hardware,\nYanek Martinson, Strick, Austin group, Rishab\nIMO, this is an ideal project for testing the efficacy of\n software toolkits. The primitives needed, including bit\n commitment, synchronization, and collusion handling, are\n severe tests of crypto systems. On the downside, I doubt\n that even the Pfaltzmans or Bos has pulled off a running\n simulation‚Ä¶\n13.4.9. D-H sockets, UNIX, swIPe\nswIPe\n    \nMatt Blaze, John I.

Some have already occurred.

The Net played a\n major role‚Äìperhaps the dominant role‚Äìin generating scorn\n for Clipper. In many way the themes debated here on the Net\n have tremendous influence on media reaction, on editorials,\n on organizational reactions, and of course on the opinion\n of technical folks.

Often these flamers end up leaving the list.\nGeography may play a role, as folks in otherwise-isolated\n areas seem to get more attached to their ideas and then get\n angry when the list as a whole does not adopt them (this is\n my impression, at least).\n13.6.5. Crypto faces the complexity barrier that all technologies\n   face\nLife has gotten more complicated in some ways, simpler in\n other ways (we don‚Äôt have to think about cooking, about\n shoeing the horses, about the weather, etc.). Crypto is\n currently fairly complicated, especially if multiple\n paradigms are used (encryption, signing, money, etc.).\nAs a personal note, I‚Äôm practically drowning in a.c.\n adaptors and power cords for computers, laser printers,\n VCRs, camcorders, portable stereos, laptop computers,\n guitars, etc. Everything with a rechargeable battery has to\n be charged, but not overcharged, and not allowed to run-\n down‚Ä¶I forgot to plug in my old Powerbook 100 for a\n couple of months, and the lead-acid batteries went out on\n me. Personally, I‚Äôm drowning in this crap.\nI mention this only because I sense a backlash\n coming‚Ä¶people will say ‚Äúscrew it‚Äù to new technology that\n actually complicates their lives more than it simplifies\n their lives. ‚ÄúCrypto tweaks‚Äù who like to fool around with\n ‚Äúcreating a client‚Äù in order to play with digital cash will\n continue to do so, but 99% of the sought-after users won‚Äôt.\n (A nation that can‚Äôt‚Äìor won‚Äôt‚Äìset its VCR clock will\n hardly embrace the complexities of digital cash. Unless\n things change, and use becomes as easy as using an ATM.)\n13.6.6. ‚ÄúHow can we get more people to worry about security in\n   general and encryption in particular?‚Äù\n\nFact is, most people never think about real security. Safe\n manufacturers have said that improvements in safes were\n driven by insurance rates. A direct incentive to spend more\n money to improve security (cost of better safe < cost of\n higher insurance rate).\nRight now there is almost no economic incentive for people\n to worry about PIN security, about protecting their files,\n etc. (Banks eat the costs and pass them on‚Ä¶any bank which\n tried to save a few bucks in losses by requiring 10-digit\n PINs‚Äìwhich people would write down anyway!‚Äìwould lose\n customers. Holograms and pictures on bank cards are\n happening because the costs have dropped enough.)\nPersonally, my main interests is in ensuring the Feds don‚Äôt\n tell me I can‚Äôt have as much security as I want to buy. I\n don‚Äôt share the concern quoted above that we have to find\n ways to give other people security.\n\nOthers disagree with my nonchalance, pointing out that\n getting lots of other people to use crypto makes it easier\n for those who already protect themselves. I agree, I just\n don‚Äôt focus on missionary work.\nFor those so inclined, point out to people how vulnerable\n their files are, how the NSA can monitor the Net, and so\n on. All the usual scare stories.\n\n13.7. Political Action and Opposition\n13.7.1. Strong political action is emerging on the Net\n\nright-wing conspiracy theorists, like Linda Thompson\nNet has rapid response to news events (Waco, Tienenmen,\n Russia)\n    \nwith stories often used by media (lots of reporters on\n Net, easy to cull for references, Net has recently become\n tres trendy)\n\n\nAryan Nation in Cyberspace\n(These developments bother many people I mention them to.\n Nothing can be done about who uses strong crypto. And most\n fasicst/racist situations are made worse by state\n sponsorship‚Äìapartheid laws, Hitler‚Äôs Germany, Pol Pot‚Äôs\n killing fields, all were examples of the state enforcing\n racist or genocidal laws. The unbreakable crypto that the\n Aryan Nation gets is more than offset by the gains\n elsewhere, and the undermining of central authority.)\nshows the need for strong crypto‚Ä¶else governments will\n infiltrate and monitor these political groups\n13.7.2. Cypherpunks and Lobbying Efforts\n‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt Cypherpunks have a lobbying effort?‚Äù\n    \nwe‚Äôre not ‚Äúcentered‚Äù near Washington, D.C., which seems\n to be an essential thing (as with EFF, ACLU, EPIC, CPSR,\n etc.)\n        \nD.C. Cypherpunks once volunteered (April, 1993) to make\n this their special focus, but not much has been heard\n since.

(support by them for\n public access programs, subsidies, restrictions on\n businesses, etc.)\nWe‚Äôre also a more radical group in nearly every way, with\n various flavors of political extremism strongly\n represented. Mostly anarcho-capitalists and strong\n libertarians, and many ‚Äúno compromises‚Äù privacy advocates.\n (As usual, my apologies to any Maoists or the like who\n don‚Äôt feel comfortable being lumped in with the\n libertarians‚Ä¶.if you‚Äôre out there, you‚Äôre not speaking\n up.)

We can represent a\n radical alternative to the Beltway lawyers that dominate\n EFF, EPIC, etc. No need to compromise on things like\n Clipper, Software Key Escrow, Digital Telephony, and the\n NII. But, of course, no input to the legislative process.\nBut there‚Äôs often an advantage to having a much more\n radical, purist body out in the wings, making the\n ‚Äúrejectionist‚Äù case and holding the inner circle folks to a\n tougher standard of behavior.\nAnd of course there‚Äôs the omnipresent difference that we\n tend to favor direct action through technology over\n politicking.\n13.7.6.

This may me in trouble with my remaining friends at the EFF,\n   but it‚Äôs as if a lobbying groups in Germany saw the\n   handwriting on the wall about the Final Solution, deemed it\n   essentially unstoppable, and so sent their leaders to\n   Berchtesgaden/Camp David to make sure that the death of the\n   Jews was made as painless as possible.

The flakiness of current systems‚Ä¶\nThe current crypto infrastructure is fairly flaky, though\n the distributed web-of-trust model is better than some\n centralized system, of coure. What I mean is that many\n aspects are slow, creaky, and conducive to errors.\nIn the area of digital cash, what we have now is not even\n as advanced as was seen with real money in Sumerian times!\n (And I wouldn‚Äôt trust the e-mail ‚Äúmessage in a bottle‚Äù\n approach for any nontrivial financial transactions.)\nSomething‚Äôs got to change. The NII/Superhighway/Infobahn\n people have plans, but their plans are not likely to mesh\n well with ours. A challenge for us to consider.\n13.11.5. ‚ÄúAre there dangers in being too paranoid?‚Äù\nAs Eric Hughes put it,  ‚Äúparanoia is cryptography‚Äôs\n occupational hazard.‚Äù\n    \n\n‚ÄúThe effect of paranoia is self-delusion of the following\n form‚Äìthat one‚Äôs possible explanations are skewed toward\n malicious attacks, by individuals, that one has the\n technical knowledge to anticipate.  This skewing creates\n an inefficient allocation of mental energy, it tends\n toward the personal, downplaying the possibility of\n technical error, and it begins to close off examination\n of technicalities not fully understood.\n‚ÄúThose who resist paranoia will become better at\n cryptography than those who do not, all other things\n being equal.  Cryptography is about epistemology, that\n is, assurances of truth, and only secondarily about\n ontology, that is, what actually is true.  The goal of\n cryptography is to create an accurate confidence that a\n system is private and secure. In order to create that\n confidence, the system must actually be secure, but\n security is not sufficient.  There must be confidence\n thatthe way by which this security becomes to be believed\n is robust and immune to delusion.\n‚ÄúParanoia creates delusion.  As a direct and fundamental\n result, it makes one worse at cryptography.  At the\n outside best, it makes one slower, as the misallocation\n of attention leads one down false trails. Who has the\n excess brainpower for that waste?  Certainly not I.  At\n the worst, paranoia makes one completely ineffective, not\n only in technical means but even more so in the social\n context in which cryptography is necessarily relevant.‚Äù\n [Eric Hughes, 1994-05-14]\n\n\n\nKing Alfred Plan, blacks\n    \nplans to round up 20 million blacks\nRFK, links to LAPD, Western Goals, Birch, KKK\nRFA #9, 23, 38\norganized crime situation, perhaps intelligence\ncommunity\ndamaging to blacks, psychological\n13.11.6.

The ‚Äúreasonableness‚Äù trap\nmaking a reasonable thing into a mandatory thing\nthis applies to what Cypherpunks should ever be prepared to\n support\nAn example: A restaurant offers to replace dropped items\n (dropped on the floor, literally) for free‚Ä¶a reasonable\n thing to offer customers (something I see frequently). So\n why not make it the law? Because then the reasonable\n discretion of the restaurant owner would be lost, and some\n customers could ‚Äúgame against‚Äù (exploit the letter of the\n law) the system. Even threaten lawsuits.\n    \n(And libertarians know that ‚Äúmy house, my rules‚Äù applies\n to restaurants and other businesses, absent a contract\n spelling exceptions out.)\n\n\nA more serious example is when restaurants (again) find it\n ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù to hire various sorts of qualified people.\n What may be ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù is one thing, but too often the\n government decides to formalize this and takes away the\n right to choose. (In my opinion, no person or group has any\n ‚Äúright‚Äù to a job unless the employer freely offers it. Yes,\n this could included discrimination against various groups.\n Yes, we may dislike this. But the freedom to choose is a\n much more basic right than achieving some ideal of equality\n is.)\nAnd when ‚Äúreasonableness‚Äù is enforced by law, the game-\n playing increases. In effect, some discretion is needed to\n reject claims that are based on gaming. Markets naturally\n work this way, as no ‚Äúbasic rights‚Äù or contracts are being\n violated.\nFortunately, strong crypto makes this nonsense impossible.\n Perforce, people will engage in contracts only voluntarily.\n13.11.8. ‚ÄúHow do we get agreement on protocols?‚Äù\nGive this idea up immediately! Agreement to behave in\n certain ways is almost never possible.\nIs this an indictment of anarchy?\nNo, because the way agreement is sort of reached is through\n standards or examplars that people can get behind. Thus, we\n don‚Äôt get ‚Äúconsensus‚Äù in advance on the taste of Coca\n Cola‚Ä¶somebody offers Coke for sale and then the rest is\n history.\nPGP is a more relevant example. The examplar is on a ‚Äútake\n it or leave it‚Äù basis, with minor improvements made by\n others, but within the basic format.\n\n\nOther Advanced Crypto Applications\n\n14.1. copyright\n   THE  CYPHERNOMICON: Cypherpunks FAQ and More, Version 0.666,\n   1994-09-10, Copyright Timothy C.

Digital Timestamping\n14.3.1. digital timestamping\n\n\nThe canonical reference for digital timestamping is the\n work of Stu Haber and Scott Stornetta, of Bellcore. Papers\n presented at various Crypto conferences. Their work\n involves having the user compute a hash of the document he\n wishes to be stamped and sending the hash to them, where\n they merge this hash with other hashes (and all previous\n hashes, via a tree system) and then they publish the\n resultant hash in a very public and hard-to-alter forum,\n such as in an ad in the Sunday ‚ÄúNew York Times.‚Äù\nIn their parlance, such an ad is a ‚Äúwidely witnessed\n event,‚Äù and attempts to alter all or even many copies of\n the newspaper would be very difficult and expensive. (In a\n sense, this WWE is similar to the ‚Äúbeacon‚Äù term Eric Hughes\n used.)\nHaber and Stornetta plan some sort of commercial operation\n to do this.\nThis service has not yet been tested in court, so far as I\n know. The MIT server is an experiment, and is probably\n useful for experimenting. But it is undoubtedly even less\n legally significant, of course.\n14.3.2. my summary\n\n\n14.4.

Timed-Release Crypto\n14.5.1. ‚ÄúCan anything like a ‚Äúcryptographic time capsule‚Äù be built?‚Äù\n\nThis would be useful for sealing diaries and records in\n such a way that no legal bodies could gain access, that\n even the creator/encryptor would be unable to decrypt the\n records. Call it ‚Äútime escrow.‚Äù Ironically, a much more\n correct use of the term ‚Äúescrow‚Äù than we saw with the\n government‚Äôs various ‚Äúkey escrow‚Äù schemes.\nMaking records undecryptable is easy: just use a one-way\n function and the records are unreachable forever. The trick\n is to have a way to get them back at some future time.\nApproaches:\n    \nLegal Repository. A lawyer or set of lawyers has the key\n or keys and is instructed to release them at some future\n time. (The key-holding agents need not be lawyers, of\n course, though that is the way things are now done.\n        \nThe legal system is a time-honored way of protecting\n secrets of various kinds, and any system based on\n cryptography needs to compete strongly with this simple\n to use, well-established system.\nIf the lawyer‚Äôs identity is known, he can be\n subpoenaed. Depends on jurisdictional issues, future\n political climate, etc.\nBut identity-hiding protocols can be used, so that the\n lawyer cannot be reached. All that is know, for\n example, is that ‚Äúsomewhere out there‚Äù is an agent who\n is holding the key(s). Reputation-based systems should\n work well here: the agent gains little and loses a lot\n by releasing a key early, hence has no economic\n motivation to do so. (Picture also a lot of ‚Äúpinging‚Äù\n going to ‚Äúrate‚Äù the various ti<w agents.)\n\n\nCryptography with Beacons. A ‚Äúbeacon agent‚Äù makes very\n public a series of messages, somehow. Details fuzzy. [I\n have a hunch that using digital time-stamping services\n could be useful here.]\nDifficulty of factoring, etc.\n        \nThe idea here is to-use a function which is presently\n hard to invert, but which may be easier in the future.\n This is fraught with problems, including\n unpredictability of the difficulty, imprecision in the\n timing of release, and general clumsiness. As Hal\n Finney notes:\n            \n‚ÄúThere was an talk on this topic at either the Crypto\n 92 or 93 conference, I forget which.  It is available\n in the proceedings‚Ä¶.The method used was similar to\n the idea here of encrypting with a public key and\n requiring factoring of the modulus to decrypt.  But\n the author had more techniques he used, iterating\n functions forward which would take longer to iterate\n backwards.  The purpose was to give a more\n predictable time to decrypt‚Ä¶..One problem with this\n is that it does not so much put a time floor on the\n decryption, but rather a cost floor.  Someone who is\n willing to spend enough can decrypt faster than\n someone who spends less.  Another problem is the\n difficulty of forecasting the growth of computational\n power per dollar in the future.‚Äù [Hal Finney,\n sci.crypt, 1994-8-04]\n\n\n\n\nTamper-resistant modules. A la the scheme to send the\n secrets to a satellite in orbit and expect that it will\n be prohibitively expensive to rendezvous and enter this\n satellite.\n        \nOr to gain access to tamper-resistant modules located\n in bank vaults, etc.\nBut court orders and black bag jobs still are factors.\n14.5.2.

The issue of recognizing\n whether a message has or mighthave a hidden message has two\n sides.  One is for the desired recipient to be clued that\n he should try desteganizing and decrypting the message, and\n the other is for a possible attacker to discover illegal\n uses of cryptography.\n‚ÄúSteganography should be used with a ‚Äústealthy‚Äù\n cryptosystem (secret key or public key), one in which the\n cyphertext is indistinguishable from a random bit string.\n You would not want it to have any headers which could be\n used to confirm that a desteganized message was other than\n random noise.‚Äù [Hal Finney, 1993-05-25]\n14.7.3. Peter Wayner‚Äôs ‚ÄúMimic‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThey encode a secret message inside a harmless looking\n ASCII text file.  This is one of the very few times\n the UNIX tools ‚Äúlex‚Äù and ‚Äúyacc‚Äù have been used in\n cryptography, as far as I know.

I described it in 1988 or 89 and many times since\n\nSeveral years ago I posted to sci.crypt my ‚Äúnovel‚Äù idea for\n packing bits into the essentially inaudible ‚Äúleast\n significant bits‚Äù (LSBs) of digital recordings, such as\n DATs and CDs. Ditto for the LSBs in an 8-bit image or 24-\n bit color image. I‚Äôve since seen this idea reinvented\n several times on sci.crypt and elsewhere‚Ä¶and I‚Äôm\n willing to bet I wasn‚Äôt the first, either (so I don‚Äôt claim\n any credit).\nA 2-hour DAT contains about 10 Gbits (2 hours x 3600 sec/hr\n x 2 channels x 16 bits/sample x 44K samples/sec), or about\n 1.2 Gbytes. A CD contains about half this, i.e., about 700\n Mbytes. The LSB of a DAT is 1/16th of the 1.2 Gbytes, or 80\n Mbytes. This is a lot of storage!\nA home-recorded DAT‚Äìand I use a Sony D-3 DAT Walkman to\n make tapes‚Äìhas so much noise down at the LSB level‚Äìnoise\n from the A/D and D/A converters, noise from the microphones\n (if any), etc.‚Äìthat the bits are essentially random at\n this level. (This is a subtle, but important, point: a\n factory recorded DAT or CD will have predetermined bits at\n all levels, i.e., the authorities could in principle spot\n any modifications. But home-recorded, or dubbed, DATs will\n of course not be subject to this kind of analysis.) Some\n care might be taken to ensure that the statistical\n properties of the signal bits resemble what would be\n expected with ‚Äúnoise‚Äù bits, but this will be a minor\n hurdle.\nAdobe Photoshop can be used to easily place message bits in\n the ‚Äúnoise‚Äù that dominates things down at the LSB level.\n The resulting GIF can then be posted to UseNet or e-mailed.\n Ditto for sound samples, using the ideas I just described\n (but typically requiring sound sampling boards, etc.). I‚Äôve\n done some experiments along these lines.\nThis doesn‚Äôt mean our problems are solved, of course.\n Exchanging tapes is cumbersome and vulnerable to stings.\n But it does help to point out the utter futility of trying\n to stop the flow of bits.\n14.7.5. Stego, other versions\n\nRomana Machado‚Äôs Macintosh stego program is located in the\n compression files, /cmp, in the sumex-aim@stanford.edu info-\n mac archives.\n‚ÄúStego is a tool that enables you to embed data in, and\n retrieve data from, Macintosh PICT format files, without\n changing the appearance of the PICT file.  Though its\n effect is visually undetectable, do not expect\n cryptographic security from Stego.  Be aware that anyone\n with a copy of Stego can retrieve your data from your PICT\n file.  Stego  can  be used as an ‚Äúenvelope‚Äù to hide a\n previously encrypted data file in a PICT file, making it\n much less likely to be detected.‚Äù [Romana Machado, 1993-11-\n 23]\n14.7.6.

Miscellaneous Comments\nthis is another ‚Äútransition‚Äù chapter, laying the groundwork\n for Crypto Anarchy\n\n15.3. The Nature of Reputations\n15.3.1. The claim by many of us that ‚Äúreputations‚Äù will take care of\n   many problems in crypto anarchic markets is disputed by some\n   (notably Eric Hughes). To be sure, it will not be a trivial\n   issue. Institutions take years or decades to evolve.\n15.3.2. However, think of how often we use reputations: friends,\n   books, movies, restaurants, etc\n15.3.3. Reputations and other institutions will take time to evolve.\n   Saying ‚Äúthe market will talke care of things‚Äù may be true,\n   but this may take time. The ‚Äúinvisible hand‚Äù doesn‚Äôt\n   necessarily move swiftly.\n15.3.4. ‚ÄúWhat are ‚Äòreputations‚Äô and why are they so important?‚Äù\n\na vague concept related to degree of believability, of\n trust, etc.\n‚Äúwe know it when we see it‚Äù\n    \n(sorry for the cop out, but I don‚Äôt have a good\n definition handy‚Ä¶.James Donald says studying reputatons\n is ‚Äúnominalist hot air‚Äù [1994-09-02], but I think it‚Äôs\n quite important)\n\n\nobvious, in ordinary life, but in the cyberspatial context\n    \nreputation-based systems\nescrow, expectations\n‚Äúreputation capital‚Äù\nlike book or music recommendations\nweb of trust (is different than just ‚Äútrust‚Äù‚Äîtensor,\n rather than scalar)\n\n\nActually very common: how most of us deal with our friends,\n our enemies, the books we read, the restaurants we\n frequent, etc.\n    \nwe mentally downcheck and upcheck on the basis of\n experience; we learn\n\n\nAre there examples?\nEric‚Äôs objections\n15.3.5. ‚ÄúHow are reputations acquired, ruined, transferred, etc.?‚Äù\nFirst, reputations are not ‚Äúowned‚Äù by the person to whom\n they are attached by others\n    \nthe algebra is tricky‚Ä¶maybe Eric Hughes or one of the\n other pure math types can help straighten out the\n ‚Äúcalculus of reputations‚Äù\n        \nreputations are not symmetric: just because Alice\n esteems Bob does mean the reverse is so\nreputations are not transitive, though they are\n partially transitive: if Alice esteems Bob and Bob\n esteems Charles, this may cause Alice to be somewhat\n more esteemful of Charles.\na tensor matrix?\na graph?\n\n\n\n\nAny holder of a reputation can ‚Äúspend‚Äù some of his\n reputation capital\n    \nin praise or criticism of another agent\nin reviews (think of Siskel and Ebert ‚Äúspending‚Äù some of\n their reputation capital in the praise of a movie, and\n how their own reptutations will go up and down as a\n function of many things, including especially how much\n the viewing audience agrees with them)\n15.3.6. ‚ÄúAre they foolproof? Are all the questions answered?‚Äù\n\n\nOf course not.\nAnd Eric Hughes has in the past said that too much\n importance is being invested in this idea of reputations,\n though many or even most of us (who comment on the matter)\n clearly think otherwise.\nIn any case, much more study is needed. Hal Finney and I\n have debated this a couple of times (first on the\n Extropians list, then a couple or more times on the\n Cypherpunks list), and we are mostly in agreement that this\n area is very promising and is deserving of much more\n thought‚Äìand even experimentation. (One of my interests in\n crypto simulations, in ‚Äúprotocol ecologies,‚Äù is to simulate\n agents which play games involving reputations, spoofing,\n transfers of reputations, etc.)\n15.3.7. Reputations have many aspects\nthe trading firm which runs others people‚Äôs money is\n probably less ‚Äúreputable‚Äù in an important sense than the\n trading firm in which partners have their own personal\n fortunes riding‚Ä¶.or at least I know which one I‚Äôd trust!\n    \n(But how to guarantee one isn‚Äôt being fooled, by a spoof,\n a sham?

Practical Examples\n15.8.1. ‚ÄúAre there any actual examples of software-mediated\n   reputation systems?‚Äù\n\ncredit databases‚Ä¶positive and negative reputations\n15.8.2. Absent laws which ban strong crypto (and such laws are\n   themselves nearly unenforceable), it will be essentially\n   impossible to stop anonymous transactions and purely\n   reputation-based systems.\nFor example, Pr0duct Cypher and Sue D. Nym will be able to\n use private channels of their own choosing (possibly using\n anonymous pools, etc.) to communicate and arrange deals. If\n some form of digital cash exists, they will even be able to\n transfer this cash. (If not, barter of informations,\n whatever.)\nSo, the issues raised by Hal Finney and others, expressing\n doubts about the adequacy of reputation capital as a\n building block (and good concerns they are, by the way),\n become moot. Society cannot stop willing participants from\n using reputation and anonymity. This is a major theme of\n crypto anarchy: the bypassing of convention by willing\n participants.\nIf Alice and Bob don‚Äôt care that their physical identies\n are unknown to each other, why should we care? That is, why\n should society step in and try to ban this arrangement?\n    \nthey won‚Äôt be using ‚Äúour‚Äù court systems, so that‚Äôs not an\n issue (and longer term, PPLs will take the place of\n courts, many of us feel)\nonly if Alice and Bob are counting on society, on third\n parties to the transaction, to do certain things, can\n society make a claim to be involved\n(A main reason to try to ban anonymity will be to stop\n ‚Äúbad‚Äù activities, which is a separate issue; banning of\n ‚Äúbad‚Äù activity is usually pointless, and leads to\n repressive states. But I digress.)\n15.8.3. Part of the ‚Äúphase change‚Äù: people opt out of the permission-\n slip society via strong crypto, making their own decisions on\n who to trust, who to deal with, who to make financial\n arrangements with\n\n\nexample: credit rating agencies that are not traceable, not\n prosecutable in any court‚Ä¶people deal with them only if\n they think they are getting value for their money\n    \nno silly rules that credit rating data can ‚Äúonly‚Äù go back\n some arbitrary number of years (7, in U.S.)‚Ä¶no silly\n rules about how certain bankruptcies ‚Äúcan‚Äôt‚Äù be\n considered, how one‚Äôs record is to be ‚Äúcleared‚Äù if\n conditions are met, etc.\nrather, all data are considered‚Ä¶.customer decides how\n to weight the data‚Ä¶(if a customer is too persnickety\n about past lapsed bills, or a bad debt many years in the\n past, he‚Äôll find himself never lending any money, so the\n ‚Äúinvisible hand‚Äù of the free market will tend to correct\n such overzealousnesses)\n\n\ndata havens, credit havens, etc. (often called ‚Äúoffshore\n data havens,‚Äù as the current way to do this would be to\n locate in Caymans, Isle of Man, etc.)\n    \nbut clearly they can be ‚Äúoffshore in cyberspace‚Äù\n (anonymous links, etc.)\n\n\n\n15.9.

Main Points\n\n‚Äú‚Ä¶when you want to smash the State, everything looks like\n a hammer.‚Äù\nstrong crypto as the ‚Äúbuilding material‚Äù for cyberspace\n (making the walls, the support beams, the locks)\n16.2.2. Connections to Other Sections\nthis section ties all the other sections together\n16.2.3. Where to Find Additional Information\nagain, almost nothing written on this\nVinge, Friedman, Rand, etc.\n16.2.4. Miscellaneous Comments\na very long section, possibly confusing to many\n\n16.3. Introduction\n16.3.1. ‚ÄúThe revolution will not be televised. The revolution will,\n   however, be digitized.‚Äù Welcome to the New Underworld Order!\n   (a term I have borrowed from writer Claire Sterling.)\n16.3.2. ‚ÄúDo the views here express the views of the Cypherpunks as a\n   whole?‚Äù\n\nThis section is controversial. Hence, even more warnings\n than usual about being careful not to confuse these\n comments with the beliefs of all or even most Cypherpunks.\nIn fairness, libertarianism is undeniably the most\n represented ideology on the list, as it is in so much of\n the Net. The reasons for this have been extensively debated\n over the years, but it‚Äôs a fact. If other major ideologies\n exists, they are fairly hidden on the Cypherpunks list.\nYes, some quasi-socialist views are occasionally presented.\n My friend Dave Mandl, for example, has at times argued for\n a less-anarchocapitalist view (but I think our views are\n actually fairly similar‚Ä¶he just has a different language\n and thinks there‚Äôs more of a difference than their actually\n is‚Äìinsert smiley here).\nAnd several Cypherpunks who‚Äôve thought about the issues of\n crypto anarchy have been disturbed by the conclusions that\n seem inevitable (markets for corporate information,\n assassianation made more liquid, data havens, espionage\n made much easier, and other such implications to be\n explored later in this section).\nSo, take this section with these caveats.\nAnd some of the things I thing are inevitable, and in many\n cases positive, will be repugnant to some. The end of\n welfare, the end of subsidies of inner city breeders, for\n example. The smashing of the national security state\n through digital espionage, information markets, and\n selective assassinations are not things that everyone will\n take comfort in. Some may even call it illegal, seditious,\n and dangerous. So be it.\n16.3.3. ‚ÄúWhat are the Ideologies of Cyperpunks?‚Äù\nI mentioned this in an earlier section, but now that I‚Äôm\n discussing ‚Äúcrypto anarchy‚Äù in detail it‚Äôs good to recap\n some points about the ideology of Cypherpunks.\n    \nan area fraught with dangers, as many Cypherpunks have\n differing views of what‚Äôs important\n\n\nTwo main foci for Cypherpunks:\n    \nPersonal privacy in an increasingly watchful society\nUndermining of states and governments\n\n\nOf those who speak up, most seem to lean toward the\n libertarian position, often explicitly so (libertarians\n often are to be found on the Internet, so this correlation\n is not surprising)\nSocialists and Communitarians\n    \nShould speak up more than they have. Dave Mandl is the\n only one I can recall who‚Äôs given a coherent summary of\n his views.\n\n\nMy Personal Outlook on Laws and Ideology:\n    \n(Obviously also scattered thoughout this document.)\nNon-coercion Principle\n        \navoid initiation of physical aggression\n‚Äúto each his own‚Äù (a ‚Äúneo-Calvinist‚Äù perspective of\n letting each person pick his path, and not interfering)\n\n\nI support no law which can easily be circumvented.\n (Traffic laws are a counterexample‚Ä¶I generally agree\n with basic traffic laws‚Ä¶.)\nAnd I support no law I would not personally be willing to\n enforce and punish. Murder, rape, theft, etc, but not\n ‚Äúvictimless crimes, ‚Äú not drug laws, and not 99.9998% of\n the laws on the books.\nCrypto anarchy is in a sense a throwback to the pre-state\n days of individual choice about which laws to follow. The\n community exerted  a strong force.\nWith strong crypto (‚Äúfortress crypto,‚Äù in law enforcement\n terms), only an intrusive police state can stop people\n from accessing ‚Äúillegal‚Äù sites, from communicating with\n others, from using ‚Äúunapproved‚Äù services, and so on. To\n pick one example, the ‚Äúcredit data haven‚Äù that keeps any\n and all financial records‚Äìrent problems from 1975,\n bankruptcy proceedings from 1983, divorce settlements,\n results from private investigators, etc. In the U.S.,\n many such records are ‚Äúunusable‚Äù: can‚Äôt use credit data\n older than 7 years (under the ‚ÄúFair Credit Reporting\n Act‚Äù), PI data, etc. But if I am thinking about lending\n Joe Blow some money, how the hell can I be told I can‚Äôt\n ‚Äúconsider‚Äù the fact that he declared bankruptcy in 1980,\n ran out on his debts in Haiti in 1989, and is being sued\n for all his assets by two ex-wives? The answer is simple:\n any law which says I am not allowed to take into account\n information which comes my way is flawed and should be\n bypassed. Dialing in to a credit haven in Belize is one\n approach‚Äìexcept wiretaps might still get me caught.\n Cyberspace allows much more convenient and secure\n bypasses of these laws.\n\n\n(For those of you who think such bypasses of laws are\n immoral, tough. Strong crypto allows this. Get used to it.)\n16.3.4. Early history of crypto anarchy\n1987-8, AMIX, Salin, Manifesto\n    \ndiscussed crypto implications with Phil Salin and Gayle\n Pergamit, in December of 1987\nwith a larger group, including Marc Stiegler, Dave Ross,\n Jim Bennett, Phil Salin, etc., in June 1988.\nreleased ‚ÄúThe Crypto Anarchist Manifesto‚Äù in August 1988.\n\n\nFen LaBalme had ‚ÄúGuerillan Information Net‚Äù (GIN), which he\n and I discussed in 1988 at the Hackers Conference\n‚ÄúFrom Crossbows to Cryptography,‚Äù 1987?\n    \nmade similar points, but some important differences\n\n\nTAZ also being written at this time\n\n16.4. The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto\n16.4.1. Unchanged since it‚Äôs writing in mid-1988, except for my e-\n   mail address.\n\nThere are some changes I‚Äôd make, but‚Ä¶\nIt was written quickly, and in a style to deliberately\n mimic what I remembered of the ‚ÄúCommunist Manifesto.‚Äù (for\n ironic reasons)\nStill., I‚Äôm proud that more than six years ago I correctly\n saw some major points which Cypherpunks have helped to make\n happen: remailers, anonymous communictation, reputation-\n based systems, etc.\nFor history‚Äôs sake, here it is:\n16.4.2.\n\nThe Crypto Anarchist Manifesto\nTimothy  C.  May\n   tcmay@netcom.com\nA specter is haunting the modern world, the specter of crypto\n   anarchy.\nComputer technology is on the verge of providing the ability\n   for individuals and groups to communicate and interact with\n   each other in a totally anonymous manner. Two persons may\n   exchange messages, conduct business, and negotiate electronic\n   contracts without ever knowing the True Name, or legal\n   identity, of the other. Interactions over networks will be\n   untraceable, via extensive re-routing of encrypted packets\n   and tamper-proof boxes which implement cryptographic\n   protocols with nearly perfect assurance against any\n   tampering. Reputations will be of central importance, far\n   more important in dealings than even the credit ratings of\n   today. These developments will alter completely the nature of\n   government regulation, the ability to tax and control\n   economic interactions, the ability to keep information\n   secret, and will even alter the nature of trust and\n   reputation.\nThe technology for this revolution‚Äìand it surely will be\n   both a social and economic revolution‚Äìhas existed in theory\n   for the past decade. The methods are based upon public-key\n   encryption, zero-knowledge interactive proof systems, and\n   various software protocols for interaction, authentication,\n   and verification. The focus has until now been on academic\n   conferences in Europe and the U.S., conferences monitored\n   closely by the National Security Agency. But only recently\n   have computer networks and  personal computers attained\n   sufficient speed to make the ideas practically realizable.\n   And the next ten years will bring enough additional speed to\n   make the ideas economically feasible and essentially\n   unstoppable. High-speed networks, ISDN, tamper-proof boxes,\n   smart cards, satellites,  Ku-band transmitters, multi-MIPS\n   personal computers, and encryption chips now under\n   development will be some of the enabling technologies.\nThe State will of course try to slow or halt the spread of\n   this technology, citing national security concerns, use of\n   the technology by drug dealers and tax evaders, and fears of\n   societal disintegration. Many of these concerns will be\n   valid; crypto anarchy will allow national secrets to be trade\n   freely and will allow illicit and stolen materials to be\n   traded. An anonymous computerized market will even make\n   possible abhorrent markets for assassinations and extortion.\n   Various criminal and foreign elements will be active users of\n   CryptoNet. But this will not halt the spread of crypto\n   anarchy.\nJust as the technology of printing altered and reduced the\n   power of medieval guilds and the social power structure, so\n   too will cryptologic methods fundamentally alter the nature\n   of corporations\n   and of government interference in economic transactions.\n   Combined with emerging information markets, crypto anarchy\n   will create a liquid market for any and all material which\n   can be put into words and pictures. And just as a seemingly\n   minor invention like barbed wire made possible the fencing-\n   off of vast ranches and farms, thus altering forever the\n   concepts of land and property rights in the frontier West, so\n   too will the seemingly minor discovery out of an\n   arcane branch of mathematics come to be the wire clippers\n   which dismantle the barbed wire around intellectual property.\nArise, you have nothing to lose but your barbed wire fences!\n16.5. Changes are Coming\n16.5.1. Technology is dramatically altering the nature of\n   governments.\n\nIt may sound like newage trendiness, but strong crypto is\n ‚Äútechnological empowerment.‚Äù It literally gives power to\n individuals. Like Sam Colt, it makes them equal.\n‚ÄúPolitics has never given anyone lasting freedom, and it\n never will. Anything gained through politics will be lost\n again as soon as the society feels threatened. If most\n Americans have never been oppressed by the government\n (aside from an annual mugging) it is because most of them\n have never done anything to threaten the government‚Äôs\n interests.‚Äù [Mike Ingle, 1994-01-01]\nThesis: Strong crypto is a good thing\n    \ntool against governments of all flavors, left and right\nreligious freedom\npersonal choice\n16.5.2.

They put together a\n peace agreement that in part proclaimed limits to\n government,  in part acknowledged inherent limits to what\n was proper for governments to do  and in part guaranteed\n that the government would not go beyond what it was\n proper for government to do, that the majority could not\n do as it pleased with the minority, that not any act of\n power was a law, that law was not merely whatever the\n government willed.\nThey did not agree on a constitution but agreed to\n respect an unwritten constitution that already existed in\n some sense.\nA similar arrangement underlies the American constitution\n (now defunct) and the English declaration of right (also\n defunct)\nThe problem with such formal peace agreements is that\n they can only be put together after government has\n substantially collapsed.  Some of us wish to try other\n possibilities in the event of collapse.\nThe American constitution collapsed because of the rise\n of nominalist theories ‚ÄúThe constitution says whatever\n the courts say that it says.‚Äù [James Donald, 1994-08-31]\n\n\n\nWar on Drugs, conspiracy charges, random searches,\n emergency preparedness orders (Operation Vampire Killer,\n Operation Night Train, REX-84).

We don‚Äôt really have free speech\nelection laws\nadvertising laws\n‚Äúslander‚Äù and ‚Äúlibel‚Äù\n    \nthankfully, anonymous systems will make this moot\n\n\npermission needed‚Ä¶licensing, approval, certification\n    \n‚Äúqualifications‚Äù\ngranted, Supremes have made it clear that political\n comments cannot be restricted, but many other areas have\noften the distinction involves ‚Äòfor pay‚Äù\n\n\nPerhaps you are thinking that these are not really examples\n of government censorship, just of other crimes  and\n other rights taking precedence. Thus, advertisers can‚Äôt\n make false or misleading claims, and can‚Äôt advertise\n dangerous or otherwise unapproved items. And I can‚Äôt make\n medical diagnoses, or give structural and geological\n advice, and so on‚Ä¶a dozen good examples. But these\n restrictions emasculate free speech, leaving only banal\n expression of appropriately-hedged ‚Äúpersonal opinions‚Äù as\n the free speech that is allowed‚Ä¶and even that is ofen\n subject to crazy lawsuits and threats of legal action.\n\n16.7. The Nature of Anarchies\n16.7.1. Anarchy doesn‚Äôt mean chaos and killing\n\nAs J. Bruce Dawson put it in a review of Linux in the\n September, 1994 ‚ÄúByte,‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs anarchy at its best.‚Äù\nIronically, crypto anarchy does admit the possibility (and\n hence probablility) of more contract killings as an\n ultimate enforcement mechanism for contracts otherwise\n unenforceable.\n    \nwhich is what is occurring in drug and other crime\n situaions: the parties cannot go to the police or courts\n for righting of wrongs, so they need to have the ultimate\n threat of death to enforce deals. It makes good sense\n from a reputation/game theory point of view.\n16.7.2. Leftists can be anarchists, too\n\n\nIn fact, this tends to be the popular interpretation of\n anarchy. (Besides the bomb-throwing, anti-Tsar anarchists\n of the 19th century, and the bomb-throwing anarchists of\n the U.S. early this century.)\n‚ÄúTemporary Autonomous Zones‚Äù (TAZ)\n    \nHakim Bey (pseudonym for    )\nMondo 2000, books, (check with Dave Mandl, who helps to\n publish them)\n16.7.3.

Instead of building pathways and sidewalks\n across the newly-constructed grounds, the ground was left\n bare. After some time, the ‚Äúemergent pathways‚Äù chosen by\n students and faculty were then turned into paved pathways,\n neatly solving the problem of people not using the\n ‚Äúplanned‚Äù pathways. I submit that much of life works this\n way.

The world financial system is a good example: beyond the\n   reach of any single government, even the U.S. New World\n   Order, money moves and flows as doubts and concerns appear.\n   Statist governments are powerless to stop the devaluation of\n   their currencies as investors move their assets (even slight\n   moves can have large marginal effects).\n‚Äúanarchy‚Äù is not a term most would apply, but it‚Äôs an\n anarchy in the sense of there being no rulers (‚Äúan  arch‚Äù),\n no central command structure.\n\n16.8. The Nature of Crypto Anarchy\n16.8.1. ‚ÄúWhat is Crypto Anarchy?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhy the name?‚Äù\n    \na partial pun on several things‚Äù\n        \n‚Äúcrypto,‚Äù meaning ‚Äúhidden,‚Äù as used in the term ‚Äúcrypto\n fascist‚Äù (Gore Vidal called William F.

What she wanted to do with material technology\n (mirrors over Galt‚Äôs Gulch) is much more easily done\n with mathematical technology.\n16.8.2. ‚ÄúAnarchy turns people off‚Ä¶why not a more palatable name?‚Äù\n\n\npeople don‚Äôt understand the term; if people understood the\n term, it might be more acceptable\nsome have suggested I call it ‚Äúdigital liberty‚Äù or\n somesuch, but I prefer to stick with the historical term\n16.8.3. Voluntary interactions involve Schelling points, mutually-\n   agreed upon points of agreement\n16.8.4. Crypto anarchy as an ideology rather than as a plan.\nWithout false modesty, I think crypto anarchy is one of the\n few real contributions to ideology in recent memory. The\n notion of individuals becoming independent of states by\n bypassing ordinary channels of control is a new one. While\n there have been hints of this in the cyberpunk genre of\n writing, and related areas (the works of Vinge especially),\n the traditional libertarian and anarchist movements have\n mostly been oblivious to the ramifications of strong\n crypto.\nInterestingly, David Friedman, son of Milton and author of\n ‚ÄúThe Machinery of Freedom,‚Äù became a convert to the ideas.\n At least enough so as to give a talk in Los Angeles\n entitles ‚ÄúCrypto Anarchy and the State.‚Äù\nConventional political ideology has failed to realize the\n huge changes coming over the next several decades.\n Focussing on unwinnable battles at the ballot box, they\n fritter away their energies; they join the political\n process, but they have nothing to ‚Äúdeal‚Äù with, so they\n lose. The average American actually wants to pick the\n pockets of his neighbors (to pay for ‚Äúfree‚Äù health care, to\n stop companies from laying-off unneeded workers, to bring\n more pork back to the local enonomy), so the average voter\n is highly unlikely to ever vote for a prinicpled\n Libertarian candidate.\nFortunately, how people vote has little effect on certain\n ‚Äúground truths‚Äù that emerge out of new technologies and new\n economic developments.\n\n16.9. Uses of Crypto Anarchy\n16.9.1. Markets unfettered by local laws (digital black markets, at\n   least for items that can be moved through cyberspace)\n16.9.2. Espionage\n16.10.

Not\n altogether a bad thing.\n16.10.5. on interference in business as justified by ‚Äúsociety supports\n   you‚Äù arguments (and ‚Äúopting out)\nIt has been traditionally argued that society/government\n has a right to regulate businesses, impose rules of\n behavior, etc., for a couple of reasons:\n    \n‚Äúto promote the general welfare‚Äù (a nebulous reason)\nbecause government builds the infrastructure that makes\n business possible\n        \nthe roads, transportation systems, etc. (actually, most\n are privately built‚Ä¶only the roads and canal are\n publically built, and they certainly don‚Äôt have to\n be)\nthe police forces, courts, enforcement of contracts,\n disputes, etc.\nprotection from foreign countries, tariff negotiations,\n etc., even to the physical protection against\n invading countries\n\n\n\n\nBut with crypto anarchy, all of these reasons vanish!\n    \nsociety isn‚Äôt ‚Äúenabling‚Äù the business being transacted\n (after all, the parties don‚Äôt even necessarily know what\n countries the other is in!)\nno national or local courts are being used, so this set\n of reasons goes out the window\nno threat of invasion‚Ä¶or if there is, it isn‚Äôt\n something governments can address\n\n\nSo, in addition to the basic unenforceability of outlawing\n crypto anarchy‚Äìshort of outlawing encryption‚Äìthere is\n also no viable argument for having governments interfere on\n these traditional grounds.\n    \n(The reasons for them to interfere based on fears for\n their own future and fears about unsavory and abominable\n markets being developed (body parts, assassinations,\n trade secrets, tax evasion, etc.) are of course still\n ‚Äúvalid,‚Äù viewed from their perspective, but the other\n reasons just aren‚Äôt.)\n\n\n\n16.11. Ethics and Morality of Crypto Anarchy\n16.11.1. ‚ÄúHow do you square these ideas with democracy?‚Äù\n\nI don‚Äôt; democracy has run amok, fulfilling de\n Tocqueville‚Äôs prediction that American democracy would last\n only until Americans discovered they could pick the pockets\n of their neighbors at the ballot box\nlittle chance of changing public opinion, of educating them\ncrypto anarchy is a movement of individual opting out, not\n of mass change and political action\n16.11.2. ‚ÄúIs there a moral responsibility to ensure that the overall\n   effects of crypto anarchy are more favorable than unfavorable\n   before promoting it?‚Äù\nI don‚Äôt think so, any more than Thomas Jefferson should\n have analyzed the future implications of freedom before\n pushing it so strongly.\nAll decisions have implications. Some even cost lives. By\n not becoming a doctor working in Sub-Saharan Africa, have I\n ‚Äúkilled thousands‚Äù? Certainly I might have saved the lives\n of thousands of villagers. But I did not kill them just\n because I chose not to be a doctor. Likewise, by giving\n money to starving peasants in Bangladesh, lives could\n undeniably be ‚Äúsaved.‚Äù But not giving the money does not\n murder them.\nBut such actions of omission are not the same, in my mind,\n as acts of comission. My freedom, via crypto anarchy, is\n not an act of force in and of itself.\nDeveloping an idea is not the same as aggression.\nCrypto anarchy is about personal withdrawal from the\n system, the ‚Äútechnologies of disconnection,‚Äù in Kevin\n Kelly‚Äôs words.\n16.11.3. ‚ÄúShould individuals have the power to decide what they will\n   reveal to others, and to authorities?‚Äù\nFor many or even most of us, this has an easy answer, and\n is axiomatically true. But others have doubts, and more\n people may have doubts as some easily anticipated\n develpoments occur.\n(For example, pedophiles using the much-feared ‚Äúfortress\n crypto,‚Äù terrorists communicating in unbreakable codes, tza\n evaders, etc. Lots of examples.)\nBut because some people use crypto to do putatively evil\n things, should basic rights be given up? Closed doors can\n hide criminal acts, but we don‚Äôt ban closed doors.\n16.11.4. ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt there some dangers and risks to letting people pick\n   and choose their moralities?‚Äù\n(Related to questions about group consensus, actions of the\n state vs. actions of the individual, and the ‚Äúherd.)\nIndeed, there are dangers and risks. In the privacy of his\n home, my neighbor might be operating a torture dungeon for\n young children he captures. But absent real evidence of\n this, most nations have not sanctioned the random searches\n of private dwellings (not even in the U.S.S.R., so far as I\n know).\n16.11.5. ‚ÄúAs a member of a hated minority (crypto anarchists) I‚Äôd\n   rather take my chances on an open market than risk official\n   discrimination by the state‚Ä¶..Mercifully, the technology we\n   are developing will allow everyone who cares to to decline to\n   participate in this coercive allocation of power.‚Äù [Duncan\n   Frissell, 1994-09-08]\n16.11.6. ‚ÄúAre there technologies which should be ‚Äústopped‚Äù even before\n   they are deployed?‚Äù\nPandora‚Äôs Box, ‚Äúthings Man was not meant to know,‚Äù etc.\nIt used to be that my answer was mostly a clear ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù with\n nuclear and biological weapons as the only clear exception.\n But recent events involving key escrow have caused me to\n rethink things.\nImagine a company that‚Äôs developing home surveillance\n cameras‚Ä¶perhaps for burglar prevention, child safety,\n etc. Parents can monitor Junior on ceiling-mounted cameras\n that can‚Äôt easily be tampered with or disconnected, without\n sending out alarms. All well and good.\nNow imagine that hooks are put into these camera systems to\n send the captured images to a central office. Again, not\n necessarily a bad idea‚Äìvacationers may want their security\n company to monitor their houses, etc.\nThe danger is that a repressive government could make the\n process mandatory‚Ä¶.how else to catch sexual deviates,\n child molestors, marijuana growers, counterfeiters, and the\n like?\nSound implausible, unacceptable, right? Well, key escrow is\n a form of this.\nThe Danger. That OS vendors will put these SKE systems in\n place without adequate protections against key escrow being\n made mandatory at some future date.\n16.11.7. ‚ÄúWon‚Äôt crypto anarchy allow some people to do bad things?‚Äù\nSure, so what else is new? Private rooms allows plotters to\n plot their plots. Etc.\nNot to sound too glib, but most of the things we think of\n as basic rights allow various illegal, distasteful, or\n crummy things to go on. Part of the bargain we make.\n‚ÄúOf course you could prevent contract killings by requiring\n everyone to carry government ‚Äúescrowed‚Äù tape recordings to\n record all their conversations and requiring them to keep a\n diary at all times alibing their all their activities.\n This would also make it much easier to stamp out child\n pornography, plutonium smuggling, and social discrimination\n against the politically correct.‚Äù [James Donald, 1994-09-\n 09]\n\n16.12. Practical Problems with Crypto Anarchy\n16.12.1. ‚ÄúWhat if ‚Äúbad guys‚Äù use unbreakable crypto?‚Äù\n\nWhat if potential criminals are allowed to have locks on\n their doors? What if potential rapists can buy pornography?\n What if‚Ä¶.\nThese are all straw men used in varous forms throughout\n history by tyrants to control their populations. The\n ‚Äúsheepocracies‚Äù of the modern so-called democratic era are\n voting away their former freedoms in favor of cradle to\n grave safety and security.\nThe latest tack is to propose limits on privacy to help\n catch criminals, pedophile, terrorists, and father rapers.\n God help us if this comes to pass. But Cypherpunks don‚Äôt\n wait for God, they write code!\n16.12.2. Dealing with the ‚ÄúAbhorrent Markets‚Äù\nsuch as markets for assassinations and extortion\nPossibilities:\n    \nphysical protection, physical capure\n        \nmake it risky\n(on the other hand, sniping is easy)\n\n\n‚Äúflooding‚Äù of offers\n        \n‚Äútake a number‚Äù (meaning: get in line)\n\n\nattacking reputations\n\n\nI agree that more thought is needed, more thorough analysis\nSome people have even pointed out the benefits of killing\n off tens of thousands of the corrupt politicians, narcs,\n and cops which have implemented fascist, collectivist\n policies for so long. Assassination markets may make this\n much more practical.\n16.12.3. ‚ÄúHow is fraud dealt with in crypto anarchy?‚Äù\nWhen the perpetrators can‚Äôt even be identified.\nOne of the most interesting problems.\nFirst, reputations matter. Repeat business is not assured.\n It is always best to not have too much at stake in any\n single transaction.\n16.12.4. ‚ÄúHow do we know that crypto anarchy will work? How do we know\n   that it won‚Äôt plunge the world into barbarism, nuclear war,\n   and terror?‚Äù\nWe don‚Äôt know, of course. We never can.\nHowever, things are already pretty bad. Look at Bosnia,\n Ruanda, and a hundred other hellholes and flashpoints\n around the world. Look at the nuclear arsenals of the\n superpowers, and look at who starts the wars. In nearly all\n cases, statism is to blame. States have killed a hundred\n million or more people in this century alone‚Äìthink of\n Hitler, Stalin, Mao, and Pol Pot‚Äìthrough forced starvation\n of entire provinces, liquidation of the peasantry, killing\n of intellectuals, and mass exterminations of religious and\n ethnic groups. It‚Äôs hard to imagine crypto anarchy causing\n anything that bad!\nCrypto anarchy is a cyberspatially-mediated personal course\n of action; by itself it involves no actions such as\n terrorism or nuclear blackmail. One could just as easily\n ask, ‚ÄúWill freedom lead to nuclear blackmail, weapons\n trading, and pedophilia?‚Äù The answer is the same: maybe,\n but so what?\n16.12.5. It is true that crypto anarchy is not for everyone. Some will\n   be too incompetent to prepare to protect themselves, and will\n   want a protector. Others will have poor business sense.\n16.12.6. ‚ÄúBut what will happen to the poor people and those on welfare\n   if crypto anarchy really succeeds?‚Äù\n‚ÄúSo?‚Äù\nMany of us would see this as a good thing. Not just for\n Calvinist-Randite reasons, but also because it would break\n the cycle of dependency which has actually made things\n worse for the underclass in America (at least). See Charles\n Murray‚Äôs ‚ÄúLosing Ground‚Äù for more on this.\nAnd remember that a collapse of the tax system will mean\n more money left in the hands of former taxpayers, and hence\n more left over for true charity (for those who truly cannot\n help themselves).\n\n16.13. Black Markets\n16.13.1. ‚ÄúWhy would anyone use black markets?‚Äù\n\nwhen the advantages of doing so outweigh the disadvantages\n    \nincluding the chance of getting caught and the\n consequences\n(As the chances decline, this suggests a rise in\n punishment severity)\n\n\nbusinesses will tend to shy away from illegal markets,\n unless‚Ä¶\nAnonymous markets for medical products\n    \nto reduce liability, local ethical and religious laws\nExample: Live AIDS vaccine‚Ä¶considered too risky for any\n company to introduce, due to inability to get binding\n waivers of liability (even for ‚Äúfully informed‚Äù patients\n who face likely death)\nmarkets in body parts‚Ä¶\n16.13.2. Crypto anarchy opens up some exciting possibilities for\n collusion in financial deals, for insider trading, etc.\n\n\nI‚Äôm not claiming that this will mean instant riches, as\n markets are fairly efficient () and ‚Äúinsiders‚Äù often don‚Äôt\n do well in the market. ( Some argue that relaxing laws\n against insider trading will make for an even fairer\n market‚Ä¶I agree with this.)\nWhat I am claiming is the SEC and FinCEN computers will be\n working overtime to try to keep up with the new\n possibilities crypto anarchy opens up. Untraceable cash, as\n in offshore bank accounts that one can send anonymous\n trading instructions to (or for), means insider trading\n simply can‚Äôt be stopped‚Ä¶all that happens is that insiders\n see their bank accounts increase (to the extent they win\n because of the insider trading‚Ä¶like I said, a debatable\n point).\nPrice signalling, a la the airline case of a few years back\n (which, you won‚Äôt be surprised to hear, I have no problems\n with), will be easier.

There‚Äôs material on this scattered around\n   this document, material I‚Äôll collect together when I get a\n   chance.\n16.16.2. This topic came up several times on then Extropians mailing\n   list, where David Friedman (author of ‚ÄúThe Machinery of\n   Freedom‚Äù and son of Nobel Prize winner Milton Friedman) and\n   Robin Hanson debated this with me.\n16.16.3. Doug Cutrell summarized the concerns of many when he wrote:\n\n‚Äú‚Ä¶the availability of truly secure anonymity, strong\n encryption, and untraceable digital cash could allow\n contract killing to be an openly conducted business.  For\n example, an anonymous news post announces a public key\n which is to be used to encode a contract kill order, along\n with a digital cash payment.  The person placing the\n contract need only anonymously place the encrypted message\n in alt.test.  Perhaps it is even possible to make it\n impossible to tell that the message was encrypted with the\n contract killer‚Äôs public key (the killer would have to\n attempt decryption of all similarly encoded messages on\n alt.test, but that might be quite feasible).  Thus it could\n be completely risk free for anyone to place a contract on\n anyone else.‚Äù [Doug Cutrell, 1994-09-09]\n16.16.4. Abhorrent markets\ncontract killings\ncan collect money anonymously to have someone\n whacked‚Ä¶nearly anyone who is controversial can generate\n enough ‚Äúcontributions‚Äù\nkidnapping, extortion\n16.16.5. Dealing with Such Things:\nnever link physical ID with pseudonyms! (they won‚Äôt kill\n you if they don‚Äôt know who you are)\n    \nand even if one pseudonym is linked, make sure your\n financial records are not linkable\n\n\ntrust no one\nincreased physical security‚Ä¶make the effort of killing\n much more potentially dangerous\nflooding attacks..tell extortionists to ‚Äúget in line‚Äù\n behind all the other extortionists\nannounce to world that one does not pay extortionists‚Ä¶set\n up protocol to ensure this\n    \nyes, some will die as a result of this\n\n\nconsole yourself with the fact that though some may die,\n fewer are dying as a result of state-sponsored wars and\n terrorism (historically a bigger killer than contract\n killings!)\n\n16.17. Persistent Institutions\n16.17.1. Strong crypto makes possible the creation of institutions\n   which can persist for very long periods of time, perhaps for\n   centuries.\n\nsuch institutions already exist: churches (Catholics of\n several orders), universities, etc.\n16.17.2. all of these ‚Äúpersistent‚Äù services (digital banks, escrow\n   services, reputation servers, etc.) require much better\n   protections against service outages, seizures by governments,\n   natural disasters, and even financial collapse than do most\n   existing computer services-an opportunity for offshore escrow-\n   like services\nto maintain a distributed database, with unconditional\n privacy, etc.\nagain, it is imperative that escrow companies require all\n material placed in it to be encrypted\n    \nto protect them against lawsuits and claims by\n authorities (that they stole information, that they\n censored material, that they are an espionage conduit,\n etc.)\n16.17.3. Escrow Services\n\n\n‚ÄúDigital Escrow‚Äù accounts for mutually suspicious parties,\n especially in illegal transactions\n    \ndrug deals, information brokering, inside information,\n etc.\nBut why will the escrow entity be trusted?\n        \nreputations\n            \ntheir business is being a reliable escrow holder, not\n it destroying their reputation for a bribe or a\n threat\n\n\nanonymity means the escrow company won‚Äôt know who it‚Äôs\n ‚Äúburning,‚Äù should it try to do so\n            \nthey never know when they themselves are being tested\n by some service\n\n\nand potential bribers will not know who to contact,\n although mail could be addressed to the escrow company\n easily enough\n\n\n\n\nlike bonding agencies\nkey is that these entities stand to gain very little by\n stealing from their customers, and much to lose (hinges on\n ratio of any single transaction to size of total market)\nuseful for black markets and illegal transactions (a\n reliable third party that both sides can trust, albeit not\n completely)\n16.17.4. Reputation-Based Systems\nCredit Rating Services that are Immune from Meddling and\n Lawsuits\n    \nwith digital pseudonyms, true credit rating data bases\n can be developed\n        \nwith none of the ‚Äú5 year expirations‚Äù (I mean, who are\n you to tell me I must not hold it against a person that\n records show he‚Äôs declares Chapter 7 every 5 years or\n so?‚Ä¶such information is information, and cannot be\n declared illegal, despite the policy issues that are\n involved)\nthis could probably be done today, using offshore data\n banks, but then there might develop injunctions against\n use by Stateside companies\n            \nhow could this be enforced? stings? entrapment?\nit may be that credit-granting entities will be\n forced to use rigid formulas for their decisions,\n with a complete audit trail available to the\n applicant\n                \nif any ‚Äúdiscretion‚Äù or judgment is allowed, then\n these extralegal or offshore inputs can be used\nrelated to ‚Äúredlining‚Äù and other informal\n signalling mechanisms\nremember that Prop. 103 attempted to bypass normal\n laws of economics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMIX-like services will offer multiple approaches here\n        \nranging from conventional credit data bases, albeit\n with lower costs of entry (e.g., a private citizen\n could launch a ‚Äúbankruptcy filings‚Äù data base, using\n public records, with no expiration-they‚Äôre just\n reporting the truth, e.g., that Joe Blow filed for\n personal bankruptcy in 1987\n            \nthis gets into some of the strange ideas involving\n mandatory rewriting of the truth, as when ‚Äúcredit\n records are expunged‚Äù (expunged from what? from my\n personal data bases? from records that were public\n and that I am now selling access to?)\nthere may be arguments that the ‚Äúpublic records‚Äù are\n copyrighted or otherwise owned by someone and hence\n cannot be sold\n                \ntelephone book case (however, the Supremes held\n that the ‚Äúcreative act‚Äù was the specific\n arrangement)\n\n\none ploy may be a Habitat-like system, where some of\n the records are ‚Äúhistorical‚Äù\n\n\nto offshore data bases\n\n\n\n\nBook Reviews, Music Reviews\n    \nsometimes with pseudonyms to protect the authors from\n retaliation or even lawsuits\n\n\n‚ÄúWhat should I buy?‚Äù services, a la Consumer Reports\n    \nagain, protection from lawsuits\n16.17.5.

Technology. Remailers, encryption\n16.19.6. Contracts and Cryptography\n‚ÄúHow can contracts be enforced in crypto anarchy\n situations?‚Äù\n    \nA key question, and one which causes many people to\n question whether crypto anarchy can work at all.\nFirst, think of how many situations are already\n essentially outside the scope of the law‚Ä¶and yet in\n which something akin to ‚Äúcontracts‚Äù are enforceable,\n albeit not via the legal process.\n        \nfriends, relationships\npersonal preferences in food, books, movies, etc.\n            \nwhat ‚Äúrecourse‚Äù does one have in cases where a meal\n is unsatisfactory? Not going back to the restaurant\n is usually the best recourse (this is also a hint\n about the importance of ‚Äúfuture expectation of\n business‚Äù as a means of dealing with such things).\n\n\n\n\nIn these cases, the law is not directly involved. In\n fact, the law is not involved in most human (and\n nonhuman!) interactions.\nThe Main Approaches:\n        \nReputations.\n            \nreputations are important, are not lightly to be\n regarded\n\n\nRepeat Business.\nEscrow Services.\n\n\n\n\nThe ‚Äúright of contract‚Äù (and the duty to adhere to them, to\n not try to change the contract after the facts) is a\n crucial building block.\n    \nImagine a society in which contracts are valid. This\n allows those willing to sign contracts setting limits on\n malpractice to get cheaper health care, while those who\n won‚Äôt sign such contracts are free to sue‚Äìbut will of\n course have to pay more for health care. Nothing is free,\n and frivolous malpractice lawsuits have increased\n operating costs. (Recall the ‚Äúpsychic‚Äù who alleged that\n her psychic powers were lost after a CAT scan. A jury\n awarded her millions of dollars. Cf. Peter Huber‚Äôs books\n on liability laws.)\nNow imagine a society in which it is never clear if a\n contract is valid, or whether courts will overturn or\n amend a contract. This distorts the above analysis, and\n so hospitals, for example, have to build in safety\n margins and cushions.\n\n\nCrypto can help by creating escrow or bonding accounts held\n by third parties‚Äìuntraceable to the other parties‚Äìwhich\n act as bonding agents for completion of contracts.\n    \nSuch arrangements may not be allowed. For example, a\n hospital which attempted to deal with such a bonding\n agency, and which asked customers to also deal with them,\n could face sanctions.\n\n\n‚ÄúSecured credit cards‚Äù are a current example: a person pays\n a reserve amount greater than the card limits (maybe 110%).\n The reason for doing this is not to obtain ‚Äúcredit,‚Äù\n obviously, but to be able to order items over the phone, or\n to avoid carrying cash. (The benefit is thus in the\n channel of commerce).\n16.19.7. Ostracism, Banishment in Privately Produced Law\nVoluntary and discretionary electronic communities also\n admit the easy possibility of banishment or ostracism\n (group-selected kill files). Of course, enforcement is\n generally difficult, e.g., there is nothing to stop\n individuals from continuing to communicate with the\n ostracized individual using secure methods.\n    \nI can imagine schemes in which software key escrow is\n used, but these seem overly complicated and intrusive.\nThe ability of individuals, and even subgroups, to thwart\n the ostracism is not at all a bad thing.\n-\n\n\n‚ÄúIn an on-line world it would be much easier to enforce\n banishment or selective ostracism than in real life.\n Filtering agents could look for certificates from accepted\n enforcement agencies before letting messages through. Each\n user could have a set of agencies which were compatible\n with his principles, and another set of ‚Äúoutlaws‚Äù.  You\n could even end up with the effect of multiple ‚Äúlogical\n subnets‚Äù of people who communicate with each other but not\n outside their subnet.  Some nets might respect intellectual\n property, others not, and so on.‚Äù [Hal Finney, 1994-08-21]\n16.19.8.

Escrow Agents and Reputations\n16.24.1. Escrow Agents as a way to deal with contract renegging\n\nOn-line clearing has the possible danger implicit in all\n trades that Alice will hand over the money, Bob will verify\n that it has cleared into hisaccount (in older terms, Bob\n would await word that his Swiss bank account has just been\n credited), and then Bob will fail to complete his end of\n the bargain. If the transaction is truly anonymous, over\n computer lines, then of course Bob just hangs up his modem\n and the connection is broken. This situation is as old as\n time, and has always involved protcols in which trust,\n repeat business, etc., are factors. Or escrow agents.\nLong before the ‚Äúkey escrow‚Äù of Clipper, true escrow was\n planned. Escrow as in escrow agents. Or bonding agents.\nAlice and Bob want to conduct a transaction. Neither trusts\n the other;\n indeed, they are unknown to each other. In steps ‚ÄúEsther‚Äôs\n Escrow Service.‚Äù She is also utraceable, but has\n established a digitally-signed presence and a good\n reputation for fairness. Her business is in being an escrow\n agent, like a bonding agency, not in ‚Äúburning‚Äù either\n party. (The math of this is interesting: as long as the\n profits to be gained from any small set of transactions is\n less than her ‚Äúreputation capital,‚Äù it is in her interest\n to forego the profits from burning and be honest. It is\n also possible to arrange that Esther cannot profit from\n burning either Alice or Bob or both of them, e.g., by\n suitably encrypting the escrowed stuff.)\nAlice can put her part of the transaction into escrow with\n Esther, Bob can do the same, and then Esther can release\n the items to the parties when conditions are met, when both\n parties agree, when adjudication of some sort occurs, etc.\n (There a dozen issues here, of course, about how disputes\n are settled, about how parties satisfy themselves that\n Esther has the items she says she has, etc.)\n16.24.2.

Several people have raised the issue of someone in an\n   anonymous transaction simply taking the money and not\n   performing the service (or the flip side). This is where\n   intermediaries come into the picture, just as in the real\n   worl (bonds, escrow agents, etc.).\n16.24.4. Alice and Bob wish to conduct an anonymous transaction; each\n   is unknown to the other (no physical knowledge, no pseudonym\n   reputation knowledge). These ‚Äúmutually suspicious agents,‚Äù in\n   1960s- and 70s-era computer science lingo, must arrange\n   methods to conduct business while not trusting the other.\n16.24.5. Various cryptographic protocols have been developed for such\n   things as ‚Äúbit commitment‚Äù (useful in playing poker over the\n   phone, for example). I don‚Äôt know of progress made at the\n   granularity of anonymous transactions, though. (Though the\n   cryptographic protocol building blocks at lower levels‚Äìsuch\n   as bit commitment and blobs‚Äìwill presumably be used\n   eventually at higher levels, in markets.)\n16.24.6. I believe there is evidence we can shorten the cycle by\n   borrowing noncryptographic protocols (heresy to purists!) and\n   adapting them. Reputations, for example. And escrow agents (a\n   form of reputation, in that the ‚Äúvalue‚Äù of a bonding entity\n   or escrow agent lies in reputation capital).\n16.24.7. if a single escrow agent is suspected of being untrustworthy\n   (in a reputation capital sense), then can use multiple\n   escrows\nwith various protocols, caveat emptor\nn-out-of-m voting schemes, where n escrow agents out of m\n are required to complete a transaction\nhard to compromise them all, especially if they have no\n idea whether they are being ‚Äúlegitimately bribed‚Äù or merely\n pinged by a reputation-rating service\nHunch: the work of Chaum, Bos, and the Pfaltzmanns on DC-\n nets may be direcly applicable here‚Ä¶issues of collusion,\n sets of colluders, detection of collusion, etc.\n\n16.25. Predictions vs. Implications\n16.25.1. ‚ÄúHow do we know that crypto anarchy will ‚Äòwork,‚Äô that the\n   right institutions will emerge, that wrongs will be righted,\n   etc.?‚Äù\n\nWe don‚Äôt know. Few things are certain. Only time will tell.\n These are emergent situations, where evolution will\n determine the outcome. As in other areas, the forms of\n solutions will take time to evolve.\n(The Founders could not have predicted the form corporate\n law would take, as but one example.)\n16.25.2. My thinking on crypto anarchy is not so much prediction as\n   examination of trends and the implications of certain things.\n   Just as steel girders mean certain things for the design of\n   buildings, so too does unbreakable crypto mean certain things\n   for the design of social and economic systems.\n16.25.3. Several technologies are involved:\nUnbreakable crypto\nUntraceable communication\nUnforgeable signatures\n16.25.4. (Note: Yes, it‚Äôs sometimes dangerous to say ‚Äúunbreakable,‚Äù\n   ‚Äúuntraceable,‚Äù and ‚Äúunforgeable.‚Äù Purists eschew such terms.\n   All crypto is economics, even information-theoretically\n   secure crypto (e.g., bribe someone to give you the key, break\n   in and steal it, etc.). And computationally-secure crypto‚Äì\n   such as RSA, IDEA, etc.‚Äìcan in principle be brute-forced.\n   In reality,  the costs may well be exhorbitantly\n   high‚Ä¶perhaps more energy than is available in the entire\n   universe would be needed. Essentially, these things are about\n   as unbreakable, untraceable, and unforgeable as one can\n   imagine.)\n16.25.5. ‚ÄúStrong building materials‚Äù implies certain things. Highways,\n   bridges, jet engines, etc. Likewise for strong crypto, though\n   the exact form of the things that get built is still unknown.\n   But pretty clearly some amazing new structures will be built\n   this way.\n16.25.6. Cyberspace, walls, bricks and mortar‚Ä¶\n16.25.7. ‚ÄúWill strong crypto have the main effect of securing current\n   freedoms, or will it create new freedoms and new situations?‚Äù\nThere‚Äôs a camp that believe mainly that strong crypto will\n ensure that current freedoms are preserved, but that this\n will not change things materially, Communications can be\n private, diaries can be secured, computer security will be\n enhanced, etc.\nAnother camp‚Äìof which I am a vocal spokesman‚Äìbelieves\n that qualitatively different types of transactions will be\n made possible. In addition, of course, to the securing of\n liberties that the first camp things is the main effect.\nThese effects are specultative, but probably include:\n    \nincreased hiding of assets through untraceable banking\n systems\nmarkets in illegal services\nincreased espionage\ndata havens\n16.25.8. ‚ÄúWill all crypto-anarchic transactions be anonymous?‚Äù\n\n\nNo, various parties will negotiate different arrangements.\n All a matter of economics, of enforcement of terms, etc.\n Some will, some won‚Äôt. The key thing is that the decision\n to reveal identity will be just another mutually negotiated\n matter. (Think of spending cash in a store. The store owner\n may want to know who his customers are, but he‚Äôll still\n take cash and remain ignorant in most cases. Unless a\n government steps in and distorts the market by requiring\n approvals for purchases and records of identities‚Äìthink of\n guns here.)\nFor example, the local Mob may not lend me money if I am\n anonymous to them, but they have a ‚Äúhook‚Äù in me if they\n know who I am. (Aspects of anonymity may still be used,\n such as systems that leave no paper or computer trail\n pointing to them or to me, to avoid stings.)\n‚ÄúEnforcement‚Äù in underground markets, for which the\n conventional legal remedies are impossible, is often by\n means of physical force: breaking legs and even killing\n welshers.\n(Personally, I have no problems with this. The Mob cannot\n turn to the local police, so it has to enforce deals its\n own way. If you can‚Äôt pay, don‚Äôt play.)\n\n16.26. How Crypto Anarchy Will Be Fought\n16.26.1. The Direct Attack: Restrictions on Encryption\n\n‚ÄúWhy won‚Äôt government simply ban  such encryption methods?‚Äù\n    \nThis has always been the Number One Issue!\n        \nraised by Stiegler, Drexler, Salin, and several others\n (and in fact raised by some as an objection to my even\n discussing these issues, namely, that action may then\n be taken to head off the world I describe)\n\n\nTypes of Bans on Encryption and Secrecy\n        \nBan on Private Use of Encryption\nBan on Store-and-Forward Nodes\nBan on Tokens and ZKIPS Authentication\nRequirement for public disclosure of all transactions\nRecent news (3-6-92, same day as Michaelangelo and\n Lawnmower Man) that government is proposing a surcharge\n on telcos and long distance services to pay for new\n equipment needed to tap phones!\n            \nS.266 and related bills\nthis was argued in terms of stopping drug dealers and\n other criminals\nbut how does the government intend to deal with the\n various forms fo end-user encryption or ‚Äúconfusion‚Äù\n (the confusion that will come from compression,\n packetizing, simple file encryption, etc.)\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Arguments Against Such Bans\n        \nThe ‚ÄúConstitutional Rights‚Äù Arguments\nThe ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Too Late‚Äù Arguments\n            \nPCs are already widely scattered, running dozens of\n compression and encryption programs‚Ä¶it is far too\n late to insist on ‚Äúin the clear‚Äù broadcasts, whatever\n those may be (is program code distinguishable from\n encrypted messages?

Another Direct Attack: Elimination of Cash\n\n\nthe idea being that elimination of cash, with credit cards\n replacing cash, will reduce black markets\n    \n‚Äúone person, one ID‚Äù (goal of many international\n standards organizations)\n\n\nthis elimination of cash may ultimately be tied in to the\n key registration ideas‚Ä¶government becomes a third party\n in all transactions\na favorite of conspiracy theorists\n    \nin extreme form: the number of the Beast tattooed on us\n (credit numbers, etc.)\ncurrency exchanges (rumors on the Nets about the imminent\n recall of banknotes, ostensibly to flush out ill-gotten\n gains and make counterfeiting easier)\nbut also something governments like to do at times, sort\n of to remind us who‚Äôs really in charge\n        \nGermany, a couple of times\nFrance, in the late 1950s\nvarious other devaluations and currency reforms\n\n\n\n\nPartial steps have already been made\n    \ncash transactions greater than some value-$10,000 at this\n time, though ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù sub-$10K transactions must be\n reported-are banned\nlarge denomination bills have been withdrawn from\n circulation\n        \nused in drug deals, the argument goes\n\n\nMassachussetts has demanded that banks turn over all\n account records, SS numbers, balances, etc.\n\n\n‚ÄúIf what you‚Äôre doing is legal, why do you need cash for\n it?‚Äù\n    \npart of the old American dichotomy: privacy versus ‚ÄúWhat\n have you got to hide?‚Äù\n\n\nBut why the outlawing of cash won‚Äôt work\n    \nif a need exists, black markets will arise\n        \ni.e., the normal tradeoff between risk and reward:\n there may be some ‚Äúdiscounts‚Äù on the value, but cah\n will still circulate\n\n\ntoo many other channels exist: securities, secrets, goods\n        \nfrom trading in gold or silver, neither of which are\n outlawed any longer, to trading in secrets, how can the\n government stop this?\n            \nart being used to transfer money across international\n borders (avoids Customs)\n‚Äúconsideration‚Äù given, a la the scam to hide income\n\n\ntotal surveillance?\n            \nit doesn‚Äôt even work in Russia\non the other hand, Russia lacks the ‚Äúpoint of sale‚Äù\n infrastructure to enforce a cashless system\n16.26.3. Another Direct Attack: Government Control of Encryption,\n Networks,  and Net Access\n\n\n\n\n\n\na la the old Bell System monopoly, which limited what could\n be hooked up to a phone line\nthe government may take control of the networks in several\n ways:\n    \nFCC-type restrictions, though it is hard to see how a\n private network, on private property, could be restricted\n        \nas it is not using part of the ‚Äúpublic spectrum‚Äù\nbut it is hard to build a very interesting network that\n stays on private property‚Ä¶.and as soon as it crosses\n public property, BINGO!\n\n\n‚ÄúNational Data Highway‚Äù could be so heavily subsidized\n that alternatives will languish (for a while)\n        \nthe Al Gore proposals for a federally funded system\n (and his wife, Tipper, is of course a leader of the\n censorship wing)\nand then the government can claim the right and duty to\n set the ‚Äútraffic‚Äù laws: protocols, types of encryption\n allowed, etc.\n\n\nkey patents, a la RSA (if in fact gov‚Äôt.  is a silent\n partner in RSA Data Security)\n16.26.4. An Indirect Attack: Insisting that all  economic transactions\n be ‚Äúdisclosed‚Äù (the ‚ÄúFull Disclosure Society‚Äù scenario)\n\n\nthis sounds Orwellian, but the obvious precedent is that\n businesses must keep records of all financial transactions\n (and even some other records, to see if they‚Äôre colluding\n or manipulating something)\n    \nfor income and sales tax reasons\nand OSHA inspections, INS raids, etc.\nthere is currently no requirement that all transactions\n be fully documented with the identies of all parties,\n except in some cases like firearms purchases, but this\n could change\n        \nespecially as electronic transactions become more\n common: the IRS may someday insist on such records,\n perhaps even insisting on escrowing of such records, or\n time-stamping\nthis will hurt small businesses, due to the entry cost\n and overhead of such systems, but big businesses will\n probably support it (after some grumbling)\n            \nbig business always sees bureaucracy as one of their\n competitive advantages\n\n\n\n\nand individuals have not been hassled by the IRS on minor\n personal transactions, though the web is tightening:\n 1099s are often required (when payments exceed some\n amount, such as $500)\n        \nsmall scale barter transactions\n\n\n\n\nbut the nature of CA is that many transactions can be\n financial while appearing to be something else (like the\n transfer of music or images, or even the writing of\n letters)\n    \nwhich is why a cusp is coming: full disclosure is one\n route, protection of privacy is another\n\n\nthe government may cite the dangers of a ‚Äúgood old boy\n network‚Äù (literally) that promulgates racist, sexist, and\n ableist discrimination via computer networks\n    \ni.e., that the new networks are ‚Äúunder-representing\n people of color‚Äù\nand how can quotas be enforced in an anonymous system?\n\n\nproposals in California (7-92) that consultants file\n monthly tax statements, have tax witheld, etc.\na strategy for the IRS: require all computer network users\n to have a ‚Äútaxpayer ID number‚Äù for all transactions, so\n that tax evasion can be checked\n16.26.5. Attempts to discredit reputation-based systems by deceit,\n   fraud, nonpayment, etc.\ndeliberate attacks on the reputation of services the\n government doesn‚Äôt want to see\nthere may be government operations to sabotage  businesses,\n to undermine such efforts before they get started\nanalogous to ‚Äúmail-bombing‚Äù an anonymous remailer\n16.26.6. Licensing of software developers may be one method used to\n   try to control the spread of anonymous systems and\n   information markets\nby requiring a ‚Äúbusiness license‚Äù attached to any and all\n chunks of code\nimplemented via digital signatures, a la the code signing\n protocols mentioned by Bob Baldwin as a means of reducing\n trapdoors, sabotage, and other modifications by spies,\n hackers, etc.\n    \nproposals to require all chunks of code to be signed,\n after the Sililcon Valley case in mid-80s, where\n spy/saboteur went to several s/w companies and meddled\n with code\n\n\n‚Äúseals‚Äù from some group such as ‚ÄúSoftware Writers\n Laboratories,‚Äù with formal specs required, source code\n provided to a trusted keeper, etc.\nsuch licensing and inspection will also serve to lock-in\n the current players (Microsoft will love it) and make\n foreign competition in software more difficult\n    \nunless the foreign competition is ‚Äúsanctioned,‚Äù e.g.,\n Microsoft opens a code facility in India\n16.26.7. RICO-like seizures of computers and bulletin board systems\n\n\nsting operations and setups\nSteve Jackson Games is obvious example\nfor illegal material (porno, drug advocacy, electronic\n money, etc.) flowing through their systems\neven when sysop can prove he did not know illegal acts were\n being committed on his system (precedents are the yachts\n seized because a roach was found)\nthese seizures can occur even when a trial is never held\n    \ne.g., the ‚Äúadministrative seizure‚Äù of cars in Portland in\n prostitution cases\nand the seizures are on civil penalties, where the\n standards of proof are much lower\n\n\nin some cases a mere FBI investigation is enough to get\n employees fired, renters kicked out, IRS audits started\n    \nreports that a woman in Georgia who posted some ‚ÄúULs‚Äù\n (unlisted numbers?) was fired by her company after the\n FBI got involved, told by her landlord that her lease was\n not being extended, and so forth\n        \n‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt truck with no spies‚Äù\n\n\nthe IRS audit would not ostensibly be for harassment, but\n for ‚Äúprobable cause‚Äù (or whatever term they use) that tax\n avoidance, under-reporting, even money-laundering might\n be involved\n16.26.8. Outlawing of Digital Pseudonyms and Credentialling\n\n\nmay echoe the misguided controversy over Caller ID\n    \nmisguided because the free market solution is clear: let\n those who wish to hide their numbers-rape and battering\n support numbers, police, detectives, or even just\n citizens requesting services or whatever-do so\nand let those who refuse to deal with these anonymous\n callers also do so (a simple enough programming of\n answering machines and telephones)\n\n\nfor example, to prevent minors and felons from using the\n systems, ‚Äútrue names‚Äù may be required, with heavy fines and\n forfeitures of equipment and assets for anybody that fails\n to comply (or is caught in stings and setups)\nminors may get screened out of parts of cyberspace by\n mandatory ‚Äúage credentialing‚Äù (‚Äúcarding‚Äù)\n    \nthis could be a major threat to such free and open\n systems, as with the various flaps over minors logging on\n to the Internet and seeing X-rated images (however poorly\n rendered) or reading salacious material in alt.sex\nthere may be some government mood to insist that only\n ‚Äútrue names‚Äù be used, to facillitate such age screening\n (Fiat-Shamir passports, papers, number of the Beast?)\n\n\nthe government may argue that digital pseudonyms are\n presumptively considered to be part of a conspiracy, a\n criminal enterprise, tax evasion, etc.\n    \nthe old ‚Äúwhat have you got to hide‚Äù theory\nclosely related to the issue of whether false IDs can be\n used even when no crimes are being committed (that is,\n can Joe Average represent himself by other than his True\n Name?)\n\n\ncivil libertarians may fight this ban, arguing that\n Americans are not required to present ‚Äúpapers‚Äù to\n authorities unless under direct suspicion for a crime\n (never mind the loitering laws, which take the other view)\n16.26.9. Anonymous systems may be restricted on the grounds that they\n   constitute a public nuisance\nor that they promote crime, espionage, etc.\nespecially after a few well-publicized abuses\n    \npossibly instigated by the government?\n\n\noperators may have to post bonds that effectively drive\n them out of business\n16.26.10. Corporations may be effectively forbidden to hire consultants\n   or subcontractors as individuals\nthe practical issue: the welter of tax and benefit laws\n make individuals unable to cope with the mountains of forms\n that have to be filed\n    \nthus effectively pricing individuals out of this market\n\n\nthe tax law side: recall the change in status of\n consultants a few years back‚Ä¶this may be extended further\n    \na strategy for the IRS: require all computer network\n users to have a ‚Äútaxpayer ID number‚Äù for all\n transactions, so that tax evasion can be checked\nnot clear how this differs from the point above, but I\n feel certain more such pressures will be applied (after\n all, most corporations tend to see independent\n contractors as more of a negative than a positive)\n\n\nthis may be an agenda of the already established companies:\n they see consultants and free lancers as thieves and\n knaves, stealing their secrets and disseminating the crown\n jewels (to punningly mix some metaphors)\nand since the networks discussed here facilitate the use of\n consultants, more grounds to limit them\n16.26.11. There may be calls for U.N. control of the world banking\n   system in the wake of the BCCI and similar scandals\nto ‚Äúpeirce the veil‚Äù on transnationals\ncalls for an end to banking secrecy\ntalk about denying access to the money centers of New York\n (but will this push the business offshore, in parallel to\n the Eurodollar market?)\nmotivations and methods\n    \nrecall the UNESCO attempt a few years back to credential\n reporters, ostensibly to prevent chaos and ‚Äúunfair‚Äù\n reporting‚Ä¶well, the BCCI and nuclear arms deals\n surfacing may reinvigorate the efforts of\n ‚Äúcredentiallers‚Äù\nthe USSR and other countries entering the world community\n may sense an opportunity to get in on the formation of\n ‚Äúboards of directors‚Äù of these kinds of banks and\n corporations and so may push the idea in the U.N.\n        \nsort of like a World Bank or IMF with even more power\n to step in and take control of other banks, and with\n the East Bloc and USSR having seats!\n16.26.12. ‚ÄúNational security‚Äù\n\n\n\n\nif the situation gets serious enough, a la a full-blown\n crypto anarchy system, mightn‚Äôt the government take the\n step of declaring a kind of national emergency?\nprovisions exist: ‚Äú401 Emergency‚Äù and FEMA plans\nof course, the USSR tried to intitiate emergency measures\n and failed\nrecall that a major goal of crypto anarchy is that the\n systems described here will be so widely deployed as to be\n essential or critical to the overall economy‚Ä¶any attempt\n to ‚Äúpull the plug‚Äù will also kill the economy\n16.26.13. Can authorities force the disclosure of a key?\non the ‚ÄúYes‚Äù side:\n    \nis same, some say,  as forcing combination to a safe\n containing information or stolen goods\n        \nbut some say-and a court may have ruled on this-that\n the safe can always be cut open and so the issue is\n mostly moot\nwhile forcing key disclosure is compelled testimony\n\n\nand one can always claim to have forgotten the key\ni.e., what happens when a suspect simply clams up?\nbut authorities can routinely demand cooperation in\n investigations, can seize records, etc.\n\n\non the ‚ÄúNo‚Äù side:\n    \ncan‚Äôt force a suspect to talk, whether about where he hid\n the loot or where his kidnap victim is hidden\npractically speaking, someone under indictment cannot be\n forced to reveal Swiss bank accounts‚Ä¶.this would seem\n to be directly analogous to a cryptographic key\nthus, the key to open an account would seem to be the\n same thing\na memorized key cannot be forced, says someone with EFF\n or CPSR\n\n\non balance, it seems clear that the disclosure of\n cryptographic keys cannot be forced (though the practical\n penalty for nondisclosure could be severe)\nbut this has not really been tested, so far as I know\nand many people say that such cooperation can be\n demanded‚Ä¶\n\n16.27. How Crypto Anarchy Advocates Will Fight Back\n16.27.1. Bypassing restrictions on commercial encryption packages by\n   not making them ‚Äúcommercial‚Äù\n\npublic domain\nfreely distributed\nafter all, the basic algorithms are simple and don‚Äôt really\n deserve patent protection: money will not be made by the\n originators of the code, but by the actual providers of\n services (for transmission and storage of packets)\n16.27.2. Noise and signals are often indistinguishable\nas with the LSB audio signal approach‚Ä¶unless the\n government outlaws live recordings or dubs on digital\n systems‚Ä¶\n16.27.3. Timed-release files (using encryption) will be used to hide\n   files, to ensure that governments cannot remove material they\n   don‚Äôt like\neasier said than done\n16.27.4. Legal approaches will also be taken: fundamental\n   constitutional issues\nprivacy, free speech, free association\n16.27.5. The Master Plan to Fight Restrictions on Encryption\n‚ÄúGenie out of the bottle‚Äù strategy: deploy crypto widely\n    \nintertwined with religions, games, whistleblower groups,\n and other uses that cannot easily just be shut down\nscattered in amongst many other activities\n\n\nMedia attention: get media to report on value of\n encryption, privacy, etc.\nDiffusion, confusion, and refusion\n    \nDiffuse the use by scattering it around\nConfuse the issue by fake religions, games, other uses\nRefuse to cooperate with the government\n\n\nFree speech arguments: calling the discussions free speech\n and forcing the government to prove that the free speech is\n actually an economic transaction\nlinks with religions, corporations, etc.\n    \nprivate meetings protected\nvoting systems\n\n\n\n16.28. Things that May Hide the Existence of Crypto Anarchy\n16.28.1. first and foremost, the incredible bandwidth, the bits\n   sloshing around the world‚Äôs networks‚Ä¶tapes being exchanged,\n   PCs calling other PCs, a variety of data and compression\n   formats, ISDN, wireless transmission, etc.\n16.28.2. in the coming years, network traffic will jump a thousand-\n   fold, what with digital fax, cellular phones and computers,\n   ISDN, fiber optics, and higher-speed modems\n\nand these links will be of all kinds: local, private,\n corporate, business, commercial, bootleg (unrecorded),\n cellular radio, etc.\n16.28.3. corporations and small groups will have their own private\n   LANs and networks, with massive bandwidth, and with little\n   prospects that the government can police them-there can be no\n   law requiring that internal communications be readable by the\n   government!\nand the revelations that Ultra Black has been used to read\n messages and use the information will be further proof to\n corporations that they need to adopt very strong security\n measures\nand ‚Äúpartnerships‚Äù can be scattered across the country, and\n even internationally, and have great lattitude in setting\n up their own communication and encryption systems\n    \nrecall Cargill case\nand also remember that the government may crack down on\n these systems\n16.28.4. AMIX-like services, new services, virtual reality (for games,\n entertainment, or just as a place of doing business) etc.\n\n\nmany users will encrypt their links to VR servers, with a\n decryption agent at the other end, so that their activities\n (characters, fantasies, purchases, etc.) cannot be\n monitored and logged\n    \nthis will further increase the bandwidth of encrypted\n data and will complicate further the work of the NSA and\n similar agencies\n        \nattempts to force ‚Äúin the clear‚Äù links will be doomed\n by the welter of PC standards, compression utilities,\n cellular modems, and the like‚Ä¶there will be no\n ‚Äúcleartext‚Äù that can be mandated\n16.28.5. steganography\n\n\n\n\nin general, impossible to know that a message contains\n other encypted messages\n    \nexcept in stings and setups, which may be ruled illegal\n\n\nthe LSB method, and variants\n    \nLSB of DAT, DCC, MD, etc., or even sound bites (chunks of\n sampled sounds traded on bulletin boards)\n        \nespecially of live or analog-dubbed copies (the noise\n floor of a typical consumer-grade mike is much higher\n than the LSB of DAT)\n\n\nof images, Adobe Photoshop images, artwork, etc.\n        \nimagine an ‚ÄúOnline Art Gallery‚Äù that is used to store\n messages, or a ‚ÄúPhoto Gallery‚Äù that participants post\n their best photos to, offering them for sale\n            \nSturges case\nLSB method\n\n\n\n\ngets into some theoretical nitpicking about the true\n nature of noise, especially if the entire LSB channel is\n uncharacteristic of ‚Äúreal noise‚Äù\n        \nbut by reducing the bandwidth somewhat, the noise\n profile can be made essentially undistinguishable from\n real noise\nand a 2 GB DAT produces 130 MB of LSB, which is a lot\n of margin!\n\n\nwhat could the government do?\n        \nstings and setups to catch and scare off potential\n users\nan attempt to limit the wide use of digital\n data-hopeless!\na requirement for government-approved ‚Äúdithering‚Äù?\n            \nthis would be an enforcement nightmare\nand would only cause the system to be moved into\n higher bits\n                \nand with enough error correction, even audible\n dithering of the signal would not wipe out the\n encrypted signal\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvariants: text justification, word selection\n        \nbandwidth tends to be low\nbut used in Three Days of the Condor\n\n\n\n\nvirtual reality art may further enable private\n communications\n    \nthink of what can be encrypted into such digital images!\nand user has total privacy and is able to manipulate the\n images and databases locally\n16.28.6. in the sense that these other things, such as the governments\n own networks of safe houses, false identities, and bootleg\n payoffs, will tend to hide any other such systems that emerge\n\n\nbecause investigators may think they‚Äôve stumbled onto yet\n another intelligence operation, or sting, or whatever\n    \nthis routinely cripples undercover investigations\nscenario: criminals even float rumors that another agency\n is doing an operation‚Ä¶.?\n16.28.7.

She writes up a typical ad,\n ‚ÄúSWF seeks SWM for fun and walks on the beach‚Ä¶‚Äù\nAlice encloses her specially-selected public key, which\n is effectively her only name. This is probably a one-\n time deal, unlinkable to her in any way.\nShe encrypts the entire package and sends it through a\n remailing chain (or DC-Net) for eventual posting in a\n public place.\nEveryone can download the relevant area (messages can\n be sorted by type, or organized in interest groups),\n with nobody else knowing which messages they‚Äôre\n reading.\nBob reads her message and decides to repond. He\n digitizes a photo of himself and includes some other\n info, but not his real name. He also picks a public key\n for Alice to communicate with him.\nBob encrypts all of this with the public key of Alice\n (though remember that he has no way of knowing who she\n really is).\nBob sends this message through a remailing chain and it\n gets posted as an encrypted message addressed to the\n public key of Alice. Again, some organization can\n reduce the total bandwidth (e.g., an area for\n ‚ÄúReplies‚Äù).\nAlice scans the replies and downloads a group of\n messages that includes the one she can see-and only she\n can see!-is addressed to her.\nThis has established a two-way communication path\n between Alice and Bob without either of them knowing\n who the other one is or where they live. (The business\n about the photos is of course not conducive to\n anonymity, but is consistent with the ‚ÄúPersonals‚Äù\n mode.)\nIf Alice and Bob wish to meet in person it is then easy\n for them to communicate real phone numbers and the\n like.\n\n\nWhy is this interesting?\n        \nit establishes a role for anonymous systems\nit could increase the bandwidth of such messages\n\n\n\n\nLegal Services (Legitimate, i.e., not even the bootleg\n stuff)\n    \nprotected by attorney-client privileges, but various Bar\n Associations may place limits on the use of networks\n        \nbut if viewed the way phones are, seems unlikely that\n Bars could do much to limit the use of computer\n networks\n\n\nand suppose a Nolo Press-type publishing venture started\n up on the Nets?

The Coming Phase Change\n16.29.1. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd better hope that strong cypto, cheap telecoms and free\n   markets can provide the organizing basis for a workable\n   society because it is clear that coercion as an organizing\n   principle ain‚Äôt what it used to be.‚Äù    [Duncan Frissell, in\n   his sig, 4-13-94]\n16.29.2. ‚ÄúWhat is the ‚Äúinevitability‚Äù argument?‚Äù\n\nOften made by me (Tim May), Duncan Frissell, Sandy\n Sandfort, and Perry Metzger (with some twists). And Hal\n Finney takes issue with certain aspects and contributes\n incisive critiques.\nReasons:\n    \nborders becoming more transparent to data flow\nencryption is not detectable/stoppable\nderivative financial instruments, money sloshing across\n borders\ntransnationalism\ncash machines, wire transfers\n‚Äúpermanent tourists‚Äù\n\n\nBorders are becoming utterly transparent to massive data\n flows. The rapid export of crypto is but an ironic example\n of this. Mosaid, ftp, gopher, lynx‚Ä¶all cross borders\n fluidly and nearly untraceably. It is probably too late to\n stop these systems, short of ‚Äúpulling the plug‚Äù on the Net,\n and this pulling the plug is simply too expensive to\n consider. (If the Feds ever really figure out the long-\n range implications of this stuff, they may try it‚Ä¶but\n probably not.)\n16.29.3. ‚ÄúWhat is the ‚Äúcrypto phase change‚Äù?‚Äù\nI‚Äôm normally skeptical of claims that a ‚Äúsingularity‚Äù is\n coming (nanotechnology being the usual place this is\n claimed, a la Vinge), but ‚Äúphase changes‚Äù are more\n plausible. The effect of cheap printing was one such phase\n change, altering the connectivity of society and the\n dispersion of knowledge in a way that can best be described\n as a phase change. The effects of strong crypto, and the\n related ideas of digital cash, anonymous markets, etc., are\n likely to be similar.\ntransition\ntipping factors, disgust by populace, runaway taxation\n‚Äúleverage effect‚Äù\n    \nwhat Kelly called ‚Äúthe fax effect‚Äù\ncrypto use spreads, made more popular by common use\n\n\ncan nucleate in a small group‚Ä¶doesn‚Äôt need mass\n acceptance\n16.29.4. ‚ÄúCan crypto anarchy be stopped?‚Äù\nA goal is to get crypto widely enough deployed that it\n cannot then be stopped\n    \nto the point of no return, where the cost of withdrawing\n or banning a technology is simply too high (not always a\n guaranteee)\n\n\nThe only recourse is a police state in which homes and\n businesses are randomly entered and searched, in which\n cryptography is outlawed and vigorously prosecuted, in\n which wiretaps, video surveillance, and other forms of\n surveillance are used aggressively, and in which perhaps\n the very possession of computers and modems is restricted.\nAnything short of these police state tactics will allow the\n development of the ideas discussed here. To some extent.\n But enough to trigger the transition to a mostly crypto\n anarchic situation.\n(This doesn‚Äôt mean everyone, or even most, will use crypto\n anarchy.)\n16.29.5. Need not be a universal or even popular trend\neven if restricted to a minority, can be very influential\nGeorge Soros, Quantum fund, central banks, Spain, Britain,\n Germany\nand a minority trend can affect others\n16.29.6. ‚ÄúNational borders are just speedbumps on the digital\n   superhighway.‚Äù\n16.29.7. ‚ÄúDoes crypto anarchy have to be a mass movement to succeed?‚Äù\nGiven that only a tiny fraction is now aware of the\n implications‚Ä¶.\nPrecedents for ‚Äúvanguard‚Äù movements\n    \nhigh finance in general is an elite thing\n        \nEurodollars, interest rate swaps, etc‚Ä¶.not exactly\n Joe Average‚Ä¶and yet of incredible importance (George\n Soros has affected European central bank policy)\n\n\nsmuggling is in general not a mass thing\netc.\n\n\nThus, the users of crypto anarchic tools and instruments\n can have an effect out of proportion to their numbers\n    \nothers will start to use\nresentment by the ‚Äúsuckers‚Äù will build\nthe services themselves‚Äìthe data havens, the credit\n registries, the espionage markets‚Äìwill of course have a\n real effect\n16.29.8. Strong crypto does not mean the end to law enforcement\n\n\n‚Äú‚Ä¶cryptography is not by any means a magic shield for\n criminals.  It eliminates, perhaps, one avenue by which\n crimes might be discovered.  However, it is most certainly\n not the case that someone who places an open anonymous\n contract for a murder in an open forum is doing so ‚Äúrisk\n free‚Äù.  There are plenty of ways she might be found out.\n Likewise, big secret societies that nefariously undermine\n the free world via cryptography are as vulnerable as ever\n to the motivations of their own members to expose the\n groups in a double-cross.‚Äù [Mike McNally, 1994-09-09]\n\n16.30. Loose Ends\n16.30.1. governments may try to ban the use of encryption in any\n   broadcast system, no matter how low the power, because of a\n   realization that all of them can be used for crypto anarchy\n   and espionage\n\na losing battle, of course, what with wireless LANs of\n several flavors, cellular modems, the ability to hide\n information, and just the huge increase in bandwidth\n16.30.2. ‚Äútontines‚Äù\nEric Hughes wrote up some stuff on this in 1992 [try to get\n it]\nItalian pseudo-insurance arrangements\n‚Äúdigital tontines‚Äù?\n16.30.3. Even in market anarchies, there are times when a top-down,\n   enforced set of behaviors is desirable. However, instead of\n   being enforced by threat of violence, the market itself\n   enforces a standard.\nFor example, the Macintosh OS, with standardized commands\n that program developers are ‚Äúencouraged‚Äù to use. Deviations\n are obviously allowed, but the market tends to punish such\n deviations. (This has been useful in avoiding modal\n software, where the same keystroke sequence might save a\n file in one program and erase it in another. Sadly, the\n complexity of modern software has outpaced the Mac OS\n system, so that Command-Option Y often does different\n things in different programs.)\nMarket standards are a noncoercive counter to total chaos.\n16.30.4. Of course, nothing stops people from hiring financial\n   advisors, lawyers, and even ‚ÄúProtectors‚Äù to shield them from\n   the predations of others. Widows and orphans could choose\n   conservative conservators, while young turks could choose to\n   go it alone.\n16.30.5. on who can tolerate crypto anarchy\nNot much different here from how things have been in the\n past. Caveat emptor. Look out for Number One. Beware of\n snake oil.\n16.30.6. Local enforcement of rules rather than global rules\ne.g., flooding of Usenet with advertising and chain letters\n    \ntwo main approaches\n        \nban such things, or set quotas, global acceptable use\n policies, etc. (or use tort law to prosecute & collect\n damages)\nlocal carrriers decide what they will and will not\n carry, and how much they‚Äôll charge\n\n\nit‚Äôs the old rationing vs. market pricing argument\n16.30.7. Locality is a powerful concept\n\n\nself-responsibility\nwho better to make decisions than those affected?\ntighter feedback loops\navoids large-scale governments\nNonlocally-arranged systems often result in calls to stop\n ‚Äúhogging‚Äù of resources, and general rancor and envy\n    \nwater consumption is the best example: anybody seen\n ‚Äúwasting‚Äù water, regardless of their conservations\n elsewhere or there priorities, is chastised and rebuked.\n Sometimes the water police are called.\n        \nthe costs involved (perhaps a few pennies worth of\n water, to wash a car or water some roses) are often\n trivial‚Ä¶meanwhile, billions of acre-feet of water are\n sold far below cost to farmers who grow monsoon crops\n like rice in the California desert\nthis hypocrisy is high on my list of reasons why free\n markets are morally preferable to rationing-based\n systems\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Future\n\n17.1. copyright\n   THE  CYPHERNOMICON: Cypherpunks FAQ and More, Version 0.666,\n   1994-09-10, Copyright Timothy C.

Miscellaneous Comments\n\n17.3. Progress Needed\n17.3.1. ‚ÄúWhy have most of the things Cypherpunks talk about not\n   happened?‚Äù\n\nExcept for remailers and basic crypto, few of the main\n ideas talked about for so long have actually seen any kind\n of realization. There are many reasons:\n   A. Difficult to achieve. Both Karl Kleinpaste and Eric\n   Hughes implemented simple first-generation remailers in a\n   matter of days, but ‚Äúdigital cash‚Äù and ‚Äúaptical\n   foddering,‚Äù for example, are not quite so\n   straightforward. (I am of course not taking anything away\n   from Kleinpaste, Hughes, Helsingius, Finney, etc., just\n   noting that redirecting mail messages‚Äìand even\n   implementing PGP and things like delay, batching, etc.,\n   into remailers‚Äìis a lot easier conceptually than DC-Nets\n   and the like.\n   B. Protocols are confusing, tough to implement. Only a tiny\n   fraction of the ‚Äúcrypto primitives‚Äù discussed at Crypto\n   Conferences, or in the various crypto books, have been\n   realized as runnable code. Building blocks like ‚Äúbit\n   commitment‚Äù have not even‚Äìto my knowledge‚Äìbeen\n   adequately realized as reusable code. (Certainly various\n   groups, such as Chaum‚Äôs, have cobbled-together things\n   like bit commitment‚Ä¶.I just don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a\n   consensus as to the form, and this has limited the\n   ability of nonspecialists to use these ‚Äúobjects.‚Äù)\n   C.

Interoperablity is problematic. Many platforms, many\n   operating systems, many languages. Again, remailers and\n   encryption work because there is a de facto lowest common\n   denominator for them: the simple text block, used in e-\n   mail, editors, input and output from programs, etc. That\n   is, we all mostly know exactly what an ASCII text block\n   is, and crypto programs are expected to know how to\n   access and manipulate such blocks. This largely explains\n   the success of PGP across many platforms‚Äìtext blocks are\n   the basic element. Ditto for Cypherpunks remialers, which\n   operate on the text blocks found in most mail systems.\n   The situation becomes much murkier for things like\n   digital money, which are not standalone objects and are\n   often multi-party protocols involving time delays,\n   offline processing, etc.\n   E. Lack of an economic motive. We on this list are not being\n   paid to develop anything, are not assisted by anyone, and\n   don‚Äôt have the financial backing of corporations to\n   assist us. Since much of today‚Äôs ‚Äúsoftware development‚Äù\n   is actually deal-making and standards negotiation, we\n   are left out of lots of things.\n\n17.4.

The scary thing is, they  really think they\n have a good idea about what all those laws should be, and\n they‚Äôre perfectly willing to shove it down our throats,\n regardless of the vast diversity of culture, intellectual,\n political, and legal opinion on the planet.‚Äù\n [an50@desert.hacktic.nl (Nobody),  libtech-l@netcom.com,\n 1994-06-08]\nwhy I‚Äôm not sanguine about Feds\n    \nkilling Randy Weaver‚Äôs wife and son from a distance,\n after trumped-up weapons charges\nburning alive the Koresh compound, on trumped-up charges\n of Satanism, child abuse, and wife-insulting\nseizures of boats, cars, etc., on ‚Äúsuspicion‚Äù of\n involvement with drugs\n\n\n\n17.12. ‚ÄúThe Future‚Äôs So Bright, I Gotta Wear Shades‚Äù\n17.12.1.

Duncan Frissell puts it this way:\n\n\n‚ÄúTrade is way up.  Wealth is way up.  International travel\n is way up. Migration is way up.  Resource prices are the\n lowest in human history.

The quantity and quality\n of  goods and services offered on the markets is at an all-\n time high.  The percentage of the world‚Äôs countries headed\n by dictators is the lowest it‚Äôs ever been.\n‚ÄúWhat all this means is that political philosophies that\n depend on force of arms to push people into line,  will\n increasingly fail to work.  Rich people with choices will,\n when  coerced, tend to change their investments and\n business affairs into a friendlier form or to move to a\n friendlier  environment.  Choice is real.

Quantum Cryptography\n18.3.1. ‚ÄúWhat is quantum cryptography?‚Äù\n\nTwo main flavors:\n    \nsecure channels exploiting the Uncertainty Principle\n        \nBrassard, Bennett, fiber optic lines, short distances,\n detects tapping\n            \nQuantum cryptography\n                \nbits can be exchanged-albeit at fairly low\n efficiencies-over a channel\nwith detection of taps, via the change of\n polarizations\nStephen Wiesner wrote a 1970 paper, half a decade\n before the P-K work, which outlined this-not\n published until much later\n                    \nspeculate that the NSA knew about this and\n quashed the publication\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfactoring of numbers using a strange Many World\n interpretation\n        \nShor\nhearkens to my spoof about Russians\n            \nI never knew I hit so close to the mark!\n18.3.2. ‚ÄúWhat about quantum cryptography?‚Äù\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploiting Uncertainty Principle to make untappable\n communication lines. (More precisely, tapped lines give\n indication of having been tapped.)\n    \nBennett and Brassard\nfaint flashes of light in a fiber optic cable used;\n polarized photons\nAlice and  Bob go through a protocol that involves them\n picking Linear or Circular Polarization (LP or CP); can‚Äôt\n be simultaneously measured‚Ä¶\n-\n\n\nNot likely to be important for a long time.\nAn additional tool, or crypto primitive building block.\n\n18.4. Chaotic Cryptography\n18.4.1. the oscillator scheme was broken at Crypto ‚Äò94\n18.5. Neural Nets and AI in Crypto\n18.5.1. ‚ÄúWhat about neural nets and AI in crypto?‚Äù\n\nOf limited use, at least in breaking modern ciphers. Marvin\n Minsky once said that if you don‚Äôt understand how to solve\n a problem, adding randomness usually doesn‚Äôt help.\nThe shape of  the solution space is very spiky, very poorly-\n suited to hill-climbing or divide-and-conquer methods\n\nNeural nets are not likely to do well with modern ciphers\n (e.g., RSA, IDEA, DES, etc.), mainly because of the shape\n of the solution space.  Instead of the ‚Äúrolling hills and\n valleys‚Äù that neural nets (and related methods, such as\n genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, etc.) do well in,\n the solution space for modern ciphers offers very little in\n the way of ‚Äúlearning‚Äù opportunities: you either have the\n solution (the key), or you don‚Äôt.\nThink of a needle standing up from a flat plain‚Ä¶a NN or\n any other hill-climber could wander for years and never\n find it. Well-designed modern ciphers like RSA and IDEA\n appear to admit no analysis based on ‚Äúnonrandom‚Äù\n properties. If anybody has found shortcuts to factoring the\n modulus in RSA, for example, they haven‚Äôt let on.\nI suspect there are uses in peripheral aspects, such as\n guessing passwords (when people have not picked high-\n entropy passwords, but have instead used familiar names).\n Or in traffic analysis. Those who munch on lots of traffic\n may well be using neural nets, custom signal processing,\n etc. to ‚Äúprepare‚Äù the captured traffic for further\n analysis. A safe bet, in fact.\nBut the move in modern cryptology is definitely away from\n using anything with ‚Äústructure‚Äù that can be learned. Put\n another way, neural nets and such work well in structured\n environments, where there‚Äôs something to _learn), but not\n in the high-entropy, seemingly random world of encrypted\n data.\n\nAI may be useful in other areas\n        \nprotocol generation\nSIGINT\n18.5.2. Evolutionary or Genetic Programming\n\n\n\n\na la Holland, Koza\nRNGs\n\n18.6. Miscellaneous Advanced Crypto Ideas\n18.6.1. ‚ÄúWhy have provably ‚ÄúNP-complete‚Äù problems not found uses in\n   crypto?‚Äù\n\nOne of the great Unresolved Mysteries! Or the Holy Grail,\n if you will.\nThe issue is why have provably hard (or NP-complete, to be\n more accurate) problems not been used? (Factoring is not\n known to NP-complete‚Ä¶experts can correct my phrasing here\n if I‚Äôm misstating things.)\nIt would be nice if a provably hard problem, such as the\n domino tiling problem, or 3SAT, or other such things out of\n Garey and Johnson‚Äôs book on NP-Completeness could be used.\n This would increase confidence in ciphers still further.\n18.6.2. ‚ÄúCan cellular automata, like Conway‚Äôs ‚ÄúGame of Life,‚Äù be used\n   for cryptography?‚Äù\nStephen Wolfram proposed use of cellular automata for\n crytography some years back; his collection of essays on\n cellular automata contains at least one such mention. Many\n people suspected that 1D CAs were no stronger than linear\n feedback shift registers (LFSRs), and I recally hearing a\n couple of years ago that someone proved 1D CAs (and maybe\n all CAs?) are equivalent to LFSRs, which have been used in\n crypto for many years.\nWolfram‚Äôs book is ‚ÄúTheory and Applications of Cellular\n Automata,‚Äù 1986, World Scientific. Several papers on using\n CAs for random sequence generation. P. Bardell showed\n in1990 that CAs produce the outputs of LFSRs.) Wolfram also\n has a paper, ‚ÄúCryptography with cellular automata,‚Äù in\n Proc. CRYPTO 85.\nIntuitively, the idea of a CA looks attractive for ‚Äúone-way\n functions,‚Äù for the reasons mentioned. But what‚Äôs the\n ‚Äútrapdoor‚Äù that gives the key holder a shortcut to reverse\n the process? (Public key crypto needs a trapdoor 1-way\n funtion that is easy to reverse if one has the right\n information).\n\n18.7. Viruses and Crypto\n18.7.1. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the connection between Cypherpunks and viruses?‚Äù\n\nLike, dewd, it‚Äôs so kool.\nBeavis ‚Äòn Butthead use PGP (actually, Eric Hughes proposed\n at one point that we suggest a crypto tie-in to the\n writers)\nThere‚Äôs only peripheral connection.\nViruses can be spread with anonymous remailers, but digital\n signatures can be used to safeguard software. Signed\n software, no mods allowed.\n18.7.2. ‚ÄúWhat about the ‚Äúencryption viruses,‚Äù like KOH?‚Äù\n(A little far afield, but the issue does come up.)\nSomebody asked about this on sci.crypt and Vesselin\n Bontchev said:  ‚ÄúThis topic has been debated to death in\n alt.security.pgp, when somebody posted KOH, without even a\n warning that it is a virus‚Ä¶..Both viruses indeed use the\n IDEA cipher - the same that is used both by SecureDevice\n and SecureDrive. However, the viruses pose some significant\n threats to the integrity of your data, exactly because of\n their viral replication means‚Ä¶..Also, if you aquire it by\n viral means, you do not get the doumentation and one\n utility, both of which are essential for the proper usage\n of the product - thus proving one more time that its viral\n capabilities are unnecessary and harmful. Also, the virus\n does not come in source, which means that it could have\n some hidden backdoors or simply security flaws, and you\n have no way to check this or to fix them. At last, in some\n cases the virus could destroy valuable information during\n its replication process.‚Äù\n‚ÄúIn short - don‚Äôt use them. You will gain nothing over\n using\n stand-alone encryption programs, and you‚Äôll expose your\n data‚Äôs\n integrity to significant risks. Those viruses are\n completely useless\n and even harmful; they have been created with the only\n reason to\n condone the illicit activities of the virus writers, by\n claiming that\n computer viruses can be ‚Äúuseful‚Äù.‚Äù [Vesselin Bontchev,\n sci.crypt, 1994-08-31]\n18.7.3. ‚ÄúWhat about viruses? Are there any ties to crypto and\n   Cypherpunks themes?‚Äù\nNo direct link that any of us see clearly. Occasionally a\n virus fan sees the ‚Äúpunks‚Äù name and thinks we‚Äôre involved\n in writing viruses. (Actually, a few folks on the list have\n virus expertise.)\nCrypto may protect against viruses, by having code signed.\n And the reliance on self-responsibility and self-protection\n is in contrast to the legal approach, which tends not to\n work too well for virus protection (by the covert nature of\n many viruses).\n18.7.4. ‚ÄúWhat interests do Cypherpunks have in viruses?‚Äù\nNot much, though the topic comes up periodically.\nSome overlap in the communities involved.\nAnd there are some virus methods which use forms of\n encryption.\nAlso, digital signatures on code can be used to ensure that\n code has not been modified since being released by the\n original author.\n\n18.8. Making Money in Crypto\n18.8.1. ‚ÄúHow can I make money in crypto?‚Äù\n\ncrypto experts are hired by software companies\nstart up companies\n    \na tough road\nnot clear that even Phil Zimmermann has made money\nand even RSADSI is facing a challenge (hasn‚Äôt gone\n public, not a cash cow, etc.)\n\n\nThere may be an explosive growth‚Äìthe phase change I often\n talk about‚Äìand many opportunities will emerge. But, having\n said this, I still don‚Äôt see obvious opportunities right\n now. And starting a company based on hope and ideology,\n rather than supplying a real market or pushing real\n technology (market pull vs. technology push argument) seem\n misguided.\n\n18.9. The Net\n18.9.1. Limitations of the current net\n\ninteroperability\nsubsidized, not pay as you go\n    \nmakes spamming inevitable, doesn‚Äôt allocate resources to\n those who want them the most\nthis will require digicash in a better form than most\n users now have access to\n\n\nsysadmins get worried\nencryption sometimes banned\ncommon carrier status not clear\ngeneral cruftiness of Net (‚Äúimminent death of Usenet\n predicted‚Äù)\n\n18.10. Duress Switches, Dead Man Switches\n18.10.1. ‚ÄúWhat about ‚Äúduress‚Äù codes for additional security?‚Äù\n\nWhere a harmless decrytion can be done, or an alarm sent.\nExamples\n    \nsending alarm, like an under the counter alarm button\ndecrypting a bank card number for a lesser-value account\ntwo sets of books (not strictly a ‚Äúduress‚Äù code, unless\n you view the IRS as causing duress)\nalarms to associates, as in cells\n\n\n‚Äù Having a separate authentication mechanism that is used\n under duress is a very good idea that some existing systems\n already\n employ‚Ä¶.  From a systems point of view, it is hard to\n figure out exactly how the system should respond when it\n recognizes a duress authentication‚Ä¶.The safe inside the\n ATM machines used by BayBanks (Boston Mass) can be opened\n with two combinations.  One combination sends an alarm to\n the bank via a separate phone line (not the one used to\n perform the ATM transaction).  The alarm phone line is also\n connected to a conventional panic switch.‚Äù [Bob Baldwin,\n Duress Passwords/PINs/Combinations, 1993-11-18]\n18.10.2. Duress switches, dead man switches, etc.\n‚ÄúDigital flash paper,‚Äù can be triggered to erase files,\n etc.\n    \n(BATF and DEA raiders may have sophisticated means of\n disabling computers)\n\n\nDuress codes‚Ä¶‚Äúerase my files,‚Äù ways of not giving esrowed\n information unless proper code is given, etc.\n    \n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt release if I am under indictment‚Äù\n        \ninteresting issues about secret indictments, about\n publicity of such cases, access to court records by\n offshore computers, etc.\n18.10.3. Personal security for disks, dead man switches\n\n\n\n\nI have heard that some BBS operators install dead man\n switches near the doors to rooms containing their\n systems‚Ä¶entering the room without flipping the switch\n causes some action to be taken\n    \nerasing a disk, dumping a RAM disk (a dangerous way to\n store data, given power failures, soft errors, restarts,\n etc.)\n\n\n\n18.11. Can Encryption be Detected?\n18.11.1. ‚ÄúCan messages be scanned and checked for encryption?‚Äù\n\nIf the encryption produces markers or other indications,\n then of course. ‚ÄúBEGIN PGP‚Äù is a pretty clear beacon. (Such\n markers assists in decryption by the recipient, but are not\n essential. ‚ÄúStealth‚Äù versions of PGP and other encryption\n programs‚Äìsuch as S-Tools for DOS‚Äìdon‚Äôt have such\n markers.)\nIf the encryption produces ‚Äúrandom-looking‚Äù stuff, then\n entropy measures and other statistical tests may or may not\n be able detect such messages reliably. Depends on what non-\n encrypted messages look like, and how the algorithm  works.\nSteganography:\n    \nmaking messages look like normal ones\ntucking th ebits in with other random-like bits, such as\n in the low-order bits of images or sound files\n\n\nThe practical concern depends on one‚Äôs local political\n environment. In many countries, mere suspicion of using\n crypto could put one in real danger.\n\n18.12. Personal Digital Assistants, Newtons, etc.\n18.12.1. ‚ÄúAre there cryptographic uses for things like Newtons?‚Äù\n\nProbably. Eventually. Digital wallets, portable key\n holders, local agents for access, etc.\nMeanwhile, a few encryption programs exist.

Physical Security\n18.13.1. ‚ÄúCan fiber optical cables be tapped?‚Äù\n\nYes. Light can escape from the fiber in bends, and ‚Äúnear-\n field‚Äù tapping is theoretically possible, at least under\n lab conditions. Active measures for puncturing cable\n shields and tapping fibers are also possible.\n    \n‚ÄúThe Fed‚Äôs want a cost effective F/O tap.

Cypherpunks List Issues\n18.15.1. too much noise on the list?\n\n‚ÄúOf all the lists I‚Äôm subscribed to, this is the only one\n that I read\n every article in.  Even the ‚Äúnoise‚Äù articles.  Humans\n being what\n they are, the noise is needed to help decide the direction\n of the\n group.  Besides, for those of us who are just starting on\n our journey\n through crypto-underworld need the noise to help\n familiarize\n ourselves with how crypto works.  I‚Äôve learned more from\n the informal\n ramblings than I‚Äôve gathered out of all the formal and/or\n mathematical\n postings to date.‚Äù [Patrick E. Hykkonen, 5-25-93]\n\n18.16. Tamper-Resistant Modules\n18.16.1. TRMs‚Äìclaims that ‚ÄúPicbuster‚Äù processor can be locally\n   overwritten with focussed or directed UV (OTP)\n18.16.2. tamper-resistant modules have some downsides as well\n\ncash registers for ensuring compliance with all relevant\n sales tax, value-added tax (VAT), and rationing rules; a\n tamper-resistant module cash register could be the\n enforcement mechanism for a national security state.\n‚Äúobservers‚Äù\n\n18.17. Deeper Connections\n18.17.1. In several places I‚Äôve referred to ‚Äúdeep connections‚Äù between\n   things like crypto, money, game theory, evolutionary\n   ecologies, human motivations, and the nature of law. By this\n   I mean that there are deeper, unifying principles. Principles\n   involving locality, identity, and disclosure of knowledge. A\n   good example: the deep fairness of ‚Äúcut-and-choose‚Äù protocols-\n   -I‚Äôve seen mention of this in game theory tesxts, but not\n   much discussion of other, similar protocols.\n18.17.2. For example, below the level of number theory and algorithms\n   in cryptology lies a level dealing with ‚Äúidentity,‚Äù ‚Äúproof,‚Äù\n   ‚Äúcollusion,‚Äù and other such core concepts, concepts that can\n   almost be dealt with independent of the acual algorithms\n   (though the concrete realization of public key methods took\n   this out of the abstract realm of philosophy and made it\n   important to analyze). And these abstract concepts are linked\n   to other fields, such as economics, human psychology, law,\n   and evolutionary game theory (the study of evolved strategies\n   in multi-agent systems, e.g., human beings interacting and\n   trading with each other).\n18.17.3. I believe there are important questions about why things work\n   the way they do at this level. To be concrete, why do threats\n   of physical coercion create market distortions and what\n   effects does this have? Or, what is the nature of emergent\n   behavior in reputation-based systems? (The combinatiion of\n   crypto and economics is a fertile area, barely touched upon\n   by the academic cryptology community.) Why is locality is\n   important, and what does this mean for digital cash? Why does\n   regulation often produce more crime?\n18.17.4. Crypto and the related ideas of reputation, identity, and\n   webs of trust has introduced a new angle into economic\n   matters. I suspect there are a couple of Nobel Prizes in\n   Economics for those who integrate these important concepts.\n18.18. Loose End Loose Ends\n18.18.1.

Is it the ‚Äúreputations‚Äù that\n matter, or the ‚Äúanonymity‚Äù? The ‚Äúuntraceability‚Äù or the\n ‚Äúdigital money‚Äù?\n18.18.2. Price signalling in posts‚Ä¶for further information\nWhen an article is posted, and there is more complete\n information available elsewhere by ftp, gopher, mosaic,\n etc., then how is this to to be signalled without actually\n advertising prominently?\n    \nwhy not a code, like the ‚ÄúGeek code‚Äù so many people put\n in their sigs?

And many of us reject the idea of government-\n mandated ‚Äústandards,‚Äù so my phrasing here is not meant to\n imply support of such standards.\nMajor alternatives:\n    \nSet-top box, with t.v. as core of access to ‚Äúinformation\n superhighway.‚Äù\n        \nProblems:\n            \nlimited number of channels, even if ‚Äú500 channels‚Äù\nmakes t.v. the focus, loses some other capabilities\nfew consumers will have television sets with the\n resolution capabilities that even current computer\n monitors have (there are reasons for this: size of\n monitors (related to viewing distance), NTSC\n constraints, age of televisions, etc.)\n\n\n\n\nSwitched-packet cable, as in ATM or even SONET\n (Synchronous Optical Network) access\n        \nAdvantages:\n            \nTelevision is just one more switched-packet\n transmission, not using up the bandwidth\n\n\n\n\nRadical Proposal: Complete deregulation\n        \nlet cable suppliers‚Äìespecially of optical fibers,\n which are small and unobtrusive‚Äìlay fibers to any home\n they can negotiate access to\n            \ne.g., by piggybacking on telephone lines, electrical\n cables, etc. (to remove the objection about unsightly\n new poles or cables being strung‚Ä¶should not be an\n issue with fiber optics)\n\n\nlet the market decide‚Ä¶let customers decide\n\n\n\n\nIn my view, government standards are a terrible idea here.\n Sure, NTSC was an effective standard, but it likely would\n have emerged without government involvement. Ditto for\n Ethernet and a zillion other standards. No need for\n government involvement.\n    \nOf course, when industry groups meet to discuss\n standards, one hopes that antitrust laws will not be\n invoked.\n18.18.4. minor point: the importance of ‚ÄúBut does it scale?‚Äù is often\n exaggerated\n\n\nin many cases, it‚Äôs much more important to simply get\n something deployed than it is to worry in advance about how\n it will break if too many people use it (e.g., MacDonald‚Äôs\n worrying in 1955 about scalabilty of their business).\nRemailer networks, for example, may not scale especially\n well in their current form‚Ä¶but who cares? Getting them\n used will allow further refinement.\n\n\nAppendices\n\n19.1. copyright\n   THE  CYPHERNOMICON: Cypherpunks FAQ and More, Version 0.666,\n   1994-09-10, Copyright Timothy C. May.

Comments\n\nRelease Note: I regret that I haven‚Äôt had time to add many\n new entries here. There are a lot of specialized terms, and\n I probably could have doubled the number of entries here.\nMuch more work is needed here. In fact, I debated at one\n point making the FAQ instead into a kind of ‚ÄúEncycopedia\n Cypherpunkia,‚Äù with a mix of short and long articles on\n each of hundreds of topics. Such an organization would\n suffer the disadvantages found in nearly all\n lexicographically-organized works: confusion of the\n concepts.\nMany of the these entries were compiled for a long handout\n at the first Cypherpunks meeting, September, 1992. Errors\n are obviously present. I‚Äôll try to keep correcting them\n when I can.\nSchneier‚Äôs ‚ÄúApplied Cryptography‚Äù is of course an excellent\n place to browse for terms, special uses, etc.\n19.4.2. agoric systems ‚Äì open, free market systems in which\n   voluntary transactions are central.\n19.4.3. Alice and Bob ‚Äì crypographic protocols are often made\n   clearer by considering parties A and B, or Alice and Bob,\n   performing some protocol. Eve the eavesdropper, Paul the\n   prover, and Vic the verifier are other common stand-in names.\n19.4.4. ANDOS ‚Äì all or nothing disclosure of secrets.\n19.4.5. anonymous credential ‚Äì a credential which asserts some right\n   or privelege or fact without revealing the identity of the\n   holder.  This is unlike CA driver‚Äôs licenses.\n19.4.6. assymmetric cipher ‚Äì same as public key cryptosystem.\n19.4.7. authentication ‚Äì the process of verifying an identity or\n   credential, to ensure you are who you said you were.\n19.4.8. biometric security ‚Äì a type of authentication using\n   fingerprints, retinal scans, palm prints, or other\n   physical/biological signatures of an individual.\n19.4.9. bit commitment ‚Äì e.g., tossing a coin and then committing to\n   the value without being able to change the outcome. The blob\n   is a cryptographic primitive for this.\n19.4.10. BlackNet ‚Äì an experimental scheme devised by T. May to\n   underscore the nature of anonymous information markets. ‚ÄúAny\n   and all‚Äù secrets can be offered for sale via anonymous\n   mailers and message pools. The experiment was leaked via\n   remailer to the Cypherpunks list (not by May) and thence to\n   several dozen Usenet groups by Detweiler. The authorities are\n   said to be investigating it.\n19.4.11. blinding, blinded signatures ‚Äì A signature that the signer\n   does not remember having made.  A blind signature is always a\n   cooperative protocol and the receiver of the signature\n   provides the signer with the blinding information.\n19.4.12. blob ‚Äì the crypto equivalent of a locked box. A\n   cryptographic primitive for bit commitment, with the\n   properties that a blobs can represent a 0 or a 1, that others\n   cannot tell be looking whether it‚Äôs a 0 or a 1, that the\n   creator of the blob can ‚Äúopen‚Äù the blob to reveal the\n   contents, and that no blob can be both a 1 and a 0. An\n   example of this is a flipped coin covered by a hand.\n19.4.13. BnD ‚Äì\n19.4.14. Capstone ‚Äì\n19.4.15. channel ‚Äì the path over which messages are transmitted.\n   Channels may be secure or insecure, and may have\n   eavesdroppers (or enemies, or disrupters, etc.) who alter\n   messages, insert and delete messages, etc. Cryptography is\n   the means by which communications over insecure channels are\n   protected.\n19.4.16. chosen plaintext attack ‚Äì an attack where the cryptanalyst\n   gets to choose the plaintext to be enciphered, e.g., when\n   possession of an enciphering machine or algorithm is in the\n   possession of the cryptanalyst.\n19.4.17. cipher ‚Äì a secret form of writing, using substitution or\n   transposition of characters or symbols. (From Arabic ‚Äúsifr,‚Äù\n   meaning ‚Äúnothing.‚Äù)\n19.4.18. ciphertext ‚Äì the plaintext after it has been encrypted.\n19.4.19. Clipper ‚Äì the infamous Clipper chip\n19.4.20. code ‚Äì a restricted cryptosystem where words or letters of a\n   message are replaced by other words chosen from a codebook.\n   Not part of modern cryptology, but still useful.\n19.4.21. coin flippping ‚Äì an important crypto primitive, or protocol,\n   in which the equivalent of flipping a fair coin is possible.\n   Implemented with blobs.\n19.4.22. collusion ‚Äì wherein several participants cooperate to deduce\n   the identity of a sender or receiver, or to break a cipher.\n   Most cryptosystems are sensitive to some forms of collusion.\n   Much of the work on implementing DC Nets, for example,\n   involves ensuring that colluders cannot isolate message\n   senders and thereby trace origins and destinations of mail.\n19.4.23. COMINT ‚Äì\n19.4.24. computationally secure ‚Äì where a cipher cannot be broken\n   with available computer resources, but in theory can be\n   broken with enough computer resources. Contrast with\n   unconditionally  secure.\n19.4.25. countermeasure ‚Äì something you do to thwart an attacker\n19.4.26. credential ‚Äì facts or assertions about some entity. For\n   example, credit ratings, passports, reputations, tax status,\n   insurance records, etc.  Under the current system, these\n   credentials are increasingly being cross-linked. Blind\n   signatures may be used to create anonymous credentials.\n19.4.27. credential clearinghouse  ‚Äì banks, credit agencies,\n   insurance companies, police departments, etc., that correlate\n   records and decide the status of records.\n19.4.28. cryptanalysis ‚Äì methods for attacking and breaking ciphers\n   and related cryptographic systems. Ciphers may be broken,\n   traffic may be analyzed, and passwords may be cracked.\n   Computers are of course essential.\n19.4.29. crypto anarchy ‚Äì the economic and political system after the\n   deployment of encryption, untraceable e-mail, digital\n   pseudonyms, cryptographic voting, and digital cash. A pun on\n   ‚Äúcrypto,‚Äù meaning ‚Äúhidden,‚Äù and as when Gore Vidal called\n   William F. Buckley a ‚Äúcrypto fascist.‚Äù\n19.4.30. cryptography ‚Äì another name for cryptology.\n19.4.31. cryptology ‚Äì the science and study of writing, sending,\n   receiving, and deciphering secret messages. Includes\n   authentication, digital signatures, the hiding of messages\n   (steganography), cryptanalysis, and several other fields.\n19.4.32. cyberspace  ‚Äì the electronic domain, the Nets, and computer-\n   generated spaces. Some say it is the ‚Äúconsensual reality‚Äù\n   described in ‚ÄúNeuromancer.‚Äù Others say it is the phone\n   system. Others have work to do.\n19.4.33. DC protocol, or DC-Net ‚Äì the dining cryptographers protocol.\n   DC-Nets use multiple participants communicating with the DC\n   protocol.\n19.4.34. DES ‚Äì the Data Encryption Standard, proposed in 1977 by the\n   National Bureau of Standards (now NIST), with assistance from\n   the National Security Agency. Based on the ‚ÄúLucifer‚Äù cipher\n   developed by Horst Feistel at IBM, DES is a secret key\n   cryptosystem that cycles 64-bit blocks of data through\n   multiple permutations with a 56-bit key controlling the\n   routing. ‚ÄúDiffusion‚Äù and ‚Äúconfusion‚Äù are combined to form a\n   cipher that has not yet been cryptanalyzed (see ‚ÄúDES,\n   Security of‚Äù). DES is in use for interbank transfers, as a\n   cipher inside of several RSA-based systems, and is available\n   for PCs.\n19.4.35. DES, Security of  ‚Äì many have speculated that the NSA placed\n   a trapdoor (or backdoor) in DES to allow it to read DES-\n   encrypted messages. This has not been proved. It is known\n   that the original Lucifer algorithm used a 128-bit key and\n   that this key length was shortened to 64 bits (56 bits plus 8\n   parity bits), ths making exhaustive search much easier (so\n   far as is known, brute-force search has not been done, though\n   it should be feasible today). Shamir and Bihan have used a\n   technique called ‚Äúdifferential cryptanalysis‚Äù to reduce the\n   exhaustive search needed for chosen plaintext attacks (but\n   with no import for ordinary DES).\n19.4.36. differential cryptanalysis ‚Äì the Shamir-Biham technique for\n   cryptanalyzing DES. With a chosen plaintext attack, they‚Äôve\n   reduced the number of DES keys that must be tried from about\n   2^56 to about 2^47 or less. Note, however, that rarely can an\n   attacker mount a chosen plaintext attack on DES systems.\n19.4.37. digital cash, digital money ‚Äì Protocols for transferring\n   value, monetary or otherwise, electronically.  Digital cash\n   usually refers to systems that are anonymous. Digital money\n   systems can be used to implement any quantity that is\n   conserved, such as points, mass, dollars, etc.  There are\n   many variations of  digital money systems, ranging from VISA\n   numbers to blinded signed digital coins.  A topic too large\n   for a single glossary entry.\n19.4.38. digital pseudonym ‚Äì basically, a ‚Äúcrypto identity.‚Äù A way\n   for individuals to set up accounts with various organizations\n   without revealing more information than they wish. Users may\n   have several digital pseudonyms, some used only once, some\n   used over the course of many years. Ideally, the pseudonyms\n   can be linked only at the will of the holder. In the simplest\n   form, a public key can serve as a digital pseudonym and need\n   not be linked to a physical identity.\n19.4.39. digital signature ‚Äì  Analogous to a written signature on a\n   document. A modification to a message that only the signer\n   can make but that everyone can recognize.  Can  be used\n   legally to contract at a distance.\n19.4.40. digital timestamping ‚Äì one function of a digital notary\n   public, in which some message (a song, screenplay, lab\n   notebook, contract, etc.) is stamped with a time that cannot\n   (easily) be forged.\n19.4.41. dining cryptographers protocol (aka DC protocol, DC nets) ‚Äì\n   the untraceable message sending system invented by David\n   Chaum. Named after the ‚Äúdining philosophers‚Äù problem in\n   computer science, participants form circuits and pass\n   messages in such a way that the origin cannot be deduced,\n   barring collusion. At the simplest level, two participants\n   share a key between them. One of them sends some actual\n   message by bitwise exclusive-ORing the message with the key,\n   while the other one just sends the key itself. The actual\n   message from this pair of participants is obtained by XORing\n   the two outputs. However, since nobody but the pair knows the\n   original key, the actual message cannot be traced to either\n   one of the participants.\n19.4.42. discrete logarithm problem ‚Äì given integers a, n, and x,\n   find some integer m such that a^m mod n = x, if m exists.\n   Modular exponentiation, the a^m mod n part, is\n   straightforward (and special purpose chips are available),\n   but the inverse problem is believed to be very hard, in\n   general.  Thus it is conjectured that modular exponentiation\n   is a one-way function.\n19.4.43. DSS, Digital Signature Standard ‚Äì the latest NIST (National\n   Institute of Standards and Technology, successor to NBS)\n   standard for digital signatures. Based on the El Gamal\n   cipher, some consider it weak and poor substitute for RSA-\n   based signature schemes.\n19.4.44. eavesdropping, or passive wiretapping ‚Äì intercepting\n   messages without detection. Radio waves may be intercepted,\n   phone lines may be tapped, and computers may have RF\n   emissions detected. Even fiber optic lines can be tapped.\n19.4.45. Escrowed Encryption Standard (EES) ‚Äì current name for the\n   key escrow system known variously as Clipper, Capstone,\n   Skipjack, etc.\n19.4.46. factoring ‚Äì Some large numbers are difficult to factor. It\n   is conjectured that there are no feasible‚Äìi.e.‚Äùeasy,‚Äù less\n   than exponential in size of number‚Äì factoring methods. It is\n   also an open problem whether RSA may be broken more easily\n   than by factoring the modulus (e.g., the public key might\n   reveal information which simplifies the problem).\n   Interestingly, though factoring is believed to be ‚Äúhard‚Äù, it\n   is not known to be in the class of NP-hard problems.\n   Professor Janek invented a factoring device, but he is\n   believed to be fictional.\n19.4.47. HUMINT ‚Äì\n19.4.48. information-theoretic security ‚Äì ‚Äúunbreakable‚Äù security, in\n   which no amount of cryptanalysis can break a cipher or\n   system. One time pads are an example (providing the pads are\n   not lost nor stolen nor used more than once, of course). Same\n   as unconditionally secure.\n19.4.49. key ‚Äì a piece of information needed to encipher or decipher\n   a message. Keys may be stolen, bought, lost, etc., just as\n   with physical keys.\n19.4.50. key exchange, or key distribution ‚Äì the process of sharing a\n   key with some other party, in the case of symmetric ciphers,\n   or of distributing a  public key in an asymmetric cipher. A\n   major issue is that the keys be exchanged reliably and\n   without compromise. Diffie and Hellman devised one such\n   scheme, based on the discrete logarithm problem.\n19.4.51. known-plaintext attack ‚Äì a cryptanalysis of a cipher where\n   plaintext-ciphertext pairs are known. This attack searches\n   for an unknown key. Contrast with the chosen plaintext\n   attack, where the cryptanalyst can also choose the plaintext\n   to be enciphered.\n19.4.52. listening posts ‚Äì the NSA and other intelligence agencies\n   maintain sites for the interception of radio, telephone, and\n   satellite communications. And so on. Many sites have been\n   identified (cf.  Bamford), and many more sites are suspected.\n19.4.53. mail, untraceable  ‚Äì a system for sending and receiving mail\n   without traceability or observability. Receiving mail\n   anonymously can be done with broadcast of the mail in\n   encrypted form.  Only the intended recipient (whose identity,\n   or true name, may be unknown to the sender) may able to\n   decipher the message. Sending mail anonymously apparently\n   requires mixes or use of the dining cryptographers (DC)\n   protocol.\n19.4.54. Message Pool\n19.4.55. minimum disclosure proofs  ‚Äì another name for zero knowledge\n   proofs, favored by Chaum.\n19.4.56. mixes ‚Äì David Chaum‚Äôs term for a box which performs the\n   function of mixing, or decorrelating, incoming and outgoing\n   electronic mail messages. The box also strips off the outer\n   envelope (i.e., decrypts with its private key) and remails\n   the message to the address on the inner envelope. Tamper-\n   resistant modules may be used to prevent cheating and forced\n   disclosure of the mapping between incoming and outgoing mail.\n   A sequence of many remailings effectively makes tracing\n   sending and receiving impossible. Contrast this with the\n   software version, the DC protocol. The ‚Äúremailers‚Äù developed\n   by Cypherpunks are an approximation of a Chaumian mix.\n19.4.57. modular exponentiation  ‚Äì raising an integer to the power of\n   another integer, modulo some integer. For integers a, n, and\n   m, a^m mod n. For example, 5^3 mod 100 = 25. Modular\n   exponentiation can be done fairly quickly with a sequence of\n   bit shifts and adds, and special purpose chips have been\n   designed. See also discrete logarithm.\n19.4.58. National Security Agency (NSA)  ‚Äì the largest intelligence\n   agency, responsible for making and breaking ciphers, for\n   intercepting communications, and for ensuring the security of\n   U.S. computers. Headquartered in Fort Meade, Maryland, with\n   many listening posts around the world.  The NSA funds\n   cryptographic research and advises other agencies about\n   cryptographic matters. The NSA once obviously had the world‚Äôs\n   leading cryptologists, but this may no longer be the case.\n19.4.59. negative credential ‚Äì a credential that you possess that you\n   don‚Äôt want any one else to know, for example, a bankruptcy\n   filing.  A formal version of a negative reputation.\n19.4.60. NP-complete ‚Äì a large class of difficult problems.  ‚ÄúNP‚Äù\n   stands for nondeterministic polynomial time, a class of\n   problems thought in general not to have feasible algorithms\n   for their solution.  A problem is ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù  if  any other\n   NP problem may be reduced to that problem.   Many important\n   combinatorial and algebraic problems are NP-complete: the\n   travelling salesman problem, the Hamiltonian cycle problem,\n   the graph isomorphism problem, the word problem, and on and\n   on.\n19.4.61. oblivious transfer ‚Äì a cryptographic primitive that involves\n   the probablistic transmission of bits. The sender does not\n   know if the bits were received.\n19.4.62. one-time pad ‚Äì a string of randomly-selected bits or symbols\n   which is combined with a plaintext message to produce the\n   ciphertext. This combination may be shifting letters some\n   amount, bitwise exclusive-ORed, etc.). The recipient, who\n   also has a copy of the one time pad, can easily recover the\n   plaintext. Provided the pad is only used once and then\n   destroyed, and is not available to an eavesdropper, the\n   system is perfectly secure, i.e., it is information-\n   theoretically secure. Key distribution (the pad)  is\n   obviously a practical concern, but consider CD-ROM‚Äôs.\n19.4.63. one-way function ‚Äì a function which is easy to compute in\n   one direction but hard to find any inverse for, e.g. modular\n   exponentiation, where the inverse problem is known as the\n   discrete logarithm problem. Compare the special case of trap\n   door one-way functions.  An example of  a one-way operation\n   is multiplication: it is  easy to multiply two prime numbers\n   of 100 digits to produce a 200-digit number, but  hard to\n   factor that 200-digit number.\n19.4.64. P ?=? NP  ‚Äì Certainly the most  important unsolved problem\n   in complexity theory. If P = NP, then cryptography as we know\n   it today does not exist.  If P = NP,  all NP problems are\n   ‚Äúeasy.‚Äù\n19.4.65. padding ‚Äì sending extra messages to confuse eavesdroppers\n   and to defeat traffic analysis.   Also adding random bits to\n   a message to be enciphered.\n19.4.66. PGP\n19.4.67. plaintext ‚Äì also called cleartext, the text that is to be\n   enciphered.\n19.4.68. Pool\n19.4.69. Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)  ‚Äì Phillip Zimmerman‚Äôs\n   implementation of RSA, recently upgraded to version 2.0, with\n   more robust components and several new features. RSA Data\n   Security has threatened PZ so he no longer works on it.\n   Version 2.0 was written by a consortium of non-U.S. hackers.\n19.4.70. prime numbers ‚Äì integers with no factors other than\n   themselves and 1. The number of primes is unbounded.  About\n   1% of the 100 decimal digit numbers are prime.  Since there\n   are about 10^70 particles in the universe, there are about\n   10^23  100 digit primes for each and every particle in the\n   universe!\n19.4.71. probabalistic encryption  ‚Äì a scheme by Goldwasser, Micali,\n   and Blum that allows multiple ciphertexts for the same\n   plaintext, i.e., any given plaintext may have many\n   ciphertexts if the ciphering is repeated. This protects\n   against certain types of known ciphertext attacks on RSA.\n19.4.72. proofs of identity ‚Äì proving who you are, either your true\n   name, or your digital identity. Generally, possession of the\n   right key is sufficient proof (guard your key!). Some work\n   has been done on ‚Äúis-a-person‚Äù credentialling agencies, using\n   the so-called Fiat-Shamir protocol‚Ä¶think of this as a way\n   to issue unforgeable digital passports. Physical proof of\n   identity may be done with biometric security methods. Zero\n   knowledge proofs of identity reveal nothing beyond the fact\n   that the identity is as claimed. This has obvious uses for\n   computer access, passwords, etc.\n19.4.73. protocol ‚Äì a formal procedure for solving some problem.\n   Modern cryptology is mostly about the study of protocols for\n   many problems, such as coin-flipping, bit commitment (blobs),\n   zero knowledge proofs, dining cryptographers, and so on.\n19.4.74. public key ‚Äì the key distributed publicly to potential\n   message-senders. It may be published in a phonebook-like\n   directory or otherwise sent. A major concern is the validity\n   of this public key to guard against spoofing or\n   impersonation.\n19.4.75. public key cryptosystem ‚Äì the modern breakthrough in\n   cryptology, designed by Diffie and Hellman, with\n   contributions from several others. Uses trap door one-way\n   functions so that encryption may be done by anyone with\n   access to the ‚Äúpublic key‚Äù but decryption may be done only by\n   the holder of the ‚Äúprivate key.‚Äù Encompasses public key\n   encryption, digital signatures, digital cash, and many other\n   protocols and applications.\n19.4.76. public key encryption ‚Äì the use of modern cryptologic\n   methods to provided message security and authentication. The\n   RSA algorithm is the most widely used form of public key\n   encryption, although other systems exist. A public key may be\n   freely published, e.g., in phonebook-like directories, while\n   the corresponding private key is closely guarded.\n19.4.77. public key patents  ‚Äì M.I.T. and Stanford, due to the work\n   of Rivest, Shamir, Adleman, Diffie, Hellman, and Merkle,\n   formed Public Key Partners to license the various public key,\n   digital signature, and RSA patents. These patents, granted in\n   the early 1980s, expire in the between 1998 and 2002. PKP has\n   licensed RSA Data Security Inc., of Redwood City, CA, which\n   handles the sales, etc.\n19.4.78. quantum cryptography ‚Äì a system based on quantum-mechanical\n   principles. Eavesdroppers alter the quantum state of the\n   system and so are detected. Developed by Brassard and\n   Bennett, only small laboratory demonstrations have been made.\n19.4.79. remailers ‚Äì software versions of Chaum‚Äôs ‚Äúmixes,‚Äù for the\n   sending of untraceable mail. Various features are needed to\n   do this: randomized order of resending, encryption at each\n   stage (picked in advance by the sender, knowing the chain of\n   remailers), padding of message sizes. The first remailer was\n   written by E. Hughes in perl, and about a dozen or so are\n   active now, with varying feature sets.\n19.4.80. reputations ‚Äì the trail of positive and negative\n   associations and judgments that some entity accrues. Credit\n   ratings, academic credentials, and trustworthiness are all\n   examples. A digital pseudonym will accrue these reputation\n   credentials based on actions, opinions of others, etc. In\n   crypto anarchy, reputations and agoric systems will be of\n   paramount importance. There are many fascinating issues of\n   how reputation-based systems work, how credentials can be\n   bought and sold, and so forth.\n19.4.81. RSA ‚Äì the main public key encryption algorithm, developed by\n   Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Kenneth Adleman. It exploits the\n   difficulty of factoring large numbers to create a private key\n   and public key. First invented in 1978, it remains the core\n   of modern public key systems. It is usually much slower than\n   DES, but special-purpose modular exponentiation chips will\n   likely speed it up. A popular scheme for speed is to use RSA\n   to transmit session keys and then a high-speed cipher like\n   DES for the actual message text.\nDescription ‚Äì Let p and q be large primes, typically with\n more than 100 digits. Let n = pq and find some e such that\n e is relatively prime to (p - 1)(q - 1). The set of numbers\n p, q, and e is the private key for RSA. The set of numbers\n n and e forms the public key (recall that knowing n is not\n sufficient to easily find p and q‚Ä¶the factoring problem).\n A message M is encrypted by computing M^e mod n. The owner\n of the private key can decrypt the encrypted message by\n exploiting number theory results, as follows. An integer d\n is computed such that ed =1 (mod (p - 1)(q - 1)). Euler\n proved a theorem that M^(ed) = M mod n and so M^(ed) mod n\n = M. This means that in some sense the integers e and d are\n ‚Äúinverses‚Äù of each other. [If this is unclear, please see\n one of the many texts and articles on public key\n encryption.]\n19.4.82. secret key cryptosystem ‚Äì A system which uses the same key\n   to encrypt and decrypt traffic at each end of a communication\n   link.  Also called a symmetric or one-key system.  Contrast\n   with public key cryptosystem.\n19.4.83. SIGINT ‚Äì\n19.4.84. smart cards ‚Äì a computer chip embedded in credit card.  They\n   can hold cash, credentials, cryptographic keys, etc. Usually\n   these are built with some degree of tamper-resistance. Smart\n   cards may perform part of a crypto transaction, or all of it.\n   Performing part of it may mean checking the computations of a\n   more powerful computer, e.g., one in an ATM.\n19.4.85. spoofing, or masquerading ‚Äì posing as another user. Used for\n   stealing passwords, modifying files, and  stealing cash.\n   Digital signatures and other authentication methods are\n   useful to prevent this. Public keys must be validated and\n   protected to ensure that others don‚Äôt subsititute their own\n   public keys which users may then unwittingly use.\n19.4.86. steganography ‚Äì a part of cryptology dealing with hiding\n   messages and obscuring who is sending and receiving messages.\n   Message traffic is often padded to reduce the signals that\n   would otherwise come from a sudden beginning of messages.\n   ‚ÄúCovered writing.‚Äù\n19.4.87. symmetric cipher ‚Äì same as private key cryptosystem.\n19.4.88. tamper-responding modules, tamper-resistant modules (TRMs) ‚Äì\n   sealed boxes or modules which are hard to open, requiring\n   extensive probing and usually leaving ample evidence that the\n   tampering has occurred. Various protective techniques are\n   used, such as special metal or oxide layers on chips, armored\n   coatings, embedded optical fibers, and other measures to\n   thwart analysis. Popularly called ‚Äútamper-proof boxes.‚Äù Uses\n   include: smart cards, nuclear weapon initiators,\n   cryptographic key holders, ATMs, etc.\n19.4.89. tampering, or active wiretapping ‚Äì intefering with messages\n   and possibly modifying them. This may compromise data\n   security, help to break ciphers, etc.  See also spoofing.\n19.4.90. Tessera\n19.4.91. token ‚Äì some representation, such as ID cards, subway\n   tokens, money, etc., that indicates possession of some\n   property or value.\n19.4.92. traffic analysis ‚Äì determining who is sending or receiving\n   messages by analyzing packets, frequency of packets, etc. A\n   part of steganography. Usually handled with traffic padding.\n19.4.93. traffic analysis ‚Äì identifying characteristics of a message\n   (such as sender, or destination) by watching traffic.\n   Remailers and encryption help to foil traffic analysys.\n19.4.94. transmission rules ‚Äì the protocols for determining who can\n   send messages in a DC protocol, and when. These rules are\n   needed to prevent collision and deliberate jamming of the\n   channels.\n19.4.95. trap messages ‚Äì dummy messages in DC Nets which are used to\n   catch jammers and disrupters. The messages contain no private\n   information and are published in a blob beforehand so that\n   the trap message can later be opened to reveal the disrupter.\n   (There are many strategies to explore here.)\n19.4.96. trap-door ‚Äì In cryptography, a piece of secret information\n   that allows the holder of a private key to invert a normally\n   hard to invert function.\n19.4.97. trap-door one way functions ‚Äì functions which are easy to\n   compute in both the forward and reverse direction but for\n   which the disclosure of an algorithm to compute the function\n   in the forward direction does not provide information on how\n   to compute the function in the reverse direction. More simply\n   put, trap-door one way functions are one way for all but the\n   holder of the secret information. The RSA algorithm is the\n   best-known example of such a function.\n19.4.98. unconditional security ‚Äì same as information-theoretic\n   security, that is, unbreakable except by loss or theft of the\n   key.\n19.4.99. unconditionally  secure ‚Äì where no amount of intercepted\n   ciphertext is enough to allow the cipher to be broken, as\n   with the use of a one-time pad cipher. Contrast with\n   computationally secure.\n19.4.100. URLs\n19.4.101. voting, cryptographic ‚Äì Various schemes have been devised\n   for anonymous, untraceable voting. Voting schemes should have\n   several properties: privacy of the vote, security of the vote\n   (no multiple votes), robustness against disruption by jammers\n   or disrupters, verifiability (voter has confidence in the\n   results), and efficiency.\n19.4.102. Whistleblowers\n19.4.103. zero knowledge proofs ‚Äì proofs in which no knowledge of the\n   actual proof is conveyed. Peggy the Prover demonstrates to\n   Sid the Skeptic that she is indeed in possession of some\n   piece of knowledge without actually revealing any of that\n   knowledge. This is useful for access to computers, because\n   eavesdroppers or dishonest sysops cannot steal the knowledge\n   given. Also called minimum disclosure proofs. Useful for\n   proving possession of some property, or credential, such as\n   age or voting status, without revealing personal information.\n\n19.5. Appendix ‚Äì Summary of Crypto Versions\n19.5.1.

README‚ÄìBRIEF VERSION\n20.2.1. Copyright Timothy C. May. All rights reserved. For what it‚Äôs\n   worth.\n20.2.2. Apologies in advance for the mix of styles (outline, bullet,\n   text, essays), for fragments and incomplete sections. This\n   FAQ is already much too long and detailed, and writing\n   suitable connective material, introductions, summaries, etc.\n   is not in the cards anytime soon. Go with the flow, use your\n   text searching tools, and deal with it.\n20.2.3. Substantive corrections welcome, quibbles less welcome, and\n   ideological debate even less welcome. Corrections to outdated\n   information, especially on pointers to information, will be\n   most appreciated.\n20.3. Copyright Comments\n20.3.1. It may seem illogical for a Cypherpunk to assert some kind of\n   copyright. Perhaps. But my main concern is the ease with\n   which people can relabel documents as their own, sometimes\n   after only adding a few words here and there.\n20.3.2. Yes, I used the words of others in places, to make points\n   better than I felt my own words would, to save time, and to\n   give readers a different voice speaking on issues. I have\n   credited quotes with a ‚Äú[Joe Foobar, place, date]\n   attribution, usually at the end of the quote. If a place is\n   not listed, it is the Cypherpunks list itself. The author and\n   date should be sufficient to (someday) retrieve the source\n   text. By the way, I used quotes as they seemed appropriate,\n   and make no claims that the quoted points are necessarily\n   original to the author‚Äìwho may have remembered them from\n   somewhere else‚Äìor that the date listed is the origination\n   date for the point. I have something like 80 megabytes of\n   Cypherpunks posts, so I couldn‚Äôt do an archaeological dig for\n   the earliest mention of an idea.\n20.3.3. People can quote this FAQ under the ‚Äúfair use‚Äù provisions,\n   e.g., a paragraph or two, with credits. Anything more than a\n   few paragraphs constitutes copyright infringement, as I\n   understand it.\n20.3.4. Should I give up the maintaining of this FAQ and/or should\n   others get involved, then the normal co-authorship and\n   inheritance arrangements will be possible.\n20.3.5. The Web. WWW and Mosaic offer amazing new opportunities for\n   on-line documents. It is in fact likely that this FAQ will be\n   available as a Web document. My concern, however, is that the\n   integrity and authorship be maintained. Thus, splitting the\n   document in a hundred or more little pieces, with no\n   authorship attached, would not be cool. Also, I intend to\n   maintain this document with my powerful outlining tools\n   (Symantec‚Äôs ‚ÄúMORE,‚Äù on a Macintosh) and thus anyone who\n   ‚Äúfreezes‚Äù the document and uses it as a base for links,\n   pointers, etc., will be left behind as mods are made.\n20.4. A Few Words on the Style\n20.4.1. Some sections are in outline form\n\nlike this\nwith fragments of ideas and points\nwith incomplete sentences\nand with lists of points that are obviously only starting\n points for more complete analyses\n20.4.2. Other sections are written in more complete essay form, as\n   reasonably self-contained analyses of some point or topic.\n   Like this. Some of these essays were taken directly out of\n   posts I did for the list, or for sci.crypt, and no\n   attribution H (since I wrote the stuff‚Ä¶quotes from others\n   are credited).\n20.4.3. The styles may clash, but I just don‚Äôt have the hundreds of\n   hours to go through and ‚Äúregularize‚Äù everything to a\n   consistent style. The outline style allows additional points,\n   wrinkles, rebuttals, and elaborations to be grafted on easily\n   (if not always elegantly). I hope most readers can understand\n   this and learn to deal with it.\n20.4.4. Of  course, there are places where the points made are just\n   too fragmentary, too outlinish, for people to make sense of.\n   I‚Äôve tried to clean these up as much as I can, but there will\n   always be some places where an idea seemed clear to me at the\n   time (maybe not) but which is not presented clearly to\n   others. I‚Äôll keep trying to iron these kinks out in future\n   versions.\n20.4.5. Comment on style\nIn many cases I merged two or more chunks of ideas into one\n section, resulting in many cases in mismatching writing\n styles, tenses, etc. I apologize, but I just don‚Äôt have the\n many dozens of hours it might take to go through and\n ‚Äúregularize‚Äù things, to write more graceful transition\n paragraphs, etc. I felt it was more important to get the\n ideas and idea fragments out than to polish the writing.\n (Essays written from scratch, and in order, are generally\n more graceful than are concatenations of ideas, facts,\n pointers, and the like.)\nReaders should also not assume that a ‚Äúfleshed-out‚Äù\n section, made up of relatively complete paragraphs, is any\n more important than a section that is still mostly made up\n of short one-liners.\nReferences to Crypto Journals, Books. Nearly every section\n in this document could have one or more references to\n articles and papers in the Crypto Proceedings, in\n Schneier‚Äôs book, or whatever. Sorry, but I can‚Äôt do this.\n Maybe someday‚Äìwhen true hypertext arrives and is readily\n usable (don‚Äôt send me e-mail about HTML, or Xanadu, etc.)\n this kind of cross-referencing will be done. Footnotes\n would work today, but are distracting in on-line documents.\n And too much work, given that this is not meant to be a\n scholarly thesis.\nI also have resisted the impulse to included quotes or\n sections from other FAQs, notably the sci.crypt and rsadsi\n FAQs. No point in copying their stuff, even with\n appropriate credit. Readers should already have these docs,\n of course.\n20.4.6. quibbling\nAny time you say something to 500-700 people, expect to\n have a bunch of quibbles. People will take issue with\n phrasings, with choices of definitions, with facts, etc.\n Correctness is important, but sometimes the quibbling sets\n off a chain reaction of corrections, countercorrections,\n rebuttals, and ‚ÄúI would have put it differently‚Äùs. It‚Äôs all\n a bit overwhelming at times. My hope for this FAQ is that\n serious errors are (of course) corrected, but that the List\n not get bogged down in endless quibbling about such minor\n issues as style and phrasing.\n\n20.5. How to Find Information\n20.5.1. This FAQ is very long, which makes finding specific questions\n   problematic. Such is life‚Äìshorter FAQ are of course easier\n   to navigate, but may not address important issues.\n20.5.2. A full version of this FAQ is available, as well as chapter-\n   by-chapter versions (to reduce the downloading efforts for\n   some people). Search tools within text editors are one way to\n   find topics. Future versions of this FAQ may be paginated and\n   then indexed (but maybe not).\n20.5.3. I advise using search tools in editors and word processors to\n   find sections of interest. This is likely faster anyway than\n   consulting an index generated by me (which I haven‚Äôt\n   generated, and probably never will).\n20.6. My Views\n20.6.1. This FAQ, or whatever one calls it, is more than just a\n   simple listing of frequently asked questions and the lowest-\n   common-denominator answers. This should be clear just by the\n   size alone. I make no apologies for writing the document I\n   wanted to write. Others are free to write the FAQ they would\n   prefer to read. You‚Äôre getting what you paid for.\n20.6.2. My views are rather strong in some areas. I‚Äôve tried to\n   present some dissenting arguments in cases where I think\n   Cypherpunks are really somewhat divided, such as in remailer\n   strategies and the like. In cases where I think there‚Äôs no\n   credible dissent, such as in the wisdom of Clipper, I‚Äôve made\n   no attempt to be fair. My libertarian, even anarchist, views\n   surely come through. Either deal with it, or don‚Äôt read the\n   document. I have to be honest about this.\n20.7. More detailed disclaimer\n20.7.1. This detailed disclaimer is probably not good in most courts\n   in the U.S., contracts having been thrown out if favor of\n   nominalism, but here it is anyway. At least nobody can claim\n   they were misled into thinking I was giving them warranteed,\n   guaranteed advice.\n20.7.2. Timothy C. May hereby disclaims all warranties relating to\n   this document, whether express or implied, including without\n   limitation any implied warranties of merchantability or\n   fitness for a particular purpose. Tim May will not be liable\n   for any special, incidental, consequential, indirect or\n   similar damages due to loss of business, indictment for any\n   crime, imprisonment, torture, or any other reason, even if\n   Tim May or an agent of his has been advised of the\n   possibility of such damages.  In no event shall Tim May be\n   liable for any damages, regardless of the form of the claim.\n   The person reading or using the document bears all risk as to\n   the quality and suitability of the document. Legality of\n   reading or possessing this document in a jurisdiction is not\n   the responsibility of Tim May.\n20.7.3. The points expressed may or may not represent the views of\n   Tim May, and certainly may not represent the views of other\n   Cypherpunks. Certain ideas are explored which, if\n   implemented, would be illegal to various extents in most\n   countries in the world. Think of these explorations of ideas\n   as just that.\n20.8.
