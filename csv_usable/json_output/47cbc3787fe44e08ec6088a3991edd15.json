Texasregeneratively raised grass-fedgrass-finished beef is the gold standardof beef and Anne and Weldon Warren havemade it their lives mission to provideincredibly high quality beef to theirlocal community and Beyond they havebeen raising their animals this way fordecades in fact they were some of themost influential voices for gettinggrass-fed and grass-finished beef inWhole Foods back when Whole Foods was astartup grocery storethey were influential in setting the AGAstandards which is the Americangrass-fed Association so you know theyare doing things the right way and ontop of all of that their beef tasteslike butter grass-fed grass-finishedbeef provides a superior omega-3 toomega-6 ratio than your typical beef orin other words it causes lessinflammation in your body so you arepromoting a high protein high fat dietwith this amazingly high quality beefand saturated fats are playing theircritical role in benefiting your bodythrough supporting hormonal functionsand cellular functions and if you'relooking for the highest quality beeflook no further than holy cow beef leaveyour butcher box that Australian and NewZealand raised meat in the cart in orderfrom your friends Anna Weldon Warrenover at Holy Cow beef I almost forgotthe most important part there and inWeldon Warren also accept Bitcoin aspayment so go check them out at theirwebsite in the link below and you canpay in Bitcoin or in cash if you'relooking to save your BitcoinI don't know about you all but I am allabout rewriting the incentives when itcomes to health care and crowd health isdoing just thatcrowd Huff is essentially crowdfundingfor healthcare with a small HSAcomponent mixed inpaying for the notes for healthinsurance you may never use only to beturned away when you actually need it isincredibly frustrating also theexorbitant costs of health insurance hasso many baked in premiums that when youcompare settling your doctor's bills uhby paying in cash versus using Insurancethe cost is astronomical so crowdfundingallows you to settle your medical billsin cash and then get the funding youneed from your group through crowdhealththis is a great alternative to healthinsurance for people who are low riskhealthy people uh who just want peace ofmind knowing that if anything actuallydid happen they do have a pool of fundsto pull from to cover their medicalcosts the best part my group is saving aportion of the monthly opt-in in Bitcoinand the rest is in cash so those savingsare going towards actually preservinglong-term value for my group through avehicle like Bitcoin we are reallyexcited about this concept and since thebusiness model is predicated on anincentive-based Health Care it is agreat great conceptfor people with low risk minimal healthcare costs it is a no-brainer go checkthem out in the link below and use ourpromo code Mafia for a discount on yourfirst six months with crowd health[Music][Applause][Music]all right safe welcome to the meat Mafiapodcast it uh seems serendipitous herethank you thank you for having me it'sgreat to be here we heard that you'vebeen preparing for a long time for thisepisode yeah I've been preparing byeating meat all my life basically yeahwe are saying that we initially bondedon Twitter over Superior nutrition butnow it's Superior cooking technologythat we also have in common it's a bigannouncement this week about meat Mafiaswitching to team cast ironstainless steel stainless steel wowdo your recommendationglad to hear that thanksyeah I think it's uh it's it's a it's amajor Awakening taking place in theworld yeah well one of the reasons weare excited to talk to you first we weowe you credit to Orange peeling us soit's not every day you get to speak tothe person who uh convinced you to buyyour first piece of Bitcoin so gottathank you for that before we get goingthank you sir um glad to hear that yeahit seems like yesterday I was walkingaround Boston with the Bitcoin standardin my ears being like I think safadineis on to something with this yeah so isthat when you're doing like your longMarathon walks and stuff yeah I wasdoing these long walks and just that'swhen I was actually really going down inthe carnival Rabbit Hole too kind ofoddly timed uh my Bitcoin orange pillingum and I think that yeah I was just Iwas going these walks with with yourbook in my ears I'm like all right likelisten to it on one and a half speedtrying to get through itum but it was uh yeah that's when it allhappened so appreciate you glad to hearthat yeah I mean it's it's a vortexBitcoin and carnivore it just sucks youin and then you end up with a lot ofBitcoin a lot of meatit's it's inevitable everybody's goingto go down that pathdo you ever wonder why that connectionisyeah I wondered extensively about it andI've written about it in the Fiatstandard there's a whole chapter on Fiatfood I thinkum you know the theum well the first obvious way is thatto think about it is well all humanhistoryhumans have eaten meat and so in my bookI begin with the work of the westernprice a man I like to call the mises ofnutrition is is similar to mises ineconomics and that his work isenormously important but it's completelyignored by the mainstream because it'scompletely inconvenient for the liesthey want to pedal and this guy traveledaround the world in the early 20thcentury just when airplanes wereinvented and he went to places that werecompletely isolated or almost entirelyisolated and whose food was domesticallyproduced and whose food was traditionalthat people there had been eating forcenturies and maybe millennium notlinked to global Food Markets so he wentto those places and he looked at whatthese people were eating and he left theUS and Canada he's Canadian and he leftthe US and Canada looking for thisidyllic Garden of Eden dietum thinking that there's some vegetariantraditional culture where people justfigured out the right formula of theright combination of plants to eatwithout meat because at that that periodyou know the late 19th century is whenthese ideas of vegetarianism andveganism had first begun to becomefashionable and he was one of thosepeople and he was out there looking forhow do we figure out the correct way tomake a vegan vegetarian diet work and hethought you know by going to all theseum primitive isolated tribes he'll beable to get it so he traveled all overthe world to get to places that you knowthey didn't have uh train tracks andthey didn't have uh extensive links withthe rest of the world for trading foodbut he could take his airplane there andhe could land somewhere and he could godown and talk to the locals and see whatthey did and what they ate and he tooktheir food and he shipped it to the U.Sand had it analyzed in the lab and helooked at the mineral content and thevitamin content of it and nutrientcontent and he was incidentally he wasone of the people who invented by whodiscovered vitamins so he's he's uh he'svery important in the world of nutritionand what he found to his surprise wasthat in all cultures everywhere in theworld everybody ate meat and in fact alldiets revolved around animal fats therewas no culture anywhere in the worldthat was free of animal fat and what hefound was I think to the extent thatpeople ate plant food they ate it as aessentially a vessel for deliveringplant for delivering animal fats so thediet centered entirely around animalfats and this is the most importantthing that he comes across from his uhtravels so I think the better way toturn it around is well so first of allwe have the idea that all over the worldmeat is the food of humans animal fat isthe food of humans and then the otherthing is all throughout human history ifyou read the Bitcoin standard allthroughout human history people havebeen using whatever is the hardest thingto make as moneysimilarly you know all over the worldyou look and you see that people usedglass beads when glass beads were rarebut then when gold coins came into theplaces where there were glass beadsglass beads stopped being money and goldbecame money gold became money andreplaced silver replaced everything thatwas less hard all over the worldeveryone always thought everyone alwayssought to use the hottest thing as moneyso the question is not so much why is itthat people who are into Bitcoin andmeat that's the natural Human Conditionpeople are always into meat and thehardest money and currently the hardestmoney is Bitcoin the question is why isit that Fiat people are intoum Fiat food and the Fiat money why arethey into easy money and shitty food andI think if you think of it this way itbecomes a better way of understanding itbecause yeahum once you're using shitty money yourmoney can't hold on to its value andthen it's only a matter of time beforeyou have to resort to eating crappy foodand I think it's no coincidence that thecentury of Fiat money witnessed thedeterioration of the money as well asdeterioration rate as well as thedeterioration of the food and that'swhat we see and that's what I discussedextensively in the Fiat standard inparticular after 1971 when um the dollarwas de-linked from gold you see thedisintegration of the American diet andthe global diets well you see thedisintegration ofum the quality of the dietaryrecommendations that are being taught atuniversities and medical schools andbeing offered by governments suddenlygovernments are out there are tellingeverybody in the world you need to eatmore grains you need to eat more pulsesand you need to eat less meat and youneed to worry about your saturated fatintake all that comes along at the sametime that the money gets destroyed andit's no coincidence it's driven by twofactors that are related on the one handthe destruction of the value of themoneyleaves people unable to afford the foodthat they want because that food youknow you can't just print cows cows needto spend time grazing and gettingsunshine and growing and then gettingslaughtered and processed in order tomake meat so if you make more money theprice of cows is going to go up but itissort of possible to print effectivelyindustrial food these are much easier toproduce because you can addyou can add the artificial fertilizersto soil you can increase the crop yieldyou can't increase the nutrients in thembut you can increase the crop yield youcan increase the calories and so thedietary recommendations shift towardTrying to minimizethe inflation that people feel and bytelling them hey no you actually youdon't need to be eating all theseexpensive things these expensive thingsare bad for you so quit the eggs withthe meat with the dairy focus on soy andGrains and corn basically all the cheapindustrial crap that can beindustrialized and can scale easily andso that becomes the focus of the dietaryrecommendations to cover up inflationand you know on the one hand your moneyis becoming worth less and less so youcan't afford to get the food that youneed on the other hand where's thatpurchasing power going well let's gointo the people who can print the moneythe government and the government is theone that gets to finance all thesenutrition departments all these dietaryrecommendations so that gives them anenormous amount of wealth to use inorder toshape dietary recommendations in here wecan look at the work of Nina titles onhow saturated fats have been demonizedover the past 50 years or so it's nocoincidence that you know the governmentthat was destroying the value of moneywas the one that was telling people tostop eating the things that he neededand that they could have an enormousimpact of this with this message becausethey had all that money that they weredestroying that was essentially going tothem you know they're destroying thevalue of your money by printing newmoney that new printed money financesall the nutrition departments that tellyou it's okay that your money is brokenbecause you don't need to be buying realfood with it just eat Industrial Wasteeat seed oilsequips unflavored Prime has one singleingredient derived directly fromgrass-fed beef protein all the boxesgo check them out in the link below anduse our promo code in the description toget a discountwhy was it important to you when writingthe Fiat standard in that chapter onFiat food to include the work of Westerna price as opposed to all the otherbooks and things that you had done toresearch who you to referenceum I don't know I I mean I thinkum it comes down to the fact that thebook was really very influential on ummy understanding of nutrition I read ita long time ago and when I first read itit really blew my mind I mean theum we we're uh we're taught to think oftoday as being a time of abundance thatpeople are healthier than ever arebetter fed than ever and then you lookat that book and I mean the book waswritten in the 20s and 30s so it wasum the things were still much betterback then but he talks about thedeterioration of the soil and he talksabout the deterioration of the nutrientcontents and this was back then and hetalks about the diseases and illnessesthat spread and you can just extrapolateyou know back then it was much betterthan now and you can extrapolate andthen you can see yeah all of thenutrition and health problems that yousee around today they're notum I think this is really themind-blowing conclusion you take fromthat book it's not that everybody issick because of abundance you know thisis the kind of selfflattering explanation that modernscience likes to put on it it's justwhat we've gotten so rich that everybodycan afford to eat so much and that theymake themselves sick by eating so muchand that's not true we're not richbecause people are not able to eat thethings thatum that they would want to be able toeat ideallywe are poor and people are having tomake do with cheap Industrial Waste andthat's what's making everybody sick sothe abundance of food is what is drivingthe illness but not it's not theabundance of good food it's not theabundance ofuh rich people food is the abundance ofIndustrial Waste essentially it's theabundance of heavily processedplant fats and it's the abundance ofheavily processed corn and sugar and soyand all these products these are thethings that are driving the illness andthese things as well what I like to callFiat food if you look at theirdevelopment over the 20th century anddiscussed this in the chapter as well itwas heavily subsidized by governmentsevery step of the way so all over theworld governments are subsidizing thesecrops governments recommend these cropsand the reason they recommend them isbecause they can't afford to peoplecan't afford to eat the meat that iswhat they need soum you know Western prices work is verypivotal in thisunfortunately there is a western pricefoundation today they're pretty activeand they're quite well known butunfortunately they don't quite take thismessage home and unfortunately what theydo is they get stuck on all these what Ithink are largely irrelevant detailsabout yeah well a western price traveledto this tribe in this isolated place inthe Pacific or in Switzerland or inAfrica or whatever and he saw that theywere eating this particular plant and sothen the the people in the West Surprisefoundation will scramble to try and getthis plant imported and it's veryexpensive and like it's just the plantthat they ate because they had to eatbecause it's the crap that grows therebut the important lesson to take home isthe animal fat and the animal proteinthat's what matters so a lot of thepeople in the western press Foundationyou know they come from a kind of veganor vegetarian background and for themit's a transformative impact that yeahwe should be eating meat but they don'tquite take it far enough so they take itto the point where Leah they'll eat meatevery day which for them seems like anenormous step but they don't push it tothe logical conclusion in my mind whichis well if you can afford to which youcan if you live today you know meat isvery cheap actually then why not justeat only meat I mean try it out for amonth and see how it goes and it'sextremely affordable a lot of peoplethink being a carnivore is expensiveit's not you can do carnivorepractically for nothing just go to theButcher and get the meat scraps and thebones you'll give them to you for freeor very close to free boil them and eatthem so there's really no excuse they'redelicious it's very nutritious just needa little bit of salt on it so if you'rebroke it's no excuse and if you havemoney you know you can go from cheapground beef all the way to very finesteaksum all budget ranges it's it it's noexcuse butum I think Western press getsmisunderstood and his work gets used inall these kind of umslightly gimmicky ways where people arejust selling you all these veryelaborate formulas and recipes and dietplans based on what this tribe and thatPride tribe ate and I think the reallyimportant uh takeaway takeaway messagefrom it is just eat as much meat as youcanwas your interpretation of his worksomething that changed your beliefs orwere you kind of like I guess when didyou really establish your beliefs aroundnutrition being more meat focused thanplant focusedum I mean I started first I I firststarted being low carb in about 20182019 that's when I started to cut downon carbs and immediately just felt anenormous uh Improvement just byeliminating uh sugary sodas and reducingmy bread intake so that was the firstthing once I heard people say well carbsare bad well let's try that and I wasn'treally emotionally attached to thesethings all that much like I liked meatalways and so cutting down on breadwasn't such a big deal but I immediatelystarted feeling better and then it wasjust you know the the more I cut downthe better I felt and the more meat Iate the better I felt and then the moreI read about nutrition the more itsuggested to cut down moreso it just kept on cutting down and Ithink Western price came first and bythat point you know I'd I'd alreadygotten to a point where I was pretty lowcarb I'd say unfortunately you knowgoing through the Western price routewas a little bit of a diversion in asense because you listen to what thefoundation say and then you startthinking oh I need to eat this plant andI need to prepare it that way and theother thing is that they really obsesson is uh the methods of preparing plantsso you have to soak your rice and youhave to sprout your beans and you haveto do all of these horrific things andyou know you go down that path and umit's kind of a big waste of time butthen very quickly I came across the zerocard Zen blog and uhand it was a light bulb moment wait youdon't soak and Sprout and do all of that and you don't eat anyvegetables and you don't eat any fruitsand you just replace all of that withmore meatI saw that and I thought all right wellyou know what I'm gonna try it for amonth I was living with my brother atthat time and him and I decided we'regonna do it for a month that was October2015 and I did it for a month and Ihaven't looked back like once I've triedit it's just yeah this is infinitelybetter than anything else and just theyou know the health benefits areenormous and also just the umthe fact that you've just basicallyfound the cheat code to eating and youdon't have to worry about anythinganymore you don't have to read anylabels you don't have to plan diet soyou don't have to count calories youdon't have to do anythinghungry eat meatand that's it and then eat until you'renot hungry anymore and then get on withthe rest of your life like the amount ofmental energy that it frees up to allowyou to go and focus on other things itreally was life-changing and like a fewmonths later is when I started writingthe Bitcoin standardI became much more productive Ium you know my life has just completelychanged since then because I'm no longerobsessed with food all day I can just goto the butcher once a week and fill upthe fridge with beef eat it whenever I'mhungry and that's it I think yeah I'mjust gonna say think about the societallevel of resources that we're wastingtrying to figure out what to eat amazingno no yeah like I go to the supermarketand it's just really all of these aislesyou people don't need them just go tothe butcher yeah yeah when you have thatcarnivore Epiphany it's like you gothrough the grocery store for the firsttime and you just are like I can'tbelieve that people are actually buyingall this it's like there's 40 000products in here and there's nothingthat's actually considered food besidesthe meat and the outer aisle the grocerystore yeah it's like once you have thatEpiphany it's just insane to think likepeople are literally buying all of theirfood in these inner aisles yeah and ifyou think about just how much of a wastethis process process is where people youknow they work hard to make money tothen go and buy these things to then gohomespend a lot of time processing thesethings trying to turn them into slightlyedible form and then they eat them andthen they get digestive problems andhealth problems from eating them andthen they spend their life trying todeal with these problems going to thedoctor and taking pills and likeyou think about how much time and effortand money goes into this process versushow much benefit comes out of it there'svery little nutrients in that plant anda lot more anti-nutrients a lot moredamage a lot more toxins sugars all ofthese thingsit's such an incredible shortcut it'ssuch an incredible life hack to justskip all of that and go to the meataisle and like the really tragic thingabout it is people think well food is aproblem food security is a problempeople are hungry the tragic thing isthat if in every Supermarket I thinkthey throw awaymeat scraps that have more nutritionthan everything else in the supermarketyeah I mean I used to go to thesupermarket and I'll get the fat thatthey throw away and sometimes usuallythey'll give it to me for free and I askthem what do they what do you do withthis if you don't throw it away I do itand I take it and I make Tallow with itsometimesand they say well we give it to peoplewho throw it in basically agriculturalFields they use it as fertilizer whichis insane I mean obviously it's goodthat it goes to fertilizer rather thanbeing a waste but this could be feedingpeople I mean you could just feed anentire townoff of the scraps of The Butchers justwhatever goes into the Butcher and thescraps that are there are enough if youget rid of all the crap that's in thesupermarket if they just replace thatbut it's it's um yeah once you see thatmoment where you just think everybody'sbasically a drug addict and they'readdicted to all of these things yeah andthey think the tragic thing is that theythink that they're doing nutrition theythink they're being responsible theythink they're being healthy it's just anaddiction it's no different from analcoholic it's no different from anyother kind of drug userthe way you think about efficiencies toowhen it comes to food and then youtranslate that over like in your bookthe Fiat uh standard you talk aboutCentral planning which is basically likethe the exact opposite of creating thesesort of efficiencies and I almost feellike in a lot of ways and you touch onthis in your book that Central planningis the root of all evil when it comes tothese inefficiencies that we see thedrunk in the middle the middle of thegrocery storeum confusing people with the wronginformation on what they should beeating the guidelines like it's allsteering people in directions thatreally aren't supporting them to theirOptimum cell optimal self in the longrun it absolutely is and it's um youknow a lot of people will try andridicule this by saying something alongthe lines of you know you're gonna blameFiat for the emergence of plant food Imean people have eaten plants foreverwell yes they have but this historicallybefore the 20th century I mean plantswere basically poor people food yeah andum you know people today like to glorifyolive oil as if it's this uh nutritionalamazing uh superfood it was always poorpeople fat it was what you ate if youcouldn't afford the animal fat and itwas mostly used for soap for skin forcandles for all kinds of other thingsbut you only and maybe for dressingSalad but you didn't cook in it if youhad to cook in your olive oil you werein a famine or you were very poorand and there are sayings about this inLebanese folklore you know if you wantto talk about how someone is better thansomebody else you'll sayso some people are in ghee or Tallowsome people are and some people areolive oil basically this is basicallypoor people are not very good peopleyeahum and it's uh it's so yeah we wouldhave had these things as food you knowpoor people will always have to resortto eating crappy things but what hashappened in the 20th century is that thethe dietary Overton window thanks toCentral planning as you were sayingthanks to the fact that government haveall this money has shifted towardsportraying these things as beingthe best thing that you can eat thehealthiest thing that you can eat andthen with industrialization we've madethem highly addictive so people thinkthat they're delicious and people thinkthat they're healthy so fruits you knowfruits have become massive sugar bombsand people think you know people eat thefruit and they get a sugar high and theythink they're being healthy because ohwow I'm getting the feeling of eatingsomething fresh and natural that'smaking me so healthy no you're justgetting a sugar high that's all there isto it and so you know people think oliveoil is this amazing food it's not it'snot a very good fat it's in fact it'svery difficult to tell us apart fromsoybean oil even in laboratoryconditions you know you could take lessolive oil from the supermarket and it'sdifficult to tell if it's been mixedwith soybean oil in a labif you can't tell in the lab there'sbeen mixed with poison it can't be verygood but again because dietary nutritionand because non-nutrition science iscentrally planned it gets determinedfrom top down and it gets marketed as ifit is a good thing so all of thesecrappy Foods continue to get this haloaround them you know olive oil is thesuperfood you need five portions offruits and vegetables and vegetableshave always been poor people food andit's barely edible and trying to makevegetables edible is extremelycomplicated thing like if you readWestern price you know the lengths thatpeople went to to in order to try andmake these vegetables edible andprimarily the only way you can make themetal is by putting a lot of animal faton them and that's really how you canmake them edible and other than that youknow people just get used to thembecause they use them extensivelyum they get addicted to them they getused to theum taste of it but reallyum I think without the inter without thedestruction of moneyI think the world's diet would be a lotmore food heavy a lot more meat heavyand that would be great for human healthand it would also be great for theenvironment around this because insteadof using instead of growing all theseenormous amounts of crops all over theworld that deplete the soil kill thebiodiversity we'd have animals grazingin Rich Lush biodiverse soils yeah Ithink a lot about you've said this a fewtimes you said eat meat drink water andget on with your life which I think issuch an incredible way to think aboutfood and nutrition and that wassomething that we wanted to talk to youabout is how many people are gettingthemselves stuck because they're almostaddicted to this they're thinking aboutfood almost as mouth pleasure as opposedto like the function and the nutritionthat you that you should be deriving andI think that that's something thateveryone goes through when they first gocarnivore low carbon I think it's anexperiment for everyone to try becauseit completely rewires your brain on whatfood actually is yes it's almost likeemerging out of a cave where you were inthat cave and all of your life was youknow how do I plan the next 100 100meals of my life you know I need to cookfor today I need to buy the food fornext week I need to buy think about whatI'm going to be eating in the next monthI need to plan a trip to travel to thisplace so that I can try this thing somuch of your life is just around allthese different forms of candy thatreally aren't making you Supermanthey're not helping you it's just mouthentertainment and if you snap out ofthat your life is just so much morefulfilling because you can get a lotmore stuff done and it's also a lot moreentertaining like if you think of yourfood as entertainment you need betterfood and you need better entertainmentthere's a lot better ways of having funin life than abusing your digestivesystem it's there to digest food it'snot an entertainment system yeah thereare ways of entertaining use your brainfor entertainment you knowum not your digestive system it's anextremely inefficient thing to do to youknow eat several pounds of things forthe pleasure that they give you likebecause you still need to poop them outat the end of the day and it's a youknow you're putting them in your bodythere are more efficient ways of havingfun so I mean the way the way that Ilike to think about it isum when I tell people yeah I just eatmeat and want it they're like oh don'tyou get boredfor me it's a little bit like I'mbuilding my house you know I'm puttingmy house together I'm putting a brick ontop of a brick so that I could build ahouse and these people are buildingtheir house but they're throwing apart awhile building the house yes and so theysee me focused on just putting thebricks and you know running the pipesand making sure the reef the roofdoesn't leak and making sure that thehouse is in right order and they thinkwow that's really boring well no it'snot boring because once I have a houseand it's strong and sturdy and the roofisn't leaking and the pipes working andthe sewage is working then I'm gonnahave a lot of fun with that housetotally meanwhile if you're throwing aparty and getting drunk while buildingyour house you're never going to get aroof that doesn't leak you're nevergoing to have a plumbing that works andyou're going to spend all of your lifeyou know having fun fixing your househaving fun dealing with the you knowthrowing a party while trying to dealwith all those problems and you're nevergoing to get to experience what it'slike to actually fun in a house that isfunctional and that's how I think offood in your body food is nutrition it'snourishing your body it's making yourbody stronger and healthier and you knowyou just get it out of the way in a fewminutes every dayand then you go on with your life andthen you find the Real Entertainment youfind real productivity you produce youmake things that are of value for othersyou work you focus on achieving thethings that you want to achieve in lifeand then when you want entertainmentyeah you can have entertainment becauseyou've got a healthy body I mean theamount of fun that you can have with ahealthy body yeah is incomparable towhat you can have when your body is nothealthy and I know this you know I usedto I used to eat garbage you know I usedto eat everything that's in thesupermarket and I was The Connoisseur ofgarbage food you know I I I kneweverything from the Snickers to thePringles to the Bounty bars to all ofthat stuff I knew it all and I ateenormous quantities of it I've triedthat and it's not as fun as what I cando now that I'm healthy yes I canum I can play sports I can be in muchbetter shape when playing sports it's alot more fun than eating a bag of chipsI can climb mountains I can swim inrivers I can I goto swim in oceans I've done incrediblethings that I would never been able todo without a strong health or that Icould have gotten really hurt doing ifmy health wasn't good if my body wasn'twell nourished I could have gotteninjured very easily the amount of funthat you can havewith a healthy body is a lot more thananything that you can get out ofanything from the supermarket in a canyeah absolutely that's really I thinkthe the idea and so when people tell mewell that's boring and that's not funthey just have a very very very sad ideaof what fun is if you get your fund froma pack of plastic in the supermarketyou're not having good fun or good foodno it's something we spend a lot of timetalking about is viewing food is aholistic asset and like the whole pointto what you're saying is like you'resupposed to build this amazing base thisamazing metabolic Machinery so you canlive a badass life so you can writebooks and play with your kids and dobetter at your job so I don't think it'sa coincidence it seems like that you goin carnival in 2015 and then a fewmonths later you're writing the BitcoinstandardI think it's just it's yeah although Ishould say no I think I started runningthe business down in 2017 so not a fewmonths yeah it was that was about a yearlater but yeah but just that likecreative output that you're getting fromlike building just just a healthierversion of yourself and you think abouthow many people unfortunately like can'tgive their gifts to the world becausethey're just used to being in thismetabolic rut because they're justeating these things that aren't actuallyfood so that's why we talk about takingthis stuff so seriously because likethis show exists because we were able toget our health on track and then focuson putting a product out into theuniverse it's just so interesting tothink about that it truly is I spent my20s basically beingum fat and lazy and eating garbage andthen in my 30s I got my togetherand I became very physically active andlike I maybe the biggest regret in mylife is the fact that I didn't get toenjoy the things that I enjoyed in my30s like I did in my 20s in my 20s I wasgetting my pleasure out of thesupermarket effectively and in my 30s isI was getting my pleasure by gettinggood at playing soccer by climbingmountains by doing all kinds of funactivities that I couldn't do in my 20sand it's it's a major regret and I'vetried both and I think it's a real shamethat many people just don't everexperience that many people never get toexperience what their body is capable ofI think it was I'm not sure one of theGreek philosophers which one it was whosaid uh it's a complete shame for a manto die having never experienced whattheir body is capable of I think of thata lot and I want to teach that to mykids like there's there's an uh you'regiven a body as a gift you're only goingto have that body once in your life andit's only going to achieve its peakfor a certain period of your life whereyou're going to be able to achievethings that you won't be able to achievefor the rest of you I mean you're eithergoing to be too young or too oldand if you miss out on that it's such ashame and if you miss out on thatbecause you're trying out all thisplastic crap from the supermarketbecause you prioritize the plastic crapin the supermarket because you'reprioritizing drinking alcohol or you'reprioritizing drugs and you're justletting your body withered awayI think it's an absolute shame it's alsojust easy to get stuck in theseparadigms I mean imagine if you in inyour 20s or in your 30s never comearound to that idea of getting healthierlike where would you be if you had justcontinued on that path oh yeah I thinkabout that a lot and I think it would bea very very bad place likepsychologically physically financiallyprobably all kinds of ways I think mylife would have just beenenormously different I I don't think I'dhave the family that I have today Idon't think that I'd have the life thatI have today and all of that is onlypossible because you give up on the crapin the supermarketyeah what umthe idea of paradigms I think Paradigmis like a Greek word that just meanspatterns and it's I think about it interms of how people think about moneylike we live in this system that usesfiat currency and that's just how it ispeople are born into it or have beenborn into it and they don't understandwhat an alternative world could looklike and you spend a lot of time talkingabout this and I think the same is withlike what we talk about on the nutritionside which is like hey you can be eatmeat only be optimal and avoid all thejunk that this you know these Centralauthorities are telling you to eat andyou'll be healthier but people reallystruggle to take that leap into liketrying to understand something differentor take the time to experiment with likewhat what is this is whether it's meatuh meat only diet or or Bitcoinum you know like what really is this I Ifeel like people just really arereluctant to trying something out forthemselves yeah I think it's um it's avery frustrating thing to particularlywith the people that you love people inyour family you know you just see thesame self-destructive patterns repeatand you see the what's really reallyum hurtful is to just watch the refusalto snap out of these patterns andparadigms and just[Music]umself-destructive activity and it's yeahI think the vast majority of peopledon't want to be shaken out of theircomfort zone and they want torationalize it's a lot easier to justrationalize what you're going through soumand I I tend toI tend to be on the side of you knowit'sI I care more about the person than Icare about my relationship with theperson and I'm willing to riskdestroying my relationship with somebodyin order to tell them the truth I thinkthis is very uncommon today most peoplewant to sugarcoat it to each other andwant everybody to be nice to everybodyelse sugar coating itself is a word thatis who tells you uh what it isinappropriately exactly it's uh you knowyou shouldn't tell people that they arekilling themselves I just let them killthemselves and applaud them whilethey're killing themselves andum I've been in this situation many manytimes and I think umI thinkumPerhaps Perhaps this this is what a lotof people need they just need some toughlove they need somebody to tell them thetruth lookum you might think that you're uh doingthe best that you can but you're notyou're taking choices every day andthese choices are destroying you andthere's an alternative and you could bedoing it otherwisebut it is very frustrating becausepeople really really like to cling on towhat they have and I think the majorityof peopleit's really sad but the majority ofpeople don't want to ever change theydon't want to ever take the path ofadmitting that they're wrong and theythink they're taking the easy path bysticking to theirum habits but you know one way I like topresent it is no actually I'm the onewho's taking the easy path you knowyou're choosing to indulge in thisgarbage today but that's not the easypath because you're choosing diabetesand uh all kinds of diseases that aregonna be a lot more difficult for you todeal with than it is going to be for meto deal with not having those things soif you really want to take the lazy easyway outjust eat meat yeah it's the easiest wayto go through life like if you if youcompare the path of eating meat onlyversus indulging in garbage and then youlook at all of the consequences thatfollow from it you'll see that you knowin the long run the consequences ofeating garbage are a lot moreinconvenient and a lot more tiring andexhausting and time consuming andeventually you know time consuming inthe sense of they'll consume you andgive you less time so take the easy wayout and eat meat but most people don'twant to do that most people don't wantto becausebecause it's it's again it's not it'sit's really high time preference what itcomes down to and that's another factorin in the Fiat food chapter in the Fiatstand but also across the whole bookwhich is when your money's losing valueyour ability to provide for the futureis compromised so therefore the futurebecomes more uncertain the moreuncertain the future is the more youdiscount the future and so the more youprioritize the present and I think thisis something that you see in everythingover the last century and my whole bookis like putting on this what would theworld look like if something happenedaround 1914 that raised everybody's timepreferenceguess what it looks exactly like theworld that we're living in right now weused to build buildings that lastedhundreds of years now we build buildingsthat last a couple of decades and thenthey need to be taken apart or renovatedum we used to eat more predominantlymeat all over the world now we eatpredominantly poisonous candy all overthe world because we can't think of thelong term and you see it everywhere yousee it in the family you see it in theway that scientific research isconducted you see it in all kinds ofaspects of life which is discussed indepth in the Fiat standard and I thinkthis is really a big part of the reasonwhy people don't want to snap out of itbecause they aren't able to think of thelong term they aren't they aren't ableto prioritize the long term they're muchbetter off they're much more used tothinking of the present and prioritizingthe present and soum The Giving Up of candy today is goingto give you withdrawal todayand well who cares about what's going tohappen in five years time like we don'thave an easy way of thinking aboutwhat's going to happen in five yearstimes anyway and so people discount thefuture heavily and so therefore theydon't care about it and sadly I meanum like when you first become acarnivore or when you first go low carbyou're astonished I mean I remember whenI first tapped when it first happened tome when I I'm about to 12 13 years agoand I just saw the improvements you knowfrom just very little reductions inprocessed food I saw incredibleImprovement in my health and in my mindit was just like oh wait until everybodyelse finds out about thisand then you go and you tell people andthey just look at you like you're weirdand they keep eating their junk andthey're not even curious about the factthat maybe it can help their lifebecause oh well who cares you know it'sall in the future I'm thinking about nowthere's the candy todayso yeah I think most people are justgonna have to either you know go throughthe um very negative consequences beforethey begin to changeorum they will never change yeah we'vealso lost this ability to your point tojust have this intrinsic understandingof what makes our bodies feel reallygood like experimenting with differentdietary inputs figuring out the bestapproach that works for you but insteadwe we focus on these weird likearbitrary data points where it's likewe're so hyper focused on keeping ourLDL within an optimal rage but it's likeyou're fat you're depressed you can'tget your dick up in the morning so likeis focusing on the LDL actually theright thing I don't think so I thinkthat's one of the interesting thingswith going carnivores it like gives youthe ability to relate to other peopleand tell stories and like get back tolike okay how do I actually feel thoughdo I need data or a watch to tell me howgood I'm supposed to feel yeah the wholewatch thing and just a completeobsession with all these metrics it'sjust yeah I thinkyou should be able to tell all of thosethings about your body just by listeningto your body and the reason that youcan't is because you can't listen toyour body because you flood did it withso many harmful things that you can'ttell the signal from the noise becauseyour body's just drowned out in candythat it's you don't know it's verydifficult for you to make any progresswith experimenting with things becauseuh you know I will remove this oneparticular candy and then added anotherone how much of a big difference is thatgoing to make I you know if you reallywanted to be meticulous about this ifyou really wanted to try and understandhow your body works do them one month ofcarnivore because we know that meat isthe one food that is essential like youcan't survive without animal fats youcannot survive and thrive for a longtime it's the one food that's trulyessential for humans and it's the onefood that's truly complete so we knowmany people throughout history havelived for decades on just meat so youcan do a month and we know that you knownothing else will be nothing else willbe able to sustain you so just do anElimination Diet where you just docarnivore for a monthsee how you feel and then start addingother things and then see how you feeland this is what really kept me incarnival forever because once you'vetried the first month it's kind of likea trap what I'm doing here because onceyou've tried it for a month there'snothing that you can add that's going toimprove your diet this is the thing thatI've had and this is you know wheneveranybody wants to say anything bad aboutcarnivore tell them all right so how doI improve my diet what should I add likename one food that I should add to mydiet that will make me healthierand nobody has ever and like the oneperson who's kind of made a compellingor at least coherent case yeah youshould add fruits and sugars was Paulsanadino and he's camped me into tryingfruits for a while and I felt like crapI does not improve my healthum I don't know whyum I mean he gets a lot of exercise he'ssurfing he's out there surfing every dayum so maybe for him he can handle themmaybe he wasn't eating enough meat maybehe was eating way too much organ meatand not enough muscle meat but I triedit I feel great on meat alone and when Iaddfruits I just go back to sugar addictionI go back to constantly having to thinkabout sugar I go back to getting thesesugary Cravings thinking about where thenext sugar hit is going to come from andonce you know you've started with fruitsthen you know your sugar your innersugar addict is going to start becominga lot moreumgreedy and you're gonna start cravingthe cheesecakes and you're going tostart craving all the other highlyprocessed candy so that's just no way tolive for me like I I I'm much better offjust being uh on meat alone not gettingon the sugar roller coaster at all inthe first place because just simplygetting on it is raising your bloodsugar levelgetting sugar crash needing more sugaruh he's just eating several pounds ofsugary stuff and indigestible fiberevery day for practically Zeronutritional benefit did not appeal to meyeah I keep coming back to just thinkingabout like the inefficiencies too withlike this whole conversation it's it ituh seems like there's so much thatpeople spend their time on and theythey're wasting their time going downthese rabbit holes trying to find asilver bulletum when you can just simplify it and ifyou simplify and just commit to it longenough you'll reap the benefits of itand understand what it actually means tobe caught in that like Health Paradigmlike you're caught in a healthy way ofliving for four weeks for the first timein your life and you actually understandokay this is where I need to actuallyspend my time like this is the person Iwant to be it really is it's amazing Iremember when I when I wasn't verystrict carnivore before or when I waslike very low carb before I startedcarnivore there would be times you knowobviously the the less crap that I eatthe better I feel and the more focusedmore productive I amand you never really get these kind ofcrashes which you get when you're eatinggarbage and then occasionally I'd findmyself you know feeling not too wellum being a little bitum sad a little unproductive unable toget my work done unable to focusand you start drifting Into the DarkPlaces and thinking you know what iswrong with me and what is wrong and youstart thinking about all the things thatbother you in life and you startbringing up and dwelling on all of thethings that you shouldn't be dwelling onand then I remember oh wait I had apizza yesterday that's why I'm being astupid little I should just go andeat more burgers and drink more waterand tomorrow I'm gonna wake up and I'mgonna be a little bit less of abut I should stop eating the crap thatmakes me feel like crap yeah and that'sit and like now that I look back atthose times like yeah every time youevery time you eat that stuff you'reputting yourself on that emotionalroller coaster and it's such an enormoustoll that it takes on you like the Idon't care how good you think you feelif you haven't tried going a whole monthwithout any sugar spikes and without anysugar Downs you don't know what it'slike and you don't know what it's likefor you to beum at Optimum Health like just nothaving any sugar spikes whatsoever and Iknow like a lot of people can handletheir sugar a lot of people can handlethe carb you know I call it metabolicprivilege there are people out therethat can eat garbage and still lookgreat and still work out and stillachieve athletic uh Feats of enormousendurance you know like most mostprofessional athletes can basically getaway with eating whatever they wantum if you're you know if if you'reblessed enoughum that you have the kind of body thatcan achieveElite athletelevels yes you can pretty much eatanything and it doesn't really matterand that's why the worst people tolisten to are the um professionalathletes when it comes to diet becausein their mind you know yeah I can eatBagels I can eat pizza I can eatwhatever I want I just go to the gym andI feel great but even they you know theywon't be like that forever eventuallythey're gonna hit 30 or 40 or 45 or 50and at some point it's going to startshowing up and they're gonna need tostart watching their foodand even there I would think even theywould actually probably do better ifthey would snap out of it and just eatmeat only but most of them won't tryjust because they have no reason to likethey can get away with eating that stuffthey won't try it until they have tobasically until they start developing abelly or a double chin and then theyreally need to start watching what theyeat yeah I'm really intrigued by thisconcept of just saying yourself stopbeing a little and the reason whyI'm saying that is I we wrote about thison sub stack a couple weeks ago and Iwas basically I think I titled it likethe rest my recipe for anxiety anddepression and it was basically likeinstead of figuring out how Society canserve you just finding a really powerfulMission and just trying to serve Societyso I know obviously nutrition plays abig part in establishing that mindsetbut also like do you think it'simportant particularly for men and womentoo just to like latch on to like latchonto a big mission that they can just goall in on yeah I think a huge part of itis just not need reading anything fromother people like freeing yourself fromexpectation of anything from othersthat's just because as long as you'reexpecting others to do things for youthen you're always going to bedisappointed and you're always going tobasically be that little and ifyou just snap out of it and you realizeyou knowum everybody's on this Earth for alimited time and nobody came in obligedto do anything for me you knowum and the only people that owe methings are people that I signedcontracts with and if they're notumfulfilling their part of the contractthen I should just stop fulfilling mypart of the contract snap out of it signa contract with somebody else so I'lljust get rid of the expectation thatothers owe you things I think that's anenormous part of it and all these thingsI mean it's strange how you would thinkthis is unrelated to diet but it'sstrange how these things are such acommon experience among people who gothrough this kind of dietary changes Ireally do think there's something aboutshitty food that makes you uhlittle like it's just you you getinto these yeah you get into theseemotional states and then you know onceyour sugar levels are downeverything looks shitty in lifeeverything looks bad and you just seethe worst in life and you're you dwellon it and I think it's just you knowperhaps at a very basic level is justyour body making you feel like sothat then you go and seek out the sugarytreat that will make you feel better andthat's just the addiction pattern likeit's it's it it's common for all kindsof other drugs like your body is PlayingTricks on you to get you to indulge inthe drug again you're just gonna makethe withdrawalnasty until you go and grab the nextdrink or the next piece of candy or thenext hit of whatever drug that you takethat's that's what withdrawal is and sothis is why I've made this tweet a longtime ago and I just keep going back toit it might be my favorite tweet of alltime of my tweets and it was just like Iwas at the supermarket I remember it Iwas at the supermarket and I justlooking at all the Cornucopia of garbagein front of me and I just rememberedtaking my phone out and tweeting Iwonder how much of modern philosophy isjust nerds mistaking the roller coasterthe emotional roller coaster of sugaraddiction for The Human Conditionbecause I really think it is like it'sjust people like I looked at all thatcrap and I'm like if I ate that crapyeah I'd be on an emotional rollercoaster and I'd be inclined to sit downand write about you know The HumanCondition being this shitty rollercoaster that I'm on but really I choseto take that ride you know I bought theticket I took the ride that's not theHuman Experience that's the eating yeahgarbage emotional roller coasterexperience and I think an enormousamount of modern philosophy and heck Imean maybe even ancient philosophy aswell is justumplant eatersdoing plant eater things and I thinkit's it's a very different world whenyou're off the smack of eating plants italmost pulls you like away from youryour willpower and your focus to justlike keep your concentration on the onething you're trying to work on whetherit's right the Bitcoin standard of theFiat standard start a podcast whateverit is but it does it puts you on thatenergy roller coaster where you're notable to just keep a status quo and andjust operate from the same point everysingle day yeah in fact I this wasreally startling for me becauseum I think I I came across this uh I'mnot sure if it was a book or an articleI think it may have been an articleabout a book and I can't remember whatthe name of the book was but it wasarguing that a great way to hack yourwillpower and to develop willpower is toquit sugar apparently sugar destroysyour willpowerand for me it was always the other wayaround I always thought about it as youknow you need a willpower in order tostop eating sugar and then uh once yousnap out of eating sugar then you getoff the emotional roller coaster andthen you stop being a little andyour life gets in order yeah it mightthe causality might be more direct itmight be that sugar is just activelyruins your willpowerand I think there is something to itbased from my experience I think thereis something to it and it there issomething to it also becausegenerally once you get into thatmentality of taking the quick high onceyou get into that mentality of just I'mgonna eat something and it's gonna makeme happy right now then youstartprioritizing pleasure over happiness youstart prioritizing the high timepreference to short-term kick ofHappiness over thelow time preferencelong-term thinkingbuilding sustainablethings that bring you sustainable joy inlife in other words I mean you couldthink about it as you know thedifference between just wanting to takea hit from a drug versus focusing onyour long-term career right the moredrugs you do the more happy you get fromthe feeling of getting a drug the lessyou'reenticed by the vision of you achievingyour goals in five ten years time thisis how people fall off the rails anddestroy their lives like you start aheroin addict you start a heroin habitand then heroin is just so much funthat you know well who needs to finishcollege anyway who needs to keep theirjob anyway because you know the the joythat is going to come to you fromsticking to your job and 10 years ofsaving and you know having all thatlong-term Focus starting a family andbuilding a family I mean it all soundsnice in theorybut you knowthe heroin is nice now yeah yeahsomething I can't stop thinking aboutwhile we're having this conversation isjust the inputs of your food determiningthe outputs of your life so like Harrywas mentioning when we kicked off theshow I remember you telling me this whenyou were still living in Boston I was inNew York you started listening to theBitcoin standard on audiobook and youlistened to it twice so the second timeyou could solidify it and I think aboutsome of the regrets that you were sayingthat you had in your 20s and if you justprioritize the right food maybe theoutput that could have come from your20s and then getting your diet on trackthat leads to you writing this bookthat's so influential to thousands uponthousands of people and even you look atsomeone like a Jordan Peterson with someof Michaela's autoimmune issues she getshim to start eating meat and greens andthen just eventually meet and all themen that he's had an unbelievable impacton that's all stemmed from like the foodthat you're putting into your body andyou think about that it's probably crazyfor you to think about the impact thatyou've had on all of these people ifthat all stem from you like takingcontrol of the food that you wereputting into your system and just theoutput that came from thatyeah I I mean I I know my buddy I knowmy life I know my brain and I don'tthink I would have done it if I hadum been eating garbage and I thinkum you know there's something about ourgeneration whereyou know 30 years ago it was a loteasier for people to eat supermarketfood and handle it but these people youknow our parentsthey had spent their life eatingsupermarket food and then they had usborn weaker effectively and so we can'thandle it less I think there is there issomething about it like it's um I I'mone of my favorite nutrition books is umKate Shanahan's deep nutrition yeahwhich is also heavily influenced byWestern price and she's looked at whathas happened to basically American jawlines and American you know she goesthrough High School photos over time andyou see that the the markers of healthand the markers of good looks havedisintegrated and you see the fertilityhas disintegrated you see sperm countsare disintegrated you see all measuresof what is healthy what is a healthyexpression of the human body havedisintegrated over time so a lot ofolder people might laugh when they hearus say this because you know well I'vebeen eating Supermarket crap all my lifeand I've been highly productive and Ithink that there is obviously a lot oftruth to it but you know if you're 70today then yeah you could have eatencrap throughout the 50s and 60s but youknow you were born likely in a householdthat didn't have access to anything likethe crap that you were born into ifyou're 30 todayand that's why you know we're a lotweaker I think we can handle that stuffa lot less and weum I think you know you see thisexpressed in all kinds of different waysthat it's go and I think with timethat's only going to exacerbate thatit's just gonna benecessary that you're if you're gonnawant to be productiveyou're gonna have to say no to thesupermarkets the majority of the stuffthat's in the supermarket because it'sgoing to be hard and harder to stayhealthyum when you're eating normally andum you knowum Kate Shanahan shows you like some ofthe most amazing specimens of peoplethat we could think of like people likeArnold Schwarzenegger or ClaudiaSchiffer they were born in tiny littleVillages where they ate very primitivefood they didn't have massivesupermarkets and their parents had thathad that and then now you look at theirkids you know their kidsthey're born into the supermarkets theydon't quite look asamazing as them and then you see thiskind of disintegration happening so it'sum I think it's very it's it's veryobvious when once you see it you can'treally unsee it yeah you touch on it tooin the Fiat standard about the soil toowhich is like measurably different thanwhat it was 50 years ago in terms of youknow nutrient density and nutrientquality in the soil I think that'ssomething that has been overlooked forcenturies and centuries I think when weoriginally came here like GeorgeWashington was talking about how we justkeep moving West to avoid addressing theproblem of soil degradation because theycouldn't grow anymore uh food on thesoil because they would just mono cropthe soil and then yeah plants would stopgrowing so yeah and the other thing theydid is they killed the Bison in order toum kill the Native Americans in order tofight the Native Americans they killed alot of the bison and that's whatdepleted the soil also massively that'swhyum bidstein wants to revive the bisonand I fully support them I think thiscountry was going to be made great ifyou replace all these horrific soy andcornfields with bisonand grazing Fields could you imagineawesome such an incredible animal it'sso powerful freaking delicious too yesjust not that much fat in it that's theonly problem yeah but it's okay yeahwhat um what what do you think of allthe noise that's out there like how doyou deconstruct whether it'sintentionally put out there by Centralplanning authorities governingauthorities or if it's just like Massconfusion where we're all like I Ialmost struggle to think that you knowwe all can't come to a consensus withoutthere being some sort of like nefariousangle with uh the noise that's out therewhen it comes to either eating right orum you know all the different topics outthere when it comes to being healthy Ithink uh this is uh the next chapter soI use the Fiat food uh chapter in theFiat standard to talk aboutum you know how food has been destroyedand that leads us to explain that leadsus to the next topic which is nutritionscience you know where all thesenutrition scientists are doing it's anexcellent question you know like how isit that all these gym Bros on theinternet have figured out that you knowyou cut down on processed garbage andyou start feeling like Superman whereasall these nerds are sitting in all theseheavily funded University uh departmentsstudying nutrition writing completelyinconsequential garbage papers thatnobody's going to read about thisobscure mechanism in the body that andhow it relates to this or this or thator the other thing and they haveabsolutely nothing useful to tell youabout you know maybe stop eating garbagethat our sponsors subsidize uh that oursponsors produceum and I think this isn't just I meannutrition science is obviouslyenormously corrupt and um hugely hugelycompromised but it isn't just nutritionscience it's economics as well which isyou know my original uh black bill onAcademia because I was doing my PhD ineconomics and I came across all thisgarbage and then came across theAustrian school and I thought to myselfwow this makes a lot of sense why dothey teach us this garbage we were justread it in a cave All These YearsLearning all that nonsense and it's thesame thing with nutrition and I believeit's also the same thing with climateand you know the more I read about moretopics the more I realize there's a lotof garbage in them I'm not very wellversed in physics but I wouldn't besurprised if a lot of the garbagephysics a lot of the physics out theretoday is uh garbage as well so I thinkand what I try and do in the nextchapter uh in in the Fiat standardswhich is called Fiat science is to lookat how Fiat money has affected umthe scientific process and I think thisis obviously something that is not goingto be very popular among academics and Idon't expect a lot of academics to pickup the Baton and run with this thesisbecause their payment and their paycheckdepends on it so but I think there's umthe the real issue here is first of allit sounds like it's such a great idealike who would not want to financescience you know we science is amazingscience has given us all theseincredible things let's put more moneyinto science and if the government canum you know Finance science and that's agreat thing and if it just puts itintroduces a tiny little bit ofinflation to finance education andscience we will all benefit enormouslyfrom science this is the kind ofcompelling logic of governmentintervention in the field of sciencebutas an economist you try and you realizewell nothing is free so what are thecosts how does this come about what atwhat costs do we get this free sciencewell let's run the numbers let's take alook and so you realize obviously whathow does you start thinking about theeconomic incentives so first of allunder a system in which governmentsdon't Finance science the only way foryou to become a scientist is to go outthere and produce something that getsother people to willingly hand overmoney for you because you what you'redoing is valuable so if you're going toget a job at a university and theuniversity is going to call you ascientist the only way that they'regoing to give you that university jobis if the output that you produce isvaluable you're either teaching studentsuseful science that they can then taketo the real world and make useful thingswith it or you're coming up withPublications that improve the state ofknowledge for Humanity and make theworld a better place so that the peoplewho benefit from these PublicationsFinance the university and finance youto make more of that stuff so as long asthat was the case which I believe wasthe case up until the early 20th centuryumthen science is Tethered to realitythere has to be an actual value of ityou can't just spend all day wanking inan office making irrelevant garbage andthen telling the world you have tobelieve me you have toyou know you have to make a bettermousetrap it has to be catching moremice you have to beumproducing more Stakes you have to bemaking better cars there has to besomething coming out of all of thiswanking or else it's just wanking youknow yeah so once you take away thatmarket feedback and then you have agovernment bureaucrat allocatingscientific fundingyou've cut off the market feedbackyou've cut off the test of usefulnessyou've cut off the test of the marketability to judge what you're doingand so therefore there is no correctivemechanism for uhstopping people from wasting their lifeand wanking pointlessly which is whatwe've ended up with that's really thekey thing like it's not so much thatwrong ideas come out of sciencepeople will always come up with thewrong ideas people will always be stupidthere will always be stupid ideas theproblem is that there's no correctivemechanism there's no consequence forbeing wrong and this is this is a reallypowerful quote that I quote from acertain scientist I think his name isBrian nozickum maybe something else I forget but thename is in Fiat standard and he saidsomething there is no cost to beingwronged in modern science but there is acost to not getting published so if youthink of this you can write whatever youwant as long as you get it published andso what's going to happen first of allis we have this enormous enormousenormous flood of scientific papersand just completely Beyond anybody'sability to read you know that thereisn't a single field of knowledge wherethere's a single person who could readall the academic papers it's justimpossible like I I remember when I wasat a university and we were told youknow you need to publish an academicjournals we were given a list of thejournals that we could publish inand there's absolutely no way that Icould read all of those journals if Iwanted to beum knowledgeable about my field you knowsimply in my field and you know youwould think you know to stay uh abreastof developments in the field read thescientific journals that's impossiblethey're literally impossible if I didn'tsleep a single moment all year long Iwouldn't get through all of the journalsthat's how much crap is being churnedout there's no cost to publishing all ofthat crap it's just the industry ofreally churning outcontent free grammatically correct andpolitically correct papers it's justthey're constantly churning them out andso what determines the success becausethere's no Market test it doesn't matterhow much you get publishedand what matters is that you getpublished so and and the people thathave captured this are the publicationindustryso the academic publishing industrythey've managed to basically be thebigger winners of the whole fundingscience scam so they get the universityprofessors to write and edit theirjournals then for freeand then they get these sameuniversities to pay exorbitant enormousridiculous criminal sums of money tosubscribe to these garbage unreadable journals so you have theprofessors slaving away spending yearstrying to publish those papers and thenthe same the university that pays theirsalaries has to pay thousands of dollarsto the academic publisher to get thosejournals this kind of made some senseback in the pre-digital era because thejournal would actually print it out onnice fancy looking paper and you couldfool academics who are not very cleverpeople generally into thinking oh wellwe know we have to pay them the bigbucks because they're printing on thison money uh cost money to print thosethings well now all these journals areelectronic predominantlyso you're basically paying an enormousamount of money for PDFs basically PDFsthat were written by your own Universityprofessors so the the journals are justmaking money and it's in everybody'sinterest to keep this ridiculous charadegoing the academics need to keepprinting so they need to keep publishingso they keep writing and they want morePublications and it's in their interestin more Publications uh get made theuniversities on the other hand they needto get more Publications on theirlibrary in their Library so that theycan look like a good University that'show you get a good ranking all these academic rankings ofuniversities it's not about how wellyou're going to learn it's about howmuch money the university pays to thepublic publishing Mafia which alsoissues the university rankings and itranks the universities based on how muchmoney it gives them for the journalsthat's one of the important criteria sothe universities want to get morePublicationsthe academics want to get morePublicationsand the journals of course want to makemore Publications because they're makingmoney the end result is an infiniteinflation in publication and a completeloss of any kind of sense or logic inthose papers like if you want tounderstand anything I strongly recommendthat you start by not reading anythingin the academic literature it's it's ait's just it's a it's a denial ofservice attack on your brain's abilityto process knowledge like if you try tore-understand Nutrition By going andreading nutrition academic papersyou'll get lost you know there's aninfinite number of papers about allkinds of different obscure topics andyou won't make any progress compared tojust you know looking at Instagram andseeing what are all these fit people onInstagram doing what do they recommendlet's just you know Pick 10 randomaccounts on Instagram do one monthfollowing each one of them and see howyou feel you're gonna make a lot moreprogress than if you spent those 10months reading every single Paper outthere on PubMed which is just going toget you lost in a world of irrelevanttrivia basically yeah it's completelyirrelevant to your life well this paperthis thing causes that levels of thatthing to rise in your body anddoesn't matterso all of this is the incentivestructure of academic publicationindustry now think about it when it ispoliticized when there is any kind ofpolitical incentive to sway the resultsin any particular waythen you've got a feedback loop that'sgoing to get you stuck in that result nomatter how absurd no matter how wrongthat's why economists still believe inthe garbage Keynesian model even thoughit continues to get refuted over andover and over and over again by realitythat's why nutritionists continue totell you about how you need to eat sixto ten portions of grains even thoughthat's basically poison even though it'sa recipe for diabetes even thougheverybody's getting fat from listeningto that stuff even though they put it inschools and school kids are gettingfatter and less healthy than ever thereis no level of real world feedback thatwill cause academics to reconsider theAmerican Heart Association continues togo along with the results of what theywant that's it and in the case ofnutrition you know the drivers as Imentioned earlier was we want to getpeople to eat the cheap crapand thenum you know to cover up for inflationand then there's this giant industrythat thrives on making all of that cheapcrap and then that industry has theincentive to continue to propagate itand so the only way that you're going toget a job in nutrition in any FiatUniversity is if you go along with thegarbage ideas and that's why if you lookat who are the people that have madeactual progress in advancing ourunderstanding of nutrition people likeNina titles she's not a PhD in nutritionpeople like Gary Tobbs not a PhD innutrition all of the most importantinfluential influencers on the internetthat have actually changed millions ofpeople's lives to the betternone of them almost has a PHD innutrition in fact the only thing thatthose phds with nutrition have donethrough this process is to go to theseinfluencers and waste their time andtroll them and try and get the peoplethat are following themto stop following them so you this isand this is and you know I love to dothis you get all these fat phds going toall these gym Bros and telling them yeshaha you're just a gym bro you don'thave a PhD my PhD is from this or thator the other thing and I think peopleshould be eating garbage and that's whyand you know you shouldn't listen to himand one of my favorite things to do onTwitter is to just tell those peoplelook you're fat shut the up yeahyou don't get to talk about anythingrelated to nutrition and Food and Healthif you're fat it's you know you're freeto be fat but you need to shut theup about food and nutrition if you uh ifyou're fat it's just very simple logiclike you can't completely disregard onlyin Academia can you just completelydisregard the topic and like they actsurprised and they act shocked and Iremember once I did it to this professorin England and um she she went crazy shestarted she started tagging myUniversity I was still at Universitytime just started tagging my Universityaccount and telling how is yourUniversity going to feel about the factthat you're saying these sexist remarksto me like what's sexist remarks it hasnothing to do I didn't mention anythingabout you being a woman I just saidyou're fine it's nothing you could be aman and it was fat I would say the samething and I have said it to a lot of menyes yesterday I was calling the sametoilet fat for doing the same thing hewas trolling Nina titles and he's fathe's extremely fat he's got bigger boobsthan her if you don't get to talk aboutnutrition when you've got gigantic boobsand a massive belly like you just all ofyour opinions are invalid by definitionandum she wanted to get me canceled by myUniversity because of that and of coursethe funny thing you know I go to Lebanonwhere you know I was in the University Iwas teaching in Lebanon where all thiswoke cancer culture thing didn't existthe lady who runs the university Twitteraccount saw me in a few days later she'slike hey remember that crazy lady thatwas telling me that was attacking ouraccounts because there's like yeah it'slike I wanted respond and tell her toshut up but I decided not to do it uhbut yeah but this is this is whatAcademia has devolved to I mean it'sessentially speaking propaganda topeople trying to improve their lives sothere's all these people out therereally actually doing the scientificmethod like the only way that you canbecome a successful influencer onTwitter is if you get real people toretweet you to follow you to say I'dlisten to this guy and it improved myhealth I've gotten healthier I've gottenbetter I've gotten more muscles I'velost fat this is how you make it likeyeah you can buy influence you canum then there's all these ways of youknow boosting social media engagementbut eventually if you're out thereselling garbage to people if you'retelling people to eat garbage you're notgonna make it yeah it's a real world ofReal Results you have to actually getgive people Real Results in order forthem to come back in order for youraccount to get a new serious engagementin the long term and that's sciencethat's what science is that's thescientific method you try what this guysaid you see what it does to your bodyand then if it works you keep listeningto him if it doesn't work you don'tlisten to him and so it's a survival ofthe most Adept and Academia is nothinglike that you see it on nutritionTwitter a lot with the gym Bros thatyou're talking about Harry and I jokeabout this all time all the time becauseyou'll have some scientists or MD thatcomes out and will say show me thepeer-reviewed study or whatever then thegym bro we'll just say post physique andit'll be a picture of him flexing withlike a six-pack or something exactly andit's funny but it's true though becausethat's that person's actual proof ofwork exactly exactly yeah absolutely youshow your physique instead of it all ofthese people it's amazing all theseacademics like they look like crap andthey obviously don't haveum flattering pictures to share onlineand they think referencing some studyfrom PubMed is science but that's notwhat the scientific method is it's sodumb to call reading PubMed science thatit's it's hilarious because you'retrusting a university and you'retrusting the funders of the Universityyou're trusting the people who did thisstudy you're trusting the people whotally the results you're trusting thepeople who published it and then they'rejust delivering it in a in a PDF thatyou're gonna download and you're gonnatake that as an authorityfor your lifethat's not what science is science isexperimentation soyou're subject of this entire debate isyour body and you can experiment withyour body you can try to go one month ona diet of Twinkies and Doritos likethose people recommend and see whathappens and then you can try and cut outthe Doritos in the Twinkies and see whathappens yeah I had a tweet the other dayit was about the difference betweenscience with a capital S and science forthe lowercase s and capital S sciencehas these Gatekeepersum for like the information uh access totechnology to actually like do theresearch and like yeah it's just thefunding it's crazy how gate cappedSciences now absolutely it's nuts andand it's it's in you knowcould get a bit boring talking aboutmethodology here but it's it'sfascinating that you know you can't justgo and do an experiment you know you andI can't just go and do an experiment andpublish the results because there's alltheseum you know the the institutional reviewboard that needs to make sure that we'renot doing this and we're not doing thatand if we want to do it it's going tohave to be enormously expensive but thisis all gatekeeping it's essentiallyum guilds that protect themselves bypreventing Outsiders and of course thisis very useful for propagating liesbecause if you wanted to spread actualuseful knowledge you'd have an opensystem of experimentation and I justwonder you know back in the day or whenbefore the internet it made sense thatyou'd have these kind of archaic systemsthat we have today but now why can'tthese trials be much more openwhy can't all these trials be conductedextremely openly to the point where youknow the people who are on it you knowthey're these people these are theTwitter accounts and they'reparticipating in the trialyou know I'm talking about trials formedication but also all these nutritiontrials why can't they be out there inthe open why can't the results beum available for everybody why can't yougo and talk to the people who took themedication in the trial and say hey whatdid you guys feel like tell me yourresults why can't they publish theresults openly everything has to gothrough all of these behind closed doorsonly the experts get to see it and ofcourse you know for the simple peoplethey think you know that's just how youmake science properly it's not it's justa scam and it's it's and and it's anamazing scam because it is it's such anincredible bait and switch becauseyou know the the the whole Enlightenmentideal of science was oh we come from theDark Ages where we had all these priestswho were the only ones who were allowedto read and write and they would tell usthings and we would just have to trustthem and believe them because they arethe ones who read and writeand now we're going to replace thatsystem we're going to replace the churchwe're going to replace all of thesethings that are based on Authorityrather than knowledge we're gonna thenrather than experimentation we're gonnareplace them with the modern scientificmethod of experimentation and we'regoing to do experiments we're going todo the scientific method and we're goingto go by the authority of nobody so itdoesn't matter how much of a priest youare doesn't matter how many times youthink God spoke to you I'm going to revI'm going to makeum the experiment myself I'm going toverify the results myselfso you'd thinkyou know this would be theidea here yeah all right so now we'regoing to be doing science all right wellLet's Do Science nope you can't doscience only these new guys in the whitecoats get to do the science yes only thepeople that areyou know instead of God spoke to themthe people who get the scientificfunding from the government they're theones who are allowed to do science andso they've undermined the authority ofthe churchbut under the pretext of we're going toreplace appeal to Authority withscientific experimentation and then wentahead and bait and switched you and tookaway experimentation and replaced itwith a new appeal to Authority exceptthe authorities Government funding nowyeah and it's amazing the stories thatyou're hearing about on the internet ofpeople taking their health into theirown hands I think carnivore is anamazing example of that is becausesomething they love to use as a weaponagainst carnivores that you know theydon't have the papers or the research orthe data published yet we can go on theinternet you know I had ulcerativecolitis that I healed through acarnivore diet I can connect with 30plus other people that have healed theircolitis through a carnivore diet so likethey've gone through the experimentationI can connect with them in a way thatthese papers aren't allowing you to doand I can actually heal and get to theroot cause of what's bothering me in thefirst place so to your point that'sactually what science is supposed to bethat really is it and you know the theum the amount of experimentation thatcomes out of these Facebook groups is isincredible because all of these peoplegoing through the same symptoms they'retrying the same different things and youreport your results and then others willbenefit enormously from it you know andthen of course if you're going throughthe same problem you're also going toexperience the same kind ofum questions along the way wellotherwise I did this and that happenedanybody else have that happen to themand then yeah it turns out that yeahwell that happened to me and then I tookthis and that fixed it and this is howI've done it for a long time this iswhat my wife does with the kids like Imean at this point I trust my wife'smedical knowledge more than most doctorsbecause she has a superpower called allthese mom groups on Facebook yes whereshe just goes I mean kids are kids andthey're all going through the same crapall the time and it's actuallyincredibly powerful like this kid my kidis doing this this and that and then shejust searches the Facebook groups you'llsee many instances of kids going throughthe same thing and she'll see all thesediscussions if she has anything newshe'll offer it then she'll ask and allthese people will jump in yeah my kidhad it and we did that and it helped andit's amazing it works and it's it's it'sonly possible now because the internetmade communication so much easier it'sactually really tragic to think about ifwe hadn't had Fiat science if we hadn'thad science through Authority if wehadn't had the scam of centralizedAuthority and government fundingdeciding everything for scienceover the past few decadesit's amazing to think about how muchmore advanced we'd be and how much moreuseful all the knowledge we have wouldbe I mean there's just so much knowledgeout there that has become commonknowledge on the Facebook groupsand everybody knows it and everybodyagrees with it except for your doctors Imean it's incredible yeah how many timeshave you heard the story of the personwho went to Facebook cured a diseasewent to the doctor and told the doctorI'm eating this and this and that andthe doctor told them oh no you shouldn'teat this go back to eating the thatalmost killed you before you savedyourself because my textbook and mystandard of care says you need to getsick like that so that I could thenrecommend the highly profitablepharmaceutical poisons for you yeah it'snot like a lot of the doctors we had onearlier early on in the podcast or uhearly on when we were podcasting theywould talk about a lot of theconfrontation that they would run intowith the established medical authoritiesGary fedke is one he's literally curingpeople from getting amputations bychanging their diet and he ran intoserious problems with the AustralianHealth authoritiesum to the point where they're going torevoke his his uh ability to practicemedicine which isgreat I mean he was helping people andultimately they were going to take awayhis his license to practice medicinejust because the advice he was givingyeah um I think it was Dwight Eisenhowerwho said uh be wary of the scientifictechnocratic Elite and it I have a hardtime convincing myself that we're notliving in that time period right nowwhere there's these gate Keepers whocontrol access to all the money powerand uh information to basically do whatthey they want with like the averageperson do you feel like we're kind ofliving through that period absolutelyand it's just I mean it's it's uh whenyou when you think about it in ahistorical context it's no differentfrom every other period there's an umthere's a group that has access toknowledge and a group that treats therest as cattleum and I think it's just no differentnow it's just they use the pretext ofthese nice sounding ideals that it's allscientific rather than it beingreligious so they've replaced oh wellGod spoke to me and God made me the onethat needs to tell you what to do andyou have to listen to me or else Godwill throw you in hell they've replacedthat with government spoke to me andgovernment gave me the money and told methat you have to listen to me or elseyou go to hell it's insane I mean it's ain all those fields it's almost becomelike a uh uh uh it's for me the bestcounter indicator I mean once I seesomebody in any kind of field saying ohthis guy is a quack who's going againstestablished uh opinion and establishedstandards of careI immediately pay attention yeah it'sbeen enormously fruitful so for instanceI've hosted on my podcast I've holdedI've always Dr Malcolm Kendrick ScottishDoctor Who's written a book or proposingan alternative theory of heart diseaseit's extremely compelling it's all aboutblood clotting from inflammation andit's and it's extremely compelling whenyou look at the evidence and it wasactually pretty common theory in the19th century back when heart disease wasnot very common yeah because it peopleweren't eating as much garbage as theywere eating right now but it was prettywell accepted that inflammation leads tothese problems that develop into heartdisease later on and that then in 20thcentury got completely replaced with thecholesterol or uh diet heart hypothesiswhich is pure garbage obviously andagain he's basically getting lynched forit and he gets excommunicated for it youknow Tim Knox you may have heard of himin South Africa he's got an enormousnumber of people millions of people inSouth Africa have fixed their diets bygoing low carb he's also gotten[Music]into enormous amounts of trouble I meancrazy I I don't even know anything aboutarcheology I've heard this guy GrahamHancock and I saw that in his Twitter hepublished a collage of all thesearticles in mainstream press of allthese uh archaeologists saying GrahamHancock is dangerous he's promotingfiction he's uhum going against medical uh againstestablished opinion and againstAuthority and expertise and all of theum all of the consensus of archeologyand I want to pay attention to whatthese guys say yeah yeah it's just it'sit's clearly if you if you're if theargument against you is that you'regoing against the establishment thenthat means the establishment has noargument if you were just an idiot who'sout there saying something really stupidit would be very easy to say no you'rewrong because one two three four andthat's what you would do but if you'regoing if you're having to pull rank ifyou're having to sayum where's your degree from if youhappen to resort toumgoing by these garbage academic journalsand just you know show me PubMed pissingcontests then yeah I'm not going tofollow anything I'm gonna I'm gonna takethat guy seriously and it's it's reallyit's really it's really a very powerfulsignal because you you would get so manypeople and I try and get those people onmy podcast all the time I get so muchknowledge just bynot listening to what the uh expertswant you to say because the experts havebeen thoroughly corrupted in the fieldsthat I understand so I'm much better offassuming that the other fields are alsocorrupted that's the amazing thing aboutDr Nokes is that he was fighting for hislicense yet a lot of people don'trealize he created one of the originalrunning gels in South Africa that wasyou know carb sugar to fuel you throughthe race he wrote a whole book on whycarbs are essential for endurance andOptimal Performance and the informationhe came across for high fat diets was socompelling that he was willing to do a180 publicly admit that he was wrong andthen run towards this path to makepeople healthier yeah he's the doctorthat's at risk of losing his medicallicense and it's the same thing withDocker yeah and then in the case ofnotes it's when he became diabetichimself and then he realized he had tostop it and then he stopped and he feltso much better Sean Baker's also gonethrough something similar as well he'san orthopedic surgeon and he gets allthese extremely obese people whosejoints are cracking up falling apartbecause of the extra weight that they doand because the fact that they can'tmove properly and he tells them to fixtheir diet and that's been ruining thebusiness for his Hospitalyeah I um I always think about justthese doctors who are standing upagainst the establishment and almostlike try to look at history in reverseand like over timelike people who really made change orcreated a shift in the way we operatethey were always The Crazy Ones theywere always The Fringe guyum you know standing out on the limbwilling to put their ideas out there andtake the criticism so so I agree withyou like whenever I hear of someonewho's like I think of like Alex uh is itAlex gladson or Goldstein who's uhum the in climate change uh EpsteinEpstein sorryum I'm like I want to listen to what hehas to say like yeah yeah that's anothergreat example you know the argumentsagainst him are always oh you don'tagree with the consensus of 97 ofscientists what does the consensus sayhow can you defend it what is theargument show me where the climatecrisis is show me where in the big blueand green ball the carbon dioxide hurtsyou yeah that um that hits on a pointthat I want to ask you about just interms ofum ESGyou're probably your three favoriteletters uhumyou know the medianing diet has run intothe same problems that Bitcoin has interms of trying to fight this ESGnarrative is there a particular likeit's it's almost feeds into the sameconversation we're having it's ourgatekeeping the information trying tolike steer people in the wrong directionum but I just find it so funny thatthese two things run into the sameproblem of like the ESG using the ESGnarrative or lens to try to beat themdown and suppress these twoum you know these two movements yeahit's I think it all goes back toinflation and that's why the chapterafter Fiat science in my book is onenergy Fiat fuels we're doing a good jobfollowing your chapters yeahum it's and and I think it's um you knowthe it's all related because the twothings that are the mostumpolitically sensitive issues when itcomes to inflation are food and fuelbecause they're the things that peopleare consuming constantly so every dayyou need to buy fuel every day you needto buy food every day you're consumingit and every day you notice what'shappening to the price so these arethings are being consumed constantlyeverybody has to pay them every day andthey affect your moodconstantly and they affect how you voteand they affect how angry you are withyour government so government is reallyenormously invested in trying to makeyou think that food and fuel are notbecoming more expensiveand the best way that obviously the bestway to do that would be to just stopdestroying the money but obviously nogovernment's going to do that so thesecond best way to do that is to just goahead and try and convince you to useinferior substitutes sothis is why and this is kind of the thisis the thing that people used to laughat me when I first published the Fiatstandard andum I think every passing day they laughless and less and less because it's nocoincidence that the same governmentthat destroys the moneyfinances dumbass scientists to tell youthat meat is bad for you and is bad forthe planet and that fossil fuels are badfor you and they're bad for the planetand that fun you know hydrocarbon fuelsare gonna boil the oceans and the carbondioxide concentration is going to ruineverythingand similarly meat you know cow fartsimagine this giant enormous planet thatis capable of handling all kinds ofthings is unable to handle cows fartingandwhether you believe in God or youbelieve in nature like imagine thisgiant ball that is going to be thrownout of whack because cows are fartingit's just so absurd the near the notionthat this is in any way taken seriouslyby anybodyum but this is the stupid world that welive in and of course it's notum I I you know havingstudied this stuff at a very high levelI used to do my PhD in sustainabledevelopment so I was one of the peoplewho believed in this garbage and I'vecome across the evidence supposedly thatis presented for it and it's just anidiotic religion there's no otherevidence for it it's just a completematter of faith and uh the only evidencefor it is just basically you have to getfunded and if you want to get funded youneed to believe this stuff if you don'tbelieve this stuff you don't get fundedso all the papers are written from thepremise from the starting premise thatCO2 is destroying the planet that thecow farts are ruining the planet thathydrocarbon fuels are ruining the planetand then they talk about inconsequentiallittle irrelevant details butum that's really how the whole thing uhworks and sothere's very littleum evidence that any serious personcould look at and see that there'sanything to it butum the financing is what drives theseconclusions and that's why I think youknow to go back to your originalquestion of whyBitcoin and meat I think those this isanother way in which those two thingscome back together because the forcesthat make you think that meat is bad andinflation is good are the forces thatum uh you know once you've beaten one ofthese then it's easy to see that this isthe analogies and the similarities tosnap out of the programming with theother one so that's why I thinkum you see this becoming it seems forFiat people it seems weird that all ofthose people want to eat meat and theywant to consume those hydrocarbon fuelsand they want to use Bitcoin but what'sreally weird is all of these masses ofidiots who have been brainwashed intoeating garbage using inflationary moneyand thinking in that they can Thrive andsurvive using pre-industrial technologybut all really when it comes to Fuelsuh the the key point is that we can'thave all the nice things that we havetoday we can't have computers andinternet and cell phones andum surviving winter and functionalinfrastructure all of these nice thingsthat we have that we take for grantedthat are the reasons why our lifeexpectancy is high and the reasons whysurviving winter is no longer such adramatic ordealare because all these things are becauseof hydrocarbon fuels this is what makesour Modern Life possible in life withouthydrocarbon fuels is a return tobarbaric primitivism and that's no funthat's the only realistic alternativeandum you're being gaslit into believingelse while solar lit should be therethe the term because they want to getrid of the gas so we're not going to beable to Gaslight but it's going to beflickering solar light you're gonnayou're being told that the solution tofixing the weather is for you to justeat cheap stuff that doesn't suffer thatdoesn'tumget inflated heavily because it'sindustrial and easy for us to produceeat and consume uh essentially fuellesssources of energy that are uhthat are basically not practical for ourmodern technology you can't have youcan't run a modern company on solar andwind you know like apple and Amazon liketo Virtue signal about this stuff but uhthey say they're 100 carbon not neutralit's they just buy forests andthen they consider that buying theseforests is uh substituting for theircarbon uh but they have to they have toemit carbon you can't run anything inAmazon or Google or Apple withoutreliable 24-hourhigh power energy high high densitypower this is just the only way that wecan have any nice things in lifedo you think that are you optimisticthat we can pull back from the brink ofthese incorrect ESG narratives wokismplant-based advocacy or do you thinkthere's just too much critical massthere at some pointI mean I don't know I don't really havea crystal ball so I can't really tellhow things are going to unfold in thefuture in this regardum I think my only reason for optimismis Bitcoin Bitcoin is the only way thatI'm optimistic the only reason that I'moptimistic because Bitcoin is apractical solution to those problems ifit wasn't for Bitcoin we'd have to beout there evangelizing and trying toconvince people andthat's just a thankless desk I rememberwhen I was a gold bug when I used tothink that gold was the answer it wasimpossible and it was frustrating and itwas depressing and uh dispiriting anddemoralizing because it relies on havingto convince morons and morons don't wantto be convinced morons want what's easyand the great thing about Bitcoin isthat it doesn't rely on convincinganybody Bitcoin Works regardless ofwhatever anybody else thinks and so itcontinues to work it continues toappreciate continues to get strongerand it continues to offer you a way outof clown World it continues to offer youa way to maintain your wealth and toprevent others from robbing youand most importantly to prevent yourwealth from being robbed to financeclown worldand so I think it's going to be reallydown to bitcoin to save us it's going tobe the the whole Bitcoin carnivore thingis going to be more than just a funnyinternet meme because you know the waythings are goingyou look at how inflationary money isgoing we're headed towards the CentralBank digital currency system where allof your purchases are going to bedetermined by government policy and sothe way that they're going to befighting inflation and this is kind ofthe conclusion of the Fiat standard thefinal chapter is the way that they'regoing to be fighting inflation if the1970s were any guide the way that theyfight inflation is by teaching you tohave fun staying poor basicallyand with Central Bank digital currenciesthey're going to be able to do that alot better so they've had 50 years ofpropaganda trying to prep you up for theidea that you shouldn't eat meat andthat you shouldn't consume uh oil andgaswhen they have their Central Bankdigital currencythey're going to bethey don't need to convince you anymorethey're just going to ration thesethings so means it's not going to beexpensive but you're only going to get300 grams of meat a month or somethinglike thatand oil is going to be cheap but you'reonly allowed to drive for you know threehours a month or something like thatyeah and so that's how they're going tobe fighting inflation and then in thatkind of world the only way that you'regoing to be able to afford the modernfuels and the only way they're going tobe able to afford meat is Bitcoinumyes it I think about like the Fiat worldand it almost has just created all thesederivatives of product like further awayfrom productivity it's like there almostneeds to be this return to like thebasis of productivity in the forms offood and fuel so that people canactually people who own Bitcoin canactually access the food and fuel thatthey want to use to live you knowwhatever lifestyle that they're going tobe living butum I guess my question to you is oncecbdc has become a thing do you thinkthat's a trapdoor that people are goingto be able to get out of once that youknow once they start living in that sortof Sims World ofelectronic government-backed moneyI don't know I think the only way out isgoing to be Bitcoin andumI think the longer you take to get outtheworse off you'll be because you'll beable to exchange your umFiat cbdc's for less and less satoshisthat's what it really comes down toso it's it's sort of similar to theissue we were discussing earlier interms of getting people off of foodoff of crap food like for the vastmajority of them they won't want tochange untilthey got really sickand similarly I think with moneyunfortunately it's uh individuals areonly going to change whenit becomes really really reallyuncomfortable and umwho knows what different people's paintolerance isit's been an interesting experimentthese past few years seeing where peopleare willing to kind of draw the Line inthe Sandyeah a lot of people still haven't putany lines anywhere they will just bendover and take whatever is given to themdo you think that there's almost goingto be like uh two fractions of tribes ofyou know One Tribe that's in these hugeUrban cities that is using cbdc they'reprobably eating fake meat Commoditiesand kind of just going along with whatthe government is telling them and thenanother Camp of people that are probablyin the Bitcoin Camp they care aboutdefense and eating animal protein and inthese like smaller communities do youkind of see that Divergence I definitelysee that that's kind of the conclusionof the Fiat standard that I think we'reheading towards a system of essentiallyFinancial apartheid the if you stay inThe Matrix basically you get to live ina tiny little pod and you're constantlytold to not leave your house because ofvarious viruses and illnesses and umclimate change or whatever stupidnonsense you know all of these uhpseudosciences are going to be used asexcuses to stop you from uh consumingFuel and consuming real food you canhave your kibble delivered to youum while you are on zoom and uh livingin virtual reality all day you know inthe metaverse so and remember like thethe key thing to understand aboutinflation and this is Michael Saylor hesays this you know inflation is a matrixit's a vector it's not a it's not a onenumber there's no inflation of threepercent or seven percent inflation is adifferent number for every single goodand these Goods aren't all the same sofor the for things that can be produceddigitally inflation is always negativefor them you know every year data getscheaper every year uh hard drives getcheaper computer screens get cheaperum things that are well computer screensare not digital they're industrial thethings that are industrial also getcheaper or get expensive only a tinylittle bit you know your laptop ischeaper this year than it was last yearyour TV all these things slightly getget slightly cheaper digital Goods getthe cheapestthe um Electronics get uh cheap a littlebit industrial things uh get you know uhapproximately zero minus two plus twoplus three plus five something like thatand then you get into the natural Goodsthe things that involve human time thethings that involve natural processesthat can't be rushed like food you knowgrazing cows you can't just press abutton and graze a cow these thingsdon'tum these things go up in price thesethings don't decline in priceso the challenge for the Fiatauthorities is to move you away from thethings that go up in price toward thethings that don't go up in price that'swhere these lockdowns are going to bevery useful because you don't need fuelfuel is a difficult thing to make so theprice of fuel isn't uh isn't going to godown significantly because you can'tjust you know click a button and there'sa very extensive infrastructure thatneeds to be used for it so you need toconsume less fuel you need to eat lessmeat you need to eat more kibble everyprocessed garbage and consume moredigital experiences so instead of takingyour car to drive somewhere so you canclimb a mountain just stay home wear aheadset and get to experience themountain at home instead of havingrelationships with human beings that yougo and see stay home and get on themetaverse and talk to them while theywear fancy avatars and you know whoneeds real people anyway just look atthe actual Avatar it's much betterand so I think this is where we're goinglike your electricity consumption isgoing to be reduced massively whenyou're living in a tiny space especiallyif all these tiny spaces and smallapartments and big buildings that's avery low cost for heatingso and thenum you are experiencing life through ascreen that's very that's relativelylittle energy consumption as opposed togoing out and actually doing stuffand then you're eating heavily processedindustrial kibble which is very cheap sothis is the this is where the Fiat worldis going this is how we can maintainFiat without hyperinflation that's theway that this is going to succeed andthis is the way that you know how areyou going to retire on your bonds whenyour bonds are getting wiped out all thetime and their value and the value ofthe currency is getting wiped out wellyou can retire on your bonds if you'restuck in a tiny little podand you know you'll be happy becauseyou're saving the Earth you're fixingthe weatherum so you know if you believe that goodluck to you but if you don't believethat then yeah you're gonna have Bitcoinand you're gonna be out there and you'regoing to get sunshine on your face andyou're gonna eat real meat and you'regonna burn glorious hydrocarbon fuelsand guess what it's not gonna do jack to the weather because you are notEarth's thermostat you can't control theEarth whether you can't control the sealevels you're an insignificant tinylittlefourth on Earth you are not affectingthe Earth and so live your own lifeI love it I love where we've gotten towith this conversation we touched on alot of the topics in your book the Fiatstandard which I think is a phenomenalread and um I just want to thank youagain for coming on because you've had ahuge impact on us and just sort ofinspired us to start making thosechanges I mean seriously when I was uhreading the Bitcoin standard I was stillworking nine-to-five job andum once I saw Bitcoin there was kind ofno going back towards like you know whatI what I saw through your work so Iappreciate what you're doing sirappreciate it thank you so much forhaving me appreciate it thank you guysawesome[Music]",
