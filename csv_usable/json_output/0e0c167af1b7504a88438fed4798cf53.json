  "text": "(Balaji) And people might say; oh my God.Well that'll kill pure science.You have to make it all accessible and sort of like\nlook at vegetation, look at three blue, one brown.Look at some of these science channels on YouTube.There's an audience for it.And actually, there's a fairly well-heeled audience\nthat wants to learn about this stuff.You could actually monetize your teaching now,\nfor example, and use that to fund research.Basically, a lot of these open\nfunding models will probably write a whole.I just went through several of them right there.(Alex) Hey guys! Alex here.This is episode two of the DeSci podcast\nand it's a special one.Balaji Srinivasan is an angel investortech founder and author of The Network State.Formerly, he's the CTO of Coinbase\nand general partner at Andreessen Horowitzand he's also an early investor in many successful\ntech companies and crypto protocols.Balaji was the co-founder of earn.com\nacquired by Coinbase.Council acquired by Myriad Teleport,\nacquired by Topia and Coin Center.He holds a B.S., M.S.and Ph.D.in electrical engineering and an MS in chemical\nengineering from Stanford University.I'm also happy to be joined by Vincent Weisser,\nwho's chief of product at Molecule and Vita DAO.Today we spoke about scientific progress,\nthe future of human optimism,the helical theory of history\nand how to make predictions.Hope you enjoy.Yeah, so why don't we do that?You know for many, I think you need no introduction\nbut for the sake of anyoneI guess I'd say on Indoctrinated.Why don't you give yourself a quick intro,plug the book before we get into all the all\nthe juicy stuff and we'll be off to the races.(Balaji) Sure.So how's my audio? Good. \n(Alex) Sounds great.(Balaji) Great. Okay, good.So I am.My name is Balaji Srinivasan.I am https://twitter.com/balajis and balajis.com .I am the former CTOof Coinbase, former general partner\nat Andreessen Horowitz.In a prior life, I was a career academic.I taught computer science and stats at Stanford\ncoming Ph.D at Stanford.I mentioned that much less nowadays simply\nbecause I'm so bearish on academiaand I kind of think that that era is ending\nand the new eraof decentralized academia, decentralized media,\ndecentralized science is beginning.And we can get into that when we talk today.I have a new book that just came outcalled The Network State,\nand it's at thenetworkslate.com.It actually intersects with many of these things\nbecause the way that the nation statejustifies itself is it says that everything\nit's doing because of science.Right? Quote unquote, science.And you know, as I get to,\nthere's a huge difference between sciencein the sense of Maxwell's equations\nwhich are independently reproducedand quote unquote, science in the sense\nof just peer reviewed publicationswhich are often not independently reproduced\nor even reproducible.And mimics the form, the journal publication,\nthe citation and the prestige and so on.Without the substance which is the ability\nto do an independent replication.And this core differencebetween quote unquote science and actual science.And one of the things I actually think about\nand I talk about is it's actually only one thingIt's more prestigious than science.\nYou know, that is.(Alex) No. \n(Balaji) Math.I know that sounds almost trivial,\nbut we don't normally think of them as opposed.Right.You know, the king and the queen of like stem.The dark get our stem.Science and how could you have math? Butone way of thinkingabout it is crypto\neconomics is based fundamentally on math.It is based on the fact thatwe can go and download the Bitcoin blockchainand run a bunch of mathematical computations\nto verify all the past transactions.Same with the Ethereum blockchain.And that's differentthan academic economics\nwhich claims to be based on science.Where it has got into this realm\nwhere you cannot verify everything.All right.And it's become the sort of priesthood,\nthis prestigious priesthood.And as I'll get to,\nI think many of the concepts behind,you know, the difference in crypto economics and,\nyou know, legacy economics or fiateconomics can be applied to, you know,\ncrypto information versus fiat information.Are you taking some non reproducible thing\non faith, on the assertion,the fiat, you know, like a state\nor of some state associated institution?Or is it crypto in the sense\nthat the data set, the calculations,the code, everything can be downloaded\nand reproduced locally.And this, by the way, is areturn to these topics. Butit's a long running strand in Western culturethat when the centralized thing is ossifiedand it is unresponsive,\nyou break the glass and you decentralize.That's what Martin Luther did when he penned the,\nyou know,95 theses to the door of the church in 1517\nsaying the Catholic Church from ossifiedactually faith through comes just through the Bible\nand this wasyou think of as a theological thing\nbut it is also a political thing where he wasdecentralizing power away\nfrom the church to individualsand of course, began a whole conflict over\nwho has authority or what have you.But that is what crypto is doing.It's decentralizing that power, that verification\nwho has the authorityto say what's true away from the government,\naway from the Federal Reserve?And now I would argue away from academia\nand to the individualwith their computer or their mobile phone\nwho can run the calculations for themselves.So the networks need actually, I have to add more.You know, I've got the V1 out there.That's how I think of it right?I have the director's cut coming\nwhere I've got a bunch of stuffon this kind of topic, like what\nI call the Ledger of Record on Regulation and so on.And those are like 50 or 100 page chapters\nthat I kept out.But by the time it's done it will be quite long.But I think it'll be of interest to a lot of people.\nAll right.So let me pause there.That's a book.It's free online, thenetworkstate.com\nYou can also get a PDF in Latin if you want thatand you can get it on Kindle.We'll do a hardcover audible.\nBut but you can go there.If you subscribe you'll get free chapters Bible\nlessons.It’s all free online.Okay. Go ahead.(Alex) Excited for the hardcover, by the way.Always a big fan.\nNo, just excited for the hardcover.(Balaji) Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah.We're going to try and make it a work of art,\nI think.I think the online version is pretty decent,\nbut we can improve if you have feedback.But we gonna try to make the hardcover\nlook really like a mantelpiece kind of thing.(Alex) Love it.All right.So to start us off at sort of a macro levelhere, you know, given as you mentioned\nyou're pretty robust academic foundations that.Yes, MS Ph.D. trifecta from Stanford.(Balaji) I also have an MS in chemical engineering\nfor what that's where it so like so I have a.So anyway so I just I've been acting\nyour way too long, so I know a little bit about it.Go ahead. \n(Alex) More than the trifecta, then.I think you'd have an interesting research\nperspective here.What do you think are the key factors\nholding back scientific progress globally?I think the entireVannevar Bush thing of centralizing research aroundand after the time of World War 2 has run it course.And so I think the fundamental thing holding back\nscientific progress globally is the choke point.That is, the U.S. government.And what I mean by that is, you know, you often seepeople say:\nOh, basic research has to be federally funded.What about, you know, the Internet\nand the human genome and so on and so forth?And it is true that there's been some great stuff\nthat's come out of what I callthe centralized research establishment.But Basho has this concept of seen and unseen.And there's this concept also of crowding out.So all of these funds that were appropriated\nand centralized with the federal government,all the research so centralized there,\nthere's a certain school of thought that comes whereit's grants and it's papers.There's choke points that happen.And if you if you seen there's a graph\nthat Carlson has postedthat I've also posted a while ago which shows\nthat the same cohort that started receivingNIH grants has basically just aged\nlike roughly one year per.Do you know about the graph I'm talking about,\nyou might be able to show it. Okay.it's, you know, NIH.See if I can find it.NIH grant recipients.Yeah, here it is. It's kind of like.It's this.This gets gives a concept.So if yougo into that and you scroll down a little bit,\nyou see thatthe fiscal year, the blue in the red thing\nthere. Right.Basically, as the years go by.That, you know, mode of the bell curvejust shifts over roughly one year at a time.And so it's like the same cohort of people\nwho are on each others grant committeesthat are warning them stem cell stuff.And they're just sort of aging with it.It's very political centralized process\nthat is ossifying alongwith much of the rest of Western civilization\nwhere you see, you know, Top Gun Infinity,you see, you know, like 70sometimes 80 year old politicians, you know.Patrick Carlson actually had thistweet just a little while agoand see if I could find it,\nwhich shows that this the case for movies.this is the case for... Oh, here we are.(Alex) We'll put these links in the show notes\nfor anyone to listening on audio.Yeah. Here you go.So take a look at that one. See that.Look at those two graphics.And the first oneshows that like, you know, movies with leads,you know, less than 30 years\nold were very common in the 90s and 2000.They are incredibly uncommon today.And now 60 year old.Why is that?Because people are like, oh, Marilyn, America.I was like better.And, you know, they want they want Tom Cruise.They want this this proven stars.But those guys are aging.You know, you go the next graphic\nand you can just see like the age of NIHinvestigators has dropped off.And you have that saying like which is,you know,\nit's like science advances one funeral at a time.If you've heard that like it's verylike obviously it'svery cynical, but it's also true in the sense\nthat often things are not,you know, people the old guard doesn't\nwant to retract something or want to give in.But when they're no longer there to fight it, then\nlike there can be progress that's made, you know.And so to your question,that centralization, the one thing that happens is\nyou'll get people like, you know, MarianaMoscato or others who will say, oh,\nall innovation is due to the state.And, you know, what about DARPA?Why don't you givethanks the great glory of the state for,\nyou know, taking and taxing all the money from youand then dribbling it back a little bit back to you\nin the form of research dollars.And the thing about this is,\nif you go a little further backobviously much of mathematics\nand physics was discovered before NSF existed.You know, like Maxwell's\nequations was not NSF funded.You know, and neither was Newton.There are if you go further back in time in fact.You know thermodynamics and fiscal mechanics\ncame out of experimentsand the empiricism of steam engines\nlike the engineering drove the science.And there, you know, there's these huge industries\nof railroads and aviation and automobiles,which obviously involve quite a lot of science,\nbut also a lot of engineering that managed to arisewithout something like the kind of federal research\nestablishment that we have.I'm not saying there wasn't some federal\nfunding for railroads and stuff like that,but fundamentally the thing was more decentralized.The reputation system was decentralized.The funding system was decentralized.By the time the so-called gentleman science\nwhere people would get independently wealthyand tinker and putter around with stuff\nin the will publish sort of for each other.Right now today that actually sort of coming back\nwith open sourcewith the fact that people can putter\nand they can try things outand they can share the results online\nand they can even do so anonymouslyAnd it's not just gentleman\nbut gentleman and gentle pseudonym science.Like the https://project-evidence.github.ioor Satoshi Nakamoto’s whitepaper.Those are things which, you know,\nthey're now very highly cited at least certainly theyou know the Satoshi Nakamoto Bitcoin whitepaper\nwas very highly cited in traditional academia.It's probably not the kind of thing\nthat you could easily get publishedin traditional academia\nbecause it spans many disciplines.It is not thought of as a good concept.But he could put it out on the internet.And https://project-evidence.github.io/\nthat's now almost conventional wisdom.I tweeted about thislike in March, April 2020\nwhich was basically evidencefor lab leak thesis\nwhen that was highly controversial.Oh, my God. Conspiracy theory.Now, it's almost conventional wisdom right nowthat basically it's\npolitically useful is almost commercialism.But it's not so much that the facts have changed.The trail in some ways has gone colder.So to your question,\nthe key factor is centralizationand that might have actually\nhad some benefits. Okay,in some senseduring that period, to me have also been in a sense\ninevitable.1950 was arguably peak centralization.I talk about this in the network book.You'll get one telephone company in two superpowers\nand three television stations.You know, AT&T, right?You know the U.S.and the USSR.So one telephone company, AT&T,\ntwo superpowers, the U.S.and USSR, three television stations, CBS, ABC, NBC.That was highly an apparently centralized.You had these massive empires, the Soviet empire,\nthe Chinese, like everything, is just massivelycentralized into these Geiger states\nand really under the U.S..And you saw that the third world was, you know,\nthose parts that weren't, you know, like being wheresome of them were actually actively fought over,\nbut they were not combatants themselves.And this degree of centralization\nwas actually very atypical.If you go backwards and forwards in time.So this whole thing of the centralized\nscientific infrastructure that we think ofas just a fact of nature\nactually arose within living memory.You know, it might be older people,\nyou know, but it's if you're 80 something years old,you were around\nbefore this whole thing was basically set up.And so we need to actually not just get rid of that.We need to transition away from it\ngradually and transition into something else.And so then it gets to, I think your next question.(Alex) Right, which is, you know, in that same vein,let's suspend our disbelief for a minute\nand pretend you had full control.Right. We're playing God here a little bit.How would you change that legacy research\nand funding structure?So this is like,\nyou know the NIH budget is actually pretty large.It's several billion dollars a year.You know, much of this is now starting\nto be taken over by people doing kill fellowshiplike things and getting academics out to kind of\njust go and dotech startups.So several different things.First isI think it's somewhat framed incorrectlyand I'll just kind of contest a little bit\nthe framing of the question which is,it's all about like“How would you allow India to flourish\nif you were in control of the BritishRaj in 1940 something?” Right now\nmy answer is I free India, right?I let India be free and I'd let them you know, goand build up their own country\nand do it independently, right?And so if given full control,\nI would give up full control.Okay. And how how would we do that?Essentially what you want to do is shatterthe entire thing into many different\nfunding sources.You know likethe thing about this is.Are you going to be able to break NIH this way?You're not. Right?I don't actually.It's almost like not a very useful lecture.But I do think just like I don't believe\nyou can abolish the Fed like Ron Paul wanted that.I do believe you can exit the Fed. Okay?And NIH is a giant jobs program.And, you know,\nNSF is also basically like this but smaller.And the thing about it is\nall these people are paid uslab techs that are basically doing the job\nthat a pipetting robot should be doing.You know,\nall of this stuff is almost like artisanal science.Where, why is it not reproducible?Lots of bench science should be a program\nthat is run by essentially something like,you know, digital or analog microfluidics\nor a pipetting robot.And it should not be run by a human.There should be much much more effort\non bringing downcost, increasing reproducibility,\nincreasing automation.The fact that we have had this huge subsidy\nfor like the, you know, 40 something postdocwho is basically like a pipette, you know, ispart of which has inhibited laboratory automation.I would argue because the the imperative isn't there\nquite as much.You have these people who are sort ofpromised academic jobs and dangled in front of them\nthat status and independence payoff.And they basically never get there.And they're embittered and they're adjuncts\nor whatever for the rest of their life.And that whole thing\nwhere you're kind of dangling something at the endwhere the pipeline doesn't really fit is,\nI think something that's reaching end of life.And so what are the kinds of things\nthat you should fund?Not perhaps, you know,\nI don't think it'll be within academia.I think it's going to be outside of academia.I think it's going to be like crypto science,\ndecentralized science where we pool capitaland fun things.What do you fund?You basically fund independent investigatorsand you fund relatively low cost.You know, maybe it's like one, two, three years.And unlike the traditional academia,\nyou don't have to write a grantwhere basically everything is done beforehand,\nyou know.Traditional academia,you know, when you write a grant about some receptor\npeople are so skepticalthat unless you've actually done the science already\nand you show it there, so you end up.Kind of saying: Oh, I'm going to do something\nthat you've already have done.And really the grant is for the stuff\nyou haven't done yet, right?And then that gets put forward.So instead of doing something like that,\njust go to a much more honest VC/startup model.You can do something like the Thiel Fellowship\nwhere you fund somebody for anybody.I might be interested in doing this myself,\nyou know,not too distant future\nand we'll test it and see if it works.But the concept is you find somebody who's smart\nand young, they're interested in something.I funded somebody recently\nwho's working on artificial wombs.I funded people,so a woman who is interested in doing that\nbecause she’s passionate about infertility issues.And I think that's an important\nthing to work on as well.I funded peoplewho are basically doing the sort of one off things\nthat you probablywouldn't get funding for an academic\nor to crazy or too innovative or what have you.And I think that what you dois you give people like maybe a 1\nto 3 years of funding, okay?And it's usually like one person\nor maybe like a very small group.And they're trying to do the basic science\nand prove it out.And then if it works\ntheir technological fire catches,then they start a company\nor they turn that into a company, okay?And if it doesn't, then like you eitherfind somebody who wants to continue the funding\nor they shut it downor they, you know, like figure out some wayof funding it from like selling\nNFT is or something like that.These are new models that are now available, right?And every job at some point\nhas some sales component.You just don't get money for free.In academia, it's a grants mechanism.But once you're in an open world\nand you can get moneyfrom basically anybody, not just academia.Guys like Andrew Human or David Sinclair,\nthey're kind of like pioneers here.They're starting to like monetize in public.The scientists influencer\nwho do you have to explain your work?This whole point of publication,\nif you also devote some of thatto making kind of cool videos online,\nexplain the social importance of it.That's good.And people might say; oh my God.Well that’ll kill pure science.You have to make it all accessible and sort of like\nlook at vegetation, look at three blue, one brown.Look at some of these science channels on YouTube.There’s an audience for it.And actually, there’s a fairly well-heeled audience\nthat wants to learn about this stuff.You could actually monetize your teaching now.For example use that to fund research.Basically, a lot of these open\nfunding models will probably write a wholeI just went through several of them\nright there. But just to recap,you can set up a company and get it funded.You can try to do crypto style funding,whether it's design, crowdfunding\nor it's NFT or some combination thereof.You can become like a science influencer\nand get subscriptions.And like Veritas, you and others are showing\nthis actually much larger market.You could even set up like job dashboards\nand stuff on your page.If you're like a physicist,then you know, the kinds of people are reading\nyour blog or the reading your publicationsare going to disproportionately be people\nwho are have skillsthat others want to employ or others want to find.And so it separates.There is bunch of different ways\nof kind of doing science outside of academia.And so how do you change the funding structure?I would look for outside academia\nfunding, decentralized funding and fortunate.Those things are coming online. (Alex) Gotcha.As something of a follow up\nthere, you talk about legacy media outletssort of enablement of decentralized censorship\nof cancel cultureof American empire, all of which\nI think you'd reasonably take issue with.And we can impact that a bit.But the question I have here\nis whether you think there'sa reasonable connection with academic journals,\ngating of open information.So more simply, are thereare there commonalities between the New York Times\nand nature of the scientific journal, for instance?(Balaji) Yeah, absolutely.And the thing is, academia moves\nslower than legacy media.It hasyou know,the thing is that of the pre-internetpower centers of the US like DC,\nwhich is regulation.Harvard, which I'll use as a medium for academia.Hollywood which is film.New York, which is media.DC and academia and Hollywood,you've been take years to multiple years\nto turn something around.You know,a paper or a film or especially a ruleor regulation\nthat can take multiple years to transform around.Media had a 24/7 metabolism.You know, CNN and others like metas,\nused to shipping in newspaper every single day.So they were the only legacy,you know, institution that had the same metabolismand speed of people who are deploying on Internet.So they became sort of the point of the spear\nof the establishmentagainst these tech interlopers\nwho were rising first in Silicon Valley.And now, I think a globalized. Okay. Andso legacy media basically hadthey're attacking everybody.They're attacking\nI mean every country, every movement within the U.S.everything that possibly could contest the U.S.,\nwhether it'sFrance or Hungary or China or India or Russiaor conservatives or centrist liberalsor tech people or crypto people or whatever.But there's like a new enemy every single day.And when you start actually adding all this up\nbecause like: Oh yeah.I guess they have kind of denounce\nall them, you might agree with one or two of them.You might say okay, well.Look, China is actually getting\npretty ultranationalist here.That's a real thing.But when everybody is denounced, other than like,\nyou know, the New York media establishment,everybody and even them, half of them are denouncing\nlike that's become saying we're okay.Well, everybody's bad.Maybe this guy is bad,\nyou know, or maybe these people areactually just pointing the finger\nat everybody themselves.And, you know, so legacy mediahas been more out in front in terms of pointingat some poor guy online\nwho's made a joke and driving them from their job.Academia hasn't you know, you don't have time\nto publish a paper on the metabolism of Twitter.But the connection with academia is.Academia is the slower moving streamthat the legacy media will cite if pressed. Why?Because science?Because nature, because cell, whatever. Okay.And you know, it's just a play on words.And the thing is that fundamentally,\nthis is the streamthat is supposed to determine\nwhat's true for people.What is it\ntrue? Well, it's in a peer reviewed publication.What more do you want? Okay.And so let's go and decompose that,\nbecause that's really important.It's basically the fundamental high level\nthing is thatscience is about independent\nreplication, not procedure citation.So you start there unless I can reproduce\nevery aspect of the experiment.I mean every single graph and table in the paper,\nideally nowadays with a keystroke.I do not believe the paper\nand that's actually the minimum thingbecause when a paper is released,\nit is making claims often about the physical world.There's math and stats paperswhich you can do wholly on the computer,\ncomputer science papers you can do on the computer.But those that have collected data set,you know, you can\nyou can sort of divide it as there's the analogto digital interface which is the collection\nand encoding of the data set.And then there is the process\nof taking the data set, writing codeto generate the figures and tables\nand the PDF that makes up the paper.All right.So at least the digital layer.Let's talk about that for a second.That digital layer\nshould be truly reproducible research.And you know the constant reproducible research\nperhaps,you know, John Clare Bowen and David Donohoat Stanford in the early\n2000s have taught about this for a whileare has a sweet package\nmany people have used Jupyter notebooks.Okay.And the basic concept behind\nreproducible research is you don'tjust give somebody a PDF, you give them the,\nyou know,TAR file or the source code where they can hit enter\nand they've got the local database.It could be a school light,\nit could be just a bunch of flat files, whatever.But they've got the data there and they hit enter\nand the code slurps up all those files.It makes a graphs and it generates a PDF, right?And the reason this is so important is you can see,\nyou know, people can't honestly have the wordsto describe every single parameter they used. Right?They don't really have the words\nto describe certain hacks.They did it on the data or how they cleaned it up.All of that, though, is there if you actually trace\nthrough every step of the source codeand it does something elsewhich is very useful, it trains graduate students\nbecause they can just look at the source.How do you do that figure? You can do this one.And then in a future paper that builds on this,\nyou could import that.Okay, so that's reproducible research.The next step is what I call\ntruly reproducible research, where that codeand that data and that PDF is not simply likeonline, it's on chain.Why put it on chain?Well, first is that it\ngets you outside of academic paywalls and stuff.It's actually truly public number 1. 2.it's immutable or it's very hard to mutate\nand there's a track record of it being mutated.So it's,\nyou know, the aspect of archival publishing.People are starting to pull down papers\nwhy it had this thing, which is like:Oh, they're pulling down papers finally, right?And they're like celebrating\nthe fact that they are like,you know, defacing the archives here.I'll show you this.Of course, it's always framed as excess or wiest.That's likegetting ridof harmful papers is a vital step\ntoward reestablish and trust.Nick's publisher should target articles\nthat are flawed in other ways.So they are truly 1984.Okay.And they'll just they'll basically\nyou know, go with the edge casesand then start moving in from the edge\nand moving in from the edge.And this article is not found, right?Now, If you did this in the Soviet Union,it would be obvious\nthat is like this was not a good thing.Even if it's wrong, have it out there\nso people can see that it's wrong and how it's wrongand critique it as opposed to deleting it\nand pursuing something that was quote published.So what's happeningto basically the truly repressed\nresearch will stop this from happening.Most people even know this is happening,\nthat the archives are getting silently purged.It just doesn't come up anymore in PubMed.This is very damaging to the historical record.This is why stuff like CI Hub is so good.I mean,\nyou know, you'll know that the system has been fixedwhen Satoshi Snowden, Alexandra Elbakyan\nget Nobel prizes or the equivalent.I actually think the Nobel itself is a broken prize,\nby the way.Like it's you know quote Eurocentric, right?Whatever the next prize is\nI think will be some kind ofSatoshi prize,\nsome like global, decentralized, pseudonymous prizewhere it's like awarded on chain and it's for work\nthat is reproducible and so on.I'd love to do something like that at some point.So coming back to truly research,\nthe data would be on chain.The code turn that data into the PDF\nwould be on chain and the published PDFcould either be on chain or with one.You know, enter were generated from\nthat I'm going to say on chain by the way.It could be are we even IPSF.I don't necessarily mean\nlike you literally need to start on Ethereum, right?What I mean is that you haveimmutable storage, public storage of the thing,\nright?And here's where that gets interesting.Why is that interesting?Once you start doing this for enough papersa citation becomes a function call.Because when you're citing an old paperthat you're that you actually are using directlythat analysis, you might actually be able to\njust literally use it as a function you're importingthat old paper and you're using that to generate\na graph that you're modifying in this paper.Okay.Especially for stats papers,\nespecially for bioinformatics papers,methods papers of many kinds,\ncomputer science papers, machine learning papers,a fairly large set of things can literally be used\nin exactly this way where the later version.You know for example,\nyou're doing a benchmarking here.You want to make sure that you're being fair\nto the other authors.You literally import their module\nand you function called out with your datasetand you've got that in the code\nso people can see you're not playing any shell gameswith your benchmark. Benchmarks are quite...that's a very common thing and that's like\na good example of what I'm talking about.Still, when a citation becomes a function called\nthat's possiblebecause the network of papers starts to be on chain\nand then you can start doing all these meta things.All a Google Scholar.What only Google can do Google Scholar. Why?Because all those papers are, you know, behind\nlike academic publishing sites, right?Someday\nsomebody will probably do something like CI Huband just put all this CI Hub on a blockchain\nor something like that in public.And when that happensthat's like this,you know, liberation of all of this old content.And then you can start actually back\ntracing it where the 30 papers at this paper sites,you can see them there on chain at this timestamp,\nit goes back ten papersand you can trace it all the way back.Ideally, it's like Newton or Maxwell or something.And here's the thing that you'll often find\nwhen you actually trace back the citations.Many things\nthat we think of as sort of like physical lawsare just function fits to curves.And the raw data\nthere is like five data points or whatever.In a paper in the 1930s\nor the 1800s or something like that.And then it's just kind of a\nit's like law, it's like pass down.There's a story of spinach\nand how it just like Popeye spinach,you know, helping muscles or carrots,\nhelping eyesight.These things become apocryphaland they are spread\nor picked up in scientific journals.And each guy cites somebody else.But no one actually has the original paper\nbecause it's too hard to find itand you track it all the way back.Might not say something like quite what it says,and this is particularly important\nin like medical studies.So having everything, you know, first you get\nan individual paper on chain that's still useful.It's reproducible. It's truly reproducible.And then you start getting a constellation,\na network of them,and then you start turning like citations\ninto function calls.Now, you at least have done something\nvery important, which isthe digital part of thepaper can at least be replicated\non your computer locally.You know, there's a cache.Bedford's law.You know, there's very specific tests you can run.You know, George Marsaglia\nwhen he's looking at like random numbergenerator says called like the die hard\nbattery of random number test.You can you canrun basic checks on this type of stuff for victory,\nwhich is unfortunately more common than one.I think, for faked or massaged data sets and so on.You can run consistent tests.See, are they actually getting this graph?Given these inputs, at least you can test\nwhether it's logically consistent.This is the kind of stuff that any VC associate does\nwhen evaluating a deal.They'll just try to add up the rows in the columnsto make sure that they can back out\nthe same revenue number a few different ways.You know, if not, there's often some inconsistency.Okay, sothat would be one of the things you can do\na truly reproducible research.You can at least look at the digital part.Now, what people will say is, well,\nwhat about the actual physical measurement, right?You're just taking the digital part\nand you're just trusting that.Well, I'd say two things.First is everybody doesn't have,you know, like an Illumina sequencer at their home.You don’t have highest peak at home.You don't have a incline plane.You don't have a superconducting supercollider.You don't have those things at home.We do have our computers and mobile phones\nwhich can do billions of calculations.We have RWC and other things that anybody can rent.So at least the mathematical part.Lets at least get on base with that\nwith the digital part, and we can check that.Now for the physical part.What I think you'll go to is I think eventually get\nwhat I call crypto instruments.And right now if you if you've done any genomics\nlike the file that's uploadedhas all kinds of metadata on it and used to check\nfor things like batch effects, right.Because you know, you sequence today, sequencetomorrow, sequence the next day\nand you might find that there's some spurious.You know, correlation\nwhere these samples seem to have this signaland the next day, a sample of the next signal.\nAnd you always have to correct for batch effects.It's very important to track all that metadata.With your sequencing run, which machine was it on.Which day was it on, etc.And just make sure that you're\nnot actually backing out of your sample.The machine idiosyncrasieswhich sometimes people can do a regression\nand they think it's a real signal.It's not it's actually just like,\nyou know, different machines had a slight shift inlike luminosity or whatever.And soit's already\ntypical to record on these biomedical experiments.And so what I say is you record\njust a little bit more metadatawhich are, you know, Merkle treesand Merkle roots that hashcertain pieces of the data\nto give a digital chain of custody.So now as the stuff is coming\nstreaming off the instrument before it's analyzed.Before can really be faked or messed around with\nthat is like put on chainand you know you kind of have something already with\nthis would like registered clinical trials.There's certain kinds of experiments\nthat are important enoughthat they're pre-registered\nand you know, you're doing the experimentso that whatever the results are,\nyou're going to report it and so on and so forth.So if you're doing something for publication,\nyou know, sometimes there's courtroom settingswhere people film it just to make sure their thing\nwas on the up and up, right.And the thing is, if you're basing multi-billion,sometimes multitrillion dollar decisions on a paper.You need to have like respectfor the people on the other end\nthat they are allowed to reproduceevery aspect of it all the way down\nto like the sensor data from that instrument.Otherwiseit's just a proclamation from a priesthood.It's not science.You know, if you can't reproduce it without trusting\nthe guy, you know, like you want to minimizethe amount of trust by minimizing\nthe amount of trust, by being open kimono, right?By, you know, being ashonest as one can be and distributingall of the data and so on and saying:\nSo look this is everything.Here's even the video of it.And so on and so forth.Here's the commands to rerun the experiment on your\nautomated pipe header or your high seek whatever.Like now you've at least, you know,\nyou can say what more could I have done, right?I have given you all the tools\nto reproduce the experiment.And that's one thing that rebuilds trust, not.I'm a scientist.It was a prestigious journal.I need this for my promotion.Which is basically where people are at.Because retractions are so,\nyou know, career damaging.The people don't really want to make corrections,\nthe retractions and compare this againto, like I said, the open source culture where\non a GitHub repo it's assumed even on the Linuxkernel, even on the Bitcoin repository,\nhow many open issues are there?Like without even looking?Probably dozens, if not hundreds, right?These are massive projects. Everybody depends on.Even then, people understand\ntheir works in progress.Okay, that kind of modesty\nand humility is not there in academiawhere things that are used by far fewer people\nand that are far fewer of a base to stand on,have to pretend that they are,\nyou know, from like Athena's head, like fully born.You know actually,Athena was born out of Zeus head. Sorry, I got that.I got that mistake, you know, so like thistruth is fully born and it isn't how it is, right?So putting all the pieces together,truly reproducible research means the digital part,the code, the data, the paper are on chain.When happens for multiple papers,a citation becomes a function call.Anybody can now reproduce what the paper\nand its antecedents are on their computer.They can do checks like Bedford's law,\nthey can do statistical checks.And that's a digital part in the analog\ndigital part, which are the instruments.Eventually we get crypto instruments\nthat start recording Merkle trees.Merkle roots with the other metadata\nthat they're already recording.And you start to get a digital chain of custody on\nthese papers and on our entire scientific apparatus.Now, what I've described, by the way,\nthere is a difficult but finite problem on parwith Wikipedia.I say we have to get the backfill\nof all the important papersinto truly reproducible research format,\nand then we need to have front fill being,you know, new papers that are all on chain.Okay, go ahead. I know there's a lot.(Vincent) Yeah, yeah.I'm curious like how are you saying?Like imagine all of this, like works in this field,\nlike sciencebeing upstream of most,\nlike scientific, like technological progress.How do you see it?Like in general, like scientific progress\nunfold like,do you see like machines taking over at some point\nsolving diseases?Like I would be curious, like your vision\nfor kind of like how decentralized scienceand like science broadly like will transition\nto kind of likethis age of like aggregates that are like doing moreand more of the work\nand like cloud labs and separate taking off.Like, how do you see that future unfold?(Balaji) Yeah.So one big thing is I think replication is massivelyunderestimated as a driver of the use of scienceJust as an example, likeyou guys have used tons of GitHub,\nyou know, based open source projects.What do you do?You'll download it, you'll run it.If it doesn't run on your computer.It's an ambitious project.And, you know, like how many times do you quote\nreplicate their claims?You're literally executing the software.And if it doesn't replicate or work\non your computer, it's useless.So like some, you know, software is replicated\nliterally,I don't know, millions, billions of times depending\non, you know, rails how many times, Python Djangowhatever those the replicationsin a sense being able to run it locally are massive.And once you get science as being something\nthat you can think of as a componentof your software infrastructure,\nyou know, where there's not like, here's the paperand there's like a human transducer\nthat needs to somehowpull it onto their site once\nthat's actually considered like a component of it,just like but crypto's done,\nyou know, the concept of like composable finance.Composablescience, composable science for papers\nare composable with each other.The key subroutines are composable\njust saves everybody just insane amounts of time.It's like it is completely non-linear, you know.Because you've now got a library of things.Wow, I can actually all of this work\nis being put into these artisanal papersthat are just like effectively scansof what was offline and they're not built\nfor the machine that built to the computer.Okay.So, that's like the broad concept of why\nI think this would accelerate things.And then, you know, now you asked a specific\nquestion, you want to repeat that specific question.(Vincent) Yeah.Kind of like how you see\nkind of like the most optimistic visions of cloudlabs, AGI, etc., like influence science,\nlike kind of like.(Balaji) Well, A.I..Is a friend of minewho's been very bearish on AGI and eventually\nI was able to figure out a bet with him.I was like: Okay, you agree\nthat artificial special intelligence existsand if not, general intelligence like domain\nspecific things like yes, sounds like okay.How about math?Okay.We are seeing language models\ndo all kinds of interesting simple manipulation.We're seeing things like,\nyou know, forecast of the state of PDA use.Obviously, we're seeing things like Dall-E\nand so on.Will you bet me that A.I.will start to advance math problems and get proofs\nthat we have not seen before that humans can check.Right.And he had to agree that while.Yeah.And so we're talking aboutit's like literally advancing the state of human\nknowledge with proofs that are better than one humanbecause it's a formal system. Right.Depending on the area of math\nthat you're talking about,in theoryit should just be like, you know, a search spacethrough the whole thing unless you're introducing\nsome new symbols or what have you.Obviously the machine representation\nis a non-trivial thing, but the symbolic algebrapackages and Mathematica has been working on this\nfor some time and that area exist.So some that some of the affordances\nfor the computer exist.And I actually did see something just recently,so it was like a first for A.I.math customer.It's just very recently.A new computer program has solved several\nopen problems in combinatorics and graph theory.Right?So that's pretty legit, right?Once you start gettingyou know, this is similar to the\nfor colored math problem for color map problem.Right from a long time ago, it was like\none of the first computer aided proofs, right?And it was controversial.But because, you know, could a human verify\nall those different combinationsin that amount time in theory? Yes.But the computer helped, right?Is like\nI forgot the exact same. And it was something like,gosh, I think there was a shorter proof for color\nmap theorem.Can every two map, you know, befor color map theorem states that no more than fourcolors required color the regions in absolute\nno to just regions of the same color, right?And so Apple and Haken, you know, proved it.And then, you knowthis is also proved in 2005 and in this part\nwith general purpose proving software.Okay, so coming back.A.I. advancing the state of math\npretty big deal in my view.I mean honestly in a sense like what is your ruler\nfor the progress of civilization?The progress of civilization is kind of\nhow good are you in math?I think you can think of lots of other metrics.I think the, you know, dictatorship scale\nis probably another good one,which is the amount of energy\nyou can manipulate, right?Like, you know, sub planetary\nor like solar system or whatever.But the amount of math you can do\nprobably pretty closely correlates with that.You're probably not going to be likeas a god, manipulating stars\nunless you can do a fair amount more math.We can right now. Andthis correlates with a lot of other measures\nsophistication,but also allows for who\nwhat is going to succeed us in the year 3000?Will there be humans?Could they be like, you know, A.I.enhanced humans or, you know, some some kind of formthat we can't even understand right now\nlike pure software, who knows?But if that does happen,\nthe way I think we all know.ıf it's sort of advanced in the sense\nlike the Neanderthals aren't around.Homo sapiens is the successor of what came beforeus on the various, you know, archaic hominids.And, well, we're better at math.And so that's like one ruler, right?You can say,\nbecause everything else is sort of arbitrary.They made like stones.And we have stones that reshape in a certain way.But math actually does have kind\nof an absolute ruler to it.So that's like one thought in terms\nof how you kind of measurewhat scientific progress\nlooks like over the medium to long term. AndI mean, there's more Ican talk about, but let me stop there.(Vincent) I'd be curious because like Q\nmakes this excellent point that kind of like cryptoshould be a very like technology that freedomis like closely associated with.While A.I.is more like surveillance state China likeChina doesn't like it.Kind of like the freedom properties of crypto.So do you think there's a risk thata being like a dominant driver of progress\nis a very like centralizing technologylike in the hands of like the Chinese state\nor like a DeepMind or maybe notnecessarily by nature, kind of like decentralized\nbecause like compute and talent,like there are benefits\nto having centralization there.So how do you see kind of like a\nAI unfolding on the centralizationdecentralization spectrum and the roots with this?(Balaji) It's complicated.So first thing I'd say is actually thinking of it\nas a triangle, which is CCP is, you know,like most cities with AI, BTC with decentralization\nand crypto and NYT with social.And so if you think of social, basically\nthat's not done yet.We think of social media as like mature,\nbut the metaverse is socialand then crypto is, you know,\nall of all the stuff that we're seeing here.And then the AI is robotics\nand all the stuff in the physical world.So it's like three different ways.Why those three technologies, by\nthe way, why is it not trite?Why not talk about electric carsand, you know, solar\npanels and spaceships and stuff?I love those things.Those are also cool,\nbut electric cars, supersonic aircraft,those are almost like endpoints or devices\nor inanimate,whereas AI and social and crypto are three waysto coordinate large numbers of human beings.Social and crypto, perhaps very obviously.Whether their up-down or it's markets, basically\nsocialist sort of left democracy with markets.And crypto is like, oh sorry, social is like\nleft democracy with like elections and upvotesand speech and voice and crypto is right democracywith markets and auctions and exits and so on.And then AI is actually neither left\nor right democracy but harmony like one.Okay, that's like the Chinese model underHu Jintao is like\nhow does a billion person state one.Which is a different model of aggregation\nlike the Democratic model is an electionand you pluribus and comeswith an election, you know, Kenneth Arrow\nand all the stuff in aggregation functions.The market model is let the market decide.And the model is harmony, which is slurpall this stuff into just one all seeing,\nall knowing AI God.Basically, right?And that's kind of what CCP is building this,\nthis thing that knows moreabout any human than any\nanything has ever known before.I don't know what the full implication of that is.We're just at the very early days of this.I don't want tosay I think it has to be AGI to be concerning.It's something that it just script all the dronesand hunt any dissent\nmore than anything we've ever seen,which is obviously troubling because,you know,\nit's like an unbeatable order in that sense.And if it's a bad order and an unbeatable one,\nthat could be bad.You know, if it's a good order.A good order can turn bad over time, you know,\nso it's pretty complicated now with that.So first, identifying as to try the other thing.I'd say is crypto can be sort of corruptedor repurposed for centralization with the CBDS\nand so on.But A.I.can also of course\nbe decentralized with federated machine learning.Or if you're seeing, you know, there's\nknockoffs of Dall-E 2 and other things that happenvery quickly, you know, they're not as good,\nbut they very quickly get out there.And moreover, these models are difficult to train\nbut as you know relatively cheap to evaluate.And so they're literally just bags of coefficients.And probably in the fullness of time,\nthey'll either getreverse engineered or hacked or something like that.Once it's known that it's possible,you know, it's probably possible\nfor other people to catch up.I don't I'm not sure how defensiblethose things are, especially with like the one shot\nstar, four zero shot stuff.Like the whole point is that you don't need\nas much data to train or would have it right.So we will see, you know,\nso that's like the second is decentralized A.I.and there's also centralized crypto.Let me pause there.(Alex) Gotcha.I'd actually like to switch gears for a minute\nand just talk about how to think, right?You're pretty well known for this,\nbut how would you say you draw from historyas you have been throughout a lot of this interview\nto make predictions in technology?And what are the biggest challenges in doing that?(Balaji) Well, I meanyou know, the thing isthere's different\nthere's different ways to pull from history.And one of the things I consider\nan unsolved problem is to determinewhether a historical analogy is accurate.What I mean by that is if you analogizean RLC circuit to a spring with dashpot, okay?You get the second order\nharmonic differential equation where you can exactlyanalogize the R the agency to the spring constant\nand the dashpot and so on.Right?It's like it's just an analogy.It's a mathematical analogy where you have a second\nor differential equation that's likewhen most famous math analogies, you know, Feynman\ntalked about in the time in lectures and whatnot.And mathematical analogies are the best kindbecause there is an ice amorphous\nin between the objects here in the objects here.And maybe leading to\nthis gives you insight into these and vice versa.Historical analogies are always more fraughtbecause, you know, people will just argue:\nOh, this guy is just like Hitler or whatever, right?And everybody will feel, you know, this is like\nabout their strength of assertion on it.And so on.I do think that at some point\nwe might become smart enough that we could saylike something in between the extreme microof like an RLC circuit versus a spring induction,\nbut in the extreme macroof like a current population\nconfiguration is like a market configuration.Okay?So that is something which is not like inanimate\nobjects and it's not millions of people acrossa very long period of time, but it's like market\nmicrostructure, like market depth.So that's not millions of people,but it's often many thousands of people\nor even hundreds of thousands of people.And it's not that controversial to say, oh,this, you know, set of market dynamics,this evolution of prices, this order book over time\nlooked like this other one.Right?There's people who just like hold order\nbooks over time.And there might be certain crowd phenomena\nthat's like,oh, this guy comes in with a big sell\nand everybody gets scared.And, you know, like the liquidity leaves\nor you could have something like that.I'm sure the HFT guys have a whole menagerieof common, you know, shocks to order books.Okay.And that's a little bit\nlike an intermediate thing between,you know, the history of a circuit\nand the history of the population.It is the history of a mesoscale\nwhere you don't run the experiment enough times.They've seen exactly how this order book\nwill collapse in certain circumstances.And the mathematical analogy part becomes easierbecause in theory you could, you know,\nespecially if you had full information in every,you know, price, quantity pair in the order book,if you could map that to the new order bookand you could kind of see how similar they were,\nyou could you can make a mathematical analogy.And I think eventually it's possible that I mean,we're at the beginning of sort of digital history,\nyou know, as I mentioned in the book.And as long as we don't blow ourselves\nup, most of humanhistory actually extends into the future.And it's hard to think about it\nlike as being at the beginning of something,because we think of ourselves as like the\nculmination. We're at the beginning of something.And if that's thecase, then the ability to look at a hugenumber of humans\nis almost like molecules in a fluid and saythis state is like a certain laminar state\nor this state is a certain turbulent stateand therefore we can analogize it to previous\nperiodswould be sort of like in fluid mechanics\nmaking: Oh, this,you know, laminar flow and this is turbulent flow.And I can analogized it to what I did before.So identifying that historical analogypart like thatmapping that ice amorphous and recognizer\nas the most difficult partto convince other people of, you know, agreeing that\nthat part is the most difficult.Subject to that if you do think\nthat there's a configuration of humans todayand the reason you use configuration\nis if you almost start thinking about humans is likebilliardballs that can just like atoms smack into each otherand do various things and they'll do certain things\nunder certain circumstances.There's like configurations of humans\nthat acted in certain ways in past historythat might act in similar ways today, in a sense,you know, saying goes human nature doesn't change,\nrobot nature may change, but human nature does.Robots are getting way\nbetter. Algorithms game better.That is a new that's a new thing under the sun.But human nature doesn't.And so if you can make that analogy\nand you can find a previous configuration,you can say, well, today is like yesterday.And I talk about this somewhere in the book where I\nsay, you know, look at the macro, macro level.I can give about 30 examples, show\nthat where we're decentralizingin a way that's similar to more the early 1900slead 1800s then to 30 years ago.Like our future is our past.It's like peak centralization.1915, you go more decentralized, another direction.Okay, so that's high level.How I think about the use of historical\nanalogies. Go ahead.(Alex) Sure.Let's dig in a little bit more on that. Right?Like to what extent do you approach history\nas being cyclical?Right?I think it's John Hillis\nwho has some great writing on this.He talks about these broad historical cycles\nof centralization and decentralizationbeing created by sort of the advent of information\ntechnologies over time.Do you align with that cyclical approach to history\nin the context of technology,in the context of,\nyou know, the way you approach prediction?(Balaji) So it's funny, it's almost trivial.But basically I have this whole thing in the book\nwhere I talk about the Helix theory of history.Okay?So the linear theory is it's just a line, okay,you know, Z of T equals KT okay?We're just advancing. We're just progressing.Maybe it's some wiggles,\nbut for the most part, the arc of history is long,but it bends for its progress.And then the cyclical theory is it's\nyou know, it's a parametric curve, right?X of T equals cosT, Y of T equalssinT and you're just going around a loop\nand we just come back to where we are.And that's like the, you know, hard men create\ngood times.Good times create weak men.Women create.It's hard to create good times,\ngood demonstrate, weak man, weak man createhard times, hard times, good, strong man,\nsomething like that.Right.\nYou know, again, the you know, but again, my pointand as they talk aboutthe book, there's, you know, left, right\nand libertarian versions of that cycle.You know, left version would be the revolutionaries,\nyou know, go and push and make the revolution.And then a Stalin compromises\nit and then, you know, we're oppressed again.And then there's another revolution,\nyou know, like that.Right.And so the cycle version\nhas something to say for it.You know, one of the reasons is humans are,\nyou know, under 70 something years old.And so as things drop out of human memory onthe order of two generations,\nyou know, certain kinds of things seem to repeat.So there's like fourth turning and,\nyou know, there'sgosh, what's his name?Peter Turchin and stuff\nI think is the most quantitative look at this RayDalio, Turchin and Strauss\nand how are all worth reading for this sort ofAsimov and Psychohistory?Look at things, okay?But the way I kind of think about it is V3\nwhich is helical, right?And so now you can kind of superimpose those, right?ZFT equals KT x f(T) equals cosTYT equals sinT and now you've got a corkscrewthat's maybe going up from the origin.And there are cyclical aspects.We're also making progress in some ways\nwe're not guaranteed to do so.It's possible that spring goes flying like this.If you watch the Collapse of Civilizations podcast,\nsobering to realize that civilizationscan collapse, that our current civilization\ncould collapse, that others have beforethat in a sense,\nwe're like the guys who got to the last levelof a video game\nand we're made the most successful up to this point.I don't thinkprevious human civilizations, to our knowledge,\nhad gotten to like space travel and so on.But that may just mean that\nlike our final flame out is like really chaotic.So it's actually good to decentralize,\nto have eggs in multiplebaskets, to get to other planets.And that's what a lot of talks about,\nabout backing up humanity.One thing I actually think is underappreciated\nthat the Internet may allow us to do is actuallyencrypt humanity.And what I mean by that is\nit used to be that there was terra incognitathat say, like, here, be dragons on the map, parts\nyou didn't know about parts of world you neverand I actually think that we're at peakvisibility like right around\nnow in terms of being ableto see the faces of all the people understand\nthe earth.You never used to have something\nwhere 3 billion people could find out whatthree other billion people look like that\nlike Google images like that never happened before.People were never that visible to all other humans,you know, like very few people's\nphotos were printed.Photos are relatively unusual.People essentially were not in the panopticon\nto the extent that they are.And I think a reaction against the Chinese controlwill be the secret state, the encrypted state, wherejust the very fact that you're\na member of a digital society is not even known toanybody other than other members that in a t\nlocally with your air glasses, you can see thatthat person has the same glowing sigil that you do,\nbut it's not disclosed anybody else.That territory\nthat that building is an unmarked buildingand you basically start to encrypt the real world.And if you think about it,\nif you if you didn't have Google Maps,if you didn't have those overlays,\nif you didn't know,you wouldn't know what many buildings on the street\nwere who's in those offices or what have you.It would basically be something where, you know,\nyou couldn't open the door, you wouldn't go in.So we're sort of visibility now.And one of my I think out of the many predictionsis the re encryption and pseudonymous of the world.And why does that actually matter?Well, it's an intermediate\nbetween now and getting to Mars. Why?One of thethings Steve Jobs did within Apple is he builthe pushed secrecy, wide secrecy.So you could have multiple teams\nthat didn't know about each other,that were working on the same thing, but they were\ninnovative since they couldn't copy from each other.Right.And they didn't feel competitive with each other\nbecause didn't know about each other.So they weren't memetic. Right?They were decentralized.And Peter Thiel and Girard and so on.Talk about mimesis\na lot like basically copying people and you know,mimesis can be good in the sense that that's\nhow you learn language, that's how you learn skills.You're copying other people doing things.Copying isn't always better, but when you look at,you know, many kinds of things that people\nfight over, like famously 54, 40 or fight wasa borderor an almost border war between the US.And you know what, at the time,\nyou know, today we call Canada,it's kind of is actually Canada at the time\nor like still British Canada.But 50 or 40 year fight\nwas that the Americans wantedthe border between the US and the Northern.I think, I said is Canada is like British Canada\nor something like that.The antecedent again to to be at the 54thparallel and 40th minute or whatever\nit is with latitude.It's actually like the 49th parallel.The point is, unless the thing was mapped,people wouldn't even be able to fight over\nsomething like that.You might say, Well,\nhow could you possibly go away from maps?At one point I'd make in the book is\nwe can see the Franco-German border, right?That border, you know, the Maginot Line was Bill,\npeople invaded back and forth.It's this huge thing, militarized landmines,\nall I mean, not any more.But, you know,\nthere were all kinds of crazy stuff happening there.We can see it.People know basically who's on either side.You can go on Google Maps\nand you can kind of get a sense are you likebasically a borderline German,\na borderline French person. Butwe don't see the Twitter, Facebook border.These gigantic things,\nwhich are both individually much bigger than France.Germany\nput together, Richard, is like 300 million plus.We're 3 billion.The people who log on to Twitter\n100% of the time are all the way in Twitter land.People log into Facebook countries\nin time over here, but those folks who the twosocial networks compete over who might, let's say,\nlog in to each about 50% of their time online.I'm just using that as one metric.You might have other metrics about the borders.Those people are not known to either party.Right.There's this giant I don't know if it's 50 million\nor 10 million or if it's totally disjoint groups.We just don't know what the size of that border is.We also don't to the size of border\ngiant Facebook and TikTok.Right.But the other day, actually,\nyou know, somebody pointed outthat, you know, they're actually here.Let me see if I can find this\ntweet. They pointed out thatFacebook, Instagram wastrying to blockthe TikTok videosfrom being published.I see if I can find this.(Alex) Go for it.(Balaji) Okay.I can't find this time, but point ismade to try to block TikTok videos coming in. Right?Okay, great.We've got a heads up.(Vincent) Do you have more time or?(Balaji) No, no, no. I actually do too.So when we...(Vincent) Maybe as a last given\nour audience are kind of builders and peopleand decentralized science and you are kind of like\none of the most successful builders in the world,like having built both in the sciences in crypto,\nwhat would you recommend?Kind of like a piece of advice\nmaybe to people that want to build out.Also like some of the visions\nyou describe for this, the world of science.How should approach it?Of course, it's like the best practices\nplaybook of how to buildstart ups, etc.,\nbut it might be different for decentralized science.Like how would you in general, justas generally advice for a builder and DeSci.What would you do?(Balaji) I've got a very specific thing build\na demonstration of truly reproducible research.Take two statistics, papers\nwhere one side see the other, okay?And maybe actually use a function from the other.Have them both be on chain,maybe with the data and stuff on our weave.And just show how you did that.That would be a huge breakthrough.This focus on something very specific.Then we've got that proof technological firewhere we can show, here's a paper, here's\nanother one.It's like ARPANET\nsitting like the first packet, right?That first on chain citation as a function call\nwhere you have composablescience will be a milestone.And I think that's like a very concrete thing\nthat somebody can build.It's not really that hard to do.It's just kind of figuring out\nlike how to put the code on chain or on some data.If you want to use Solana or whatever\nthat somebody find, do it are you one.Point is use some kind ofdecentralized platform to show\nthat you can get composable science.I can get composable finance.(Alex) Awesome.I think that's just about it for us. Balaji.Appreciate the words, appreciate the time,\nappreciate the advice at the end there.1729.com thenetworkstate.com for anybody\nlooking for the buck it's great.Any final words?Are well I'm on Twitter @balajis so follow me there\nand if you do build anythingand in truly reproducible researchers\nsay which is on chain very interested in seeing it.And you're doing things that are like Molecule DAO\nI'm interested in that too.Thanks. \n(Vincent) As one last question.That direction, do you have specific\nlike recommendations for like a book or a resourcelike to dive into like the science like something\nyou would recommend you haven't recommended before?(Balaji) Oh, well, I like thePrinceton Guide to Mathematics.If you ever do have to be in solitary confinement,\nthat is a book to bring with you.That the bench press.It will be okay.All right.And there's a culvert or whatever, right. AndI think we also haveif you just subscribe at thenetworkstate.com\nI'll be pushing out a bunch of more free contentand chapters that will cover a bunch of these topics\nand have more, more references there.(Vincent) Amazing. Thanks for taking the time.Well, the pleasure.(Balaji) Thank you.(Alex) Thanks Balaji!(Balaji) Bye!(Alex) Thanks for tuning in.For more information about this podcast\nand about molecule, check out the show notes below.If you have any questions\nand want to get into a deeper discussion abouttoday's topics,\nfeel free to visit our Twitter or discord.You can find all the important links\nin the description and show notes below.Also, if you're a researcher seeking funding,\nif you want to start working in a biotech DAOor if you're an investor, please\nvisit our website molecule.to for more information.Thanks again for tuning in\nand we'll see you again soon. Bye.(Balaji) And people might say; oh my God.Well that'll kill pure science.You have to make it all accessible and sort of like\nlook at vegetation, look at three blue, one brown.Look at some of these science channels on YouTube.There's an audience for it.And actually, there's a fairly well-heeled audience\nthat wants to learn about this stuff.You could actually monetize your teaching now,\nfor example, and use that to fund research.Basically, a lot of these open\nfunding models will probably write a whole.I just went through several of them right there.(Alex) Hey guys! Alex here.This is episode two of the DeSci podcast\nand it's a special one.Balaji Srinivasan is an angel investortech founder and author of The Network State.Formerly, he's the CTO of Coinbase\nand general partner at Andreessen Horowitzand he's also an early investor in many successful\ntech companies and crypto protocols.Balaji was the co-founder of earn.com\nacquired by Coinbase.Council acquired by Myriad Teleport,\nacquired by Topia and Coin Center.He holds a B.S., M.S.and Ph.D.in electrical engineering and an MS in chemical\nengineering from Stanford University.I'm also happy to be joined by Vincent Weisser,\nwho's chief of product at Molecule and Vita DAO.Today we spoke about scientific progress,\nthe future of human optimism,the helical theory of history\nand how to make predictions.Hope you enjoy.Yeah, so why don't we do that?You know for many, I think you need no introduction\nbut for the sake of anyoneI guess I'd say on Indoctrinated.Why don't you give yourself a quick intro,plug the book before we get into all the all\nthe juicy stuff and we'll be off to the races.(Balaji) Sure.So how's my audio? Good. \n(Alex) Sounds great.(Balaji) Great. Okay, good.So I am.My name is Balaji Srinivasan.I am https://twitter.com/balajis and balajis.com .I am the former CTOof Coinbase, former general partner\nat Andreessen Horowitz.In a prior life, I was a career academic.I taught computer science and stats at Stanford\ncoming Ph.D at Stanford.I mentioned that much less nowadays simply\nbecause I'm so bearish on academiaand I kind of think that that era is ending\nand the new eraof decentralized academia, decentralized media,\ndecentralized science is beginning.And we can get into that when we talk today.I have a new book that just came outcalled The Network State,\nand it's at thenetworkslate.com.It actually intersects with many of these things\nbecause the way that the nation statejustifies itself is it says that everything\nit's doing because of science.Right? Quote unquote, science.And you know, as I get to,\nthere's a huge difference between sciencein the sense of Maxwell's equations\nwhich are independently reproducedand quote unquote, science in the sense\nof just peer reviewed publicationswhich are often not independently reproduced\nor even reproducible.And mimics the form, the journal publication,\nthe citation and the prestige and so on.Without the substance which is the ability\nto do an independent replication.And this core differencebetween quote unquote science and actual science.And one of the things I actually think about\nand I talk about is it's actually only one thingIt's more prestigious than science.\nYou know, that is.(Alex) No. \n(Balaji) Math.I know that sounds almost trivial,\nbut we don't normally think of them as opposed.Right.You know, the king and the queen of like stem.The dark get our stem.Science and how could you have math? Butone way of thinkingabout it is crypto\neconomics is based fundamentally on math.It is based on the fact thatwe can go and download the Bitcoin blockchainand run a bunch of mathematical computations\nto verify all the past transactions.Same with the Ethereum blockchain.And that's differentthan academic economics\nwhich claims to be based on science.Where it has got into this realm\nwhere you cannot verify everything.All right.And it's become the sort of priesthood,\nthis prestigious priesthood.And as I'll get to,\nI think many of the concepts behind,you know, the difference in crypto economics and,\nyou know, legacy economics or fiateconomics can be applied to, you know,\ncrypto information versus fiat information.Are you taking some non reproducible thing\non faith, on the assertion,the fiat, you know, like a state\nor of some state associated institution?Or is it crypto in the sense\nthat the data set, the calculations,the code, everything can be downloaded\nand reproduced locally.And this, by the way, is areturn to these topics. Butit's a long running strand in Western culturethat when the centralized thing is ossifiedand it is unresponsive,\nyou break the glass and you decentralize.That's what Martin Luther did when he penned the,\nyou know,95 theses to the door of the church in 1517\nsaying the Catholic Church from ossifiedactually faith through comes just through the Bible\nand this wasyou think of as a theological thing\nbut it is also a political thing where he wasdecentralizing power away\nfrom the church to individualsand of course, began a whole conflict over\nwho has authority or what have you.But that is what crypto is doing.It's decentralizing that power, that verification\nwho has the authorityto say what's true away from the government,\naway from the Federal Reserve?And now I would argue away from academia\nand to the individualwith their computer or their mobile phone\nwho can run the calculations for themselves.So the networks need actually, I have to add more.You know, I've got the V1 out there.That's how I think of it right?I have the director's cut coming\nwhere I've got a bunch of stuffon this kind of topic, like what\nI call the Ledger of Record on Regulation and so on.And those are like 50 or 100 page chapters\nthat I kept out.But by the time it's done it will be quite long.But I think it'll be of interest to a lot of people.\nAll right.So let me pause there.That's a book.It's free online, thenetworkstate.com\nYou can also get a PDF in Latin if you want thatand you can get it on Kindle.We'll do a hardcover audible.\nBut but you can go there.If you subscribe you'll get free chapters Bible\nlessons.It’s all free online.Okay. Go ahead.(Alex) Excited for the hardcover, by the way.Always a big fan.\nNo, just excited for the hardcover.(Balaji) Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah.We're going to try and make it a work of art,\nI think.I think the online version is pretty decent,\nbut we can improve if you have feedback.But we gonna try to make the hardcover\nlook really like a mantelpiece kind of thing.(Alex) Love it.All right.So to start us off at sort of a macro levelhere, you know, given as you mentioned\nyou're pretty robust academic foundations that.Yes, MS Ph.D. trifecta from Stanford.(Balaji) I also have an MS in chemical engineering\nfor what that's where it so like so I have a.So anyway so I just I've been acting\nyour way too long, so I know a little bit about it.Go ahead. \n(Alex) More than the trifecta, then.I think you'd have an interesting research\nperspective here.What do you think are the key factors\nholding back scientific progress globally?I think the entireVannevar Bush thing of centralizing research aroundand after the time of World War 2 has run it course.And so I think the fundamental thing holding back\nscientific progress globally is the choke point.That is, the U.S. government.And what I mean by that is, you know, you often seepeople say:\nOh, basic research has to be federally funded.What about, you know, the Internet\nand the human genome and so on and so forth?And it is true that there's been some great stuff\nthat's come out of what I callthe centralized research establishment.But Basho has this concept of seen and unseen.And there's this concept also of crowding out.So all of these funds that were appropriated\nand centralized with the federal government,all the research so centralized there,\nthere's a certain school of thought that comes whereit's grants and it's papers.There's choke points that happen.And if you if you seen there's a graph\nthat Carlson has postedthat I've also posted a while ago which shows\nthat the same cohort that started receivingNIH grants has basically just aged\nlike roughly one year per.Do you know about the graph I'm talking about,\nyou might be able to show it. Okay.it's, you know, NIH.See if I can find it.NIH grant recipients.Yeah, here it is. It's kind of like.It's this.This gets gives a concept.So if yougo into that and you scroll down a little bit,\nyou see thatthe fiscal year, the blue in the red thing\nthere. Right.Basically, as the years go by.That, you know, mode of the bell curvejust shifts over roughly one year at a time.And so it's like the same cohort of people\nwho are on each others grant committeesthat are warning them stem cell stuff.And they're just sort of aging with it.It's very political centralized process\nthat is ossifying alongwith much of the rest of Western civilization\nwhere you see, you know, Top Gun Infinity,you see, you know, like 70sometimes 80 year old politicians, you know.Patrick Carlson actually had thistweet just a little while agoand see if I could find it,\nwhich shows that this the case for movies.this is the case for... Oh, here we are.(Alex) We'll put these links in the show notes\nfor anyone to listening on audio.Yeah. Here you go.So take a look at that one. See that.Look at those two graphics.And the first oneshows that like, you know, movies with leads,you know, less than 30 years\nold were very common in the 90s and 2000.They are incredibly uncommon today.And now 60 year old.Why is that?Because people are like, oh, Marilyn, America.I was like better.And, you know, they want they want Tom Cruise.They want this this proven stars.But those guys are aging.You know, you go the next graphic\nand you can just see like the age of NIHinvestigators has dropped off.And you have that saying like which is,you know,\nit's like science advances one funeral at a time.If you've heard that like it's verylike obviously it'svery cynical, but it's also true in the sense\nthat often things are not,you know, people the old guard doesn't\nwant to retract something or want to give in.But when they're no longer there to fight it, then\nlike there can be progress that's made, you know.And so to your question,that centralization, the one thing that happens is\nyou'll get people like, you know, MarianaMoscato or others who will say, oh,\nall innovation is due to the state.And, you know, what about DARPA?Why don't you givethanks the great glory of the state for,\nyou know, taking and taxing all the money from youand then dribbling it back a little bit back to you\nin the form of research dollars.And the thing about this is,\nif you go a little further backobviously much of mathematics\nand physics was discovered before NSF existed.You know, like Maxwell's\nequations was not NSF funded.You know, and neither was Newton.There are if you go further back in time in fact.You know thermodynamics and fiscal mechanics\ncame out of experimentsand the empiricism of steam engines\nlike the engineering drove the science.And there, you know, there's these huge industries\nof railroads and aviation and automobiles,which obviously involve quite a lot of science,\nbut also a lot of engineering that managed to arisewithout something like the kind of federal research\nestablishment that we have.I'm not saying there wasn't some federal\nfunding for railroads and stuff like that,but fundamentally the thing was more decentralized.The reputation system was decentralized.The funding system was decentralized.By the time the so-called gentleman science\nwhere people would get independently wealthyand tinker and putter around with stuff\nin the will publish sort of for each other.Right now today that actually sort of coming back\nwith open sourcewith the fact that people can putter\nand they can try things outand they can share the results online\nand they can even do so anonymouslyAnd it's not just gentleman\nbut gentleman and gentle pseudonym science.Like the https://project-evidence.github.ioor Satoshi Nakamoto’s whitepaper.Those are things which, you know,\nthey're now very highly cited at least certainly theyou know the Satoshi Nakamoto Bitcoin whitepaper\nwas very highly cited in traditional academia.It's probably not the kind of thing\nthat you could easily get publishedin traditional academia\nbecause it spans many disciplines.It is not thought of as a good concept.But he could put it out on the internet.And https://project-evidence.github.io/\nthat's now almost conventional wisdom.I tweeted about thislike in March, April 2020\nwhich was basically evidencefor lab leak thesis\nwhen that was highly controversial.Oh, my God. Conspiracy theory.Now, it's almost conventional wisdom right nowthat basically it's\npolitically useful is almost commercialism.But it's not so much that the facts have changed.The trail in some ways has gone colder.So to your question,\nthe key factor is centralizationand that might have actually\nhad some benefits. Okay,in some senseduring that period, to me have also been in a sense\ninevitable.1950 was arguably peak centralization.I talk about this in the network book.You'll get one telephone company in two superpowers\nand three television stations.You know, AT&T, right?You know the U.S.and the USSR.So one telephone company, AT&T,\ntwo superpowers, the U.S.and USSR, three television stations, CBS, ABC, NBC.That was highly an apparently centralized.You had these massive empires, the Soviet empire,\nthe Chinese, like everything, is just massivelycentralized into these Geiger states\nand really under the U.S..And you saw that the third world was, you know,\nthose parts that weren't, you know, like being wheresome of them were actually actively fought over,\nbut they were not combatants themselves.And this degree of centralization\nwas actually very atypical.If you go backwards and forwards in time.So this whole thing of the centralized\nscientific infrastructure that we think ofas just a fact of nature\nactually arose within living memory.You know, it might be older people,\nyou know, but it's if you're 80 something years old,you were around\nbefore this whole thing was basically set up.And so we need to actually not just get rid of that.We need to transition away from it\ngradually and transition into something else.And so then it gets to, I think your next question.(Alex) Right, which is, you know, in that same vein,let's suspend our disbelief for a minute\nand pretend you had full control.Right. We're playing God here a little bit.How would you change that legacy research\nand funding structure?So this is like,\nyou know the NIH budget is actually pretty large.It's several billion dollars a year.You know, much of this is now starting\nto be taken over by people doing kill fellowshiplike things and getting academics out to kind of\njust go and dotech startups.So several different things.First isI think it's somewhat framed incorrectlyand I'll just kind of contest a little bit\nthe framing of the question which is,it's all about like“How would you allow India to flourish\nif you were in control of the BritishRaj in 1940 something?” Right now\nmy answer is I free India, right?I let India be free and I'd let them you know, goand build up their own country\nand do it independently, right?And so if given full control,\nI would give up full control.Okay. And how how would we do that?Essentially what you want to do is shatterthe entire thing into many different\nfunding sources.You know likethe thing about this is.Are you going to be able to break NIH this way?You're not. Right?I don't actually.It's almost like not a very useful lecture.But I do think just like I don't believe\nyou can abolish the Fed like Ron Paul wanted that.I do believe you can exit the Fed. Okay?And NIH is a giant jobs program.And, you know,\nNSF is also basically like this but smaller.And the thing about it is\nall these people are paid uslab techs that are basically doing the job\nthat a pipetting robot should be doing.You know,\nall of this stuff is almost like artisanal science.Where, why is it not reproducible?Lots of bench science should be a program\nthat is run by essentially something like,you know, digital or analog microfluidics\nor a pipetting robot.And it should not be run by a human.There should be much much more effort\non bringing downcost, increasing reproducibility,\nincreasing automation.The fact that we have had this huge subsidy\nfor like the, you know, 40 something postdocwho is basically like a pipette, you know, ispart of which has inhibited laboratory automation.I would argue because the the imperative isn't there\nquite as much.You have these people who are sort ofpromised academic jobs and dangled in front of them\nthat status and independence payoff.And they basically never get there.And they're embittered and they're adjuncts\nor whatever for the rest of their life.And that whole thing\nwhere you're kind of dangling something at the endwhere the pipeline doesn't really fit is,\nI think something that's reaching end of life.And so what are the kinds of things\nthat you should fund?Not perhaps, you know,\nI don't think it'll be within academia.I think it's going to be outside of academia.I think it's going to be like crypto science,\ndecentralized science where we pool capitaland fun things.What do you fund?You basically fund independent investigatorsand you fund relatively low cost.You know, maybe it's like one, two, three years.And unlike the traditional academia,\nyou don't have to write a grantwhere basically everything is done beforehand,\nyou know.Traditional academia,you know, when you write a grant about some receptor\npeople are so skepticalthat unless you've actually done the science already\nand you show it there, so you end up.Kind of saying: Oh, I'm going to do something\nthat you've already have done.And really the grant is for the stuff\nyou haven't done yet, right?And then that gets put forward.So instead of doing something like that,\njust go to a much more honest VC/startup model.You can do something like the Thiel Fellowship\nwhere you fund somebody for anybody.I might be interested in doing this myself,\nyou know,not too distant future\nand we'll test it and see if it works.But the concept is you find somebody who's smart\nand young, they're interested in something.I funded somebody recently\nwho's working on artificial wombs.I funded people,so a woman who is interested in doing that\nbecause she’s passionate about infertility issues.And I think that's an important\nthing to work on as well.I funded peoplewho are basically doing the sort of one off things\nthat you probablywouldn't get funding for an academic\nor to crazy or too innovative or what have you.And I think that what you dois you give people like maybe a 1\nto 3 years of funding, okay?And it's usually like one person\nor maybe like a very small group.And they're trying to do the basic science\nand prove it out.And then if it works\ntheir technological fire catches,then they start a company\nor they turn that into a company, okay?And if it doesn't, then like you eitherfind somebody who wants to continue the funding\nor they shut it downor they, you know, like figure out some wayof funding it from like selling\nNFT is or something like that.These are new models that are now available, right?And every job at some point\nhas some sales component.You just don't get money for free.In academia, it's a grants mechanism.But once you're in an open world\nand you can get moneyfrom basically anybody, not just academia.Guys like Andrew Human or David Sinclair,\nthey're kind of like pioneers here.They're starting to like monetize in public.The scientists influencer\nwho do you have to explain your work?This whole point of publication,\nif you also devote some of thatto making kind of cool videos online,\nexplain the social importance of it.That's good.And people might say; oh my God.Well that’ll kill pure science.You have to make it all accessible and sort of like\nlook at vegetation, look at three blue, one brown.Look at some of these science channels on YouTube.There’s an audience for it.And actually, there’s a fairly well-heeled audience\nthat wants to learn about this stuff.You could actually monetize your teaching now.For example use that to fund research.Basically, a lot of these open\nfunding models will probably write a wholeI just went through several of them\nright there. But just to recap,you can set up a company and get it funded.You can try to do crypto style funding,whether it's design, crowdfunding\nor it's NFT or some combination thereof.You can become like a science influencer\nand get subscriptions.And like Veritas, you and others are showing\nthis actually much larger market.You could even set up like job dashboards\nand stuff on your page.If you're like a physicist,then you know, the kinds of people are reading\nyour blog or the reading your publicationsare going to disproportionately be people\nwho are have skillsthat others want to employ or others want to find.And so it separates.There is bunch of different ways\nof kind of doing science outside of academia.And so how do you change the funding structure?I would look for outside academia\nfunding, decentralized funding and fortunate.Those things are coming online. (Alex) Gotcha.As something of a follow up\nthere, you talk about legacy media outletssort of enablement of decentralized censorship\nof cancel cultureof American empire, all of which\nI think you'd reasonably take issue with.And we can impact that a bit.But the question I have here\nis whether you think there'sa reasonable connection with academic journals,\ngating of open information.So more simply, are thereare there commonalities between the New York Times\nand nature of the scientific journal, for instance?(Balaji) Yeah, absolutely.And the thing is, academia moves\nslower than legacy media.It hasyou know,the thing is that of the pre-internetpower centers of the US like DC,\nwhich is regulation.Harvard, which I'll use as a medium for academia.Hollywood which is film.New York, which is media.DC and academia and Hollywood,you've been take years to multiple years\nto turn something around.You know,a paper or a film or especially a ruleor regulation\nthat can take multiple years to transform around.Media had a 24/7 metabolism.You know, CNN and others like metas,\nused to shipping in newspaper every single day.So they were the only legacy,you know, institution that had the same metabolismand speed of people who are deploying on Internet.So they became sort of the point of the spear\nof the establishmentagainst these tech interlopers\nwho were rising first in Silicon Valley.And now, I think a globalized. Okay. Andso legacy media basically hadthey're attacking everybody.They're attacking\nI mean every country, every movement within the U.S.everything that possibly could contest the U.S.,\nwhether it'sFrance or Hungary or China or India or Russiaor conservatives or centrist liberalsor tech people or crypto people or whatever.But there's like a new enemy every single day.And when you start actually adding all this up\nbecause like: Oh yeah.I guess they have kind of denounce\nall them, you might agree with one or two of them.You might say okay, well.Look, China is actually getting\npretty ultranationalist here.That's a real thing.But when everybody is denounced, other than like,\nyou know, the New York media establishment,everybody and even them, half of them are denouncing\nlike that's become saying we're okay.Well, everybody's bad.Maybe this guy is bad,\nyou know, or maybe these people areactually just pointing the finger\nat everybody themselves.And, you know, so legacy mediahas been more out in front in terms of pointingat some poor guy online\nwho's made a joke and driving them from their job.Academia hasn't you know, you don't have time\nto publish a paper on the metabolism of Twitter.But the connection with academia is.Academia is the slower moving streamthat the legacy media will cite if pressed. Why?Because science?Because nature, because cell, whatever. Okay.And you know, it's just a play on words.And the thing is that fundamentally,\nthis is the streamthat is supposed to determine\nwhat's true for people.What is it\ntrue? Well, it's in a peer reviewed publication.What more do you want? Okay.And so let's go and decompose that,\nbecause that's really important.It's basically the fundamental high level\nthing is thatscience is about independent\nreplication, not procedure citation.So you start there unless I can reproduce\nevery aspect of the experiment.I mean every single graph and table in the paper,\nideally nowadays with a keystroke.I do not believe the paper\nand that's actually the minimum thingbecause when a paper is released,\nit is making claims often about the physical world.There's math and stats paperswhich you can do wholly on the computer,\ncomputer science papers you can do on the computer.But those that have collected data set,you know, you can\nyou can sort of divide it as there's the analogto digital interface which is the collection\nand encoding of the data set.And then there is the process\nof taking the data set, writing codeto generate the figures and tables\nand the PDF that makes up the paper.All right.So at least the digital layer.Let's talk about that for a second.That digital layer\nshould be truly reproducible research.And you know the constant reproducible research\nperhaps,you know, John Clare Bowen and David Donohoat Stanford in the early\n2000s have taught about this for a whileare has a sweet package\nmany people have used Jupyter notebooks.Okay.And the basic concept behind\nreproducible research is you don'tjust give somebody a PDF, you give them the,\nyou know,TAR file or the source code where they can hit enter\nand they've got the local database.It could be a school light,\nit could be just a bunch of flat files, whatever.But they've got the data there and they hit enter\nand the code slurps up all those files.It makes a graphs and it generates a PDF, right?And the reason this is so important is you can see,\nyou know, people can't honestly have the wordsto describe every single parameter they used. Right?They don't really have the words\nto describe certain hacks.They did it on the data or how they cleaned it up.All of that, though, is there if you actually trace\nthrough every step of the source codeand it does something elsewhich is very useful, it trains graduate students\nbecause they can just look at the source.How do you do that figure? You can do this one.And then in a future paper that builds on this,\nyou could import that.Okay, so that's reproducible research.The next step is what I call\ntruly reproducible research, where that codeand that data and that PDF is not simply likeonline, it's on chain.Why put it on chain?Well, first is that it\ngets you outside of academic paywalls and stuff.It's actually truly public number 1. 2.it's immutable or it's very hard to mutate\nand there's a track record of it being mutated.So it's,\nyou know, the aspect of archival publishing.People are starting to pull down papers\nwhy it had this thing, which is like:Oh, they're pulling down papers finally, right?And they're like celebrating\nthe fact that they are like,you know, defacing the archives here.I'll show you this.Of course, it's always framed as excess or wiest.That's likegetting ridof harmful papers is a vital step\ntoward reestablish and trust.Nick's publisher should target articles\nthat are flawed in other ways.So they are truly 1984.Okay.And they'll just they'll basically\nyou know, go with the edge casesand then start moving in from the edge\nand moving in from the edge.And this article is not found, right?Now, If you did this in the Soviet Union,it would be obvious\nthat is like this was not a good thing.Even if it's wrong, have it out there\nso people can see that it's wrong and how it's wrongand critique it as opposed to deleting it\nand pursuing something that was quote published.So what's happeningto basically the truly repressed\nresearch will stop this from happening.Most people even know this is happening,\nthat the archives are getting silently purged.It just doesn't come up anymore in PubMed.This is very damaging to the historical record.This is why stuff like CI Hub is so good.I mean,\nyou know, you'll know that the system has been fixedwhen Satoshi Snowden, Alexandra Elbakyan\nget Nobel prizes or the equivalent.I actually think the Nobel itself is a broken prize,\nby the way.Like it's you know quote Eurocentric, right?Whatever the next prize is\nI think will be some kind ofSatoshi prize,\nsome like global, decentralized, pseudonymous prizewhere it's like awarded on chain and it's for work\nthat is reproducible and so on.I'd love to do something like that at some point.So coming back to truly research,\nthe data would be on chain.The code turn that data into the PDF\nwould be on chain and the published PDFcould either be on chain or with one.You know, enter were generated from\nthat I'm going to say on chain by the way.It could be are we even IPSF.I don't necessarily mean\nlike you literally need to start on Ethereum, right?What I mean is that you haveimmutable storage, public storage of the thing,\nright?And here's where that gets interesting.Why is that interesting?Once you start doing this for enough papersa citation becomes a function call.Because when you're citing an old paperthat you're that you actually are using directlythat analysis, you might actually be able to\njust literally use it as a function you're importingthat old paper and you're using that to generate\na graph that you're modifying in this paper.Okay.Especially for stats papers,\nespecially for bioinformatics papers,methods papers of many kinds,\ncomputer science papers, machine learning papers,a fairly large set of things can literally be used\nin exactly this way where the later version.You know for example,\nyou're doing a benchmarking here.You want to make sure that you're being fair\nto the other authors.You literally import their module\nand you function called out with your datasetand you've got that in the code\nso people can see you're not playing any shell gameswith your benchmark. Benchmarks are quite...that's a very common thing and that's like\na good example of what I'm talking about.Still, when a citation becomes a function called\nthat's possiblebecause the network of papers starts to be on chain\nand then you can start doing all these meta things.All a Google Scholar.What only Google can do Google Scholar. Why?Because all those papers are, you know, behind\nlike academic publishing sites, right?Someday\nsomebody will probably do something like CI Huband just put all this CI Hub on a blockchain\nor something like that in public.And when that happensthat's like this,you know, liberation of all of this old content.And then you can start actually back\ntracing it where the 30 papers at this paper sites,you can see them there on chain at this timestamp,\nit goes back ten papersand you can trace it all the way back.Ideally, it's like Newton or Maxwell or something.And here's the thing that you'll often find\nwhen you actually trace back the citations.Many things\nthat we think of as sort of like physical lawsare just function fits to curves.And the raw data\nthere is like five data points or whatever.In a paper in the 1930s\nor the 1800s or something like that.And then it's just kind of a\nit's like law, it's like pass down.There's a story of spinach\nand how it just like Popeye spinach,you know, helping muscles or carrots,\nhelping eyesight.These things become apocryphaland they are spread\nor picked up in scientific journals.And each guy cites somebody else.But no one actually has the original paper\nbecause it's too hard to find itand you track it all the way back.Might not say something like quite what it says,and this is particularly important\nin like medical studies.So having everything, you know, first you get\nan individual paper on chain that's still useful.It's reproducible. It's truly reproducible.And then you start getting a constellation,\na network of them,and then you start turning like citations\ninto function calls.Now, you at least have done something\nvery important, which isthe digital part of thepaper can at least be replicated\non your computer locally.You know, there's a cache.Bedford's law.You know, there's very specific tests you can run.You know, George Marsaglia\nwhen he's looking at like random numbergenerator says called like the die hard\nbattery of random number test.You can you canrun basic checks on this type of stuff for victory,\nwhich is unfortunately more common than one.I think, for faked or massaged data sets and so on.You can run consistent tests.See, are they actually getting this graph?Given these inputs, at least you can test\nwhether it's logically consistent.This is the kind of stuff that any VC associate does\nwhen evaluating a deal.They'll just try to add up the rows in the columnsto make sure that they can back out\nthe same revenue number a few different ways.You know, if not, there's often some inconsistency.Okay, sothat would be one of the things you can do\na truly reproducible research.You can at least look at the digital part.Now, what people will say is, well,\nwhat about the actual physical measurement, right?You're just taking the digital part\nand you're just trusting that.Well, I'd say two things.First is everybody doesn't have,you know, like an Illumina sequencer at their home.You don’t have highest peak at home.You don't have a incline plane.You don't have a superconducting supercollider.You don't have those things at home.We do have our computers and mobile phones\nwhich can do billions of calculations.We have RWC and other things that anybody can rent.So at least the mathematical part.Lets at least get on base with that\nwith the digital part, and we can check that.Now for the physical part.What I think you'll go to is I think eventually get\nwhat I call crypto instruments.And right now if you if you've done any genomics\nlike the file that's uploadedhas all kinds of metadata on it and used to check\nfor things like batch effects, right.Because you know, you sequence today, sequencetomorrow, sequence the next day\nand you might find that there's some spurious.You know, correlation\nwhere these samples seem to have this signaland the next day, a sample of the next signal.\nAnd you always have to correct for batch effects.It's very important to track all that metadata.With your sequencing run, which machine was it on.Which day was it on, etc.And just make sure that you're\nnot actually backing out of your sample.The machine idiosyncrasieswhich sometimes people can do a regression\nand they think it's a real signal.It's not it's actually just like,\nyou know, different machines had a slight shift inlike luminosity or whatever.And soit's already\ntypical to record on these biomedical experiments.And so what I say is you record\njust a little bit more metadatawhich are, you know, Merkle treesand Merkle roots that hashcertain pieces of the data\nto give a digital chain of custody.So now as the stuff is coming\nstreaming off the instrument before it's analyzed.Before can really be faked or messed around with\nthat is like put on chainand you know you kind of have something already with\nthis would like registered clinical trials.There's certain kinds of experiments\nthat are important enoughthat they're pre-registered\nand you know, you're doing the experimentso that whatever the results are,\nyou're going to report it and so on and so forth.So if you're doing something for publication,\nyou know, sometimes there's courtroom settingswhere people film it just to make sure their thing\nwas on the up and up, right.And the thing is, if you're basing multi-billion,sometimes multitrillion dollar decisions on a paper.You need to have like respectfor the people on the other end\nthat they are allowed to reproduceevery aspect of it all the way down\nto like the sensor data from that instrument.Otherwiseit's just a proclamation from a priesthood.It's not science.You know, if you can't reproduce it without trusting\nthe guy, you know, like you want to minimizethe amount of trust by minimizing\nthe amount of trust, by being open kimono, right?By, you know, being ashonest as one can be and distributingall of the data and so on and saying:\nSo look this is everything.Here's even the video of it.And so on and so forth.Here's the commands to rerun the experiment on your\nautomated pipe header or your high seek whatever.Like now you've at least, you know,\nyou can say what more could I have done, right?I have given you all the tools\nto reproduce the experiment.And that's one thing that rebuilds trust, not.I'm a scientist.It was a prestigious journal.I need this for my promotion.Which is basically where people are at.Because retractions are so,\nyou know, career damaging.The people don't really want to make corrections,\nthe retractions and compare this againto, like I said, the open source culture where\non a GitHub repo it's assumed even on the Linuxkernel, even on the Bitcoin repository,\nhow many open issues are there?Like without even looking?Probably dozens, if not hundreds, right?These are massive projects. Everybody depends on.Even then, people understand\ntheir works in progress.Okay, that kind of modesty\nand humility is not there in academiawhere things that are used by far fewer people\nand that are far fewer of a base to stand on,have to pretend that they are,\nyou know, from like Athena's head, like fully born.You know actually,Athena was born out of Zeus head. Sorry, I got that.I got that mistake, you know, so like thistruth is fully born and it isn't how it is, right?So putting all the pieces together,truly reproducible research means the digital part,the code, the data, the paper are on chain.When happens for multiple papers,a citation becomes a function call.Anybody can now reproduce what the paper\nand its antecedents are on their computer.They can do checks like Bedford's law,\nthey can do statistical checks.And that's a digital part in the analog\ndigital part, which are the instruments.Eventually we get crypto instruments\nthat start recording Merkle trees.Merkle roots with the other metadata\nthat they're already recording.And you start to get a digital chain of custody on\nthese papers and on our entire scientific apparatus.Now, what I've described, by the way,\nthere is a difficult but finite problem on parwith Wikipedia.I say we have to get the backfill\nof all the important papersinto truly reproducible research format,\nand then we need to have front fill being,you know, new papers that are all on chain.Okay, go ahead. I know there's a lot.(Vincent) Yeah, yeah.I'm curious like how are you saying?Like imagine all of this, like works in this field,\nlike sciencebeing upstream of most,\nlike scientific, like technological progress.How do you see it?Like in general, like scientific progress\nunfold like,do you see like machines taking over at some point\nsolving diseases?Like I would be curious, like your vision\nfor kind of like how decentralized scienceand like science broadly like will transition\nto kind of likethis age of like aggregates that are like doing moreand more of the work\nand like cloud labs and separate taking off.Like, how do you see that future unfold?(Balaji) Yeah.So one big thing is I think replication is massivelyunderestimated as a driver of the use of scienceJust as an example, likeyou guys have used tons of GitHub,\nyou know, based open source projects.What do you do?You'll download it, you'll run it.If it doesn't run on your computer.It's an ambitious project.And, you know, like how many times do you quote\nreplicate their claims?You're literally executing the software.And if it doesn't replicate or work\non your computer, it's useless.So like some, you know, software is replicated\nliterally,I don't know, millions, billions of times depending\non, you know, rails how many times, Python Djangowhatever those the replicationsin a sense being able to run it locally are massive.And once you get science as being something\nthat you can think of as a componentof your software infrastructure,\nyou know, where there's not like, here's the paperand there's like a human transducer\nthat needs to somehowpull it onto their site once\nthat's actually considered like a component of it,just like but crypto's done,\nyou know, the concept of like composable finance.Composablescience, composable science for papers\nare composable with each other.The key subroutines are composable\njust saves everybody just insane amounts of time.It's like it is completely non-linear, you know.Because you've now got a library of things.Wow, I can actually all of this work\nis being put into these artisanal papersthat are just like effectively scansof what was offline and they're not built\nfor the machine that built to the computer.Okay.So, that's like the broad concept of why\nI think this would accelerate things.And then, you know, now you asked a specific\nquestion, you want to repeat that specific question.(Vincent) Yeah.Kind of like how you see\nkind of like the most optimistic visions of cloudlabs, AGI, etc., like influence science,\nlike kind of like.(Balaji) Well, A.I..Is a friend of minewho's been very bearish on AGI and eventually\nI was able to figure out a bet with him.I was like: Okay, you agree\nthat artificial special intelligence existsand if not, general intelligence like domain\nspecific things like yes, sounds like okay.How about math?Okay.We are seeing language models\ndo all kinds of interesting simple manipulation.We're seeing things like,\nyou know, forecast of the state of PDA use.Obviously, we're seeing things like Dall-E\nand so on.Will you bet me that A.I.will start to advance math problems and get proofs\nthat we have not seen before that humans can check.Right.And he had to agree that while.Yeah.And so we're talking aboutit's like literally advancing the state of human\nknowledge with proofs that are better than one humanbecause it's a formal system. Right.Depending on the area of math\nthat you're talking about,in theoryit should just be like, you know, a search spacethrough the whole thing unless you're introducing\nsome new symbols or what have you.Obviously the machine representation\nis a non-trivial thing, but the symbolic algebrapackages and Mathematica has been working on this\nfor some time and that area exist.So some that some of the affordances\nfor the computer exist.And I actually did see something just recently,so it was like a first for A.I.math customer.It's just very recently.A new computer program has solved several\nopen problems in combinatorics and graph theory.Right?So that's pretty legit, right?Once you start gettingyou know, this is similar to the\nfor colored math problem for color map problem.Right from a long time ago, it was like\none of the first computer aided proofs, right?And it was controversial.But because, you know, could a human verify\nall those different combinationsin that amount time in theory? Yes.But the computer helped, right?Is like\nI forgot the exact same. And it was something like,gosh, I think there was a shorter proof for color\nmap theorem.Can every two map, you know, befor color map theorem states that no more than fourcolors required color the regions in absolute\nno to just regions of the same color, right?And so Apple and Haken, you know, proved it.And then, you knowthis is also proved in 2005 and in this part\nwith general purpose proving software.Okay, so coming back.A.I. advancing the state of math\npretty big deal in my view.I mean honestly in a sense like what is your ruler\nfor the progress of civilization?The progress of civilization is kind of\nhow good are you in math?I think you can think of lots of other metrics.I think the, you know, dictatorship scale\nis probably another good one,which is the amount of energy\nyou can manipulate, right?Like, you know, sub planetary\nor like solar system or whatever.But the amount of math you can do\nprobably pretty closely correlates with that.You're probably not going to be likeas a god, manipulating stars\nunless you can do a fair amount more math.We can right now. Andthis correlates with a lot of other measures\nsophistication,but also allows for who\nwhat is going to succeed us in the year 3000?Will there be humans?Could they be like, you know, A.I.enhanced humans or, you know, some some kind of formthat we can't even understand right now\nlike pure software, who knows?But if that does happen,\nthe way I think we all know.ıf it's sort of advanced in the sense\nlike the Neanderthals aren't around.Homo sapiens is the successor of what came beforeus on the various, you know, archaic hominids.And, well, we're better at math.And so that's like one ruler, right?You can say,\nbecause everything else is sort of arbitrary.They made like stones.And we have stones that reshape in a certain way.But math actually does have kind\nof an absolute ruler to it.So that's like one thought in terms\nof how you kind of measurewhat scientific progress\nlooks like over the medium to long term. AndI mean, there's more Ican talk about, but let me stop there.(Vincent) I'd be curious because like Q\nmakes this excellent point that kind of like cryptoshould be a very like technology that freedomis like closely associated with.While A.I.is more like surveillance state China likeChina doesn't like it.Kind of like the freedom properties of crypto.So do you think there's a risk thata being like a dominant driver of progress\nis a very like centralizing technologylike in the hands of like the Chinese state\nor like a DeepMind or maybe notnecessarily by nature, kind of like decentralized\nbecause like compute and talent,like there are benefits\nto having centralization there.So how do you see kind of like a\nAI unfolding on the centralizationdecentralization spectrum and the roots with this?(Balaji) It's complicated.So first thing I'd say is actually thinking of it\nas a triangle, which is CCP is, you know,like most cities with AI, BTC with decentralization\nand crypto and NYT with social.And so if you think of social, basically\nthat's not done yet.We think of social media as like mature,\nbut the metaverse is socialand then crypto is, you know,\nall of all the stuff that we're seeing here.And then the AI is robotics\nand all the stuff in the physical world.So it's like three different ways.Why those three technologies, by\nthe way, why is it not trite?Why not talk about electric carsand, you know, solar\npanels and spaceships and stuff?I love those things.Those are also cool,\nbut electric cars, supersonic aircraft,those are almost like endpoints or devices\nor inanimate,whereas AI and social and crypto are three waysto coordinate large numbers of human beings.Social and crypto, perhaps very obviously.Whether their up-down or it's markets, basically\nsocialist sort of left democracy with markets.And crypto is like, oh sorry, social is like\nleft democracy with like elections and upvotesand speech and voice and crypto is right democracywith markets and auctions and exits and so on.And then AI is actually neither left\nor right democracy but harmony like one.Okay, that's like the Chinese model underHu Jintao is like\nhow does a billion person state one.Which is a different model of aggregation\nlike the Democratic model is an electionand you pluribus and comeswith an election, you know, Kenneth Arrow\nand all the stuff in aggregation functions.The market model is let the market decide.And the model is harmony, which is slurpall this stuff into just one all seeing,\nall knowing AI God.Basically, right?And that's kind of what CCP is building this,\nthis thing that knows moreabout any human than any\nanything has ever known before.I don't know what the full implication of that is.We're just at the very early days of this.I don't want tosay I think it has to be AGI to be concerning.It's something that it just script all the dronesand hunt any dissent\nmore than anything we've ever seen,which is obviously troubling because,you know,\nit's like an unbeatable order in that sense.And if it's a bad order and an unbeatable one,\nthat could be bad.You know, if it's a good order.A good order can turn bad over time, you know,\nso it's pretty complicated now with that.So first, identifying as to try the other thing.I'd say is crypto can be sort of corruptedor repurposed for centralization with the CBDS\nand so on.But A.I.can also of course\nbe decentralized with federated machine learning.Or if you're seeing, you know, there's\nknockoffs of Dall-E 2 and other things that happenvery quickly, you know, they're not as good,\nbut they very quickly get out there.And moreover, these models are difficult to train\nbut as you know relatively cheap to evaluate.And so they're literally just bags of coefficients.And probably in the fullness of time,\nthey'll either getreverse engineered or hacked or something like that.Once it's known that it's possible,you know, it's probably possible\nfor other people to catch up.I don't I'm not sure how defensiblethose things are, especially with like the one shot\nstar, four zero shot stuff.Like the whole point is that you don't need\nas much data to train or would have it right.So we will see, you know,\nso that's like the second is decentralized A.I.and there's also centralized crypto.Let me pause there.(Alex) Gotcha.I'd actually like to switch gears for a minute\nand just talk about how to think, right?You're pretty well known for this,\nbut how would you say you draw from historyas you have been throughout a lot of this interview\nto make predictions in technology?And what are the biggest challenges in doing that?(Balaji) Well, I meanyou know, the thing isthere's different\nthere's different ways to pull from history.And one of the things I consider\nan unsolved problem is to determinewhether a historical analogy is accurate.What I mean by that is if you analogizean RLC circuit to a spring with dashpot, okay?You get the second order\nharmonic differential equation where you can exactlyanalogize the R the agency to the spring constant\nand the dashpot and so on.Right?It's like it's just an analogy.It's a mathematical analogy where you have a second\nor differential equation that's likewhen most famous math analogies, you know, Feynman\ntalked about in the time in lectures and whatnot.And mathematical analogies are the best kindbecause there is an ice amorphous\nin between the objects here in the objects here.And maybe leading to\nthis gives you insight into these and vice versa.Historical analogies are always more fraughtbecause, you know, people will just argue:\nOh, this guy is just like Hitler or whatever, right?And everybody will feel, you know, this is like\nabout their strength of assertion on it.And so on.I do think that at some point\nwe might become smart enough that we could saylike something in between the extreme microof like an RLC circuit versus a spring induction,\nbut in the extreme macroof like a current population\nconfiguration is like a market configuration.Okay?So that is something which is not like inanimate\nobjects and it's not millions of people acrossa very long period of time, but it's like market\nmicrostructure, like market depth.So that's not millions of people,but it's often many thousands of people\nor even hundreds of thousands of people.And it's not that controversial to say, oh,this, you know, set of market dynamics,this evolution of prices, this order book over time\nlooked like this other one.Right?There's people who just like hold order\nbooks over time.And there might be certain crowd phenomena\nthat's like,oh, this guy comes in with a big sell\nand everybody gets scared.And, you know, like the liquidity leaves\nor you could have something like that.I'm sure the HFT guys have a whole menagerieof common, you know, shocks to order books.Okay.And that's a little bit\nlike an intermediate thing between,you know, the history of a circuit\nand the history of the population.It is the history of a mesoscale\nwhere you don't run the experiment enough times.They've seen exactly how this order book\nwill collapse in certain circumstances.And the mathematical analogy part becomes easierbecause in theory you could, you know,\nespecially if you had full information in every,you know, price, quantity pair in the order book,if you could map that to the new order bookand you could kind of see how similar they were,\nyou could you can make a mathematical analogy.And I think eventually it's possible that I mean,we're at the beginning of sort of digital history,\nyou know, as I mentioned in the book.And as long as we don't blow ourselves\nup, most of humanhistory actually extends into the future.And it's hard to think about it\nlike as being at the beginning of something,because we think of ourselves as like the\nculmination. We're at the beginning of something.And if that's thecase, then the ability to look at a hugenumber of humans\nis almost like molecules in a fluid and saythis state is like a certain laminar state\nor this state is a certain turbulent stateand therefore we can analogize it to previous\nperiodswould be sort of like in fluid mechanics\nmaking: Oh, this,you know, laminar flow and this is turbulent flow.And I can analogized it to what I did before.So identifying that historical analogypart like thatmapping that ice amorphous and recognizer\nas the most difficult partto convince other people of, you know, agreeing that\nthat part is the most difficult.Subject to that if you do think\nthat there's a configuration of humans todayand the reason you use configuration\nis if you almost start thinking about humans is likebilliardballs that can just like atoms smack into each otherand do various things and they'll do certain things\nunder certain circumstances.There's like configurations of humans\nthat acted in certain ways in past historythat might act in similar ways today, in a sense,you know, saying goes human nature doesn't change,\nrobot nature may change, but human nature does.Robots are getting way\nbetter. Algorithms game better.That is a new that's a new thing under the sun.But human nature doesn't.And so if you can make that analogy\nand you can find a previous configuration,you can say, well, today is like yesterday.And I talk about this somewhere in the book where I\nsay, you know, look at the macro, macro level.I can give about 30 examples, show\nthat where we're decentralizingin a way that's similar to more the early 1900slead 1800s then to 30 years ago.Like our future is our past.It's like peak centralization.1915, you go more decentralized, another direction.Okay, so that's high level.How I think about the use of historical\nanalogies. Go ahead.(Alex) Sure.Let's dig in a little bit more on that. Right?Like to what extent do you approach history\nas being cyclical?Right?I think it's John Hillis\nwho has some great writing on this.He talks about these broad historical cycles\nof centralization and decentralizationbeing created by sort of the advent of information\ntechnologies over time.Do you align with that cyclical approach to history\nin the context of technology,in the context of,\nyou know, the way you approach prediction?(Balaji) So it's funny, it's almost trivial.But basically I have this whole thing in the book\nwhere I talk about the Helix theory of history.Okay?So the linear theory is it's just a line, okay,you know, Z of T equals KT okay?We're just advancing. We're just progressing.Maybe it's some wiggles,\nbut for the most part, the arc of history is long,but it bends for its progress.And then the cyclical theory is it's\nyou know, it's a parametric curve, right?X of T equals cosT, Y of T equalssinT and you're just going around a loop\nand we just come back to where we are.And that's like the, you know, hard men create\ngood times.Good times create weak men.Women create.It's hard to create good times,\ngood demonstrate, weak man, weak man createhard times, hard times, good, strong man,\nsomething like that.Right.\nYou know, again, the you know, but again, my pointand as they talk aboutthe book, there's, you know, left, right\nand libertarian versions of that cycle.You know, left version would be the revolutionaries,\nyou know, go and push and make the revolution.And then a Stalin compromises\nit and then, you know, we're oppressed again.And then there's another revolution,\nyou know, like that.Right.And so the cycle version\nhas something to say for it.You know, one of the reasons is humans are,\nyou know, under 70 something years old.And so as things drop out of human memory onthe order of two generations,\nyou know, certain kinds of things seem to repeat.So there's like fourth turning and,\nyou know, there'sgosh, what's his name?Peter Turchin and stuff\nI think is the most quantitative look at this RayDalio, Turchin and Strauss\nand how are all worth reading for this sort ofAsimov and Psychohistory?Look at things, okay?But the way I kind of think about it is V3\nwhich is helical, right?And so now you can kind of superimpose those, right?ZFT equals KT x f(T) equals cosTYT equals sinT and now you've got a corkscrewthat's maybe going up from the origin.And there are cyclical aspects.We're also making progress in some ways\nwe're not guaranteed to do so.It's possible that spring goes flying like this.If you watch the Collapse of Civilizations podcast,\nsobering to realize that civilizationscan collapse, that our current civilization\ncould collapse, that others have beforethat in a sense,\nwe're like the guys who got to the last levelof a video game\nand we're made the most successful up to this point.I don't thinkprevious human civilizations, to our knowledge,\nhad gotten to like space travel and so on.But that may just mean that\nlike our final flame out is like really chaotic.So it's actually good to decentralize,\nto have eggs in multiplebaskets, to get to other planets.And that's what a lot of talks about,\nabout backing up humanity.One thing I actually think is underappreciated\nthat the Internet may allow us to do is actuallyencrypt humanity.And what I mean by that is\nit used to be that there was terra incognitathat say, like, here, be dragons on the map, parts\nyou didn't know about parts of world you neverand I actually think that we're at peakvisibility like right around\nnow in terms of being ableto see the faces of all the people understand\nthe earth.You never used to have something\nwhere 3 billion people could find out whatthree other billion people look like that\nlike Google images like that never happened before.People were never that visible to all other humans,you know, like very few people's\nphotos were printed.Photos are relatively unusual.People essentially were not in the panopticon\nto the extent that they are.And I think a reaction against the Chinese controlwill be the secret state, the encrypted state, wherejust the very fact that you're\na member of a digital society is not even known toanybody other than other members that in a t\nlocally with your air glasses, you can see thatthat person has the same glowing sigil that you do,\nbut it's not disclosed anybody else.That territory\nthat that building is an unmarked buildingand you basically start to encrypt the real world.And if you think about it,\nif you if you didn't have Google Maps,if you didn't have those overlays,\nif you didn't know,you wouldn't know what many buildings on the street\nwere who's in those offices or what have you.It would basically be something where, you know,\nyou couldn't open the door, you wouldn't go in.So we're sort of visibility now.And one of my I think out of the many predictionsis the re encryption and pseudonymous of the world.And why does that actually matter?Well, it's an intermediate\nbetween now and getting to Mars. Why?One of thethings Steve Jobs did within Apple is he builthe pushed secrecy, wide secrecy.So you could have multiple teams\nthat didn't know about each other,that were working on the same thing, but they were\ninnovative since they couldn't copy from each other.Right.And they didn't feel competitive with each other\nbecause didn't know about each other.So they weren't memetic. Right?They were decentralized.And Peter Thiel and Girard and so on.Talk about mimesis\na lot like basically copying people and you know,mimesis can be good in the sense that that's\nhow you learn language, that's how you learn skills.You're copying other people doing things.Copying isn't always better, but when you look at,you know, many kinds of things that people\nfight over, like famously 54, 40 or fight wasa borderor an almost border war between the US.And you know what, at the time,\nyou know, today we call Canada,it's kind of is actually Canada at the time\nor like still British Canada.But 50 or 40 year fight\nwas that the Americans wantedthe border between the US and the Northern.I think, I said is Canada is like British Canada\nor something like that.The antecedent again to to be at the 54thparallel and 40th minute or whatever\nit is with latitude.It's actually like the 49th parallel.The point is, unless the thing was mapped,people wouldn't even be able to fight over\nsomething like that.You might say, Well,\nhow could you possibly go away from maps?At one point I'd make in the book is\nwe can see the Franco-German border, right?That border, you know, the Maginot Line was Bill,\npeople invaded back and forth.It's this huge thing, militarized landmines,\nall I mean, not any more.But, you know,\nthere were all kinds of crazy stuff happening there.We can see it.People know basically who's on either side.You can go on Google Maps\nand you can kind of get a sense are you likebasically a borderline German,\na borderline French person. Butwe don't see the Twitter, Facebook border.These gigantic things,\nwhich are both individually much bigger than France.Germany\nput together, Richard, is like 300 million plus.We're 3 billion.The people who log on to Twitter\n100% of the time are all the way in Twitter land.People log into Facebook countries\nin time over here, but those folks who the twosocial networks compete over who might, let's say,\nlog in to each about 50% of their time online.I'm just using that as one metric.You might have other metrics about the borders.Those people are not known to either party.Right.There's this giant I don't know if it's 50 million\nor 10 million or if it's totally disjoint groups.We just don't know what the size of that border is.We also don't to the size of border\ngiant Facebook and TikTok.Right.But the other day, actually,\nyou know, somebody pointed outthat, you know, they're actually here.Let me see if I can find this\ntweet. They pointed out thatFacebook, Instagram wastrying to blockthe TikTok videosfrom being published.I see if I can find this.(Alex) Go for it.(Balaji) Okay.I can't find this time, but point ismade to try to block TikTok videos coming in. Right?Okay, great.We've got a heads up.(Vincent) Do you have more time or?(Balaji) No, no, no. I actually do too.So when we...(Vincent) Maybe as a last given\nour audience are kind of builders and peopleand decentralized science and you are kind of like\none of the most successful builders in the world,like having built both in the sciences in crypto,\nwhat would you recommend?Kind of like a piece of advice\nmaybe to people that want to build out.Also like some of the visions\nyou describe for this, the world of science.How should approach it?Of course, it's like the best practices\nplaybook of how to buildstart ups, etc.,\nbut it might be different for decentralized science.Like how would you in general, justas generally advice for a builder and DeSci.What would you do?(Balaji) I've got a very specific thing build\na demonstration of truly reproducible research.Take two statistics, papers\nwhere one side see the other, okay?And maybe actually use a function from the other.Have them both be on chain,maybe with the data and stuff on our weave.And just show how you did that.That would be a huge breakthrough.This focus on something very specific.Then we've got that proof technological firewhere we can show, here's a paper, here's\nanother one.It's like ARPANET\nsitting like the first packet, right?That first on chain citation as a function call\nwhere you have composablescience will be a milestone.And I think that's like a very concrete thing\nthat somebody can build.It's not really that hard to do.It's just kind of figuring out\nlike how to put the code on chain or on some data.If you want to use Solana or whatever\nthat somebody find, do it are you one.Point is use some kind ofdecentralized platform to show\nthat you can get composable science.I can get composable finance.(Alex) Awesome.I think that's just about it for us. Balaji.Appreciate the words, appreciate the time,\nappreciate the advice at the end there.1729.com thenetworkstate.com for anybody\nlooking for the buck it's great.Any final words?Are well I'm on Twitter @balajis so follow me there\nand if you do build anythingand in truly reproducible researchers\nsay which is on chain very interested in seeing it.And you're doing things that are like Molecule DAO\nI'm interested in that too.Thanks. \n(Vincent) As one last question.That direction, do you have specific\nlike recommendations for like a book or a resourcelike to dive into like the science like something\nyou would recommend you haven't recommended before?(Balaji) Oh, well, I like thePrinceton Guide to Mathematics.If you ever do have to be in solitary confinement,\nthat is a book to bring with you.That the bench press.It will be okay.All right.And there's a culvert or whatever, right. AndI think we also haveif you just subscribe at thenetworkstate.com\nI'll be pushing out a bunch of more free contentand chapters that will cover a bunch of these topics\nand have more, more references there.(Vincent) Amazing.
