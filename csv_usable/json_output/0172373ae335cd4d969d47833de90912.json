fact manyof us in the free market movement orhard money movement which say thatprofessor hayek is definitely theworld's greatest living economistit's aparticular pleasure for me to be heredoing the interview personally becauseprofessor hayek had a great influence onmy uhearlyunderstand the free market system andhow it works and my read of hiswork since then since then have heavilyinfluencedmyunderstanding of free market economicset cetera so it's a pleasure to be hereand i'd like to ask you a professor myfirst questioni wonder ifthe since our audienceis mainly interested or at least verygreatly interested in the theory ofmoney and how it affects theirinvestments etci wonder if we could talk for a minuteabout how money evolvedwithoutthethe help of governments into and inpresent times it seems very much thehindrance of money from governmentinterference umcarl minger talked about the evolutionof money as a sort of a naturalphenomenon umhow did money come about and what'shappened today to to mess up things somuch see the great trouble is the moneywasn't allowed to develop further aftertwo or three hundred years of coins allgovernments put their hands and stoppedany further developments you are notallowed toexperiment on it money hasn't beenimproved moneyhas rather become worse in the course oftimebecause unlikely you refer to meand it's quite truesaid menger and before him hume andmandevillemadelawlanguagemoney the threeparadigmsof spontaneously grown institutionsnow fortunatelylaw and language have been allowed todevelopmoney has originated in the originalform but as soon as it was there in itsmost primitive form it was frozengovernment said it must not develop andreferand what we have had since indevelopment where matters of governmentinventions mostly around mostly abusesof moneyand i have come to the position ofasking has monetary policy ever done anygood i don't think it has i think it hasdone only harm and that's why i am nowpleadingfor what i've called denationalizationof moneynot in this booki hope i will live long enough afterthinking on this book to add anotherbook on money which is very awesome butit's a moment whymoral issues seem to be more importanteven than the monetary problems and morefundamental yes i would agree but tostick on the money subject just for aminute i'll never forget uh it was atour conference the national committeefor military reform conference inlausanne switzerland at the beautifulbaravaj hotel where you first introducedthis theory of competition in currenciesin an excellent speech that was verywell received and since has been printedinto a pamphlet form and then aminiaturethan a smallbook we earlier before when we werechatting i showed you that in the uhrecent edition of fortune magazine evenfortune magazine has picked up ondiscussing thisthis controversial uh theory ofcompetition of currencies uh let me askyou how do youhow do you think that it would uh workwould would the major banks such aschase manhattan issue currencies or orwould there be gold coins issued or howare theyno i still believe that my original planis rightbut i'm afraid i've come to theconclusion that political is completelyutopiangovernments will never allowand even bankers do not understand theiridea because bankers have all grown upin the system in which they are socompletely dependenton central banks government institutionsas lenders of last resultthat after manyexperimentsthere's hardly a banker who willunderstand even what i am arguingso i may not be revealing half a secretiam devising a roundabout wayuh[Music]after all in the modern worldhand to hand moneycoinsand paper is no as the most importantuh credits and credit cardsor substituteswhere the governments can stop peoplefrom issuing moneythey can hardly stop them from openingaccounts in somethingunless introduce a complete system ofexchange controlexcept as i said before i do not expectthat any bank will understand itbut the other people who are suitablefor itmy hope is nowis that one of the big dealers in thelaw materialswe prepare to open accountswhich we really redeemin so much of current mannersit's unnecessary to buy this list of lawmaterialsonly in the form of accounts right whichit pays outin whatever currencies are only neededor in any currency enough to buy thisvista for almost 10 minuteswhich will make hisunitcall itthe solidthese standard units are never beingused in circulationpeople very soon begin to keep theiraccounts and so it's the only thingwhich is trustworthyit's also a thing where many people cancompetemost of them will probably choose thesame list if one of the big man hasstarted this right others will imitateitso i think we can forget about existingmoney and existing banks and we gladlyopen a system of accounts which willdisplace money ah that is that's that'sa fascinating concept maybe the unit oneday will be known as the hikeuhon continuing on just for a minute uh onthe money issue it occurs to me that thefundamental uh flaw in uh friedman'stheory of monetary controlis becoming more and more evident todaywe have electronic transfer of money wehave credit card money we havecomplicatedcomputerized analysis of the moneysupply yet but uhin spite and because of these things thefederal authorities are even admittingthat they don't even know what the moneysupply is they can't put their finger onit so how how in the world could youhave a a theory based on a tightdefinition of increasing the moneysupply at a particular rate which variesfrom time to time if you don't know whatthat what the fundamental money supplyisyou know about 40 years ago i once wrotea sentence something like thisone of the worst things which couldhappenwould beif mankind ever forgot the quantity ofmoneyexcept they should never take itliterallyand that's why i still believeit is truethat the price level is determined fromthe quantity of money but we never knowwhat the quantity of money in this senseisi think so who ought to bebut whatever issues the money must adaptthe quantity so that the price levelwill remain stablebut to believe that there's a measurablemagnitudewhich you can keep constant withbeneficial effects either the guy wascompletely wrong i agree with when iwill add you see i don't likecriticizing me freedom not only becausean old friend because outside monetarywe are in complete agreementour general view on what is desirablewhat is notwas almost identical till we get on tomoney but if i told him what i mentionedbeforethati very much doubtwhether monetary policy has ever doneanything goodhe personally is convinced that a goodmonetary policy foundation will work foreverything wellit's uh it certainly leads to my nextquestion that is in light of thethe total mismanagement of money bygovernments government control overmoney in the central banksin light of thisthethird world debt crisis the huge buildupof loans at last count there wassomething on the order of 600 billiondollars loaned to the third worldcountries in light of this uhterrible situation still beingcontrolled areat least the central banks claim to becontrolling itin light of all that what do you thinkis the outcome for the third world debtcrisis as it's being called but what doyou see is the outcomei don't knowif you are very luckyi thought you should be as luckywe may get through itwithout eithera resumption of inflationornew controls being clapped oni don't quite see how it can be done buti still hope it may be donebutthe only good thing ihopeto see is that people are becomingsomewhere aware that the presentmonetary system is not reallysatisfactorythat we will have toconsider veryfundamental reformi don't think anybody is yet going farenoughi must sympathize with the people whowould like to return to the goldstandardi wish it were possible i am personallyconvinced it cannot be done for tworeasonsa is a gold standardpresupposes certain dogmatic beliefswhich cannot be actually justifiedand our present generation is notpreparedto re-adoptbeliefs which we hold traditions andhave been discreditedbut even more stillsi believe that any returnany attempt to return to goldwould lead to such fluctuations in thevalue of gold that for that reason itwould break downso although much sympathize with thegold standard peoplei don't believe that is a possible wayi think in the long runonlymuch more radical proposalhow we get over that from the transitionperiod i don't know it's certainly adifficult question it seems to me thatuh that your solution um or some type ofsolution that gets money back to astableof evaluation so people can trust moneyis is absolutely fundamental to thesurvival of a free western civilizationand and what's umdiscouraging is that as you say thelikelihood of adapting your very veryradical proposal is probablyonly very very slight at least at thistime and thenon the other side the idea of returningto any sort of gold standard i agreewith you doesn't seem to be politicallyfeasible and if we continue in thepresent situation with these massive uhbudget deficits uh and continuation ofuh inflation it seems to meum um that that the the only outlookseems to be for a continuation of thestatus quo ups and downs but basicallylong-term currency depreciation whichmeansuh i hesitate to speak about because itinvolves another frightfully importantproblem which i have been muchinterested which i haven't studied soquestion of the supposednecessary help to the underdevelopedcountriesnow i believesome such help of the peoplebut i have argued 40 years ago thatought to be taken not in the form ofgovernment to government helpbut the form of private investmentgovernments only coming in in the formof guaranteeingfree repaymentofcapital and the returns of suchinvestmentsthat i argued hugely enoughnot with regards to the undevelopedcountries with regards the first rarehelp of the united states to europe ithink the same principleto the underdeveloped countriesi don't thinkgovernments also give a penny to othergovernmentsthey can help private enterprisebyguaranteeing against political riskswhich essentially involves a problem orfree transferof returns and capitalthere you couldexercise a very considerable pressurebecause it would stop giving suchguarantee to any country has failedbeforehand rightthatand that seems to be the root of theproblem becauseit looks like most of these third worldcountrieseven the larger countries with a sizableeconomic base and a huge amount ofnatural resources like brazil will bewe will really find it impossible to torepay these debts at least in the shortterm another level is basically one morethingeffective help can only begiven if it'saccording to the sensibility of thepolitical systemthis distinction governments cannot makebut private industry can i agree agreedbut since we have this system that imean this system that isn't working wellnowuh and it in in theit looks like if you examine thefundamentals that the long-term uhoutlooks tends to be for more and morecurrency depreciation i know that thatumumludwig von mises once said a trickylittle quote he said government is theonly agency that can take a usefulcommodity like paper slap some ink on itand make it totally worthless uh yesindeed it seems like to me examining thefundamentals that that's probably thelonger term outlook it but that's mypersonal uh uhidea of how the scenario develop nobodyknows for sure but in general withoutgetting into all the specifics i know wedon't really have time now but do yousee the future as being more and moreinflation and currency depreciation ordo you think that we could have amassive depression because of thegovernment's mismanagement of moneymany of the things havein last two years moved very much betterthan i hopedthat uh particularly in england mrthatcherwould be able to bring inflation down aswell as she has doneand same to some extent in americais very encouragingif they can bring down inflation to zeroand stay therei think theposition of the leading countries can besavedbut i'm not sure that means the positionof their banks can be savedthey are not only no longer mainlydependent on the economy of their owncountryandwelli have nightmares about the possiblebanking crisis but i don't like to talkabout it because i haven't studiedcurrently as sufficiency many of the ourum attendees that come to ourconferences uhand have been coming to our conferencesfor years tend to beahead of their time at least they havefor the last 10 years in the sense thattheygo contrary to uh to current investmentthinkinguh andsay years and years ago one of the firstgroups of investors to understand thatin periods of long-term currencydepreciation gold is a good investmentand they own the little gold as a hedgein the same way europeans have for yearsuh todayall ofour attendees are asking themselves thequestion re-examining their case forgolddo you really think in light of thepresent trends uhthat you could say for the long termholdinguh which would you would governmentpaper money be a better long-termholdingour goal certainly no i mean a wholedifferent issue is the investment issuefrom the what is desirable as money imyself i can't sayi invest in a large scaling goal but myultimate results are gold coins of acertain number i mean everything shouldgowrong that would be something but thatdoesn't mean it's a good money becausethis is a long-term situationdoesn't securing the lease that amoney would be stable in the short termi think in the present situation wouldbe very unstable manit it i think particularly so because ofthechance that the price of gold could goup dramatically in price or they couldgo it could drop dramatically as it hasin the last several monthsdo you uh have have you been readingabout and does the does the the hugesize of the u.s budget deficits uhyou know i just read today's uh heraldtribune that uhthat the u.s presidenttheu.s budget deficit is going to be over200 billion for fiscal 83 and it's therewas an interesting i don't know if yousaw the little clipping on this but thepresident reagan uh had a commissionstudy the deficit problem governmentdebt problem the grace commission it wascalled and they came up with some prettyshocking predictions that the deficitcould grow to three four five hundredbillion dollars and even toward the endof the century over a trillion dollarswhat what what impact would this have onthe u.s dollar in foreign exchangemarkets and these would be other realnot not other but real goods andservicessit downdramaticallyyeahwell all the more need for uhyour sound uhmonetary reformi don't believe that we should ever havea good money againbefore we take the thing out of thehands of government and then we can'ttake themviolently out of the hands of thegovernment all we can do is by someon the pathway introduce something shecan't stop umwhat do you think is the major problemor major threat to western civilizationon a very fundamental question is it isit do you fear uh or do you think themain problem or threat to westernfree uh civilization isuh a third world war uh a confrontationbetween the soviet union the unitedstates are the economic and politicalarea now the main danger is pacifismuh[Music]that the west may be so in become soinferior in powerthat one russian threat after anotherwill force it to go into direction whichit doesn't wanti do not believe in the danger of anatomic warat least i don't think it will break upwhich break out between the major powerswhether if mr qaddafi gets an atomicbomb for somebodythat might cause that for effectsbut i think both sides areintelligent enoughto use it as a threat but not actuallyto use it in the end i would say atomicwar was not a war it's the end ofcivilization nothing elsebut the dangerof russia becoming so much strongeras by her friendsforcing the westnot only to make concession to her butmodify its own system on the russianside is a very very serious oneand a maximum not in the expectationthat i ever use my arms that's the onlywayto be able to say when the actionsdemand something newi don't think the russians will befoolish enough to begin a war againstthe strong opponentsso you would favor the uh the the re-armlimitof uh the united states uh that reaganhas proposed and that and the deploymentof cruise missiles in europe that typeof thing certainlycan judge the strategic importance myimpression of this is absolutelyessentialand i'm great galan particularly by theeuropean pacifist movements yesi believe you knew the lord john maynardkeynesand actually taught with him uh at thesame university did you not well itaught at his university while he wasadvising governmentsee the mylondon school of economics was evacuatedto cambridge for the whole warappearanceand keynes got new homes in his collegebut he was most of the time advisinggovernment so we met only occasionallyon weekends we are personally very goodfriendsyou have not seen my 100thbirthday article in the economist abouthim i did see that and i was going toask you about that that was reprintedquite a lot and passed around in freemarket circles in the united states thatwas very interesting umdo you think that many of his ideas weresound but yetthey were misused because in his lateryears and i may be incorrect in this i'mcertainly not a scholar but in lateryears i believe he wrote thatabout grave concern that some of hisideas that he had come up with werebeing misused by governmentswhen he had the illusionthat little inflation is good much notyou know he was one of the cleverest mani knewbut he was not really a very competenteconomist at allhe had strong intuitions which sometimeswere rightand strong convictionthat he could get anycould get over any theory which heinvented to justify his particularrecommendationsuh he was in a way a great man but idon't think he was a great economist ithink that maybe he was a great investori've heard that he was a very excellentinvestor from time to time he had majorlosses but i read in an article theother day that uh in recent papers thatcame out about himthat in the 1930s he made60 times his money in the stock marketuh well i have to qualify it slightlyand i can quote him literallyhe confessed to mewhen he speculated in currency i wentback burke and it turned to commoditiesnot stock markets i madei think half a million pounds thenthat's fascinating that was a tremendoussame amount for his college yeah thatwas a tremendous amount of money he musthave made two million pounds in thepre-war uh pound values oh that's thatwas that thati i also read in this article that hewas uh that he was a contrarian in thesense that he would look and see whatwas the the uhuhthe predominant opinion of all theestablishment investment advisors andbankers and then go do the exactopposite but they didn't know this storybut it sounds very much likeprofessor hayek thank you it's it's beena pleasure and an honor to be here uhat the university for this interview i'dlike to say to our audience todaythatprofessor hayek has had his famous bookthe road to serfdom translated into 15languagesand latest one believe it or not andhere it is right here it's beentranslated into of all things russian soall we need to do is find a way to getseveral million of these into the sovietunion and i think we'd be a lot betteroff but i think that is fascinating andi think it's a a real commentary on theimportance ofof professor heights ideas to the futureof western civilizationwithouta true understanding of freedom and howimportantnon-intervention is and without athorough understanding of hayek'sconcept of spontaneous order as opposedto today's system wheremankind seems destined to repeat themistakes of the past and try to inflictan artificial socialist orderon mankind if that type of policiescontinuethen we are in for some very very bleaktimes indeedbut as we mentioned today in theinterview there's some very encouragingsigns and i would ask everybody heretodayto make give serious consideration todonating some money each year some ofyour profits in your business are yourinvestments each year to the spread ofprofessors hayek's ideas and other freemarket economist ideas at the variousinstitutes in the united states andabroadthank youyou",
