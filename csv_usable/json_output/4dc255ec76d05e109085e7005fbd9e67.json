  "text": "what's up man it's uh good to bespeaking with you again it's as we werejust mentioning it's been a while over ayear it's been just about a year it'sit's been a while it's been a while yeahit's great great to be here great to betalking to you man I always always enjoyour conversations yeah me too and uhwe've talked you know when we gettogether we talk about a lot ofdifferent things but uhthe last year or not even last year thelast six months I guess has been veryinteresting in the world of gnoster andyou know we can definitely talk aboutwhatever we want to here today but oneof the main reasons I wanted to have youon is because I've been likepretty away from all sorts of socialmedia lately I just as we were just kindof reflecting on our lifestyles it'sjust increased increasingly lessimportant or like it's less relevantwhen we have all the things that we werediscussing and um but when I do go onthere especially on Noster I see a lotof you just being super excited aboutwhat's happening in Noster what you'rebuilding in Noster and so I figured youknow for me to kind of make up for fornot paying attention for the last sixmonths uh I could have a chat with youand you can get me up to speed soum maybe I mean maybe for people thatyou know don't know you can justintroduce you know who you are and whatyou do and then we'll break into thespecifics of what's going on inaustraland perfect uh okay so yeah so umyeah my name is Paulo I'm uh a developerI've been pretty much a developer mywhole lifeum always very excited about about opensource software and and the what whattechnology can do for Freedom it's asomething that has always interested mevery very much uh and I'm from Argentinawhich I I think in in very many in manyways it has shaped how I see uh softwareand how I say technologyum and yeah now I leaveum a world schooling life so I I travelthe world with with my family uh wedon't travel like every two weeks orsomething but but yeah we try to go tobeautiful places with beautifulcommunities that that we can integratewith and I got into Bitcoin maybe yeah afew years agoum around 2017 uh I was absolutelyenamored and it took a long time for meto understand Bitcoin to understand whyit's different from all these otherthingsum I I think my my orange peelingJourney took probably around three yearsof listening to Stefan Rivera mainlybecause I went yeah I was into Austrianeconomics way before Bitcoin like I readHuman Action in 2006 way way way beforeI ever heard of Bitcoin so I understoodall that part but it took me listeningto Stefan uh to make the connectionbetween Austrian economics and Bitcoin II haven't seen it and until that andwhen I started hearing him uh I Ithought why how is this related uh butlike now it's obvious butit's super interesting when you are verydeep in in one thing that you lose alittle bit of perspective well I thinkthat's the case with a lot of theso-called libertarian and cap Austrianfolks you know andthis is a very biased sort of uhperspective because it's just basicallybased on Twitter and some of my meatspace interactions but it does seem thatthere's some kind of like you said somekind of blockage for a lot of that crowdlike maybe they're too deep in someaspect of that that they can'tI don't know they can't see the logic orthey they can't see the validity of ofwhat Bitcoin represents and they end upkind of missing it which is ironicbecauseBitcoin is kind of like the distillationof that philosophy in form and it's soweird that that would be a group thatthat doesn't get it immediatelyI think it'slibertarian Theory applied to somethingright rightum yeah I I I tend to think that thereare a couple of things I I think creeptill like all the coins have doneuh enormous enormous harm to theunderstanding of Bitcoin and theconfusion that that they bring whichpretty much captures us all right it'svery strange to meet someone whounderstands really understands Bitcoinwithout having gone through through acheat code phaseum and on the other hand I think thatyou have the effect of people that havebeen thinking about these politicalproblems uh and they cannot see aneconomical solution that completelyinvalidates politics which is whatBitcoin does right there is nogovernance in Bitcoinum but they've just beenum bitching pretty much about the sizeof government and asking for politicalsolutions to diminish the size ofgovernment and those Solutions willnever never never yield results but it'shard to it's hard to reassess I thinkchanging your mind is one of the is oneof the life skills that are very hard toconquer that you have to continuouslywork on uh but it requires a lot of uhuh humbleness yeah absolutely you knowand that that crowd is also they'reclutching their gold bars too and youknow they're so invested both likementally and financially in that beingat least a big part of their supposedsolution and I think you know itdisincentivizes them or causes them tomaybe Miss what's really going on inBitcoinum but so when did you were you inArgentina when you got Bitcoin or hadyou already been like moving around nono it's funny because uh in 200 uh 2011or 12 I I so I was living in Virginia inBlacksburg uh and I decided I decided tostart a company and I said okay I'mgonna move back to Argentina because ofyou know cheapish Labor uh but skilledTippy slaver and and I'm just going toyeah create this company so it startedgoing kind of well I I created my teamgot within one year of starting thecompany it was a team of 15 people thatI hired I was like no investment nonothing it was just me and and then abunch of people that I started hiringand and then the the income for mycompany was in in the states my companywas registered in Delaware and and topay salaries I would have to either geta wire transfer from the states toArgentinaget 50 of the funds confiscated by thebankimmediately and then how to prove viapaperwork how to prove that it's notmoney laundering that is you know it'sall it's all uh cool with that with thatwith that cash so obviously I did neverdid that because why would I so insteadof what I started doing is buying tothis to the states every two or threemonths buying a bunch of iPhones thencrossing the border with the iPhonesjust glued to my body what like yeahyeah like my chest my back my legseverywhere iPhones uh and thenso but like wouldn't they see that insecurity you go through the metaldetector no no no nono no so that's the thing II in in States with just the the iPhonesin my backpack right like no worries butthen this is all allegedly I'm notconfessing to any crimes here this iswhat someone might dobut then when you go to get yoursuitcases and all that stuff I wouldjust go to the um to the bathroom andthen put all the iPhones all over theplace or when you exit in Argentina whenyou when I exited in Argentina that'sright so then when New York CityArgentina you have to drop into like theX-ray machine the all the bags and allthat stuff but there is no x-ray machinefor you as a personyou knowum so that's that was what I was sayingand then it's just when you go toWindows when I get to Buenos Aires Iwill just sell all the iPhones Adambrutal premiumum and use that to pay summaries youmean at a at a discountoh no no no iPhone no no I would botheroh there's a huge markup because no onecan get iPhones into the country like oh maybe you can make money on doingit this way I would make money so so thethe markup would usually pay for my tripback and forth and the lodging for acouple of days wow umoh it's absolutely insane but see thisis the kind of thing that people arepushed to do when they are stupididiotic regulations I I did not want todo this stuff like I wanted to work onmaking my business better uh but I hadto I had to pay these these tax if youwill of having to do these stupid thingsto get around this regulationumobviously if I had known Bitcoin that'ssolved my use case I didn't know aboutBitcoin at the time I wish I hadum but but yeah no I I left Argentina in2013 again uh because I I left Argentinain 2001 and then I went back for to makethis company then inflation killed mycompany and I moved to Boston to startsomething differentand and that yeahthe the first one I was like a superidiotic idea uh the first one was mythesis was that cloud computing wasgoing to make starting companies veryeasy uh very simple which is is it isthe case uh especially starting you knowlike support companies but themaintenance of running databases andrunning your your Apache server or anykind of server that you run uh was notgoing to scale at the same time becauseuh because of labor cost so my my compthe idea of my company was I'm going toprovide like the cloud part uh of the ofthat human laboruh which was a bad idea because at theend of the day technologyum moved in the direction where youdon't need uh see like devops and peoplemanaging your databases on a regularbasis uh especially doing maintenanceand stuff like that so the thesis wasboard my company didn't die because ofthesis was working it was it diedbecause of inflation and how didinflation kill it specifically like youjust oh well I just could not pay withsalaries like the the income that I wasreceiving was not growing at the same uhPace to keep up with inflation soum I had to pay a number of salaries inpesos and the pesos were the number ofpesos that I would have to pay for theemployees to you know have like keeptheir their their uh life uh standardsthat number was going growing way fasterthan I could uh increase Revenue indollars but it's but you're not talkingabout like in a minimum wage sort ofthing you just mean they would oh no nono no no I was paying I mean no no Imean I mean you're not you're not beingforced to pay more and therefore can'tafford it you're just saying youcouldn't keep up with wage inflation isthat what you meanyeah yeah it's not that I was I wasn'table to meet like a regulatory level orsomething but you I needed to pay anamount like a salary that my employeeswould be able to have a regular liferight rightumI mean by the way it's a it's a it's agood example I I think back then in twoand 2011-ish I was paying aroundmaybe I can't remember the exact numbermaybe it was like 5 000 pesos or or 8000 pesos or something something likethatright now that number 5000 pesos you goand buy cookies with that rightum and it used to be a normal salarylike a good salary for an engineercan I ask you this like so I I went toArgentina in2003 I think or fourum and like you know Argentina has kindof had a long history of being aneconomic and financial Basket Case rightlike several defaults and inflationepisodes that kind of stuff I know thisis probably a difficult question toanswer and obviously they all share thesame fate to some degree and everyone'smoronic and all that kind of stuff butwhy Argentina specifically is likeamongst the worst in terms of managingcurrency and economic policy and stufflike that do you have any insight onthat that's a really hard questionum the the theory that pops to mind isthat uh ArgentinaBrazilians are going to love theseargentinians tend to think of themselvesas very superior to the rest of LatinAmericaum so there is a lot I mean buenos ideasused to be called the parties of theParis yeah of Latin America yeah yeahandand it used to be like that becauseArgentina Buenos Aires was the port thatthat all received all trade from fromEurope in the 17th I can tell it's it'sa there's gorgeous elements of that Cityyou know it'sit's it's very interesting because it'sa city that you can tell that it wasabsolutely ransacked by communismbecause it was a city that lookedbeautiful you go to theater colon andthe other cologne is Like ThisMagnificent work of art it's absolutelygorgeous and there are many many placeswhere you walk that run walk around inBuenos Aires and you you think that youare in the best part of Paris or orsomething like that but then you youwalk around some more and then you seethe communism has completely taken overcompletelyum and it'sit's it has infected the roots of the ofthe of the society there uh so I I gavea talk back in I think it was like yeah2011 or 12 or so uh I went to uh to aschool like um what's it called like ahigh school for adults at night at nightschool or something sure yeahso I gave a talk to to the kid to thekids I mean they were like my ageum but it was very very poor people thatwere it was structural poverty rightlike their families and their theireverybody they they knew were supersuper poorI talk about entrepreneurshipbecause you can't be an entrepreneurright like it doesn't it doesn't demandany kind of degreeor anything it just requires beingproactive and having imaginationum and there were many many kids whom II could tell that what I was talkingabout resonated with them but then theyapproached me and they like a few kidsask me but what do you mean work becausethey were not familiar with the conceptof work so I asked them okay what doesyour father do well I don't know hewatches to be well but like how does hepay for things well someone comes andgives him moneyokay what did your grandfather do I meanthe same thingthese are generations of people who havenever witnessed workI guess part of the broader question tooas part of that is like notwithstandingmost countries devolve into Socialism orcommunism right because everyone getsused to those handouts that you'rereferring to and and everyone getstrained to think oh the government ishow problems are solved and you just endup spiraling downward but it does seemlike Latin America has a particularPaul Shaw for Socialism or communism orat least the the speed at which theydevolve into it I mean even maybe rightnow we're in kind of one of thosemoments where you haveI think Colombia Chileuh and Brazil just elected likeSocialist Communist leaders did they notnow what's interesting and after you Iwant to talk about this Javier Javier sosomeone Guy andumright because he's like apparently ahardcore Austrian dude he's talked aboutBitcoin before and he's doing well inthe in the polls and I think theelection is in October but anyways canyou know continue what you were sayingand we'll dive into that afterwardsyeah yeah soumwhat you were sayingthe reason why is the structural kind ofmentality of like people give you thingsyeah and and the thing I mean yes thatthat is exclusive things ratherthroughout throughout the world right sothat's definitely not special toArgentinaum but I I think our argentinians uh I Iguess there's a factor of Randomnesswhich what happened in Argentina couldhave happened everywhere and does happenin other places but I yeah I don't knowI I wonder if Argentina with the um thisInstinct of this superiority thatargentinians usually feelum blinds them from hey maybe this isnot the best place in the world maybewhat we're doing is not the most logicalsensible thing to doum because I I did see that uh approachthroughout my life I I remember when Iwas a kid I I used to absolutely hateArgentina and think I don't belong thisplace like I I don't belong with thisframework of of thinking about the worldof whatever you dothere is no meritocracy of any kindwhatever you do is right whatever you doif you didn't work too hard then that'sthe right way of doing things and thereis in Argentina there is um there is alarge appeal to uh we we call it a setof evil uh being like the wise guy rightif you can get away with not doing workthat's the person that is the mostadmired like throughout the entireSociety society that is super supercommon the people that are like thefamous people are the most admiredpeople is all around not working hardlike if you work hard and you earnedwhat you get like your lifestylewhatever it might be then you're kind oflike a schmucklaughs all right well how does thatsquare withso you have that mentality however itdeveloped over the years but how doeshow do those people then assess or judgethe fact that their currency has youknow been so horrible over the number ofyears like it's fine to have that kindof mentality and that kind of politicalor economic philosophy but when yourcurrency loses 50 on 75 100 in a yearand that dramatically affects yoursavings like doesn't that cause peopleto reassess those positions or how hownot really because it because if youthink from the framework that everythingargentinians do is the best it can bethen you think well then if oursituation sucks it must be someoneelse's fault and the IMF has always beenpointed as the bad guyumwhich to me always the fact thatargentinians had like a knee-jartreaction against the IMF made me thinkokay maybe the IMF then are the good guyin some wayumbut but yeah no I mean in in Argentinathe common thing is that it's the faultof the of the shankies the you know usit's the fault of the of the SpaniardsArgentina is absolutely despise peoplefrom Spain absolutely the spaniers theydon't even know that Argentina's hateSpain argentinians absolutely despiseBrazilians Brazilians for like I try tomess with uh with MBK and he doesn'teven buy because he doesn't even knowthere is like this privacyand so is it is it indicative at all ofa shift in that mentality that someonelike Javier isat least according to the polls likedoing all right in the in this upcomingelection like is there his message isobviously resonating to some degreeokayI I don't know how to follow all this bythe way I'm just asking you becauseyou're Argentina[Laughter]I'm not following so every time I calledmy mom she she told talks to me aboutinflation and then Javier so I'm I'maware of what's going on through thelens of my my mother is telling methings about Javier melee I don't know Idon't really care about politics I don'tthink politics will ever be the solutionto anythingum so you know whateveroh yeah hope hope it goes well I I thinkwhat what's indicative is thatthe the so Argentina used to have theperonis party I I guess no one caresabout this but but Argentina you stillhave the the pedonist party with Peronin the in the 60s uh he which was yeahit's a very strange party because it haduh components of the left and componentsof the rightum he was like a dictator but appeal alot to to the leftum yeah it's kind of weird but in theearly 2000s that party like everythingwent to and that party split into abunch of differentsegmentsumsoall the major parties other thancambiemos which is the party that wasempowered before uh the currentpresident uh they had these extremecommunist tendency I I think maybeJavier Miller is a representation ofwe've been trying this for so longmaybe it's not working but againit's it's all politics at the end of theday right like and argentinians keepwaiting for some savior to come and youknow fix things and no one's comingabsolutely no one right and you know Isay that all the time the best you knowperspective to have is that no one'scoming to save you and if you get acouple like bumps or layups along theway where someone half sensible comesinto power and that makes your life alittle bit easier than great right butthat's not what you should put all youryou know you shouldn't put all yourchips in that basket all right in termsof just the practicalities though when acurrency is inflating at 100 a yearlike you mentioned you have family therestill it seems and like how do peoplemanage that like what is the responseand there's a lot of capital controlstoo right so how do people insulatethemselves or manage like that scenariotake out the politics who cares you knowno control over that but like how arepeople managing with their save you knowtheir cat their money being so devaluedI I tend to think that that people areincredibly more resilient than becausethe fact that all decisions are made atthe edges of the margins and and not asa whole it means that every decisionthat you make might not take intoaccount how the overall situationis right you're making this decision ofshould I buy this Orangeum and I don't know I've seen people gothrough very very very harshcircumstances in life and and they justpull through one time I hired um one guyfrom that was living in Israel and hewas very close to the border with uhwith Gaza and I was you know curious soI asked him about you know like theconflict and and how do you live underlike a constant threat right regardlessof you know like the situation with Gazaor Palestine or whatever like I was justinterested in his perspective like thislife perspective and and he told me wellyou do see missile flying every likefrequently but like you get used to itsomewhere else yeah yeah like we'll justgo to the grocery store anyway becausewe need to buy yeah and yes likewhatever man like there are missilesflying over our heads but like you needto do things in life rightuh I don't know in in my in mycircumstance like in me in particular II sendI pay for some of the stuff that my mymom needs you know uh I just sent herBitcoin every every month uh to pay sofor example Healthcareumher healthcare bill is80 more than she gets as the pensionlike uh her yeah like you know yeah soobviously she can't she can't affordHealthcare and you know she needs it soso I like pay send her Bitcoin and thenshe sells itumbut yeah I don't know man every um Ithink every every life has a differentuh every person has a different way ofdealing with itum yeah I I don't know it's um yeah it'svery strange but I think people areincredible incredibly resilient yeah Imean does that particular instancebecause you would think in places likethat Bitcoin and unfortunately probablycrypto would at least be part of asolution part of a workaround but isn'tis it not the case that Argentina inresponse to IMF dangling the carrot foryou know basically another bailout justcame down hard on on bitcoin and cryptoand is that going to make it moredifficult to buy and sell it in thecountry and use it for those purposesI meanArgentina has been under Capitalcontrols for 20 years our argentiniansknow very very very well how to navigatethose those Watersumso that'suh that Argentina has been trying to banthe use of the US dollarfor like two decadesum andevery time they ban one what we call itCueva is a place where you go and andtrade on the black market uh quoteunquote for listeners uh when you whenyou trade dollars it's like an illegaltrade and you are actually getting thereal price of of the dollar and thoseCuevas started selling Bitcoin as wellum I don't know whenever you do thiskind of silly bands it it never worksbecause it's like burning the air it'sand biting Bitcoin has been harder rightlike Banning the dollar is because it'sphysicalum it's I mean obviously the bankingrails don't count because you cannot usebanking rails with others in Argentinait's absolutely absolutely impossiblebutbut even the the physical dollars areare are available if you I and everybodyknows where to go it's it's not hard tofind a Cueva every once in a while theystorm a Cueva and they make a show andyou know like they arrest very violentlya bunch of people that are working therebut you know it's like Pirate Bay thenext day they're for five more rightwould you ever move back if thingschanged there or became more sensible oranything like that it's because it'sbeautifulI just don't like the ethos uh no I Iwas just not go back they don't thinkthat could changeoh no wayno cultural momentum is so hard tochangeum yeah that's why I think this time fornursery is so special but I I think themomentum of culture takes literallygenerations to be able to be changedum in Argentina I don't even get a sensethat there isum there is uh an interest in changingthat that momentum so no I definitelydefinitely not uh not very very bullishand I would I would not see myselfliving there at all regardless of likethe economic crisis and all that rightwhere do you think in the world todayhas ayou know an interesting or positiveculture and I guess like we're kind ofin this in the stage of History where wedelineate between meat space and youknowsoft space basically because you knowthere's obviously legitimate boundeddelineated cultures happening incyberspace uh but you know where wheredo you think is like a culture that's atleast acceptable for you know the thingsthat you value in the world todayno they're places that that I've seenthat have an ethos that resonates withme the most are smaller places ruralplaces out of the um out of the wayplaces where it's hard to get toum where you don't get like we've seenthis and we don't have to touch on itbut this this culture like this Globalculture if you will uh of caring aboutlike the mostsimple and silly things that arenon-existent problems uhuh or mini minuscal problems thateverybody has to have an opinion aboutnow right and there are so many placesin the world when you get out of Austinor when you get out of like big citiesthat don't even realize that there arepeople talking about these things likeit's it's not part of the reality andthat lies so nice that she can it's soit's so fresh man it's so incrediblyrefreshing to like what do you mean youjust want to talk about the fish youcaught today and the bread you made andthe dinner you're having later and notlike pronouns and politics and whateverthe else like wow it's so nice Iwant to be your friendit's so funny in in the place where I'mat now it's like these small island inGreece and it's the climbing Mecca inthe world so climbers from all over theworld come for you know one or two weeksuh to to climb here andbecause because of you know people fromall over the world there is a lot of thepronoun people coming here but the thegap of understanding betweenyou know I I uh I am not a woman eventhough I'm obviously a woman or it's solarge that the locals which obviouslythe localsum a lot of them don't speak Englishother than people you knowum clerks and you know uh waitress andstuff like thatumevery once in a while I see I see peoplecome in and say and create a change.orgpetition to change something in theisland and it's always written by peoplewho've been here for a week they'releaving the second week and they want tosay oh no we need to save this islandokay good luck people are like you canleave nowthank youum yeah I mean I always come back to onyou know I was thinking today actuallyand often I guess because it's likeyou're sayingin certain areas in the mainstreamdiscourse you know not in those far awayplaces these sorts of issues whetherthey be those or climate related orsocialists you know economic policies uhare so ever-present and you know Ialways come back to that BuckminsterFuller Buckminster Fuller quote you knowlike you you don't change the world bylike screaming against something you youmake the problem Obsolete and it reallyis the case that entrepreneurs andinnovators are the real social justiceWarriors right now the people that justpoint out the problem and say the end isnigh and you know what we need is morecommunism it's the people that identifythe problem and say well I'm going toisolate the problem and I'm going to seeif what I can do to generate or developa solution to it and that will be thething that actually improves people'slives or enhances convenience or makespeople more prosperous or whateverbut for some reason that you know that'sjust a very difficult concept for alarge portion of people to seeminglywrap their heads around so we we get Ithink there's there there's a largeInstinct in people and I have no ideawhether this is uh uh modern deceased mymother mental disease or not but there'sa large Instinct on people to to alwayscrave for some kind of top-down solutionyeah and everybody even even uh forthemselves they they think in in termsof top-down Solutions like oh theyshould ban this or oh this should not bepossible or we should be able to do Xrightum it's alwaysit's always the the the instinct is tosolve a problem but by changing a law orby yelling at someone or by not yellingat someoneum but no problem can be solved but buttop-down Solutions like by definitiontop 10 Solutions will always beauthoritarians yeah uh uh and the onlything that you can that is what JordanPeterson says right like the only thingyou can change is your room like make itmake your bed uh fix fix your own thingsand fix the the world the part of theworld that surrounds you and maybe youcan start expanding that Circle later uhbut fix your own stuff and there is sorewarding to be able tomodify at the agency to to modify thingsaround you and and have a positivepositive impact you don't have to be youknow namedum emperor of Twitter uh to be able tochange the world yeah well and that'ssuch a perfect point is because likeit's it's far more impactful to changesomething in your local environment andyou know like not no single person canreally change the world quote unquotewhatever that means like save the worldbut you caneffect change in your local environmenteven if that's just helping a neighboror you know making it easier for youknow helping your community in some wayand that's like genuinely a quality oflife increase because all those peoplethat you interact with on a daily basisbenefit in some capacity and you knowand that's felt but it's funny you youbecause another aspect of this is whatwe were talking about earlier with likethe libertarian crowd it's likeeveryone has blind spots that's just atruth right and you try to beopen-minded and objective and rationaland logical to try to minimize thoseblind spots and you try to find theright philosophy that allows andperspective on things that causes thingsto kind of fit together the best andthat's you know an attempt to tominimize those blind spots but you justyou can't avoid them and you know youbring upPeterson and you know it's funny one ofhis major sticks is like the the dangersof authoritarian centralized top-downcontrol right and so bring it down to alocal basis clean your room and thenexpand out from therebut simultaneously like when you observehis responses to emerging so-calledproblems in the world today whether it'sonline identity or more recentlyum you know the the emerging dangers orpitfalls of artificial intelligencehis response is so often to like to uhinvoke government authority to like tryto negate or like restrict the negativeimpact of this thing like with AI he wassomeone posted a picture of someone whowas photorealistic and you know theperson wasn't actually there it mighthave been Selena Gomez at the Met orsomething and umhe was like you know we needlike we need laws immediately becausethis is going to be dangerous and it'slike brothis is totally antithetical to yourwhole stick like can't you see thatyou're falling for the same trap thevery trap that you've often veryemotionally like an aggressivelycriticize in other domains you're makingthe same mistake here you're jumpingright to the conclusion that what weneed is someone on high to make a law tocoerce someone not to do a thing ratherthanfinding a technological solution to whatis a technological problem you know andso it's bizarre to me you know that'sthat's obviously a blind spot to him orit seems to be one you know to meI think it's just Instinct it's theinstinct is there and for the most partI think the Instinct might be part ofhuman nature or it might be like toauthority authority is is is the easysolution so say for example you you areum you know at um but a cliff and youjump and you die right because you fellfrom from the cliff well the instinct iswell it should be forbidden for peopleto die from jumping on cliffs okay thenit should there should be some kind ofum guard to to prevent people from fromjumping but it's it's thelow-hanging fruits it's like the levelone thinking is okay this should beforbidden the wait it's idiotic youcannot forbid people from interactingwith sober in some way because okaymaybe this award doesn't allow it but ifit's physically possible someone mightwrite it and someone might interact withthat software in that way so that'sthat's not the that's not the thesolutionum butthese things require uh training andconstant uh self-assessment of of yourof your uh responses your knee-jordreactionsum becauseI I done I I think we we discussed thisat some point but I think you also donemeditation rightyeah I've experimented with it I don'tcurrently do itso so I think the whole point at leastfrom my perspective my approach tomeditation is to become less reactiveum is to observe your Sensations andacknowledge that something is itching orthat you have some discomfort and justobserve that thing that sensation butwithout scratching yourself or withoutyou know moving around uh there is aconcept called aditana which is I I willsit down to meditate and I will not moveI will sit down to meditate for threehours and even if my back hurts I willjust sit stillum with within reason I I foundumbut the whole point is to learn toseparate yourself from this input andthe output that you createbut you might go and meditate for onehour and feel all enlightened and alland then you go out and you see yourdaughter breaking something like mydaughter breaking something I'm like ohmy God what are you doingthat whole wonderful enlightenedpractice goes out the window in a splitsecondum but you know maybe after one hour ofhaving that reaction you connect thatyou were super reactive and then maybeit will take less and less time for youfor you to go from having the input andconnecting an output uh to the pointwhere maybe you can in some cases breakthatum that that response that knee-sharkreaction yeah no I agree with that I'vealways you know meditation or anythingthat kind of allows you to create thatspace between an impulsive and anemotional reaction or a sensorial or areaction to a sensorial input like anitch or whateverand you know the Observer behind thatright I think you know you just as youyou emerge in the world and as you'reyou go through your cultural familialall those sorts of conditioningyou tend to associate the two with eachother like I am that thought I am thatemotion that scratches mine and I thinkvarious practices can allow you to widenthat gap between the two and you becomemore of an objective Observer of allthese different things and you know ifyou do that well enough then perhaps youare able to the Gap can be so large thateven thoughyou you like the spark of that emotionalresponse you can tell when it'shappening but maybe you can you know uhput it out before it is actuallyexpressed you know and all all thebetter because then you're you'reperhapsacting more calmly more consciously morethoughtfully to your environment and notso emotionally and not so reactively andyou know nobody's perfect so we all weall fail at that unless you're like amonk in a cave for 30 years in silencebut then yeah but then maybe you comeout of to the real world well exactlyexactly this is a really horrible personthat's not that impressive becauseyou're not dealing with like rush hourtraffic in New York and a shitty bossand you know five kids and all that kindof stuffum and for for the record you knowobviously massive Peterson fan nottrying to throw shade because I'velearned a ton from them but you know Ido think it's an example ofthat thing that everyone's susceptibleto where you don't recognize when youknow in certain instances you're kind ofbeing the opposite of what you espousein other areas but this perhaps is anexcellent unintentional segue into thenostril stuff because basically thepremise of Nostra and as you said whatbrought you into Bitcoin and studyingAustrian economics beforewasyou know a philosophy or an idea or arecognition of the value of Freedombroadly speaking to express yourself totransact to act in accord with you knowwhat you believe to beright for lack of better term or forlack of a broader term and so it'sinteresting thatwell not interesting I think it's greatthat we have these tools that areemergingin tandem with perhaps growing Authoritythat authoritarian Instinct that youmentioned before perhaps gettingexpressed even more in the world todaybecause of the architecture ofInstitutions that prevails you know thatthatpeople's will or people's power or orpower generally and money is beingincreasingly concentrated at thosecenters of authority and as you say it'slargely because people are ranting atthat and willingly granting at that butwe would probably both agree that thatis ultimately detrimental to humanFreedom flourishing peace prosperity allthat kind of stuff and thensimultaneously to that or as a reactionto that perhapswe have these largely digital systemsand Landscapes that are trying tocounterbalance that that are trying tomake it so people can express themselveshow they want they're trying to make itso people won't be financially orinformationally or otherwise censored orde-platformed or any of that kind ofstuff and it's interesting and you knowwe'll we'll dig into the details of allthat but it's just kind of related tothis Peterson pointlet me I'll put it this way maybe thisis a better analogy you know the gundebate always rages right you know sothere's a horrible tragedy somewhere andyou know half the people say the problemis obviously guns no gun if there's lessguns less tragedy let's remove them theother half say no it's not the gun'sfaults it's mental health it's socialconditioning it's cultural and you knowguns need there needs to be a way forthe citizens to defend themselves and toto represent a check on the balance ofpower of governance it's super importantwe can't infringe on it and these placesyou know that debate is just sopolarized it doesn't really get anywhereand then you have into this landscapeslipping 3D printed guns so now asoftware file and a generic plasticprintermake basically or will you know veryshortly make that debate almost mootbecause it's like who you know who caresanyone anywhere will be able to printguns so you know the debate is no longershould we have them or not becausethey'll be ubiquitous or at least thecapacity for them to be ubiquitous willbe there so then where does the thediscussion move when that's the casewell I'd say it moves to probably abetter place like kind of like the placearound cultural responsibility familyeducation you know virtue all that kindof stuff and it seems like that's whatNoster and freedom you know software andTechnologies represent it's like surethe world is in a weird place wherethere's you know people want moreauthority to take care of the you knowso-called problems that are emergingbut then you have this Force that'sbasically going to say doesn't matterwhat you think anyways these ideas aregoing to get out there these picturesare going to get out there these songwhatever it's all going to be out thereso so then what what happens when theauthority is is no longeruh it loses power no longer has theinfluence that it once had so you knowwhat what do you make of the seeminglyemerging tide or Rising tide of FreedomTechnologies especially insofar as hownostrils kind of poured fuel on thatfireyeah I think it's funny because when yougo to when you go to Noster very oftenyou see people that are super stokedabout trying Noster and we've we've gotthis uh this safe space to get out of uhelon's uh tyranny and then they havethis one bad experience with someone andthey say well can you can we ban thisguy and it's the instinct is let's banthis person because he was mean to me orbecause maybe he said somethingabsolutely disgusting and you have nodesire to be whatsoever to be uhinvolved with that with that person butthen you have tools to just block thatperson and not see like mute that personand not not interact with that personbut unless you kill the personthe person's gonna be thereum but yeah I I tend to think that thatBitcoin because I used to equate Bitcoinwith freedom I thought there weresynonymsumand that's why I got the the Bitcointattoo because I have like this climberto tattooed uh and the climber isreaching for for a Bitcoin logo and mymymy my pitch for the for the for thetattoo is that the climber is reachingfor Freedom okay yeahnicevery nice is that is that in is that inlike a yin yang sort of half of a yeahmy wife has the other half nice verycoolum soand and recently I've started I've beenthinking a lot about about uh Nosterfrom the lens of what I've learned aboutBitcoin because Bitcoin it took me solong to understand Bitcoinum the fact that there is thisConsciousness emerging from and this setof values emerging from Simply code andthe interaction of humans with that codeto me that absolutely I I find thatutterly fascinatingum so when I started looking at atNoster I I had in the back of my mind II I've I always have this sense ofwonder with with Bitcoin and I startedfeeling the same kind of sensation withwith Noster the most uh the more Iinteracted with it and the more I readthe specifications of the protocolum I I started getting this this samesense uh from from Noster and now I Ithink that my my thinking with regardsto Freedom has changed into thinkingthat Bitcoin is one side of the freedomwhatever pentagon hexagon trianglewhatever it might be but it's just oneof the sides and I think Nosteris a tool in the same way that Bitcoinis a tool is a toolthat takes care of another side I Idon't know what other sides there are tothis shape that is freedom but I 100think that Noster is um is thisincredibly incredibly liberating toolfor Freedomum in a way I I think it might be moreimportant than than Bitcoinum at the same time I think that Nosterwould never had happen without Bitcoinand without the lightning Networkum it's not a technical requirement it'snot like a layer three or like thesepeople like to think in terms of likethese layers and you know lighting isthe layer two and a Noster could be thelayer three it technically it's notwhatsoever but from an economical sensethere are layers to things there arethings that require other things nottechnically but economically and inorder to havea network uh if you can call Nostranetwork uh or an ecosystem an ecosystemin order to have Noster you need to haveinfrastructure that runs Noster you needto have the relays you need to have thedevelopers you need to have all thesethings rightum andif those things are funded by PayPal orby Bank wires or buy anything that isnotcompletely censorship assistantthen those things inherit like youcannot have a layer on an economic layeron top of something else that has morefreedom than the lower layer the lowerlayer in the upper layers inherit thefreedom and the sense of super system onall these attributes from the lowerlayers so I see Noster as a as aneconomic layer running on top of Bitcoinbecause of the fact that we can pay forrelays we can send money to snow thenlike we did when he came intoInternationalwe can do these things and there is nojob point there is no one place wherewho the US government or whoever itmight be can go and say we need to shutthis down we need to shut down thisrelay because there is thiscommunication that we don't like thereis none of that whereas if you pay for ahosting machine in AWS they can go to awthey can go to Amazon and say we need toshut down this computer because we don'tlike which is what happened to to Gapthe Gap right I think it was governorone of these censorship resistance sitesuh that was shut downum these thingsneed to be funded with censorshipassistant managerum so yeah I I I I'm no sir to me theyabsolutely captivated my my imaginationthe sense of wonder that I that I feelwith everything that's possible it'sit's off the chartsum and I keep interacting withdevelopers that are feeling the same waywe're look we're seeing the amount ofopportunity of things that we can buildlike we can actually build what theinternet was supposed to be supposed tobe or at least the web was supposed tobe since the 70s uh we can actuallybuild it now in a much much better waythan what they had in mind and to me theamount of the the impact and the freedomthat that can bring to to the peoplethat choose to interact with it is uhit's absolutely staggeringcan you before we continue that becausethere's a bunch of stuff I want to touchon but can you just kind of explain topeople what the basic architect why thisarchitecture is different and why itpermits that degree of freedom and notyou don't even have to kind of explainwhy the integration with Bitcoin is soimportant but just what is its Generallike why is it so different than the webas it exists today why does it allow forso much more freedomthe thing is that um what what Nosterdoes there the way compute Networknetworking has been done for the mostpart for the past few decades has beenthere's many clients and there's oneserver the server can be multiplecomputers but at the end of the day isthis one central point where we allcoalesce that Central Point is theauthority that gives you the truthum so you go to twitter.com andyou get a list of whatever with tweetsfrom your your the people that youfollowand you trust that these people havesaid have written these things becausetwitter.com is telling you that theywrote these things there is no secondcheck there is no point where are yousaying well let me dig into this no noif it comes from tutor.comthat's it that's the truthum then in in in innetworking we have peer-to-peerconnections which is whatum slash tax has been doing I mean uhBitTorrent for example uh it's kind ofthe same where you connect to multiplepeopleum to get some kind of state right so Ican publish tweets and you can connectto me directly and I can give you thisinformation of what I wrote and then youconnect to someone else and you make allthese connections uh I'm dumbing it downlike I'm simplifying because explainingthis properly would take a long time butbroadly is like this we have like thesetwo different paradigms the thepeer-to-peer one is really really hardum it's how lightning network worksum and we we see what running alightning network node implies it's it'sreally hard you need to be your youruptime needs to be pretty much 24 7.um it's it's it's very very very complexit's not something that at least for themoment it's not something thatabsolutely every single person can dowith a click of button especially peoplethat are not interested in doing it theyjust want to inter interact with thelighting Networkum so Noster the the Noster brings adesign thatit keeps the idea of this Central focalpoints but it removes the authority fromthem so the authorities pushedcompletely to the edges and becauseeverything you do on Noster is signedwith private keys in the same way youtransact with with Bitcoin in the sameway the um the validity the authenticityof the data is kept within the dataitself it's just the signaturesso then the idea that you have theseCentral points becomeskinda irrelevant because you can have asmany of these Central points as you wantright so you can have what's called arelay you can have a relay that is underU.S law uh that might sense or uh orwhatever someone from Iran might say butthen you can have this other relay inIran and they the only thing they can dois not give you data like you can askthem for what did John say and maybethey they lie and they tell me well hedidn't say anything but because I canask as many relays as I want and I canjust ask your relay so say if everysingle relay Advance you I can just goto your relay and ask you what did yousay and I get the data immediatelyum so the beautiful thing is andand uh nvk he used to run the Bitcoinhackers Mastered on instance and andthere was you know some people using itbut at some point uh he decided that hedidn't want to pursue running this thinganymoreum and he was also running because hewas also running BRB which is a a Nosterrelayand they said kind of at the same timehe shut down both of the servers that hewas runningthe people that were using Bitcoinhackers went to Twitter and startedcomplaining why did he do this you tookall my data you took my blah blah blahblah blahthe people that were using Noster mostpeople didn't even realize that it hadhappened because your experience ofusing Nestor did not change like youneeded to go to the settings and go toyour list of relays and see a red dotnext to the relay and say oh what'sgoing on here but you did not evenrealize in the same way that when Chinabanned the Bitcoin miners the BitcoinNetwork didn't care like okay blockswere coming in a little bit slower butno one said oh no you took mytransaction there was no bitching on onon on Twitter because because China hadtaken transactions that you wanted to dolike transactions were still there theyall confirmed like it's it's no one ifif you weren't paying attention youdidn't know that this massivelyimpactful uh thing had happened to theBitcoin Network people didn't evenrealize which is which is what happenswhen you when you move these thesethings to to the edgesso you know basically your identity is akey pair you have all these differentrelays that when I sign a note getsblasted out and 95 of them might be likedon't like John not not transmitting hishis note but you know one in Zimbabwewho's not sensorial at all might be likeyeah I'll do that and so it gets sentout and so people that are following methey can see I signed the message it wasrelayed they get to see it and that'scommunication rightumso one question is presumably a systemlike I mean it's way more uh heavy likeyou know data heavy because the same ina centralized server like one entitysends out the information whereas inthis one several relays may be relayingthe information and so it's like it'spresumably more less data efficientum is like one is that the case andwhat's the kind of implications of thatand twothis seems like a very simplearchitecture once it's been built youknow which is often the case withInnovation you look back and be like whywhy didn't anyone think of this beforebut why didn't anyone think of thisbefore like what is the major likelight bulb moment here why did it emergenow was it just because Bitcoin kind ofcamebefore andhad a similar sort of model andsomeone's in Fiat Jeff perhaps thoughtlike well maybe we can apply this toCommunications like why not earlierI'm not sure why not why not early yeahso the first question yes for sure it'sdefinitely that way the um that there isan impact on the on the data a largeimpact on the data so say for exampleyou go to twitter.com and Twitter comesgive you all gives you all the tweetsif you connect to 20 differenttwitter.com quote unquoteum you'll get 20 times the the amount ofdataum and there's a lot of things that wecan do to improve thisumand that's what's beautiful because it'sall open protocol open networksum and open source code we can we canexperiment with a bunch of different uhsolutions to to this problem whichI don't think it's going to be a problemat allum and yes like now if you useum Noster on the go on your phone usingdata it's going to really really consumea lot of data but I was in Thailand atthe beginning of the yearand the data that I had was superexpensive So within one day I wrote aproxy which instead of connecting to abunch of relays I just connected to myserver at home and my home server athome created all these connections sofrom a data consumption perspective myclient was using the same amount of dataas a Twitter client would use so likeone time like every event was sent to myphone one timeand there's a lot of things that thatcan be done with this I umin fact you could you could post thatwith fetty you could have proxies orcaching services that are run within thefetty instances which means that you canhave a community that is already usinghas some kind ofumtrust uh in this in this localized placethey can trust the the the consumptionof these communications to this um to tothis fatty instance so there's a lot ofthings that can be done uh so I am100 convinced that this is not asignificant problem at all for not ascaling issue long term it's not ascaling issue uh the thing is thatit it's funny becauseI think no story scales so much betterthan most thingsbut Noster at this point is somisunderstood that the things thatNoster is absolutely fantastic at butsimply they have not been built yetpeople are saying oh this is going tokill Noster this is a big problem for usso for example discoverabilitydiscoverability is aright now everybody's talking about howbad this comparability is in after whataccessibility how like oh yesso so at the moment it's mainlydiscovering people that you want tointeract with right I follow suggestionsyeah follow Twitter yeah exactly uhthere has been very very littleattention paid to the onboardingexperience to to Noster and that's whymost onboarding experiences to Nosterthey are absolutely horrible at themoment which means you get a large churnof new users and it's fine you know likeright now using Noster requires somekind ofum investment or you know not obviouslyeconomical investment but you knowum energy investment uh and manage yourinvestment butbut don't all these are problems thatare not only going to be solved butthey're going going to be solved in waysthat the centralized platforms simplycannot do they cannot they will not beable to discoverability is going to beso much better in Noster than on therest of the internet that the fact thattoday in 2023 people were complainingabout discoverability issues in Nosteris going to be lovableumand and the same thing for for relaysthe thing is that when you pushsignatures to the edges and validationof the signatures to the edges to theactual clients then there is no devopsteam that you need to hire because youneed to have a thousand servers likeTwitter might be running these thingsorganically they can spread out becauseit scales at the protocol level itscales horizontally you don't need tohave a Twitter or a Facebook kind ofteam working on keeping these Servicesalive whereas Google and on all the fansthey need to invest in being able tokeep these Services alivewhat I find really interesting and thisis kind of speaking to the the Bitcoinelement of it is because of theincreasingly seamless integration withlightning you know and I'm sure thatwill get much better in a very shortperiod of time but now all these thingslike so-called problems that emerge likeyou know something we would want this todo something we want to be developed adata issue uh whatevernow immediately a financial incentivecan just will just kind of shift to itit's like oh this is something that weneed done but who's you know how can itbe done because it's going to be costlyor or whatever the market will just belike well it turns out this problem isworth 10 SATs to every user who like isfacing the problem or 100 you know whatI mean like because it's so integratedit just seems to be the case likewheneverwhen you have that element of freedomand this integration with you knowcensorship resistant money and you knowthe the way in which it can flowit just seems like oh like whensomething is encountered it'll be pricedright away and maybe it'll be priced outbe like you know what that problempeople aren't willing to pay to solve itbut this problem people are willing topay x amount to solve it like everyproblem now has a price and it can bethat price can be paid like thatand what does that mean for the pace ofdevelopment the type of solutions thatget developed like it's just it'smind-blowing isn't it it really is and II think we're barely experimenting webarely started experimenting with thesethings uh the fact is that in protocolpayments uh so payments within Nosternative eventsum it started happening I think maybeless than three months agoum the fact that andcurrently there I know for one clientI'm a face the the client that for likethe main client for Androidthat is doing a lot of this work wherethey post bounties for for futures orlike someone post Avenger Advantage forfor some kind of functionality and theychoose what to implement based on whathigher speed like what's what's the thelargest pool of money because that isbasically you voting with your money uhfor something that you really reallywant instead of having to conduct allthis user serviceum to try to assess what the marketwants you can just get the market to payfor those things there is a lot ofexperimentation in this realm um I andactuallywhen uh back in January I I was thinkingI was constantly thinking about Nosterum and I wroteum I wrote like a like a blog postuh for for the issue of creatingmarketplaces localized marketplacesbecause you always have the issue of umhow to how do you create a market rightwhen you don't have a market there areno buyers no no Sellers and you have thechicken and egg problem of why would amark why would a seller come to a marketif there are nobody buy this personand just thinking around Noster becauseagain I was I was in bed at the time andthe the over like application in inThailand was absolutely terribleum and there was just simply a mismatchof of communication between the thedriver and and the and the riderand another is you know it's forcommunications and I was thinking wellif I could pay these people in in in inBitcoin I like you could create alocalized Marketby posting to a multi-sig like a two oftwo if you had like a fatty kind ofsystem uh you can post to a two of twomulti-sig and you can say well I'mwilling to spend in the next one yearone Bitcoinum or maybe yeah maybe one Bitcoin is alot uh half a Bitcoin in going torestaurants right and maybe you arewilling to spend also have a Bitcoin inthe same place and we can host thatmoney to uh to a multi-sig andwhen you want to orange peel arestaurant instead of saying hey can Ilike paying Bitcoin and go in therebecause I've been waiting for you lookat all these people waiting for you likeif you start taking itand you could be an Oster you could payfrom the multi-sig over lightning likeyou could pay uh you could just go tothe restaurant you could pay from themoney that you locked for this one usecaseum and then there is so many differentuse cases of of merging the fact that wehave empirical payments withum with having Nosterum in terms of development there is Idon't know if you know about him but umshe's sovereignty he's the guy that runsthe Australia podcast and he he'sworking on a super super cool GalaxyBrain Project called NOS rocket and thewhole premise of nurse rocket is the themission of nurse rocket is humans arenot living to their fullest potentialand the way that the approach that hehas is that's the problem to be solvedand from that problem you create a bunchof sub problems all the way down to weneed to fix this one button that doesn'twork well in this application maybe it'sall the way down in you know like to ahierarchy of 25 items in a treeumbut people can say I agree that this isa problem that I care about this muchand they can start funding theseproblems right so the idea is to breakany kind of problem down to uh works ofsix hour chunks and then someone can sayI'm willing to do this work and and thenthere is yeah it's a really complexsystem it's already about the honor andso people can just pick up the worksolve the problemexactly so the the idea that he has inmind is to replace companies to replaceor get like this type ofumtop-downum yeah an organic prioritization of thetasks that need to be done based on anoverarching like major goal and animmediate or an emergent pricing ofthose different tasks which helps theprioritization and enables them to besolved all the way down all the way downso you start from this really you knowlike Humanity needs to go to Marswhatever and you can go to what kind ofuh what kind of screw should we put onthis on the spaceship right and then youpay someone to wait to work on that onfiguring out what's the right screwthat is pretty galaxy brain yeah big itis super Galaxy brain yeah but you knowit is super ambitious but he's been awayso and I think that's what's super coolis that he's been working on thisproblem for 10 yearsso oh and it's only that Noster camealong that he worked on these on thissame problem before within ethereumbefore uh I don't know if this is publicwell he told well whatever now it ishe works on this probably with uhvitalik before the um thewhat's it called the uh the the the thefork that they had the hard Fork thatthey didum okay whatever you know what I meanso before that then he went to cardanoto work on on fixing these issues samething and he was saying okay this is all coining and this is all sonow then he saw Noster and he said ohactually I think this is the the vehicleto execute on this Visionum so yeah I'm I'm very very hopefulthat nurse rocket will will launch youknow it's so fascinating about somethinglike that and I mean there's it's kindof a reflection of how ConsciousnessWorks uh in a sense butbecause you know one thinks and this iskind of this problem uh has been gettingdiscussed in the AI concern circles aswell right because it's like well whatdo you optimize for what what do youhave the super intelligence what do youhave the emergent Market structure tooptimize for like you said he's I wantto optimize for human flourishingbroadly now even if we could come tosome agreement on what that actuallymeans it still begs a question likeshould you be optimizing for that rightand should the AI be optimizing forhuman flourishing human conveniencetruth love paper clips like who knowsit's highly consequential in those likethere's a highly consequential decisionbut what's interesting about the youknow the approach that you just uhexplainis thatwhat what's being optimized for willbecome clearer and clearer as thesmallerpriorities become priced and solvedright because you may think we'reoptimizing for this and therefore like atree a higher prioritization tree justfault drops down from that and and getsbuilt up but your assumption it's almostlike you're able to correct your falseassumptions as it goes right because youmay have all these menial tasks and oneyou thought was priced at X ends upbeing priced and prioritized at Y andthat gets done and that's that somehowshifts the the value tree even more liketweaks it a little bit so that it'sgoing in a better direction and you dothat you know all the way up over acourse of whatever period of time andpresumablyit allows the truth of whatquote-unquote should be optimized tokind of emerge you know so it's againit's this bottom up rather than top-downuhyeah approach to solving whatever ourproblems actually are because what the do we know do we think we know whatour problems are but maybe we don't youknow and this is a way ofallowing wisdom to emerge through ourcostly decisions basicallyyeah that's the whole idea and I thinkwhat he's what he's getting at is thatwhen you do this work within the realmof a corporation you you actually lockthis uh connection to reality rightbecause the work say with within IBM forexample a bunch of employees maybe thework that a thousands literallythousands of people might be working onis misaligned with the real requirementsof reality right but they don't know ityet like they don't know they will notknow it for a really long time so muchlatency they don't they don't get thatfeedback in near as quick as you mightbe in this sort of approach exactly andwith this system you you get like theimmediacy uh of the feedback loopsconstantly constantly you get you getthese feedback loops and maybe you'llget to solve one task whichuh someone else that cares about adifferent part of the tree realizes thatactually that task solves what you wereworking on uh in a different way and nowlike this whole chunk of the tree can bejust chopped offso interestingyou know really it'san emergent Market based incentiveimbued way of like determining what arethe real issues right like let's saythis architecture is already in placehow muchtime energy and uh Financial Resourceswould be devoted toso-called solving climate change versusdeveloping the capacity and ability forhuman beings to to express themselveshow they see fit and to transact youknow with whomever and however they wantlike what do you think would be the youknow the balance there and again I don'tknow I mean obviously I'm being a littletongue-in-cheek because I think theformer has been over overly emphasizedon the latter not nearly as much butthat would be a manner for the truth toemerge you know because what is trutheven you know it's like it's prettynebulous uh Concept in a lot of casesand this would be a way tobecause the the as is so often said talkis cheap right so that that's why havinga cost to things is so consequentialthat's why action is so consequentialbecause there's a cost to action and sowhen when that can be so much moreuhlikewhen that when it can be determined whenthose when the the costs and the valuesimbued in those actions can be expressedwith so much less latency and can bedirected so much more easily or orwithout friction you really I think thatis as good a mechanism as I can think offoremergent truth to emerge to to emergebecauseit has the element of both the choicebut but also the cost right becauseabsent the cost like the expression of apreference is relatively meaninglessso you know I need something that thatis very common because I I I've workedon on large organizations and the amountof waste of human time waste which isit's it's a genocide if you think aboutit the amount of men hours completelywasted it is an absolute genocide andand it's just because of how separatethose environments are from realitythere there there is nothing going fromfrom transcending connecting those thosetwo those two environmentsum it's an absolute tragedy theI I think it kind of kills the humanspirit because I think in a way peoplesense that they are doingmeaningless jobs uh meaningless work andI think that I've worked with a lot ofpeople that realized that they werehaving that kind of uh job and I I thinkit ittranslates into seeing the world as umas a very scarce in terms ofopportunities uh as a very scarce placeso it's a very frightening place so youend upyou end up think thinking that you havethat job you know that it's meaninglessyou know that is the work that you'redoing doesn't matterbut they are thankful because they thinkthere's nothing better there's no otheropportunity and it's an absolute tragedyand that you know being in thatcircumstance causes you tolike twist and distort your own mind tofit it so it's less disruptive to to toyou right so like because such acircumstance would you know cause a lotof anxiety a lot of stress a lot oftension a lot of Despair a lot of allthese things you know you hear the termall the time that someone people youknow say that their jobs aresoul-sucking or Soul destroying rightlike isn't that like horrible thatyou're you're you're you're doingsomething that is so antithetical orcounter to what you want to be doing howyou want to be feeling what you deemmeaningful that that's how youcharacterize it and so I think part ofthe reasonthat there's you know part of thecontributing influence to social Decayand degradation that we always rail onin Bitcoin land is this people have tocontort themselves to fit thisuh unnatural or or imperfect sort oflandscape of meaning for themselves andthey do that through substance abuse andmedication and diseases of Despair andall this kind of stuff and you know soI'm totally on board like if we cancorrect that if those if theif if what we collectively orindividually and emergently collectivelywork on can graft morewith a greater Fidelity on what isactually most true and most meaningfuland good and beautiful and all that kindof stuff then it seems obvious that it'sgoing to correct a lot of thoseyou know contortions and distortedperspectives that people have that arecausing them so much pain and anguishbroadly speaking you know so again youknowBitcoin kind of fixes this but I guessnow Bitcoin and master fixes thisyeah but maybe in the end it's actuallyFreedom fixes these right well of courseyeah but it's you know the thing is thethe thing is that that is one of the oneof the issues is that this kind of uhproblems are are Downstream from thefact that we have this massively big uhorganizations whether it is governmentsor incredibly large companiesum that you get the opportunity of leavein this isolated world where you don'thave to have a direct contact withreality so that ties what we weretalking uh at the beginning about aboutArgentina and these people who had neverin their lives and their parents livesand their grandparents lives they hadnever had a job doing somethingum because there was an organizationsupporting them the government therewasn't an organization that was bigenough an extractive of value somewhereelse that they could sustain this lifebut without that organization a personthat just sits at home watching TV allday would perish because they will nothave the me means to sustain their lifeand in the same way you tie with thepeople that are doing menial jobs atcompanies that there is so much noisethat thousands of people working onsomething that is completely irrelevantgoes on unnoticedbecause if you have a company of 10people and they work that eight of thosepeople are doing it doesn't matter thatcompany goes bankruptin a company with 100 000 peopleif a thousand people are doing somethingthat is completely relevantprobably no one will even notice rightso the the the size of this organizationis what's bringing this uh capacity ofbeing abstracted from realityandI actually think that that's one of thethings that in different ways Bitcoinand Noster fixum because the way I've been thinkingyou already you are like you understandBitcoin so well that that why Bitcoinfix is that part is it doesn't need tobe discussed but why Noster fixes thispart or how Noster affects this part Ithink is a little bit novel and lessunderstoodsothe way I think about that isanytime you create a new company a newproject or whatever the one of thehardest part that you need to address ishow are you going to get customers howare you going to get users right sodiscoverabilityanytime you have a Facebook or a Twitteror a YouTube or any of these kind ofcompanies who have such a large Networkeffectthe the amount of value that they canextract from this network effect is solarge is so vastthat they havenot a monopoly position but close towhat we could conceptually think of as amonopoly position it doesn't matter ifthey are providing the best platform orthe best applications it's simply youcan launch a Twitter that is 2x betterthan Twitter and no one will care rightbecause your friends are in Twitter samething with Facebook with WhatsApp likeall these things they have so muchinertia that is really really reallyhard to to compete with these thingsand the amount of value that is createdwhen you create a network effect likethe one that Facebook has it's immensebut that Network effect was not createdby by Facebook that Network effect ispart of human behavior it just happensthat Facebook was at the right place atthe right timeto capture the entire thingand they give a bit of Bali back to theusers enough to make it worth theirwhile but that's why Facebook and thesecompanies they have suchblobish uh Market capitalizationsbecause the value of their marketcapitalization of Facebook is not theFacebook code or the Facebook company orthe other IP it's just the networkeffect is for the most like 90 is thenetwork effect that they have withintheir Silo and you cannot take thatNetwork effect somewhere elsesowhen you create a company you think wellI need to put advertisements on Googlebecause that's if I want to be uhdiscoverable in any way I need to be onGoogle I need to be on Facebook so youare literally paying a tax even if youdon't want to pay the tax but if youwant to be able to compete you need topay these tax to these these uh thesecompaniesand what what master has which is whathas captivated uh capture my attentionso much is thatNoster because data cannot be siledcannot be okay it's facebook.com or it'stwitter.com data transcends any kind ofsilo uh the network effects of anythingthat happens in Noster benefitthe whole ecosystem of Nosterthe thing is thatwhen you put the current experience ofusing Noster against the experience ofusing Twitterit depends on who you are but 98 of thepopulation or probably 99.9 percent ofthe population are going to say wellTwitter is so much better because myfriends are there Facebook is betterthan other because my friends are thereum so it's a really hard pitchespecially when you go to people and yousay well censorship assistance I thinkthat's a horrible horrible pitch becauseno one cares about censorshippersistence no one is getting bad no onegetting Shadow ban is the sliver of thepopulation that cares about these thingsuhumuh Edward Edward Snowden did therevelations everybody's still usingFacebook no one caresumbut when you think that Noster has somany different widely differentapplications which each one of themmight have its own network effects thefact that each Network effect so forexample I wrote subster which is like aSpotify type of client where you canpublish your music you can get paid youcan create playlists so if you create acool playlist you will get paid everytime someone is listening to thatplaylist and then the artists aregetting paid as well Etc and then Iwrote highlighter.com which is kind of asimilar idea where you can it's likewhen you can use medium.com read wiseand you can capture the stuff thatyou're reading that you find valuableand you can keep it there you can keepit on highlighter.com but the fact thatthey are not uh Asylum the fact thatthere is everything is happening onNosterany kind of network effect thatsubstance might get or that highlightermight create it will feedback into thewhole ecosystem right so maybe peoplewill come to Noster because ofKnowledge Management tools that arecross-compatible with your music playeror maybe someone will come because thereis a market that sells this art thatthey like you know like painting fromMaddox for exampleum and you will start using Nosterbecause of this one company use caseand then you might start discovering thewhole thinggo back to the beginning of thismonologue is that the reason I seeNoster healing the Facebook and theselarge institutions largeum uh these large companies is thatwithin a Noster world you cannot createa multi-billion you know 100 billiontype of organization becauseyou cannot uh keep the the users and thedata hostage which is what every singlecompany up till now has been doing youuse Evernotethe value that you create is compatiblewith Evernote you go to notionthey'll keep that in Evernote is deadokay yes you can export whatever thevalue of the information is not on thedata that you wrote is on the links ofthe information right that's that's whatidea is right idea is the connection oftwo different thingsum so you go to you transition to notionand the work that you've been doing inEvernote has is that you transition fromnotion to ROM research your your valuethat you accrue within notion is deadum butbecause you know that if you leaveEvernote your data will die your thevalue of that data will die there is alarge incentive to not leave a burnoutthere is an incentive for Evernote tosay well we need to raise your priceswell we need to collect some data togive you some adsum that kind of user of use is notpossible with enough because you the thecompanies within Noster they always havethe gun to the head like the miners inBitcoin they always have the gun to thehead of I can live at any timeat no pain to me yeah no I totallytotally agreeum and you know it's interesting asyou're as you're saying that andrelevant to our discussion earlier abouthowyou know a protocol so you knowsomething you interact with on theinternet can influenceyour psychology your mindset yourperspective how you act pretty muchseemingly you know things that are veryfundamental about you and we were justdiscussing this umyou know how having to uhcome to grips with your situation causesyou to contort yourself to fit that sothat the tension of of being there isn'ttoo destabilizing and you you thinkabout where we are today and your yourcomments on uh you know kind of theInstinct for Authority you havepolitical jurisdictions that you'renestled within right and you'rebasically a prisoner of that tax youhard to leave all the rest of it that weall knowbut everything Downstream of that almostoperates on the same model as you'resaying so like what Twitter wants you tobe is a Twitter prisoner because that'show they can extract the most value fromyou perhaps slave is the better metaphorwhatever but you get the point and likepart of and every everyone does that andand I think part of the cultural issuesthat we see emerging is kind of likeyou know everyone is Stockholm syndromein so many different like places likeyou you you almost get like Stockholmsyndrome PTSD from Twitter and Facebookand Google and Evernote and all thethings you interact with online and thenyour meet space institutions that you'resubject to and the governance modelsthat you're within and no wonder thatcauses like a like a weirdDistortion of your perspective becauseyou're you're a prisoner on so manydifferent levels and yes you you getsome kind of value back and that's whyyou make that proverbial deal with thedevil but you're stillyou're still locked in and one of theinitial things that just blew my mindabout Nostra I was like okay so we havean open protocol that anybody cancontribute to we have like you knownative censorship resistant frictionlesspayments basically built in or you knowwill beand then you have a type of identitythat can move between like Servicesclients apps seamlessly and not have anyloss as a result of doing that be ableto like bring what you've accrued toyour identity with you wherever you goand like the first thing the first likeEpiphany to me was like wow the thehow much is that going to acceleratedevelopment because competition is goingto be so much more pure it's like okayyeah Damas is like awesome right now andI love it but if another one is betterthen I'll probably use that more or youknow like you'll just be able to hoparound so and of course that's lessbeneficial to your would-be uh captorsbut it's much better for you because youget to just make choices based on whatis literally the best solutionirrespectiveof what you have to give up or lose as aresult of making those changes and soyou know when that landed in my brain Iwas like wow like how fast is this goingto happen and what are going to be thetype and scale of solutions but it alsomakes me think you know this this wouldbe a question for you as a builder inthe spacehow does it influence theyou know this sort of structure ofthings influence the economicsand the incentives of building somethingin the space you know because you're notcollecting all the Sheep into a pen allyour prisoners and then saying to publicmarkets VCS what have you likelook what we can squeeze out of allthese over the next 10 yearsright you're basically saying is it justSAS flow business models like hey ifpeople use our clients you know we takea cut of the payments that are happeningthrough our our client and that's thebusiness model and we can't reallyyou know I'm sure there'll be other waysto figure out monetization but like wecan't Clump everyone together and sellyou sell the future value of you to someentity and you know cash out in that wayyou know that's that model seems to bebasically turned on its head so what doyou think is Will how will economics bekind of influenced in in this newparadigmwhich which were before answering thatwhich what you're getting at has beenthe case for the past two decades thepast two decades has has been aboutcreate something that gets millions andmillions and millions of usersdon't worry about monetization don'tever charge anyone anything just getusers just grow just hockey stick growthuh and you'll find a way to abuse yourusers at some point it doesn't matter sothat's absolutely secondary absolutelyjust minor information and like who noone cares about that partumand but with regards to your questionthe monetization I mean obviously I'vebeen thinking a lot about monetizationum and the the thought that continuouslyPops to my mind is thatNoster the nature of Noster is stillwidely unknownin the same way that Bitcoin in 2011 and2012 other than a couple of Illuminatithat said oh this is going to disruptcentral banks uh it was oh censorshipassistant PayPal cool you know like itwas very very very very easy tounderstand Bitcoin and they're a levelone thinking right like you see it ohokay so PayPal butumbut if you started thinking aboutmonetizing Bitcoin back back in 2011 youwould haveum probably arrived to and that's whathappened you you would arrive to wrongconclusions and I think with investorit's kind of the same thing whereit's too early in the discovery phase ofwhat Noster is to think aboutmonetization and I speak I speak withthe founders of uh within Noster andlike Builders and the people that aremaking things uh very very regularly uhalmost daily I have like a one hour ortwo hour long call where I go for a walkwith this other person and we justdiscuss all these thingsand whenever I I talk to someone that isthinking oh maybe I should charge forthis thing I try to dissuade them fromfocusing too much on that so for exampleI one founder uh wanted to charge foruser uploads uh for picturesand the the fact is that no one's gonnapay for that because it's it's it's it'sit's not you cannot really have abusiness based on on that uh maybesomeday probably not but not at thispoint and at this point it's not goingto affect your bottom line in any waylike maybe you'll get if it goes wellmaybe you'll get like 100 bucks a monthif it goes well which I I don't think itwould get anywhere near near thatumso the way I think isa I don't think within those three youcan have what I was saying before Idon't think you can have uhyou know hundreds or hundreds ofbillions like a Facebook level companymaybe there is uh I think there iscertain approaches that will yield uhvery nice business a very verysuccessfuluh organizationbut I don't think any any nostrilcompany will get to that massive scalewithyou know 10 or 20 or 30 50 000 well howcould how could they because if someonedoes something great another one just belike well copy that and add or subtractthis and everyone can just go overseamlessly soHow Could You precisely II well you can't then that's that's thewhole point right but but what I thinkis that that model is actually deadoutside of Noster as well I think thatmodel will not come backumand maybe interest rates going up is thefinal nail in the car fund I mean wewe've seen what what all this growth uhunicorn companies have been doing withtheir their Tech teams like they'vesloshed everybody they've been firingpeople uh all over the place andand I thinkinterest rates might come down mightmight come back down uh it's just intime for Noster to have shown what it isand destroyed that model anywayum but the fact is that right now Nosteris so small it's minusculebut it has compounding effects acrosseverything that can be done on theinternet whatever you can think that canbe done on the internetis probably better at doing itand when you think that Network effectsmultiply on all the use casesthe world that I see is a world whereall these applications that we're usedto using online will be not the clientswhich means that if Facebook at somepoint is if Facebook tries to competehead to head with the network effects ofNosterFacebook Facebook will get absolutelyobliterated same thing for Twitter Ithink Twitter will very very likely endup or deador a Twitter club or another client Ithink that's where we're going so thismassively big companies with thismassively capitalized companies I thinkthere is no space for them withinanother or outside of anotherit's so interesting man because like itmakes you think okay wellwhat is going to make a user stay with aparticular clientand it seems like the only answer ishow good the experience is right likedoes it have the things that I want inthe way that I want them and the secondthat it doesn't why would I Stayand and isn't that beautiful isn't thatwhere we want competition to happenright and that's the mind-blowing thinglike imagine how more much more quicklythe Solutions in the market will caterto those preferences rather than as wekeep saying like you know Twitter orFacebook or Instagram gets you sucked inwith something and then they're likegotcha and now you can't goanywhere so there's like they don't haveto respond you know as much to to yourdesires and stuff but like in this theydon't have to respond at all to yourdesires like they could sure they cancheat on your face like they could notcare less about your desires like youhave if you have a hundred thousandfollowers on Twitter or a millionfollowers on Twitterand that's your primary way ofcommunicating with your audience theyown youin recent years we've seen what happensto people that get kicked off of Twitterit's like they are unpersoned it's likewhat happened to that person oh theythey were just kicked off Twitter forlike the last two years oh I you know Ithought they were he died basically Ididn't I didn't even know they stillexisted you know which is so that's partof what makes well that's part of thereason why there's an incentive and aneed for something like Noster becausethat's so scary that you know not notonly just all the time you've put intoyou know getting your followers let'ssay but just that you can be so easilyunpersoned like oh you said the wrongthing counter regime whatever theboom you're gone and right now maybethere's a more benevolent dictator incharge and Elon but you know how howlong will that persist you know and willit soman it's uh it's so fascinating I knoware you tight on time do you have I'mgood yeah I'm still good yeahum what was I gonna ask next oh you knowjust to finish the the point that I wasmaking or we were both making about theprisoner sort of dynamicimagine whatyou know what really excites me is kindof like how people's minds work and howpeople are influenced by different ideasand ethics and values and principles andhow they act them out and all that stuffuh if we're operating under theassumption and I think it's at leastpartially true that like thisarchitecture that you find yourselfwithin the architecture of incentivesand power and authority influences howyou think the emotions that emergewithin you who you become all that kindof stuff and we're kind of making thecase that the current architecturehas a lot of negative attributeswhat happens when you combine like whatwe you know what Bitcoin is and I thinkwe've both talked about like how Bitcoininfluences your mind changes behaviorsreassesses values all that kind of stuffwith you know combining it with thisarchitecture another Freedomarchitecture that is Noster isn't itexciting to consider the effect theimpact that that degree of Freedom willhave and what what enables that freedomwhat constitutes it like all that goesinto it will have on people's minds youknow like in in to use it over an overlyused term recently but to like to breakfree from The Matrix basically to likeinculcate you know a more open a morefree a more clear mind about life or orreality generally like it's just it'ssuper exciting to think howthese solutions that we just talkedabout like a better what's a betterclient for social media or for music orfor video or for whatever the fact thatit can like it's soyou're so free to choose and it's socapable at catering to your preferencesthe marriage of those two things like Ijust think are going to instill inpeople such a profound sense of agencyof freedom of creativity of you know allthat kind of stuff and I I meanI mean I was already on board for kindof Renaissance 2.0 as a result ofBitcoin right and I think we we all kindof thought that something like thiswould emerge as a result of that it'sjust really cool to see that it appearsto be emerging now and that it has legsand there's enthusiasm around it I meanI guess one obvious question is justwhat are the risks or you know what aretheumyou know in all this Rosy talk aboutsomething like this you know what arethe downsides risks flaws all that kindof stuffone of the things that I've observedumrecently is how quicklythe conversation aboutumchanges on the algorithm of Twitter orGoogle for for that matter becauseGoogle has been doing this for many manyyearsum how quickly everybody's in sync withoh I'm seeing this a lot or why is thison my feedumand I wonder a lot what happens with theumthe these algorithms that everybody insome way I mean Loosely speakingeverybody is in some ways plugged ininto these algorithmsso if you think about it there is umthere is athe experience that we every person thatis have their life around the aroundusing the internet frequently uh whichis most of usour experience is very homogeneousumbecauseyou you interact with with the algorithmthe code of the algorithm is the same itmight be the experience that it yieldsit might be tailored in different waysto to your the data that it's mine fromyour behaviorbut the the code of the algorithm is thesameso we've been operating for the past10 years or so under these uhnormalizing function across Societyand it's a bit of an unknown whathappens when you have GlobalCommunications becauseit used to not be the case that we hadthis normalization before the internetwe we didn't all were affected by thesame algorithm uh a hundred years agoright from Japan to whatever toArgentinaum so societies could be much moreheterogeneousbut at the same time we didn't haveGlobal Communications instant freeGlobal Communications a hundred yearsago so I wonder I it's a it's an unknownuh but what happens when when you getGlobal Communications but you don't geta normalizing function over every singleperson that is plugged into the internetum I I don't know I I think these thingshave so many uh unknowns unknowns like Ican feel the unknowns unknowns I canthink of a few known unknownsumlike when you when you think about thefact that the data that that inhabitsNoster is completely liquid and there isno container uh separating this datathe amount of innovation that isDownstream from the fact that you cangrab the musicum listening behavior of all yourfollowers and you mesh that with thetype of books that your followers arereading and commenting on and havingconversations aroundit used to be that you have good readsit used to be that you have Spotifythose were separated there was no way ofhaving one person grabbing the data andinteracting with the data combining itin different shapes it was completelyimpossible maybe you can get some kindof deal with Spotify and Goodreads shareinformation and there is like a team of50 Engineers working on but it it wasnot you could not do that spontaneouslythroughout every single different usecaseand the amount of innovation that canoccur from the fact that one person cangrab all that information because it'spublic informationas much as you as the person who wantsto make that information publicum you can grab all that informationmesh it in different ways and cut it andand havesuch a pretty much an infinite amount ofdifferent Community combinations and wayto explore this dataumwhat what happens whenyour experience of how you dothe Public Square type of communicationthe Noster uh the the Twitter type ofexperience what happens when you areinteracting with that data in somethingthat looks like a like a 3D Galaxyexploration game there is one clientthat does display of notes instead ofjust like the typical feedthey they do like stars and you cannavigate to a Galaxy and that Galaxy ispeople that are talking about dance orabout music like hip-hop like Frenchhip-hop and you go to that Galaxybut the person that you're interactingwith they're in the typical experiencelike it it's the the uh the the level ofhow heterogeneous these experiences canbeit's absolutely massive rightumbutI I don't know what's Downstream fromthat I don't know what's the sideeffects of doing these things it mightbe terribleit might you know you could characterizelike the overarching shift and I'm suremany haveis you because you keep saying like onceinformation is on siled you know likeobviously more and more of our lives arebecoming digitized right it's becominginformation the value that we ascribe tothings the tools we use software'seating the world right it's been theTrope for a long timebut in that in a world where informationI mean you can attempt to Silo it butwhat we're finding is you can't reallylike there'll always be a way to unsiloinformation you know in from marginalcosts of replicating information isbasically zero can be transmitted at thespeed of light like what the what areyou ultimately going to do about thatand soyou know the bigger question is what isthe ultimate effect of anything that'sinformation based being completelyUnshackled basically and I mean we couldget really Cosmic with that and say welleverything is ultimately informationbased like even meet space isinformation and so what happens whenuh when that is increasingly andincreasingly Unshackled like a verysimple one that you know many peoplehave opinions on in terms of theauthority of the state but it's like IPright and and uh trademarks and uhpatents and stuff like wellthat's just information you know and theability to enforce the use of thatinformation what happens when you justit's so easily available you you justcan't the cost of enforcement is toohigh you cannot enforce that so whatwhat happens then when information is soeasily accessible and usable like wellover the course of time that structureof stewarding and enforcing access toinformation will just go away becauseit's too too costly to enforce so thenhow does the how does the treatment ofIp happen now presumably back to whatwe're saying about competition it'lljust be subject to Market forces likesorry that information is out therewho's going to use it the best and yesyou won't be able to ring fence it likewe were talking about Twitter andFacebook and these companies that takethat approach so your proceeds fromusing a certain set of information willpop will probably be less in the futurebut them is the breaks right this thisfreedom is coming forevery all informationso is Noster just kind of another stepin that inevitable progression towardsliberating informationI I think I think no sir is the vehiclethat makes the the fact that informationappears to be free it makes that effectumit makesum Compound on itselfum because you can do all these crosslinking of of information and andyou can you can there is this conceptthat thatum informationback from from the the days of thecreation of the web that content can canbe addressable uh you can have a URLright in a new link and you go fromdocument a and document a is mentionedin document B and there's there's a linkso this this relationship and then thisgraph starts to to emergeand what nothing gives you is that sametype of graph of course absolutelyeverything no it's just website ABSabsolutely everythingumso I I absolutely think and soaround 10 ish years ago there was thisconcept of the semantic web which whichwas a way of um fixing uh the issue thatthese siled companies started started toget wherethere was no no way of getting uhstructured data of like an Amazonproduct for example you go to amazon.comand you see this listing of whateverum you know whatever clothesandthat the data that those were clothes uhyou know it's a pink shirt for examplethat datalived within within uh Amazon so whatcompanies that wanted to start using thedata in some way they started scrapingthe data which is the the the action ofdownloading the data programmable wayand trying to infer being shared youknow so you try to get this data in waysthat you can represent the data indifferent waysso a fewyears ago the semantic web started wherethe idea was to post the same websitewith the same information but have thedata that this is a pink shirtstructured within document in a way thatthe users don't see it but if I downloadthe HTML the code of the website I cansee picturedumand ultimately the semantic webcompletely failedum I was kind of involved on creatingthings around the semantic web back backin the day but the effort made no sensebecause the person that has the datalike amazon.com has no benefitwhatsoever ofgiving competitors their their cataloggiving competitors the reviews thedescriptions like all these differentthings that's very very valuableinformation for amazon.com that givescompetitors at Bayumso there was an incentive for people toconsume the data but not in an incentivefor people to create this structureddata Noster by by default is structuredsoyou as the contentum as the platform if you will that isproducing these Amazon listings or thesethingsyou are benefiting from the fact thatthere is this vast amount of data so forexampleum a few weeks ago there was this newapplication that came out that isum like uh it's called webman and it's ait's like uh like a a Walkman but forfor music right so they posted a bunchof songsthat you could use interacting with thatwith uh that application now I havesubster so I could very easily integratethe data that they producedand they can integrate the data that Ithat I produce now if we share the sameuh way of storing the data we the thethere is no integration it just happensmagicallyum which is where things are movingbut the fact is thatwhat man benefited from substance andsubstance benefited from from weapon sowe all we both have the incentive toshare this data to make this dataaddressableumand and and the fact is that these theseum this again this unsilon of the dataisum beneficial for everybody thatbenefits and it's detrimental for anyonethat doesn't interact with the data inthis way there will be the point whereFacebook and Twitter and and Amazon ifthey don't integrate with industrialdata they will just perish because therewill be enough momentum of the data inthe network that will absolutelyobliterate themyeah I just I think the consequences ofinformation being liberated or just likeyou said they're kind of a lot ofunknown unknowns there because it'sinformation is is everything and ifwe're almost likethe pace thethe pace of liberating informationat least relevant information to ourlives is like growing exponentially whatkind of impacts does that have and likeyou know what are the adjustments goingto be for everything you know like as wesaid ethics and morals and everythingbefore like just a simple example likelet's say in a prior environment let'ssay with mute music or something like ifyou you have some sort of Ip rights tomusicum and they can be enforced then theprevailing ethic might be like well thenthey should be like enforced it's fairfor someone who creates music to benefitfrom their creation and like I I cantotally see and probably agree with thatargument but if you find yourself anenvironment like Well it can't beenforced so what's the ethic now it'slikehmmlike I well I still think they shouldbenefit somehow but maybe not as much asthey were imposing before and this iskind of the idea of how value for Valuemight emerge you know a lot of peopleprobably dismiss it now because like whywould I pay for something I can get forfree but I feel like it's going to kindof chew on people's moral sensibilitiesa little bit more than they might beexpecting because you'll be in alandscape wellit's at your fingertips you can take itfor free but would you walk into a storeand like well bad example because it'sphysical but you know what I'm sayinglike would youdo you not think the person that'sgiving you value deserves anything backyou know sure you get to choose up toyou what do you think but like thatseems like where we're going and that isdefinitely at least a you know anethicalshift of some kind you know becausebefore the consideration was lessI I I think when when you get top downrules and you get accustomed to youliving your life via obeying top-downrules your moral compass gets completelyobliterated because you don't have todevelop one like you just follow therules if the rules are thereit that's that's morality moralityequals rules yeah andperhaps the current Global society thatthat we that we live in uh have themoral compass way towait wait underdeveloped absolutelybut perhaps this information thisFreedom of Information this yes you cansteal thisuh yes you can reload on on these thingsyou can have like the experience thestrategy of the comments uh might changethat if you see a song that you like andeverybody does that song and no one iscontributing back to the artist wellthat song that you were enjoying willstop being producedum but but going back to the realitything is is it's just we are soobstructive fromreal world consequences but we're justnot used to these things we're just notused to having consequences from ourfrom our actions we expect that if we dosomething dumbif we are not careful we can sue thegovernment because we tripped on thesidewalk that's absolutely ridiculouslike pay attentionracingpositionumbutand and when you get in that in andthat's where we find ourselves rightwhen when you're when you luckthe uh the development of a moralcompass then the moral compass becomesthe law and then your subject ofbecoming a pawn for tyranny when a turnis the one thingestablishing establishing the uh thelaws there's um I I read this a fewyears ago but there was um I'm sure youyou've read this on the duty of CivilDisobedience uh Harry Thoreau and and hewas going on on it's absolute supershort read very very very muchrecommended and one of the things thathe was saying is that the the person hehe the book pretty much talks about thisand the person that confuses the themorality with with rules uh it that'sthe most dangerous person that's theperson that willdo whatever is being told to do out offear yeah and and out of having no nomoral compass and that's where we wherewe are right like we are in a placewherenobody has to develop any kind of Ethicsor even even talking about these thingsis weird yeah and andeven if they had them although you couldmake the case that to truly have themthese two things are have to go hand inhand but even if you recognize them insome degree the courage toespouse them or to stand like to staytrue to them is also totally lacking Imean we the best example is obviouslycovet the the code is I mean it's likeit's just insanehow many people fall into the very youknow circumstance that you justarticulate like it's it's perfect andit's terrifying because it was mostpeopleyou know I think God or whatever forthose courageous principled people thatresisted that and didn't you know didn'tfall into that and stayed true to theirown principles and their own decisionmaking and all that kind of stuffbecauseyou know perhaps that was consequentialin in how far things went you know if ifif more if if everyone instead ofeighty percent of people had were sosubject to that kind of uhmental perversion that you know that youjust described uh maybe that form oftyranny and again like when I hate touse that term because people think it'sjust like it's it's always top down butobviously this is a relationship youknow you people hunger for it in acertain sense as we've been exploring inthis conversation and soyou know if that was more maybe maybethat thing would have spiraled even moreout of control and uh and obviouslywe're not out of the weeds yet I meanthere's still a lot of you know uhaspects of that that are bubblingbeneath the surface and above thesurface and everyone has to be vigilantabout the thing that I you know wouldtalk about with family members andfriends the whole time is this verynotion it's like what do you believe isright or wrong what is your ethicalgrounding what are your values andprincipleswhere basically where is the Line in theSand and then when it's met what are yougoing to dobecause it's not your Line in the Sandif you're just going to re be pushedback and redraw it then it's not andmost people are very uncomfortable andunwilling to admit they don't have aLine in the Sand it's not therethey will be pushed by the edge of thecliff behind them if necessary becausewhat it takes to draw that linethey're not willing toto pay that price basically[Music]effect of the fact thatwe have themthis notion of the truth is somewhere inbetween right like everything needs tobe met withit's not of the extreme it's not it'sit's not as bad as you're saying rightso because you have these moralflexibilityum you are you you will never be able topin down person and all and tell themlike you're saying where is this the theLine in the Sand because the way mostpeople see it the line of the sun shouldbe redrawn constantly becauseI mean this is peroxiology right peopledon't want to act from from firstprinciples people want to just simplyreact to the circumstances of today andI do wonder how much of this is drivenby the algorithms and the algorithmstelling peoplebecause we've seen how quickly withCorona uhopinions changed it was within a matterof days it went from no one cares thisis nothing don't panicto we're all going to die we all need toget 16 vaccines in the eyes rightumit went extremely extremely quickly andit's a it's a a beautiful beautifulShowcase of how effective these what wewere discussing earlier about thehomogeneousum Society Global Society these theselayer of normalization across everysingle person that is imposed uh with aclick of buttonum that's so scary so I I do water in anostal world where there is nothere is no algorithm that is dictatinguh the way you relate to information to99 of the human populationcan uh can uh a Corona effect happen cana shift of point of view andnormalization of point of views happenin the in this in this way I truly thinkthat it can'tyeah you may be right and I it alsomakes me think likewell maybe a more natural so-calledalgorithm is able to emerge through thatspace you know and then we get into thethe god discussion which we don't havetime for today but you know like whatwhat is that thing that's coming throughas an ethic when the landscape is soflattened and open to and and lackingthat manipulation of today's algorithmslike what kind of emergent ethicactually comes through and where doesthat come from you know it's a superjuicy question but just last point on ontheand what we've been saying here isI think part of it is that for so manypeopleself-preserveself-preservation as a minimum andself-aggrandizement and all that kind ofstuff as a as a maximum butself-preservation trumps everything andthat's part of the problem I think and Ithink that's whywe talked about meditation before andall these various perspectives you canhave practices you can engage in thatallow you to separate from ego to adegree again not to not to kill it notto disregard it but to to be the masterof it rather than be the servant of itI think that's part of the reason whythose things have been so important forall of history is because ifself-preservation is your primary goalthen you will be led down the road toservitude you will be able to beconvinced of anything because as long asyou don't need like get as long as youdon't kill me thenlike I'll do what you say versus youknow you we look back on historyand we look at Heroes and martyrs andphilosophers and Warriors and stuff andin hindsight we glorify them becausethey were ones that said the primarything is not self-preservation it'sadherence to some Eternal or fundamentalvalue or principle maybe it's love maybeit's truth maybe it's Freedom maybe it'swhatever those are some of the big onesobviously but to say I'll lay down mylife for the preservation and for myadherence to this principle because thatis actually that act is more importantthan just my meat sack persisting for afew more years into the future andyou know obviously in the world todaythe value of that and the appreciationfor thatseems tobe in Decline and I'm very excited andhopeful thatthe tools that are emerging at ourdisposal and you know frankly peoplelike you and I and all the other peoplethat are willing to explore these ideasand that there's interest in them areactually happening more and more thinkmakes me extremely optimistic evenagainst the backdrop of the last twoyears and all the power structures andinstitutions that we're still ultimatelynestled with them but it's likeit's so encouraging that it seems likethe momentum is gathering foryou know these tools and thesediscussions and these ways ofreconstituting your behavior and youknow what what could be the cause ofGreater Hope than thatI mean I couldn't couldn't say Icouldn't agree more with what you'resaying andI am ridiculously optimistic with wherewe're going and the fact is thatin a sense is is it's kind of relievingthe experience of discovering Bitcoinwhere you realize that you do not needto wait for hyper bitcoinization toenjoy the benefits of using Bitcoin youdon't have to wait for to be go to everysingle coffee shop and pay with Bitcoinlike that that's that doesn't matterright at all you can experience hyperrecognization yourself you canexperiencethe fruits of aligning with Bitcoin andrecognizing what it is and recognizingthat you are not bitcoin's master andthat no one isyou can experience right now it's thereit's just out for you to pick it up andgrab itum and and in the same in the same way Ithink we're in a pointumin in history where and and in in worldaffairs where you can very easilyexperience an extremely free life if youjust chose just choose to grab a donedone uh Prince he has the the chooselife I actually read that book beforebefore starting the world schooling uhlifeum that's awesome you can you can yeahyou can literally choose life like youcan choose a a life or pursuing freedomand aligning yourself with freedom youdon't need to wait for every singleperson in the world to be liberated inthis way uh you don't need all thepeople to say well I'm not going to useGoogle anymore because it's evil I'm notgoing to use Facebook anymore I'm notgoing to sell my data for to Whatsapp orto telegram or to whatever it might be Ican choose to act that way yeah at leastin 90 of my life I can do or 95 of mylife 100 I can choose to act in this wayand reap the benefits now and thebenefits will only continue to to to toto increase but you can take thosebenefits now if you don't like the workthat you're doingand it this seems because and it's funnybecausea couple of years ago I I I I was uhworking on projects that were notworking whatsoever and I I had to lookfor a job which I thought that I wouldnever look for a job again in my lifebut I had to go and and look for a job II just so happened to find a really cooljob at a Bitcoin butum but I had a a minds of scarcityum ofI needed to reduce the amount of entropyin my life so where is the next paycheckcoming rightum and and the fact is that to a largedegree you have so like people have somuch more agency in creating abundancein their lives if they simply choose toseek abundance but if you have ascarcity mindset you will leave ascarcity life it's it's it in whicheverway you see life it's a self-fulfillingprophecy you can see the world that thisharsh place where there are noopportunities and you need to you knowuh go through these horrible horriblejob commute but we were discussingbefore recording just commute which isan absolute Life Soul crushing activitythat millions and millions of people doon a daily basis it's sohorrible you simply can choose not to doit ever again and just don't good now ifyou choose thatthere are a side responsibility rightyeah there's a responsibility you justneed to man up and take thatresponsibility and act accordingly butyou don't like the way your governmentis treating you you don't like the factlike I didn't like in Spain that thegovernment didn't allow me to to leavemy house so I left Spain if youif you don't accept it don't accept itbut then don't just pitch online justact accordingly yeah I think it's agreat point and it's it's entirelymore logical and practical right becauseyou know dreamers Visionaries uhdon't like either of those sort oflabels but people that think that thefuture can be better and they have kindof an idea for howtend to be kind of idealistic right likethere's not enough freedom in the worldand we need more prosperity and peaceand stuff but as you're saying I meanit'll never be to the point where it'sperfect like you won't just wake up oneday and be likethere we go it's all good everywhere nono no anywhere like there'salways going to be problems and even ifyou've resolved a ton of them you'rejust going to move the goal post onceagain to be like well yeah but the thepeople on Mars aren't so happy now so wegotta you know we can't be we can'tsettle until they are and if you have ifyou don't balance that properly thenyou'll always as you said kind of be inthat sort of scarcity mindset or thatthings aren't good enough or you knowthe they don't compel you forwardsufficiently but they don't compel likethe best out of you so I think everyonehas to find that balance so stillstriving for you know an ideal of acertain kind whether it's personally orsocially or economically and you know bemoving toward that and have that pullyour potential out of you but also notallow it to rob you of you know thecurrent time right not allow that torestrict the motivation you have forembodying some of those principles orvalues that we referred to earlier rightlike it's regardless of one yes you canchoose like there's a lot of optionalitythat exists in the world if there's noperfect option but the other aspect ofthat islike choosing regardless of circumstancethis is kind of the taken to its extremethis is like the Victor Frankl thingright like regardless of circumstancechoosing which values and principlesthat you are going to adhere to I.E howyou're going to act in whatevercircumstance so even if you do live inthe Communist formerly known asCanadabeing a little bit a little bit fishyjoking there but you know what I'msaying like even if you're there andit's getting you down there's still lotsof you know good around there's lots ofgreat people around there's lots ofthings you can do there's lots of beautyall that kind of stuff and I do you knowI'm definitelyI well I try to balance that becauseobviously you know I feel like sometimesit's too easy to focus on the negativesor the things that are you know holdingone back or at least you know you'reallowing yourself to believe thatthey're holding you back and I thinkit's important to kind of reset and beyou know try to be more honest withyourself frankly and be like yeah maybethose are problems but don't putyou know take the responsibility for itI guess it comes back to that right likeyou still have that responsibility todetermine how you act and what you'regoing to contribute your your time andresources to and umyeah so I think that's wise advice thatuh despite how things may be one there'sa ton of amazing things happeningand two you know it's always on you tomake the choice about how you respond uhlast one because it's also it's alsoyou're you're just it's also your choiceon where you put your attention I thinkthese this is very very very oftenum notuh stressed enough is that if you focuson the things that are that suck aboutyour surroundings then you're justmaking those things stronger and havinga larger way larger effect on onyourself so if you're down like smile II do that very very very oftenum where you just change your posture uhwhen you're stressed out or whatever oror like I I climb uh very often so I Ideal with fear in a in a daily basis I'mvery used to like that that rough yearI'm gonna die and if you smile at pointI it literally I don't know what it doesI've read that it does does these thingschemical the brain whatever I don't knowif that's the case maybe it's possiblewhatever it might be but you literallyjust instead of focusing your attentionof this fear that you're feeling youaccept that fear is there and then yousmile and it creates like this weirdconnection of it's not like uh like umwhat's it calledum like a thrill seeking junkie orsomething but you you you find you'reable to find Focuson the thing on the task at hand becauseof the fear like that fear grounds youto that moment and you're not justthinking about something else you arelike okay I'm scared I like I don't wantto die so I need to focus on executingat this this at this point in time yeahI couldn't agree more and you know partof the reason for not wanting to subjectmyself give my focus to let's say theTwitter algorithm because it puts in myface a bunch of stuff that brings medown you know and I you you have to kindof be more I want to be more protectiveover my attention and cognizant you knowI thinkcheesy wrote in one of his recentarticles but like it's an apt way tocharacterize how we use attention andthat we pay it and that whatever we payit to benefits from that you knowbecause we're limited and because wewhen we devote our attention tosomething it costs us time andopportunity cost what we what we givethat attention to receives the benefitsso why would you focus on things thatobjectively you might say areyou know that you don't want or that arebad or that are you know non-productivein some capacity soyeah self-help book on the shelves inmany places I'm sure uh Pablo what's mylast question and thank you for theextra time because I know we're way overbut what just like you're building a itseems like a ton of like I feellike every day I see something I know sowhere you're like oh I just built thisfor that which is incredible in itselfbut uh what like in terms of clients orwhat's got you jazzed up about uh anyparticular thing happening in Noster aswe speak on uh May 9th 2023.now we're working on without the onethat has captured my my imagination themost is this highlighter.com that I'mbuildingum which is uh right now the the ux isabsolutely terrible because I it as Iwas implementing it the idea morph likesix timesthe base the base the bass premise isthat we have demos and amethysts and youknow like all the Twitter likeexperiences that the focus of the um ofthe client and the value of the data isthe real-time component of the data sothe data that you interact with in indemos tends to become stale the thevalue of the data tends to become staleso you want to see what people aretalking about right now not if they ifdemos were to show you what people saidsix months ago the feed is six monthsago it's not as valuablethe client that I'm building withhighlighter is is a client that focuseson the valuable informationso it's what you would use Evernote orwhat you would useum uh what's the other one a insta paperor pocket.com or these type of thingsthat you used to manage or or read wisethat's a good one uh is this type ofclient of application that you use tointeract with you're reading somethingthat you find interesting and youhighlight it right why are youhighlighting that well you'rehighlighting that because you considerthat that information that you're seeingis worthwhile keeping in some way it'sit it it resonated with you in some wayusually what happens is that informationgoes to your Evernote or to your notionor to your obsidian or to whatever itmight beand it just stays there it sits theremaybe every once in a while you'll goback and you'll look at those notesum but what happens if these notes areactually kept on an open protocol whathappens if other peoplecan see what's your reading what you'rehighlighting What notes are you takingso you've been reading CivilDisobedience and you wrote on the sideon the margin of the page you wrote Ohthis is interesting because blah blahblah blah blah that blah blah blah blahblah that's the gold like our our friendsvetsky he lent me a bookum uh when we went to Rigaso when they fly back I was reading thebook that he gave me a physical bookon the on this on the margin of the pageof each of multiple patients there werenotes that he wrote to me I opened thebook those are the notes that I'm goingfor the at first like my eyes directlygo thereuh because that's the interaction ofour friend Alex with that book it's notonly that book it's the interactionand I can if that data had been storedin Noster and highlighter that's wherehighlighter is going if that data hadbeen stored in in Noster I could have aconversation with Alex with you withGigi with anyonearound that conceptthat highlightthat idea that resonated with Alex andwe could all share a conversation aroundthat what kind ofinteresting ideas what kind ofconversation might happen what kind ofDiscovery might we find if we have thattoolso I've been talking with Gigi a lotabout these because I was gonna say thatGT's been talking about something likethis for a long timeand the fact is that we this was notpossible before Noster right so I uh afriend recommended I read uh an essayfrom Gigi that he had published like aweek ago uh two weeks now uh calledumpurple text orange highlights becausethe idea of orange highlights is I findsomething interesting in CivilDisobedience and I share it with youwell Henry threes did butum if he had been alive he could likeyou could send money to the Highlightthat I made because I'm bringing youthat quote and part of that money so inthe case of of Gigi I make a highlighton shishi's text and you see that andyou might send money to that highlightand that money is split between Gigi andmyself right now you share that withyour audience and now someone sees thatbecause you send that to your audienceand that the money that your other sensegoes to you to me to Gigi to anillustrator to whoever it might be andthere's a conversation that can happenhere's some idea right exactly exactlyso I read his article about uh this thisthis essay uh man I immediately startedworking on it immediately and then whenI published I was talking with him as Iwas working on it and then when Ipublished uh the the the application thefirst the first version of theapplicationhe uh we got in a call and we were justdoing a pleb walk just walking aroundand sharing ideas andthe the uhhow deep these ideas I have not finishedcomprehending yet I have I'm not at thebottom nowhere near the bottom but thesethis idea of highlightergives usand again highlighter is just client itcannot write you it cannot take yourdata someone might come and someone willcome and create a different experiencearound these highlights and you canexperience this communication thisconversation in a different waythe to me that excites me so much andand if you think about it you seeagain Evernote uh Google wave Romeresearch notion all these thingswhy why why do all these differentsystems for Knowledge Managementpersonal Knowledge Management Systemscontinue to emerge continue to becomepopular because we haven't reachedthe conclusion yet we haven't reachedthe right way of approaching these andthe fact is that the experience of howyou should interact withyour knowledge knowledgement managementsystem it's quite personalso the way I see it is we nothing givesus this Global pool of KnowledgeManagement of knowledge that we can allkeep and interact withandeach developer can create differentexperiences of how to interact and thoseexperiences will resonate in differentways with different people but they willalways be completely interoperable amongyour Knowledge Management minusmanagement sheets Knowledge ManagementandI I just see so much will so much valuebeing created in being able tobeing able to interact you know likehighlights for the most part are usuallythings that you think that they're worthwhile but they die like you don't keepthem in any way it's really hard to goback to the text than actuallyinteracting with them this gives us thisinteraction within the protocols it'sinsanemanI'm so excitedI just uh yeah I I can't waitwell I mean it's happening now so I justit's so great I guess it's the right wayto put it to be able to see all thishappening and these things emerge andthese Solutions being developed and thenlike I mean what you just said is arabbit hole in itself right we alwaystalk about the Bitcoin rabbit hole butlike whatso someone could think about what youjust said and really all these differentPathways would Branch out from it andthat's you know that's that's themind-blowing aspect of it and to thinkthat like now we're all on the precipiceof like a brand new rabbit hole you knowcombining the two rabbit holes togetherelements I mean it's justif Bitcoin was alike a catalyst for intellectualexploration and development and dreamingand whatever else beforethis is just you know added a tank ofgasoline onto the the little fire thatwas 100 100 that's that's where I'vebeen for the past couple of weeks it'sbeen oh my God this is absolutely insanelike getting my mind look so I've beenusing a highlighter and and one of thethings that I built is a way to organizelike once you have a bunch of highlightsyou want to organize them in differentways right so one of the things that Ibuilt is like uh like a lease managementsystem and then I started taking notesof feedback that people give me withinthose lists but because the feedbackthat people give meare actual nostril events I can havefrom my list of things toum you know like feedback uh from thatlist I can interact with the people thatgave me the feedback and I can seeconversations happening around my to-dolist for examplelike yesterday someone asked me to tomake a modification to something and Iresponded to that person from my to thelist application which is highlighter tothat person that person stopped me Inever received the sub all my to thelist application it's when you erasethis which is what they're trying to getyou to change right like this yeah yeahno no it's it's absolutely mind-blowingman wellI'm gonna have to chew on all that for awhile and watch how things progressbecausethere's so much to think about so we'llprobably have to do this again inanother uh I don't know six months sixmonths will probably be enough time forsome good stuff to talk but if thingshappen faster than maybe sooner but I uhalways great to chat with you man and Iappreciate you making the time today andgive me some extra time are you you'renot going to be in Miami next week areyou yeah yeah yeah I'm going to be yeahoh sweet all right well yes why don't weget together there and for a drink andcontinue the conversation somewhere loveit all right brother take care thanksagain you too thank you",
