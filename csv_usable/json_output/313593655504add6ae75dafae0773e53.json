to get this data foryourself you cango to the website in this qr code i'llalso put a link to the websiteat the cdc website that has this datain the description below this video butbasically what we're looking at hereis um starting in 2011 they do have databefore 2011but they use a different methodology soyou can't really compareum the previous data to this data andbeyond which is what we're doing in thisvideo but i'll put a link in thedescription belowalso to an older video of mine where itook all the data available at that timeand put it into one video but it'sa voiceless video so this is going to bewith some narrationanyways here we have the 2011obesity data from the cdc this is basedon body mass index or bmi and you canseethat pretty much all the states areparticipatingwell actually all the states areparticipating in this yearand um most of them are somewhere in thesay 20 percent to you know 30 percentmaybe up to 35 for some of the statesum in the south as well as a little bitof the midwestas far as the percent of the populationthat has obesityall right so we're going to now cyclethrough from year to yearstarting here again in 2011 up to 2019which is the most recent dataon the cdc website as of uh me recordingthisall right so here we have 2012. you'reseeing a little bit of a progressionherewhere we're getting much more of thesouth and midwestshowing that 30 to 35 percent obesityratesfor those states and we're progressingnow into 2013we have states now starting to show thegreater than 35 starting withmississippi in west virginiaand a good portion of the map is now inthis 30 to 35 percent rangewhere only a handful of states are inthis 20 to 25range that originally had a decentrepresentation on the map up to 2014again this uh this light green color iguess not light green the light greenwasn't on the map in the beginning thethe under 20was not there even in 2011 but anywaysthis thisgreen color is slowly uh fading away butit's still holding onbut a lot more of the country is now inthe 30 to 35 percentuh obesity prevalence uh ratesand we have another another statearkansasjumping in in the 35 percent abovecategory 2015marching along even more louisianaalabamanow in that greater than 35 category2016 um the green color is almostcompletely goneeverything is pretty much 25obesity prevalence rates or higher mostof it being the 30 to 35category 2017 progresses even more2018 progresses even moreup to 2019 which again is the the newestdata that the cdc website hascurrently on their website um andyou see that there's basically justwashington dc which is essentially justa single cityand colorado are the only two statesleft in that 20 to 205 category almost the entire mapis at 30 to uh or at least 30obesity rates or above there's a handfulleft in the 25 to 30range but this is what we're talkingabout when we talk about the obesityepidemic so let'skind of compare these uh across timethis is a gifimage showing mark the march from 2011to 2019but here's 2011. here's 2019 you can seea progressivedarkening and writing which with the waythey do their maps it meansgreater obesity prevalence so again thisis the obesity epidemic this is whatwe're talking about when people say theobesity epidemicit's a slow progression over time it's iguess it's not super slow because it'ssomething that's measurableyear by year where we're getting higherand higher obesity rates so within theunited states and this isn't just theunited states this is happeningin other countries around the world mostcountriesum where there's a fair amount ofincome median incomes fairly highare going to have issues with obesityat this point in time solet's get some summary data here soagain here's that 2019 mapuh the 2017-2018data collection period is the mostrecent that the cdc has on their websitefor sort of summarizing it so it doesn'tinclude this year 2019but 42.5 of the total u.spopulation was considered obese based onbmi or body mass index of 30 orgreater there was 31.1 percent of thepopulationwas overweight this is the category forbmi between 25and basically 30. and then if youcombine those two together73.6 percent of the population is eitheroverweight or obeseum and so that doesn't leave a whole lotof theyou know the slice of the us populationleftmost of the us population is eitheroverweight or obesethat leaves about 25 of the populationthat is notkeep in mind that if you look at the bmium scalethere's still the underweight categorythat would be in thatremaining you know 26 and 0.4 or sopercentum so if you were to be able to takethat out which i don't have that datathe cdcas far as i know don't doesn't providethat we're probably looking atless than a quarter of the populationthat has a normal weightum in the united states so that'sthose are really uh stark numbers umand what's even more dramatic is thatthis isso this these values are across allracial and ethnic groupssome of the racial and ethnic groups areactuallyseeing even worse numbers than thegeneral population is doingso why do we care about this um thereare a numberof diseases related to obesityso people with obesity are more likelyto get the diseases or conditions onthislist so hypertension type 2 diabetescoronary heart disease strokegallbladder disease osteoporoosteoarthritissleep apnea a handful of cancers andthenagain this is a this is a very shortlist this list could be much much longerthan thisthere's a lot of other conditions thatare also linked tohaving a high amount of body mass orbody fat and soobesity is something that we do need totry to combat against as a societyand also those of us in the exercise andsort of health professionsit's something we need to be aware ofand try tocombat against in our careers definitelysomething that we need to know is thereand we need to also learn how to measureit and how touh sort of again combat against it umthe next video i'll beuh putting out and i'll be linking to inthe description below this once iam able to get that out is going to beon some basic anthropometricmeasurementsthat are often used in order to assessweight statusbmi being the big one as well asdifferent ways of carrying weight thatmayincrease cardiovascular these risksone way or another so go ahead and checkout those links belowif you want to see any of those videos",
