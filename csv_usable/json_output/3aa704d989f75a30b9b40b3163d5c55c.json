Lightning payment volume surged by over 400% between Q1 2021 and Q1 2022.As the Bitcoin network grows both in monetary value and in number of users, so do the applications for the Lightning Network. In this article, we will explore the potential benefits for exchanges that choose to adopt the Lightning Network and how it can improve their value proposition.Why Haven’t More Exchanges Adopted Lightning?Let’s address the elephant in the room — if the Lightning Network is growing so rapidly, why haven’t more exchanges jumped on board? The answer lies in the incentives.Some exchanges may not be incentivized to enable cheap and reliable payments via Lightning, however increasing the speed of withdrawals and deposits will increases the overall economic activity for the exchange.When exchanges are prioritizing new features and services, they are probably preferring to add support for new blockchains, staking, or other features that can directly generate revenue. Lightning’s benefits are below the surface. Exchanges can increase overall velocity by providing instant deposits and withdrawals. When it comes to trading, timing is everything, right?The Benefits of Lightning Can No Longer Be IgnoredThere are numerous advantages to incorporating Lightning into an exchange:Competitive Edge on FeesIntegrating Lightning can give exchanges a competitive advantage by offering cheaper and faster deposits and withdrawals. This attracts new users, some of whom are sensitive to high on-chain withdrawal fees, like the one we are seeing right now, and encourages trading, driving more economic flow toward the exchange.Increased VolumeThe experience of Paxful, a peer-to-peer exchange showcases the potential for volume growth. According to the former CEO, Ray Youssef, Paxful’s weekly volume of deposits increased threefold after implementing Lightning in September 2021.Early Adoption by Major PlayersBitfinex was one of the first major exchanges to adopt Lightning back in 2019. It now controls the largest nodes on the network. Companies like Block’s Cash App and Microstrategy are already recognizing Lightning’s value proposition and developing enterprise Lightning solutions. Xapo became the first bank to adopt Lightning, and even the world’s biggest exchange Binance recently stated they are working on implementing the Lightning Network. This comes after Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong recently said they also have plans for implementing Lightning.Improved UTXO ManagementHaving Lightning as part of the value proposition can help exchanges with UTXO management.By enabling more efficient use of Bitcoin’s blockchain, Lightning can help reduce transaction fees and processing times and allow for the consolidation of multiple UTXOs into a single payment channel. Since Lightning transactions are off-chain, they do not require confirmation on the Bitcoin blockchain, making it possible to execute multiple transactions without adding to the UTXO set on the base layer.The Long Game: Preparing for Mass AdoptionExchanges that play the long game understand the importance of scaling. The few forward thinkers that choose to integrate Lightning will be perfectly positioned for the mass adoption that is coming with the fast-approaching bull run. Conversely, being unprepared for growth can backfire, leading to expensive withdrawals and congested, unusable networks (which we have seen in the past).Besides mitigating the risks associated with bull runs, adopting Lightning opens up the “medium of exchange” aspect of Bitcoin. The exchanges that are thinking long-term realize that integrating Lightning enables the foundation for a new economy fueled by a pristine asset and driven by open-source tools and an excellent user experience.However, setting up new infrastructure to support the Lightning Network can be challenging. To facilitate this, we launched Blocktank Instant, our Lightning payment processing service. It is designed to allow exchanges to offer Lightning deposits and withdrawals to their customers without needing to set up or maintain their own Lightning infrastructure.If you want to see Lightning integrated in the exchanges you use, let them know about Blocktank.
