enjoyed the uh coffeebreak or one quick note also just onthat there is the uh the art stage sothose of you who are interested to seethat art area just know he's he'sactually got to leave early today sohe's got an early flight so if you'reinterested make sure you go and checkthat out at some point in one of thebreaks um so next up we've got alongtime entrepreneur uh investor in thespace dan held he's been uh around along time he'sdone various bitcoin startups working atuh zeroblock blockchain.comuh interchangekraken uh and a bunch of things he's gotlots of insights to share and uh let'suh give it up for dan held[Applause]all right so i use this mic not theseones righteither oneall right i'll use this oneokay sothe title of my presentation today iscalled casino gamesyou will get triggered this will be atriggering presentationso if you're easily offended stickaround and you're going to be offendedokaymost of bitcoin's adoption was throughspeculationi know i know we wish it was otherthings we wish it waspeople using it to escape regimes uhoppressive regimes we wish it was peopleusing it tobuy things that were illegal becausebitcoin transactions are immutablehowever most bitcoin adoption is throughspeculationit's not a bad thing thoughin marketing there's a term called aviral loop a viral loop is a mechanismthat creates growth so how that worksthink about it this way like uh if irefer you to take an uberyou take an uber and then you refer yourfriend and they refer a friend that's aviral loopviral loops are a core mechanic of a lotof products and moneybitcoin has the same mechanic we getinto bitcoin we tell our friends aboutit those friends also tell their friendsabout it etcand this is a representation of how thatlooks so we've got speculation pricegoes upadoptionwinningsatoshi actually hypothesized thatbitcoin would be adopted in this mannerand he wrote this before bitcoin wasworth 10like before bitcoin is worth a penny andi think it's really telling becausesatoshi himselfthought that bitcoin's viral loop orspeculative mechanicwould lead to adoption so satoshi saysin this sense it's more typical of aprecious metal instead of supply chainto keep the value the same the supply ispredetermined and the value changes asthe number of users grows the value percoin increases it has the potential fora positive feedback loop as usersincrease the value goes up which couldattract more users to take advantage ofthe increasing valuea speculative a speculative loop thisisn't a bad thing it's not uhspeculation is not an evil thing it'sjust inherent to human beings there weareanimals after all we're notthese superior you know theseincredibly intelligent beans we we allspeculate whether it be in stocks bondsreal estate bitcoin etcwe all speculate we all feel that fearand and greedand so this chart's a little bitoutdated i couldn't find an updatedchart but an updated chart would havethe coinbase users atover10 mil100 million so this is just an early2021 is where we see that spikebitcoin and cryptocurrencies and cryptoassets did not become magically morethey did not have magically more utilitythey did not all of a sudden become muchmuch more usefulpeople just started to speculate and weseethat growth and that speculation drivegrowth across the board and the firstmetric i want to show are user accountsnow unique users for blockchains areincredibly hard to pull because uniqueaddresses aren't representative ofunique people but these are unique kycaccounts on coinbase which aredirectionally indicative of adoption andgrowthas we see in the early you know the 16to 17 cyclea hugely important this is cumulativeusers by the way a better chart wouldhave been more of the growth rate butthis gives you a pretty clear pictureso we we see most of this adoptionoccurring during speculative cycleswe also see fundraisingincrease exponentially during thesecyclesas we can see you know 2018we can see is ait's hard to see on this chart but it'sa magnitude higher than 2016 and 2017and then 2021 is even a magnitude higherthan 2018.things didn't become magically morebitcoin didn't become much more usefulin 2021it was due to a speculative cycle thatled to more fundraising occurring 25billion dollars in 2021.we also see this in liquidityuh through the speculative cycles 20172021bitcoin's liquidity gets deeper and thisis great because it can have more andmore market participants includinginstitutions now can participatebecause these institutions might want tobuy a billion or 10 billion dollarsworth of bitcointhrough these speculative cyclesbitcoin adoption growsbut we also see this occurring tooyou know across the board across allthese other crypto assets as well notjust bitcoinwe also see bitcoin core development andnow these are commits it's not exactly ait's a directional indicator ofpeople working on it but in terms ofbitcoin core funding i don't think we'veever been in a better spot than nowlots of companies sponsor bitcoin coredevelopersa lot of people personally sponsorbitcoin core development i'd say it'snever been better in terms of fundingum and then finally bitcoin's securitymodel is dependenton speculative cycles occurringas the price goes higher more peoplespeculate more people start to movebitcoin on chain more transactions whichequals more fees more security whichmakes bitcoin a better moneybitcoin's long-term security model isdependent on more transactions occurringon the base layer this is a verycritical thingwe don't really have an issue with itfor the next 10 20 years or so but inthe next 10 or 20 years demand for blockspace in the bitcoin blockchain needs tooccuraka more transactions otherwise we willhave a potentially have a securitybudget problembut we do not know of course what aproper level of security budget is it'sa super nuanced conversationbut more transactions equals moresecurity which is goodso a lot of people come for thespeculation but stay for the sound moneyi mean how many people hereunderstood sound money before they gotinto bitcoin right like it's nota couple people might yeah i meanthere's definitely the austrian folksi studied finance and undergrad so forme it was it made sense but a lot ofpeople came from the specul speculativesideyou're not a bad person look you're justa human you you felt you felt greed andand fomo because your buddy bought itand and that's how most people got intothis spaceand and this is not a bad thing at allthis is this is just human nature andhow it workssolet's get a little bit controversialhereum let's call bitcoin spot trading sospot is like just when you buy and sellthe underlying assets of bitcoinlet's call that trading so buying andselling it let's call that a casino gameso a casino game uh for example we'llcall bitcoin pokerum don't take this analogy too literallyi'm just using it as a way to talk aboutspeculation sobitcoin's primarygame is poker but that's the only gameit hassome of these other blockchains haveother casino games we might callnfts blackjack and yield farming slotsandlending borrowing roulette andstaking being crapsagain these analogies are not you don'twant to make these analogies one-to-onebut what's happeningis that these games are attracting morepeople to like solana and ethereum whichis interestingthese speculative games are what drawspeople inand so the games are working for examplei went to nyc nft conference and a fewother nft conferences and they don'tthink in a bitcoin center they think inan eth standard they bought an nft for0.1 eth and they flipped it for 0.4 it'sa really interesting mechanic becausebitcoin's monetary policy is objectivelya better better money bitcoin by any byany measure is a better moneybut it's through these speculative gamesthat people are being introducedto the moneyand souh nfts for ethereum are are verypopular here's an example of uh boardapes and how they're priced in ethereumthis isn't a dollar chart it's anethereum chart and so thethe nft folks are thinking about moneyin an ethereum standard which is reallyinteresting to seeand then you know as we've seen herehere's the ethereum btc chart over timeas we've seen recently the d5 summer in2021 we've seen kind of an increasedkind of a higher level where i thinksome of this is uh indicating you know alot of peopleplaying these speculative games withnfts and defyleads to kind of a permanentpermanent user base that sticks aroundthey came for the speculation but someof them are staying for thei would argue poorer moneyand soum you know basically with bitcoin whenwe think about it from a marketingperspective how do we introduce peopleto bitcoin wellwe've all had the conversation where wetry to convince our family and friendsthat the fiat standard is terrible andthatum you know here's how central bankingworks and bitcoin's great because youdon't have to trust anyonewe're we're right but that message ishard i know we've all been with familyand friends and we've or or when you'vebeen dating and you've brought this upand people look at you like you're kindof crazy you know soum speculative games arethe primary way in which bitcoin wasadopted and also is a little bit morefun and a little bit more primitiveit's people's fear and greed that youtap into rather than a lengthyexplanation of austrian economicssoyou know at the end here what i reallywant to leave everyone withis that um through these speculativegames that is how bitcoin was adoptedand i know people feel a little bittriggered with the word speculationbecause it it feels like i'm i'mminimizing bitcoin or making it seemtrivial it's not it's just human natureand what i'm advocating foris bringingdefyback to bitcoin uh nft started onbitcoin um nft started out rare pepestarted on counterparty which was on topof bitcoinand we also had a lot of other thingslike join marketjoin market is actually the first d5product in the world um you can earn ayieldyeah join market is is an awesomeawesome tooland by the way shout out to i think it'sdirt gigi and a few others who areworking on jam which is a better gui foritbut that is earning yield on providingyour coins to be mixed with othersthat's an example of one of the first d5products on bitcoini would argue lightning is defy as wellumi think this is great bringing morethings back to bitcoin i mean bitcoin isa phenomenal pristine piece ofcollateral it is them it is the bestmoney that we have in the world and someof these defy projects can bring backthis game these games back to bitcoinand i believe that that will bring moreadoption soum you know that's what i really want toleave everyone with i think that's thelast slide uh here's the last slide yeahso speculation isn't a dirty word weneed to embrace human nature andlet the games begin i appreciateeveryone listening hope you didn't gettoo triggered but uh thank you cheersany questions for dan i'll do it rightdo you want to go on the lectern i'llrun around any questions for danokay well uh i suppose we'll leave itthere then thank you thank you daneveryonethanks danumso we're actually a little bit early souhwe'll just wait until the next panel isready so 5-10 minutes[Applause][Music][Music]i need[Music]umum[Music][Music][Music][Music]um need[Music]there[Music]um[Music]so[Music]time[Music]me[Music][Music]ohuh[Music]so[Music][Music]um[Music]me[Music]um[Music][Music]hello okay we're back so[Music]thanks for waiting we've got our nextpanel i'll let uh marty bent uhintroduce everyone so everyone welcomemarty up[Applause]um all right we're here to talk aboutuhthe bitcoin economyuh the circular economy we've gotuh four individuals who are building inthe space to to stoke that circulareconomy uh once you join me up herewe've got nicola dorier from btc payserver max keatondesiree dickerson from thunder games andsamson nowfrom jan3.umyeah the circular economy it's a bigtopic it's something that is a big memein the space how do we stoke thiscircular economy how do we get peopleactually using bitcoinand driving the utility that the networkand the stack being built on top of itprovides how do people get onboarded inunique ways without maybe buying bitcoindirectlyand we'll start with you uhbuilding btc pay serveri mean i think we all know whywhy you started btc server there's avery infamous tweet out there but how doyou viewthis open source project enablingindividualsto get into the bitcoin economyuh so i would saya btc best server uh for a very newindividual that discover bitcoin isit's a few steps early i guessi thinkwhen more people want to be introducedto the bitcoin economy they need firstto learn or to receive and send bitcoinit's the simplest thing everandum i i i thinkmy my project btcp server isnice for when people are already acertain level of education about thisandfor in btc server will really lookingfor this type of person or localcommunity or like asmall businessuh that cankind of handhold like your localmerchants to learn about bitcoin becauseas i said like like just the learningcurve even if technically speaking it'seasy to click on to install your own btcserver there's lots of things in bitcointo learn about maybe most of you forgotabout it because now you breathe bitcoinbut uh there's still lots of roadblockson thisyeah i mean i was telling you before wecame on stage here i think that'sprobably a good framing too it'sprobably for somebody who's alreadyunderstands bitcoin and just wants toleverageuma better accounting software notaccounting software but invoicingsoftware i've been using bt space serverforfor four years and it's incredible toseejust how far it's come since day one andwhat it enables and that's as a btc payserver user i can't recommend it enoughbecause it's just worked for us uhyou're in your outlook i was talking tomax huddle huddle disclaimer sponsor thepodcast uhinvoice via btc pay server and it's forme personallyit's enabled my business to to adoptlike a pretty significantbitcoin standard like i've said this onthe podcast i thinkthis year 80 of our revenues will be insats and most of them will be running toour btc pay server sothank you for building it and umthen as a business we get the bitcoinand we have it on our balance sheet andit's like what can we do with itand you made a big announcementyesterday max with debify you can usethat bitcoin as collateral to do thingswith it so what what how do you viewbitcoin as collateral enabling peopleto to leverage things uh in the digitaleconomywell um yeah my thesis is basically thatfor the next 10 years we will seebitcoin likebecoming evolutionary from trading assetto collateral asset but of course it'salso about payments gaming nation stateadoption and all those thingsum well i think if you if you alreadyhave bitcoin that's probably mostprobably if you know and you understandthe value of the bad bitcoin and all theoptions and features of bitcoin you wantyou want you don't want to sell itlike you don't want to sell itand one of one of the best tools how topreservefinancial stability yet not sell yourbitcoin is basically borrow against thatand the great thing about bitcoin isi was speaking about it yesterday thatit's actually programmable moneyand you can figure out many differentschemes ownership schemesincluding non-custodial borrowing andlendingand this will allow you to have somecontrol over your fundsand this will allow you to borrow or notto sell bitcoinand actually that's that's the greatpart so you're kind of still being anowner of your own assets but you're alsonot selling it and borrowing againstthat and using this for likefunding your business running yourbusiness or doing whatever you want likeof course majority of people still useuh collateral uh for bitcoin for acollateral in order to buy more bitcointhat's the main use casebut i thinklike in nextin next year's the the variation of usecases will grow people will start usingit more and moreincluding for improving cash flows andsecurity reasons and all that stuff imean financial security reasonsso i think the adoption of collateralwill only growhopefully we aremoving from the stage wherethe contingents the stuff alreadyprobably finished and hopefully peoplewillunderstand that it's not a problem ofbitcoin all these issues with lendingplatform it's a problem of third partiesthat were built on top of bitcoinand thendez what i really like about thundergames this is sort of like a roundaboutwayto get people who may not beinto bitcoin yet into bitcoin andonboarded via uniqueuh vehicle which is gaming so how do youview what you guys are doing to getpeople into the bitcoin economy yeah umand i my talk earlier it was you know wethink about games specifically mobilegames as like a launch pad for peopleone having their first exposure tobitcoin in a safesimple secure and fun way but thenalso presenting them opportunities oflike what to do with their bitcoin soyou know we are non-custodial and walletagnostic so presenting them with ways toliketake that bitcoin and go from there sofor instance i was chatting with martywas one of the great ways is like okaywe can you can cash out to breeze forinstance and breeze has an amazing likepodcasting platform so you can win satson thunder cash out to breeze and tiptip podcasterson the breeze app which i think isreally cool and creates this like tinylittle lightning economy which is ithink is really important and you knowsomething we think about and one of myfavorite ways that we kind of do thislike littlelightning economy is we have a lot ofpeople who create content for us um youknow we're small um and i am ourmarketing arm and i have a lot of otherthings to do and so our community hasstarted making a ton of memes andwriting tweets and just creating allthis amazing content that we generatevalue from and one of the things i hateis that you know what i can't like paythem like i don't have can't add them asa salaried employee so i've just startedtipping themwith stats and like micro transactionsmake that possible we actually have aproduct that we're coming out with heresoon that make it possible you know tokind of include this in games where it'slike hey you're creating content for ourgame economy like we're going to be makeit possible where i can just tip youdirectly um so i think that's what'sreally cool is like you knowthe new experience like people areexperiencing life like in thishybrid physical virtual world now and sonow we can start like paying people forthe work and for the value that theycreate in the virtual world as well andlike we're just experimenting in thegaming space and it's all super fun buti think it can kind of stem from thereand we can change like traditionalfinance in general and just like thetraditional ways in which societyoperates soi think gaming is like this little tinyecosystem we can experiment a lot withyeahand thensamsonyou're going after pretty big fish uhwith nation states at gen 3. whatimpact do you think convincingmore and moregovernments toeither adopt big win or adopt laws thatare welcoming to bitcoin what can thatdo for the for the bitcoin economy inthe long runwell there's a number of benefits ithink one is you can preemptbad decision making so if you look ateurope there's a series of bad decisionsthat's led to the current situation um iwas going to make a meme like a venndiagramlike trying to ban hardware wallets nobannon-custodial walletstrying to ban proof of work and thenenergy crisis it's like europebut um you know going out there andengaging with nation states engagingwith politicsall rightthanksso let me seeif you can engage with the governmentsahead of time they may be able to putsomebetter policiesthey can incentivize mining incentivizeminers to build energy infrastructurefor their own mining and in the case ofany dire need like now they could alsoshut off andpour energy and back into the gridbuti see like el salvador is leading theway they've done a really importantthing which is made bitcoin legal tenderso that's effectively saying bitcoin ismoney it's not so much about the legaltender aspect it's more of anendorsement at the nation-state levelsaying bitcoin is money and we're backto a sane world where money can be moneythe alternative is money is asurveillance tool and that's where youget the uh you know banningnon-custodialnot banning your having your own walletright that's basically insanity like notallowing you to have possession of yourown money and then you getthe situation like in lebanon where youhave to hold up to the bank to get yourown money out of the bank forimportant reasons right for a medicalsurgery for your father or somethinglike that so i see that as a initiativeto kind of approach it from a high levelbut at the same time you need thegrassroots you needgetting stats into people's hands likethrough games or through stores merchantadoptionlending all this stuff so i think it allplays together and of course there'scriticism like why do you want to help agovernment get bitcoin but thealternative is you get proof of workbans orwallet bans or things like thatyeahespecially on the mining side with ithink there's a really interestingpath forward for anyeither individual states i'm focused inthe united states really trying toconvince an individual state with energyresources to spin up a bitcoin miningpermanent fund similar to the volcanobond maybe you issue a municipal bondraise cash and you use that cash to buya six partner with a minor and they goand they find an abandoned well and theyput some generators on it mine bitcoinpay back the bond holdersand then roll some excess profits into apermanent fund where in the unitedstates the big problem between thestates and the federal government as thefederal governmentdangles money in front of them and sayshey you better do this so we're notgoing to give you your moneybut bitcoinparticularly bitcoin mining enables thisthis path forward we can create thesepermanent funds you can build that upand the next time the federal governmentcomes to you is like heyyou're not going to get this money ifyou don't do what we say the state canjust say hey we actually don't need yourmoney bitcoin's enabling us to to buildour ownisolated economy in our stateit was a tangent from the moderator butuh i thinkthat tangent and what you guys arebuilding highlightsuhunique capabilities that bitcoinprovides the worldthat the traditional incumbent financialmonetary system does not sowhat are you guys seeing out there interms of what you're building whatyou're doing that really highlightsbitcoin is uniquely suited to dosomething thatthe traditional system cannotso i have veryuma very precise situation where i cannotuse anything than bitcoin in mysituation soin japan i think two or three years agowe created like theparticipation server foundation whichwas kind of the first foundation in thisspace touhtry to create a structure to easilyaccept donation from corporate andredistribute it to contributor to ourown projectsand umthe thing is that it's an open sourceproject so like people come fromeverywhere in the worlduh including some countries that uhso it's located in tokyoand so it's some people living incountries thatthe bank don't even knowhow to properly spell the nameor likethey don't even know the name of thecountry soumwhen i try tosend some fun to someto some contributorsthe banking system in japanduring thatinternationally is a process that takefor each wire transfer we want to takeit takes around 30 minutes of paperworktime you need at first at home like toprint a paper bring this paper to thebank uh enter in a cubicle where you'reremotely connected to an employee thenscan the paper and then after you havelike a an interrogation of 15 minutes tobe sure you are not a terrorist uh whyyou're sending this money and they lookat their invoice they see one line theydon't like or you're reimbursing aperson why are you reimbursing theperson you say hey that when phone sayoh no you cannot do that so yeah allkind of problem so we have right now wehave 15 or no uh 10 contributors aroundour owncontributor so if i wanted to pay all ofthem it would takelike 30 minutes by 10 so yeah half a dayfive hours doing this this uh this uhthese bullshitsuh soin our case like now we uh thefoundation receive bitcoinand we pay bitcoin to uh the contributordirectly just becausethere is no other way like there is nosimply no other way it's a i never thinkabout that it was a circular economy inthis sense but definitely it is and likeonlycan do thisbitcoin is a super collateral how's itdifferent thana typical collateral that is usedthroughout the systemwell uh how is different from othercollateral assetswell first of all in terms of from theperspective of lender if there'sliquidation for exampleif you have a real estate as acollateral it takes you months or maybeyears to sell it and to get cashusually it's also the period when uhreal estateusually falls down in price well thathappens in bitcoin pretty fast of coursebut uh with bitcoin you can actuallysell your collateral instantlyso this is one of the reasons uh anotherreason as i told you already it's aprogrammable moneyand another thing you can actuallyyou can uhlike you can create severalownership systems in terms of like ifyou have non-custodial setupand lender will be in charge to someextent borrower will be in charge tosome extent and for example like we'redoing in existing landing platform landand there's a platform in charge to someextentit also creates a full transparencyand the great thing also about bitcoinas i know that not many people are fansof transparency in terms of bitcoin andi appreciate that and i like i supportthat with all our projects butif you want to borrow moneyuh you can easily prove that youactually have assetslike there's guys husseki app who aredoing this nowand i think this uh this like thisindustry will only evolve so you don'tneed to go with your salary bankstatements whatever whatever you justshow easilydigitallyremotely you show that you have assetsin order to borrow against these assetsand you can almost instantly borrowmoney so there's a lot of differentthings but i think the mostimportant are thatyou can easily sell bitcoin it'sbasically 24 7 tradingyou can easilydistribute the keys to your collateraland you can easilybe transparent and you can also actuallyfollow like with non-custodial if if theescrow is created on bitcoin blockchainyou can double check always you canmonitor what's happening on your escrowso there's no funds movement and yourfunds are not being reopticated sothat's these are the most importantproperties in terms of collateral forbitcoinyeahand then i mean you already touched onwhatthis can dofor gaming in terms ofenabling micro payments anduh inciting the circular economy alittle bit butuh in terms of like the culture ofgaming how do you seebitcoin beginning to like seek into thatand really that's like one thinglet's be honest for the first 13 yearsjust been a bunch of us nerds trying tolike push bitcoin into the culture likeand gaming is obviously a massiveindustry right now do you see this as atrojan horse for the bitcoin economyoh yeah um and that's you knowgaming or bitcoin can do a ton forgaming not just likepeople winning real world value andgames it's you know i think it'sinteresting because one yeah likegaming companies just make money off ofus hand over fist it's you buy theconsole you buy the game you buy themonthly subscription you buy the in-gamecontent you create ugc for this companyit's just a one-way value syncand there's a lot of like interestingstuff too in terms of like being anindie studio or a developer it's youknow you areum really kind of at the will of thesedistributors i mean we are constantlybeing taken out of the app store and outof google playand fighting that battle and also youknow we one of our monetization methodsis through um ad revenue andwe are at the middle of the ad companiesand we don't get paid for 90 days sowhen we make money we don't see thatmoney for 90 days and bitcoin cantotally circumvent not only these walledgardens of these distributors that wehate like googleum apple like i mean it's just madnessbut like we have to play by their rulesnow but bitcoin really has the potentialto circumvent that but thenin terms of just the community aspectthat's where i think gaming really hasor bitcoin has the biggest aspect isactually bringingbitcoin to the people who need it mostand that's what we really think a lotabout at thunder is you know mobilegames are so big because there's a lowbarrier to entry in terms of price pointbut so many people are playing games 63percent of women worldwide play mobilegames and 60 of those women play everysingle day said this earlierum and so if we can use mobile games asa way to bring bitcoin to a femaleaudience similarly similarly with likeemerging markets um a 66mobile games industry is going to reach66 billion dollars by 2026 and aroundlike 45 percent of that growth isprojected to be attributable to the apacregion so again you know mobile games ifmore and more people are playing mobilegames if we can introduce bitcoin tothem through these mobile games likethis is how we're going to reach massadoption and again emerging marketsfemale audiences these are traditionallyunderserved audiences when it comes tofinancial access and empowerment andspecifically bitcoin so if we can usemobile gamesalthough it's fun it is a very veryserious andpowerful tool for introducing bitcoin tothe worldand thensamson for you like why what can thebitcoin economy do obviously peoplethink uh bitcoin and nation statesshould have thisnaturally uhcombative relationship but could youmake an argument that bitcoin canprovide a lot of utilityto nation states just via the natureof the assetsure earlier you said it's like thefirst 13 years it's a bunch of nerdspushing bitcoin into the mainstream it'sstill the case and it's still going tobe that way for a while but umyeah i there's the definite benefit likeif a nation states takeif nation states put bitcoin in theirtreasury they can actually combat thingslike inflation right they can tap intouh energy reserves mine bitcoin and paypeople so a lot of it i think is justeducating them onwhy bitcoin would benefit them andthat's also a way to prevent against uhbadbadly thought out regulations right justuh align the incentives just likebitcoin aligns incentives for end usersand normal peoplebut in line align their incentives thatyou know if you start mining bitcoin orlet's say you do a bitcoin bond you canactually fund infrastructure projectsyou know keep people warm in the winterthings like that they're really coolbutoverall i think it's really justeducating and letting them know thatbitcoin is the future and you probablywant to get on board early right there'sa interesting thing that could happensometime in the next couple years whichis one country with a fiat currency juststartsprinting the out of their currencyand buying bitcoin with it and if you'rethe first one to do that then you canaccumulate a massive stack of bitcoinbefore everyone else catches onso that's a fun thing to think aboutpure speculative attack is uh it needsto happen yeah i have a small questionalso for you is in thedifferent um argument that you can maketo convince like thosepensions like to add up bitcoinone of them is like uh saying just for qto the amfquestionwhen you ask her to when you try toconvince nation statesto add up bitcoinisuhwhen you tell them uh you to theamf is it a good agreement for themwell generally you don't need to tellthem like a lot of countries alreadykind of want to do that anywaysbuti think a lot of politicians areinvested in short-terminterests right they're verylow a very high time preference theywant to get re-elected or they want toshow something right away and imf moneyis quick easy money that you can borrowand you can do something and show peoplesomething right butthat's the challenge likethey have a lot of influence becausethey wield a lot of fiat currency andthat's very temptingand that's why i think el salvador isvery interesting because they're willingto go forbenefits in the long termbut you know they might suffer in theshort term because they're going to getbeat down by the imf andthe ratings agencies are going to trashthem but it's going to pay off in thelong term and i think we just have towait just like when bitcoin's in a bearmarket you know we all look kind of dumbbut when it's amooning then we look very smarti thinkstat i saw a few months ago is argentinaspecifically has taken something like 53loans out from the imf for the last 60yearsand their annual inflation rate isliterally like 110over that 50-year period so justhighlights thatthe imf isn't really helping thesecountries at all particularly argentinaso it seems to me thatthe countries that are more likely toadopt beacon and have a long-term vieware like the country whereum the current politicians are quitepopular and have agood chance to be re-elected so thatthey can see likeover time like people being attractedbut by their policy and kind of realbenefit of that seems i would say it'slike a litmus test ifa government or politicians are goingfor a bitcoin standard that meansthey're in it for the long run they'rein it for long-term prosperity of theirnation not just short-term re-electionget paid so i think it's a it's a way tosee like whereare their intentions really lyingso that's a benefit of bitcoin it justshines a lightand i've uh i just want to throw thisout there because just from myexperience of runninga bitcoin company that accepts bitcoinfor payment and then focusing more onthe podcasting 2.0 nature whichleverages key senduh on the lightning network wheresomebodyboost the podcast as they're listeningit's income to my business but the way iset it up with the splits i getfifty percent i get forty percent mattgets forty percent car gets five percentour developer gets five percent so as abusinessuh we're getting paid for our work buti'm actually not paying matt i'm notpaying car i'm not payingdj for the split so it's going directlyto them and sojust thinking as a business owner likehow does that changethe way like taxes work and stuff likethat so technically like the businessdidn't get any income it went directlyto us so you're building these openstructures where the money's flowingdirectly to the persondoing the work and the business actuallynever touches it on their balance sheetin some instances if you leveragesomething like he said so just thinkingstructurallyhow this stack is beginning to changejust like business operations and howthat affects taxes and stuff like thatyeah it's interestinglike it's kind of uhone thing that lightning can do and likewhat you you're mentioning like lots ofpeople in lightning think about makinglike small payments like in yourcommercial stuff like this but i thinkone thing that is undervalued is thatthe concept of payment stream and it'sbit what you are doing like peoplemaking very small payments and becomingautomatically redirected and the peopleto it's redirecting might be alsoautomatically redirected somewhere it'skind of a concept of payment streamand yeah i think i think we are likemaybe 10 years or 20 years away fromhaving the meaningful regulation comingfrom that but like somebody has to startand showing their way and like startingout after i guessyeah i think you can imagine a structureif this gets fully fleshed out and issuccessfuli mean where you can get so granular iknow like jeremy rubin's working atcovenants at the protocol layer and whoknows whether or not they get introducedbut certainly a lightning mckee sendand he is there a possibility where likethe business actually doesn't hold moneyeveroutside of like their ongoing expensesthey need to keep in reserveand you pay out employees shareholderswhatever automatically as you're gettingpaidi would i would love to see like getpaid from ad networks like literallystream but it's like okay like you'regetting one sat for like someoneinteracting with an interstitial ad andlike we could split thatum up i mean it was more than one set umand share the revenue with our userslike that would be like insane if itjust went to a prize pool like obviouslyit's not possible now but umwe're getting there i mean i think youknow what slime orsorry um what samson said earlier um wasimportant is like you know the adnetworks have blocked all um you knowbitcoin stuff previously so i'dpersonally just call them up or emailthem or message them on linkedin likehundreds of people until someone willjust listen about bitcoin and why thisisn't bad and like i think we've gotwe've liketurned over like 10 or 12 ad networkswhich is like really great and so like ithinki think people see the potential likethat would be a game changer for us likei think you know would definitelybenefit our business um if we weren'tlike reporting so much of the incomeum to the business itselfyesumso the the splitting of income isinteresting paying people with bitcoinis interesting and then tipping isinteresting too i think the where thisis going is that bitcoin has allowed ustochange a lot of ways that companies dobusiness or interact with their usersand their employees technically withlightning you could pay people daily youdon't have to pay them at the end of themonth or by monthly but the biggerimplication is how does taxation workbecause now you have this parallelsystem a new form of moneythat you can opt intoyou're not locked into the fiat railsyou're not locked into usingthe banking system orcollecting the money first andredistributing it so it makes taxationmuch more difficult the question iswhere is everything goingwhen government governments want tocollect their tax revenue because thisactually breaks a lot of that model eventhings like capital controls are nowtechnically obsolete even though somecountries are still trying to enforcecapital controls they technically don'texist anymore right so korea is one ofthemthey have capital controls but at thesame time you don't because bitcoin andcrypto buti think it's going to change thecompetition for people for nation stateslike attractingtalent attracting people to move to livein your your country and they have tobasically treat people better and ithink that's a good thing it's atertiary benefit of bitcoin i believe soif you look at bitcoin city it's almosta it's a special economic zonebasically no tax on anything except forvat but i think you could also see someshift down the road where countries justdo tax property because that's reallywhat you provide you provide the landyou don't really own it even though youcan own it but you don't really own itand thenit's obviously linked like if you livethere or you own it then you can pay taxon that and i think that's a much moreclear system than trying to become anintermediary through the fiat currencyand try to insert yourself in differentparts of the economy because then youspendyou knowmonths weeks well weeks probably doingyour taxes and trying to sort stuff outevery year and like nicholas is sayingit's ait's a lot of time right and we could bedoing better things with that time so ithink overall the trend is going to betowards simplification just because thetechnology has changed the entireparadigm so muchi it's kind of uh so for those that sodidn't read this book the sovereignindividual is bit of the point thatyou're making indeed that technology ischanging the way uhor like uhthe structure of power and so like itwould change the way of all people gettaxed and umand uh so one of the things that thebook predicts ismore and more uh power to umto nation to small nation umcities basicallyand uh yeah it's interesting to see uhthe only thingif if it can reach full maturity andfulleach open reason a utopianobjective i would say like the onlything that states can tax will be theland and i think everything willderive from this and i think it makestotal sense because at the end of theday likethe concept of state is is inherentlylike geographicalso i think uh yeahi think it's good thingsand thenmax thinking about what you're workingon at devi phii think particularly the nature ofmulti-siganduhhow risk-averse large corp or largebanks or financial institutions are thenature of multi-sig makes it so theseinstitutions are almost incentivized tocollaborate and distribute risks acrosseach other which creates these newbusiness models and interactions thathaven't existed before and the best partis well we touched briefly abouttaxation as well but the good part isalso when you borrow it's non-taxableevents in many countries actually so forbitcoin there's only incentives in orderto borrow against the bitcoin butas you mentioned yeah that's a differentmodel for banks different mindsetthe good part is actually is not onlytheir their they will beforced to some extent to learn to uselike i think more secure model ratherthan being fully custodialbut the best part in non-custodial setupis that they will be able to directlyinteract with the borrowerand they will be able directly toreceive all interest payment withoutmiddlemen because now many banks thatare willing to tap in into bitcoinlending market they need to go throughintermediaries custodial lendingplatform so they provide them liquidityand these platforms they actuallydistribute this liquidity among theirborrowers but they charge for thatwith the setup that we are planning toofferthey will be able directly to reach theborrower and directly receive whole allinterest payments in their pocket soit's not onlymore secure more transparent but it'salso more profitable for banks to startlending money directlyto the borrower to the end borrowerinstead of going through intermediarieswe've got umtwo minutes left and i just want tothrow it to the four of you like whatwe've talked about what's been built andwhat could be enabled already but whatare you guys excited for on the horizonin terms of things that may be coming tothe the bitcoin stack that will enablethis economy even furtherso on my side i'm not working directlyon this but i think i already mentionedi want to see happening and starthappening it's the concept of paymentstream that's really like payinghaving a flow of payment going frompeople and like not having to botherabout every time taking a specificdecision okay i want to send this amountof money having this concept of paymentstream that only lining a loweryeah i'mwe're also not working on this but i'mexciting particular about dlc's discretelog contracts because uhlike if you're our lending platform youcan use dlcs in order to build oraclesforallowing you to show a properliquidation price or ltv ratio for yourloans so this is kind of what i'mfascinated what's coming or what'sdeveloping at the momentyeah i mean i will actually echo that iam super excited for dlcs especially umin the gaming space um i love that i'malso just so inspired being here likethe last time i felt likei felt like this much building and thismuch new stuff was at the lightningconference um and so it's really cool tosee so much you know like fetty there'sjust like so many cool things beingbuilt but i also did like want to touchon like the taxes i i did pay my dctaxes this year so if you know mariobros is watching i'm good soyeahi should have been advising michaelsaylorlet's see what am i excited about wellwe've been trying we've been working ona relaunch of aqua that's the bitcoinand liquid wallet that we started atblockstream and now is being built atjan three but uh hopefully we can pushthat out in the next month or two but umit's a really simple wallet it's uhbitcoin liquid bitcoin and a focus forit is also on liquid tether so there wasa panel upstairs on emerging markets andob was also shilling liquid liquidtether because liquid tether is actuallyreally cool and you guys are using itheavilyit's the only stable coin that cannot befrozen because liquid confidentialtransactionsetc sothe plan for aqua is that we're going topush it heavily in the global southemerging markets and i think it'sprobably the only bitcoin wallet that'sgoing to feature prominently a stablecoin and i think we've ceded a lot ofterritory to the coins becausethey've embraced it and you know all thechicano wallets have stable coins on allthe different chains but there's nobitcoin wallet yet that's featuredheavily stable coin and we've integrateduh or integrating liquid taxi fromuh volcan ventures from tierro and theseguys so the cool thing about aqua is ifyou're inlatin america or argentina where youneed a stablecoin you don't actuallyneed to get the bitcoin first you canjust take a liquid tether payment toyour wallet and then pay the fees inliquid tether too so i think it's goingto maybe shift the tide a bit andgetting more things into bitcoin and ithink over the next months and yearswe're going to see that shift happeningwith tdx that was announced hereyesterday with debify and everythingelse that's being builtawesome well nicholas max dez sampsonthank you for your timeit's been athank you everyone that was a fantasticpanel i really enjoyed that one so uhnext upwe've got the man behind bitcoin isvenice he's a writer in the space he hasbeen an investor in the space also he uhis also you know writing and putting outa lot of interesting content i'm excitedto see what he's got so everyone pleasewelcome alan farrington[Applause]all right thank you very muchjust by the way due to a technicalmishap i'm gonna have to stay at thepodium but i would kind of like you allto see my t-shirtbecauseit's been under wraps for a lo i orderedthis about three months ago and debutedit todayunfortunately that's you probably can'tsee it again but anyway yes sotodayi am going to be talking about bitcoinand islamic financeso i think that this has become a bit ofa memeum and it's partly if not largely myfault for for championing this idea buti've realized over the past maybe one ortwo years that even though this is oftenreferenced i think it's very rarelyreally discussedand at the same time there's a lot ofmisconceptions around what islamicfinance really is in the first place ithink the the most common of which isprobably that it's just regularwestern finance except you aren'tallowed debtum and if there's a single bad ideathat i want to try to kill today on therecord i think it's this one um thissort of simple enough kind of innocentseeming enough ideauh is wrong in just about every way so ithink not only does such a a simplecomparison do a great disservice to whatis really quite a rich school of thoughtbut even thesort of superficial assessment of debtitself is is kind of inaccurate as uh aswe'll seebut who am i to be getting up here andand talking about this in the firstplace welluntil fairly recently i worked in tradphi uh i'm actually now setting up abitcoin business that i'm hoping tolaunch and and uh sort of publicize soonum but to which all of this is highlyhighly relevant so i know we're notreally supposed to do promotions inthese talks and i don't really haveanything to promote yet anyway but ifthis is also of commercial interest toyou uh please do come and talk to meabout it um and if anyone if you're youknow if you're watching this online ifyou're not in regards now now or later ishould say toouh that's my twitter handle uh my dmsare open i would love to hear from youum i'm also not a muslim um i think thisis definitely worth mentioning up fronti mean firstly just for the sake of kindof or honesty and transparency i'm suresome of you are wondering given howniche a topic this is uh but nothingnothing i say has any kind of you knowtheological weight behind it right i'mnot i'm not preaching i'm not trying toconveyany kind of authority just beyond my ownintellectual interestand if anything that is what i want totry to instill in all of you today ithink that you too should beintellectually interested in thisuh because it provides a centuries-oldalready worked out alternative towhat we might call fiat finance andwhich i think aligns remarkably wellwith bitcoinso i'm going to cover three tenets ofislamic financewhich i've hopefully helpfully reducedto slogans for you and which i thinkwill probably work pretty well as memesas welland i'm focusing as you can see on thecontrast to fiat financeumand i just want to beclear that this is not uh remotelyexhaustive it's not supposed to be it'sit's more of like a layman'sintroductionuh the point of which is to convince youthat this is highly dissimilar to thefiat that we know and hate uh and andsimilar to the the bitcoin that we knowand love so i'm going to talk about uhrisk sharing not risk transferuh use not financialization and thespirit of the law not the letter of thelawso islamic finance is remarkably astuteon the risks associated withentrepreneurshipyou could even say that it mandateshumility in the face of economicuncertainty because the idea that youcan know what is going to happenis not just impossible in a kind ofhayekian sense or foolish just in termsof common senseuh it's it's blasphemous so only godknows all and so for you to act as ifyou know what is going to happenis seen as unethicalso given you can't know what is going tohappen you have to make an informeddecision and you have to takeresponsibility for itso even if you don't claim to know whatis going to happen if you nonethelessstand to benefit no matter what happensyou are seen as having unacceptablydisregarded a personal responsibilityto take the risks that are necessary toearn those rewardsso you don't have to take anyresponsibility but if you want anuncertain reward that can only followfrom skin in the gameoh sorry that should have been therebeforeumso what does this mean in practice wellthis background is necessary toappreciate where the prohibition onincome from fixed interest debt comesfrom and it's a lot more sophisticatedlet's say than just saying no debtso if you lend to a businessand you intend for your payback to comefrom interest payments before dispersalto shareholders and beforereinvestment you will get paid no matterwhatit doesn't matter uh whether thebusiness does well or poorly it doesn'tmatter who is taking what risks whatresponsibilities making what decisionsyouwill be paid back and so this isperceived as risk transferthat's not supposed to happenwell it doesn't really say that muchanyway uh hopefully it will come back onsoon so yeah this is perceived as risktransfer so between those who arecontributing capital to the businessyeahum the there we go theuh the risk is being transferred fromone group to another rather than beingsharednowyou[Music]you might think that this is justuh incredibly naive you know why nothave credit marketsagain it doesn't say that much why nothave credit markets with uh consentingand informed participants and i have alot of sympathy for this for what it'sworth i do think that there will becredit markets on a bitcoin standardi think that actually could be anentirely separate talk um but what iwould also put to you is that i thinkrejecting this out of hand is equallydoes that say the right thing yeah is uhis equally naive because it ignores howblatantly unethical a great deal of debtbased finance isif youhave to have a real stake in theuncertain enterprise that you'reinvesting inthere would be no zombie companiesthere'd be no private equity there wouldprobably be considerably less globalimpersonal capital and a great deal morelocal interested involved capitalistswho are sharing the risks of their jointendeavorsso interest is useful and useful inquotation marksprimarily because it lets you price riskefficientlybut what the lens of islamic financeallows you to see is that this also hasdownsidesdo you really want to be able to pricesomething that you know nothing aboutand in which you have no real stakedo you want the incentive of finance tobe first and foremost exploitativeand just for the purpose of avoidingfuture legal liability i have no ideawho this individual is i i just googledold mean banker and this is the firstthing that came up so so maybe lookmaybe you do maybe you don't again i'mnot trying to be a prude i'm notpreachingbut my very strong suggestion would bethat bitcoin is going to make thisdecision for you because zombiecompanies and private equity are onlypossible in the first place because ofthe mechanism of money creation thatprevails under fractional reserve andcentral bankingso another way of putting thisis a financial exploitation is going tobecome a lot more difficult which meansthat risk transfer is going to become alot more difficult tooif you had a sound money thatappreciated at the aggregate rate ofreinvested return on capitalwhy would you risk it for a fixed upsideif you no longer needed to chase yieldto preserve your purchasing power and ifyou no longer needed to misallocatecapitalwhy not take some responsibility forallocating it well insteadwhy not share the risks and share therewardsnow you might think that zombiecompanies and private equity are kind ofweirdniches within finance for me to decideto be mad aboutbut i think really they're only the mostsalacious in terms ofirresponsibility and exploitationand in fact when you dig into it almosteverything that follows from debt-basedfinance i believehas similar characteristicsso another rule of islamic finance uh isan interesting one around how collateralworkswhich aligns withavoidingexploitation and taking responsibilityit's really hard to visually communicatethe concept of collateral by the way idon't know if anyone even got thatso in uh in islamic finance umif you have an investment that iscollateralizedyou cannot retain possession of thecollateral until you have fulfilled yourliabilityso i could borrow from youand i could give you a like a goldbracelet sayas collateral but i would have toactually give it to you right i can'tkeep itand if i don't pay you back then youkeep it and prior to that or you knowper whatever the terms of the contractare you can't sell it either becausethat is rehypothecation which iseffectively fraudbecause you are avoiding a personalresponsibility so you originally saidthat you would do something that youknew you could dobut then subsequently behaves in such away that means you don't actually knowif you can do that anymore or notnow this might all seem pretty trivialbut i i gave an example where both thepersonal incentives and the financialterms are super easy to understand infact thishas far wider implications than what'sbasically just a pawnshopit means that you can't have mortgagesfor examplebecause a mortgage is collateralized bythe house that the borrower possesseswhile they are paying off the loanand there's uh there's a john mullaneyjoke which i will obviously now butcherum where he saysi bought a housewell no the bank bought a house butthey're letting me live in it which issuper nice of themand forgive me for for feeling the needto explain the joke right but that thisis funny because he's drawing attentionnot only to how widespread and hownormalized this activity isbut also this way of talking about theactivity that obscureswhat is really going onso criticizing something that's sowidespread and so normalized might seembizarre but again what islamic financedoes is give us a lens to see thedownsidesand there are manymortgages are predicated on futureincome streams that you can't possiblyknow anything aboutit's a promise that you have no ideathat you can keepbut it also constrains your ability toact because all the risk has beentransferred to youif you can't handle the risk you loseeverything you get kicked out your houseyou have nowhere to live potentiallywhile still in debt for it as welland then finally rather than you knowmaking housing affordable and accessiblefor all as a typical fiat propagandawould gothis directly contributes to monetizinghousingand it's not just that housing becomes ade facto store of value it's even moreliterally true than thisgiven the house becomes the collateralfor the credit asset of your unknowablefuture incomeon which the liability of new money isbrought into existenceit's a lot more than just private equityand zombie companies it's virtually allpersonal finance fiat personal finance ishould say and it's a decent chunk ofcommercial banking as wellso bitcoin fixes this technically um butislamic finance fixes this ethicallyumbecause it's because the yourrelationship to therisk and the value of productive assetshas to be in their usei think to be more accurate it's it'sjust not even conceivable per anyactivity that that is ethical forexactly that reasonand some of you have probably jumpedahead and realized this already butwhere this is all goingis that you can't print moneyit violates just about every ethicaltenant so far described it requires aguaranteed payment that you have no wayof knowing is possible and no way oftaking any real responsibility forit's economically equivalent toreapplicating the collateral and so itcontrives wealthfrom baseless promises rather than fromreal workthe aversion to financialization andislamic finance comes from the prettystraightforward ideathat there ought to bea one-to-one relationshipbetween a financial instrument and theunderlying real economy asset the morethis ratio diverges the less realfinance becomes and the more we end upbuilding a house of cards that willsurely one day collapsenow obviously bitcoin doesn't work thiswaytechnicallybut i'm hopeful that i don't really seeany reason for it to wait for it to workthis way socially eitherprior tobeing more obviously money day-to-dayi think that the the clearest ways thatwe're going to see or that it will beevidence what bitcoin's financialcharacteristics are are each of thefollowing solightning channels in which there is nofinancial instrument because it is beingusedor as a kind of pristine collateral fora more involved financial transactionbut in which caseclearlyyou will have to hand over the bitcoinif we've if we've learned anything fromthe incomprehensibly stupid d5 c5implosionit's that the promise of a bitcoin isnot a bitcoinright only a bitcoin is a bitcoin andthere's no nonsense of it beingwrapped or of total value locked or ofor of yield right so the yield is thefriends we made along the waybut the bitcoin is and only isactual bitcoinnot financialized but usedso one of the reasons that it's it'stricky to pin down exactly what islamicfinance is is that the idea of settingit side by side with fiat finance andkind of comparing and contrastingsort of doesn't make any sense in thefirst placeislamic finance isn't a list of whatobjectively is and isn't allowedit's a framework for deducing whatshould and shouldn't be allowed based oncertain ethical principlesnow as with credit markets and as withmortgages you might reasonably thinkwell what good is a well-spirited law ifyou can't objectively tell what the lawsaysbut againislamic finance encourages us to askbackwhat good is a well-lettered law if whatit is telling us to dois blatantlyunethicaland i want to be really clear by this soi'm not i guess accused of being kind ofrhetorically overzealous it's not thatthere is no letter of the law thereclearly is and i've you know i'vereferred to it several times alreadyit's more that the letter of the law isnot the focusthe the corepoint the core tenet what matters morethan anything else is the spirit of thelaw and that is how the letter of thelaw is derived as opposed tovice versaso if you want to even snap your slogani guess you could maybe sayuh ethicsnot efficiencyum and again i'm not preaching but ithink if you entertain the ethics inquestion you'll find that they alignwith bitcoin remarkably wellso these would be principles likeuh nafs the the self or the ego which weought to disciplineand sabor patience which we ought toinculcatethis is effectively just telling you tohave a low time preference rightum and i i don't think it's much of asurprise either if you consider thatthese ethics evolved around theprevalence of gold coinage and amercantile system that was heavilydependent on reputationi also don't think as much of a stretchat all to say that the islamic economicmodel is finance as it would be on soundmoneyi think this helpfully and naturallybridges the divide between the financialand the ethicalthe primary ethical consideration thatsound money imposesis responsibilitythere's no lander of last resort there'sno monetization you have to takeresponsibility for your actions and youhave to try to provide real value in useand perhaps more i guess psychologicallyeven than ethically sound moneyencourage us to think long term which isan argument i'm sure everybody here ismore than familiar withit relieves you from worrying only aboutyour personal and immediate well-beingand allows you to care about bigger moretranscendental thingspossibly the most important of whichwould be the well-being of othersand so this quickly goes well beyond thefinancial and allows us to generate allof the ethical tenets on whichuh islamic finance rests and the spiritof the law on which it encourages us tojudgetake responsibility for your actionsencourage others to do the samekeep your worddo what you say you will do and don'tsay you will do things you don't knowyou can dotherefore be mindful of your reputationthink and act locally because that isthe only place your reputation canmatter and the only thing you can knowand don't take advantage of peoplehelp thembe kindthe last thing i'll say before wrappingup is something that i wanted to try todemonstrate rather than dictate i hope inow haveyou do not need to be a muslim tothink that this is how people ought tobehaveand that the world would be a betterplace if everybody didum but you knowthey don't and everything's and youknow cry harder alanso i guess where that leads us is thethe most important question of all uhwillbitcoin fix thisi don't knowbecausei can't see the future right and itwould be unethical of me to pretend thati canbuti thinkif we take responsibilityor enough responsibilitybitcoin can help us fix thisso thank you very much[Applause]thank you alanokay so uhdaniel prince are you around i'm justtrying to get you oh there is okay he ishere gotcha okay fantastic so we've gotour q a session coming upnow and uh daniel prince is going to beour host souh hopefully we are able to get theguest on with the stream and uh i'll letdaniel take it from here so welcomedanielthank you guys[Applause]check yeah yeah thank you thank you guysuh thank you alan if you're still arounduh great talk uh i'd like to bring up onscreen if we are ready uh abu bakr who'suh zooming in remotelyfrom uh here he ishow are you brotheri'm good how's it going prince hang onwe are you on mute or do we not have uhsound yetgive us a give us another testhello can you hear me nowwe hear you we hear youthanks thanks thanks for coming toreagan via the uh via the internet todaymy pleasure my pleasure why don't you uhwhy don't you tell the panel uh just alittle bit about yourself brieflyintroduce yourself and uh tell us whoyou are and uh what you're focusing onin bitcoinyeah for sure so i'm a boo booker likedan saidandi'm essentially an engineer andprogrammer so i'm a bitcoin corecontributor somy time is dedicated to reviewing codeand then in the case that i have patchesmyself i push that onto the actualrepository itself and then beyond thati'm also involved with a project calledgala along with a few other bitcoinerswhich basically is a program designed totrain the next generation of bitcoinenlightened developers here in africaand i'm also board member of b trustwhich the goal there really is to growthe bitcoin ecosystem initially inafrica and then scale that out as wemove on and then beyond that i'm alsoceo and cto for cursive capital which isa bitcoin venture capital firmand then beyond that i'd say theminority of my time is spent playinghaloand you are harolduh i'm 23.it blows my mindabsolutely blows my mindso out of all of that i'm going to askyou um a few questions around uh betrust uh just in case there's anybody inthe audience here today that doesn'tknow exactly what be trust is um can youjust uh fill us in what that is uh andsee your role thereyeah sure sobeatrice is essentially a funda set upas a blind trust by jack dorsey and ng awhile back last year really and theentire process last year was to get aboard set up which is a four-personboard that includes myself carla obi andwozu which some of you might have seenyesterday on the panel speaking aboutfetty as well as a drama now the mainidea like i said is to grow the bitcoinecosystem now our view is we start offin somewhere like africa given themix up of the actual board itself sowhen we say growing the spacespecifically we're starting out with adepth focus because our view is that'sthe immediate way we could actuallyprovide impact to the space because themoretalented and skilled engineers we haveworking on these actual repositories orlike bitcoin core or some of the otherproducts like bdk the better overall forthe ecosystem because at the end of theday every single project that we'rebuilding whether closed source opensource all relies on open sourcetechnology and the further down thestack you go to like the base protocolthe the more important it is in terms ofhaving talented and skilled engineersworking on it so really for us is to atleast grow out that pipeline a bit sowe've started asmall team that we're growing which isthe the open source team we havecurrently a developer there called vladwho's working on bdk full-time and isbeing supported by vtrust so the idea isto get two three more people on the sameteam and then have them working onproducts in the space and then down theline would steal throughout otheravenues for us to provide impact to thesole spaceso just to put this into context uh youguys have 500 bitcoin to oversee is thatcorrectyeswhat kind of talenthave you been seeingooh tremendous especially on thecontinent because at the end of the dayafrica is one of those continents whereover the years a lot more of thedemographic has shifted towards a lotmore young people so specifically evenin a country like nigeria where i'mcurrently at in the state kaduna whichis where i'm atwe have more than half population aroundyou know the age of below 30. so and andthis is growing so it's not shrinking sofor us the mostimpactful thing is even as just anindividual nigeria is to ensure thatthere's a productive use of this talentthat's emerging which is a lot of theseyoung folks because if we have a ton ofyoung folks who are unoccupied there'sgoing to be a lot of issues like youknow security issues which some statesare facing so for us really we trust theidea is to leverage this talent that isabundant and to ensure that it'sproductively put to use and what betterway to put to use than to build the nextgeneration of monetary finance reallywhich is bitcoinyesterday we had uh michael saylor onon one of these interviews and uhsomebody asked him the question uh aboutuh increasing the adoption in africa uhhis answer was to uh for for somebody tocrack the code to get a uh a veryuh a download a lightning wallet forfree on a a very cheap phone tointerchange between something like astable coin and uh bitcoinwhat would be your thoughts you're thereboots on the ground uh you know what'sgoing on what's your thoughts on firstof all that approach and what you seethe best approach for adoption in uh inafricathat's definitely interesting i mean atthe end of the day with africaand with adoption in general you don'tnecessarily want to reinvent the wheelin terms of the bottom-up approach oftrying to get a lot more people ontothese rails now when i say you don'twant to reinvent the wheel i meanspecifically if you have an ecosystemthat already exists there are alreadyexisting rails in which individualseither on board or off board so the bestway really in terms of trying to keyinto that is to ensure that you're usingexisting infrastructure to do thatonboarding so to sailor's point i thinkthat approach would definitely help alot and more on that point really frommy end i think one thing we've noticedisgiven the statistics we see aroundmobile phone penetration and internetadoption increasing year on year thebest strategy right now given we stillaren't at that point where smartphonesare ubiquitous yet it's growing i meanit's around 40the last time i checked so a lot ofpeople are on smart on on feature phonesso these are phones that don'tnecessarily have you knowall those advanced uh i guess featuresthat we haven't compute like iphones andandroid phones but necessarily allthey're based on is ussd codes which isa huge huge huge infrastructure that'salready heavily regulated so in terms ofkeying in we have products like matchand crew who are really leading thatring so what they do essentially isallow individuals to buy bitcoin as wellas send down the line using thelightning network so they use lnaddresses all via ussd code sothe idea there is to use the existinginfrastructure we have which is ussdcodes to provide the best experience ofbitcoin which is through the lightningnetworkyeah all right welli would like to ask whether the crowd atthis point have any questions and umask you directly if there's anybody herethat has any questions please raise yourhands yes there's one one gentleman downhere if we could get a mic yep greatthank you okay yeah thank youyeah soi'm very glad to see you and i'mibrahimtoval i'm from malii would like to know what is yourconnection withbecause ithink from your last point about the ssdcodeand because that is now really uhafrica is very familiar today with uhmobile moneyand if i take mali today you know allbank together in mali have less thanthree million clients maybe about 20-25banks so they are sharing 23 millionclientsbut if you take their mobile companieswe have five they have about 15 millionclientsandsoso people are used they are all usingssd codeand there are a lot of talent a lot ofstartup what is your relation today withthe african university students startupswhich are in the continent working onthisyou know mobile digital money sectorsand so on because which are boomingreallyyeah great question i mean and whatbitcoin can play there as a role and howbecause they are not working withbitcoin but they are working with mobiletransactions mobile money transactionwith ussd code and but bitcoin level isquite low yeah how you do to make aconnection and how you are cooperatingwith youryourpeer africans young peopleyeah great question first of all so ithink to your point the main thing we'reseeing which isi guess the main reason why you wouldtend to see a lot of people not buildingbitcoin infrastructure for ussd codes isbecauselike i said it's a heavily goodregulated spacespecificallyin terms of thethe amount of fees that you pay foreach sms you're sending out using ussdcodes it varies across the continentwith places like nigeria havingextremely absurd rates relativelyspeaking compared to some are likeyou know kenya where uss decoys are alot more ubiquitous so to put that inperspective in nigeria we have aswitching a bank switching system callednibs one of the most i guessefficient so to speak relativelyspeaking on the continent hence why youtend to see a lot of people making a lotof inter bank transactions whereas in acountry like kenya a lot of those banktransactions happen over uss d codes nowwith regards to in general why or how ithink we should proceed is we definitelyhave to sit down with a lot of theseregulators to ensure that we have atleast a more reasonable pricingmechanism for these companies to come inand actually be competitive in the spacebecause the main reason why we see a lotof high rates is because banks are theones paying and frankly they don't carewhether it's high or low so we have tomake sure that it's at a stage wherefolks can actually afford to innovate ontop of that and then with regards tofolks in the universities and all thatmy view is thatthe best way for us to not only key intothat and tap into that talent is for usto ensure that we're running things likehackathons we're training at least getin touch with these faculties to pushsome of the bitcoin content at leasttowards even if it's not theundergraduate level maybe thepostgraduate level and then beyond thatensure that the existing tech hub so tospeak are notfocused on nft's web 3 crypto fancystuff and instead focused on somethingthat's more of a long-term solutionwhich is bitcoin and by doing that ibelieve we'll see a lot more peopleworking in the space and building crazycool innovative solutions so i thinkthat's really how we could push the ballin terms of those those frontsgreat question thank you uh i just wantto clear something up you guys aretalking about ussdcodes uh i just that's not a coinby the way that's umright it can be a little bit it's veryclarifying it's it's a cellular networkis that correctyes yesright okay so subscribed supplementaryservice data that's what it stands forright so it's just uh the network inwhich uh the the messages are being sentacross uh it's not like it's bitcoinbeing switched into ussd which is astable coin bitcoin thing in the middleno that's not happening at all it's justbitcoin to bitcoin yeah uh any furtherquestions uh from the audience here thatuhyou want to ask at allall right uh yes there is one gentlemanup the back herehi umjust a questionregarding adoption because you're thereobviously you've got the skills toproduce the technology that can beadopted butthere's two extremely hard things for mefor adopting bitcoin that i've learnedover the years and one iseducating people that bitcoin is moneyand the second thing ishow toride the volatility and still keep thefaith in in bitcoinandthe big challenge i see for emergingmarkets whichumyou're on the on on the spot for is theeducation what what do you think we cando to help peopleget over those twomassive challenges because it's onething to be able to provide thetechnology to thembut holding on and understanding what itis you're holding and what money is isthe biggest challenge i think and theeducation generally is not much beyondprimary in much of africa sothe challenge must be even harder thanit is for people in the western worldthat uh that have got into bitcointhat's that's definitely a good questionand an interesting point of view i meanpersonally i would sayin terms of understanding and capturingtruly what bitcoin from a value point ofviewprovides to individuals here in placeslike africa and other emerging markets ithink it's a lot easier for them tograsp than in other developed parts andi say this becausea lot of the education is alreadyhappening for us i guess on our behalfin terms of theum the economies and and the issueswe're facing with regards to highinflation the food crisis here innigeria so to put it in context if we'retrying to convince folks and i guesshighlight the benefits of moving on tobitcoin or the value in terms offinancial freedom that bitcoin providesto these individuals they first have tounderstand that the current systemdoesn't work because if it works therereally isn't any sort of compellingreason for them to move to that andalready much of that work is being doneby crashing currencies a lot offailed currency control measures inplaces like nigeria for exampleand by that very fact a lot of peoplealready feeling the brunt of the currentsystem and are already moving to analternative like bitcoin and that's whatwe tend to see with regards to adoptionin places like nigeria because if younotice it also coincides with kind ofthe economic hardships that have beengoing on over the last few years so forus really it's a matter offirst of all acknowledging the economici guess circumstances in these regionsand then letting people know that thereis a viable alternative and not onlythat but at least providingeasy to use interfacesso this goes way beyond applications toactual ux wise in terms ofhow easy it is to actually buy bitcoinhold bitcoin store bitcoin and sellbitcoin and part of these i guessmeasures that we need to take include avariety of things so in terms of custodypush them at least to a point wherethey're able to self-custody which takesquite a while so at least we need somesort of middle ground which i think fedis an incredible i guess middle groundfor us because it's not on the heavycustodial side and neither is it fullyself-custody so with solutions like thatwe have that on the end in terms ofstorage and then with regards to frontusing front-facing user applications weneed a lot more of these apps to be alot more intuitive for people to usebecause the biggest convincing factorfrom what i've seen in terms of adoptionis ease of use and that's the mainreason why a lot of people don't usecash and tend to use credit cards forexample so i think just to cut it shortwhat we really have to do in terms ofeducation is like i saidcontinue to highlight the issues of thecurrent system try and ensure thatthey're aware there's an alternative andthen provide that with the best i guesspossible way to experience that and inthis case is usually the lightningnetwork so getting a lot more peoplebuilding a lightning is incredible whichcompanies like vietnam are open sourcethey're well known open source but theyprovided open access to the apis forlighting i'm seeing a lot more companiesactually build and function on top ofthe lightning network which isincredible for adoptionhow bullish are you abba becker onbitcoin on the future considering whatyou've seen the the uh the talent thatyou're you're interacting with each dayyeah i'm incredibly bullish i meansome days i like i sleep with a hugesmile on my face knowing that at the endof the day regardless ofwhether i wake up or i die i know thatthere are incredible talents building onthis space and a lot more talent justgetting their toes wet in this spaceso i'm really really looking forward toseeing the ton of talent that's going tocome out of this continent in terms ofnot only building on the protocol layerwith bitcoin core but all the way to youknow the higher layers in terms oflightning and user applications so yeahthere's a ton to look forward to thereare ton of folks working in this spaceand our job really is to facilitate thatand to prop it up to a stage where it'svery very easy for a dev to go hey iwant to be a bitcoin dev you can do thati have talent i want to contributesomething bigger than myself you can dothat so really at the end of the day ithink bitcoin is the one savior for thiscontinent that we've been looking forthat actually provides the middle groundwe need to actually becomea prosperous continent and to get to astage where a lot of us have beenclamoring forhas there been any more news on the uhthe political front uh out of any of theuh the countries over there that youcould fill us in on that we might not beaware of on this side of the uh theworldoh yeah so i mean in a country likenigeria for example thegeneral elections are coming up for thepresidency sothere's a lot ofi guess movingof the political landscape in terms ofuncertainty with regards tomaybe the regulation we're gonna expectbut our job really is to at least get incontact and come start conversationswith a lot of these folks that aretrying to get the seat at least that aregetting there in terms of the numbersand could get there so at the end of theday regardless of what regime isactually in the office we still have atleast good comms in terms of trying togetbetter regulation for people andobviously the main reason for that is ifpeople don't have good reg in terms ofgetting access to bitcoin then itbecomes harder for them to gain thataccess which kind of destroys the wholeidea of mass adoption so yeah youdefinitely be watching that i guess withregards to how that unfolds we're tryingour hardest here on i guess on theground to ensure that it's a smoothtransition for a lot of people in termsof how they use bitcoin day-to-day butregardless that's the main reason whywe're building such a resilient system imean at the end of the day you can stilluse bitcoin regardless of what politicalregime is in office or notall right i've just been given the twominute warning by uh the masterceremonies down here stephan laverahimselfso i'll ask you one question you'regoing to have to be pretty quick on yourfeet with it but if you had one lastorange pill to give to somebodywho'd you give it to and whyoh that is that is definitely reallyhardi meansince i have two minutes let me be alittle bit controversial maybe i'd saythe cbn governor in nigeriabecause it's not too bullish sohopefully if we're able to orange pilumthen we can get that cbm vine reversedand a lot of people will be able toeasily innovate in this piecewell thank you for joining us today abubakr and i hope everybody uh feels asbullish as i do when i speak to suchyoung people in the space that it's suchcapableum technical abilities that i can onlydream of having so uh thank you forjoining us everybody please big round ofapplause for abu bakrthank you brotherthanks for having me done have anawesome time guys byethank you daniel and abu bakar what agreat conversation i think there's a lotof things to be bullish onthereso i i think it's just really uhfascinating tosee and i i think it really is a goodquestion as well about the education notjust about bitcoin the technologybitcoin money but also dealing withvolatility in bitcoin that's part ofwhat we deal with in bitcoin so next upwe've got an announcement so i'm we'regoing to have the huddle hall ceo backon
