  "text": "[00:00:59] Preston Pysh: Hey everyone. Welcome\nto the show. I’m here with Tuur Demeester.Tuur, I want to start off by saying we’ve\nbeen having these conversations for quitea few years now. I was looking back and our\nfirst chat was in 2017 and I was like, ohmy God, it has been so many years already.\nWelcome back to the show. It is so awesomehaving you here.[00:01:17] Preston Pysh: You just come with\na wealth of information. So, great to haveyou.[00:01:20] Tuur Demeester: Happy to be here.\nAnd you’re right, I mean, that’s likesix years ago. That was, that was a different\ntime. Although, interestingly enough, weirdly,some of these debates are coming back now,\nlike the block size and stuff like that. Anyway,I’m sure we can talk about it.[00:01:33] Preston Pysh: Well, that’s where\nI, that’s exactly where I want to start,because yeah, I think in our first conversation\nwe were probably talking about how fees werehigh, how you needed to have some type of\nsolution that was, you know, second layerfor immediate settlement, low fees. And here\nwe are back with inscriptions now happeningon the base layer and lots of people saying,\noh my God, like what’s happening?[00:01:59] Preston Pysh: And you’re seeing\nall the OGs kind of just smirk. What are,what are your thoughts on inscriptions?[00:02:07] Tuur Demeester: This is both of\nus smirking right now for the audio listeners.Yeah, I mean, and, and the nice thing is that\nback then we were saying these things of like,yes, so we cannot do everything on the base\nlayer.[00:02:19] Tuur Demeester: It’s just how\nprotocols work in general. You have to engineerthese things with a particular function for\na particular layer, and if you have a differentfunction, you build another layer on top.\nThat’s how you scale. The foundations ofa building have a particular function that’s\nnot where you’re going to hang the picture.[00:02:35] Tuur Demeester: Right. The picture\nis going to be on the first floor, the secondfloor. So, but back then, the challenge was\nthat the Lightning Network had been conceived,which is the, the payment layer on top of\nBitcoin. Theoretically, it had been conceivedthat it wasn’t built yet, and now, six years\nlater, it’s actually here.[00:02:51] Tuur Demeester: We have over 5,000\nBitcoin that are circulating at massivelyrapid speeds in that lightning layer, and\nespecially I think that’s going to be importantfor this year, is large exchanges are starting\nto implement it and they’re motivated bythese high fees because they also pay a part\nof that and they know they can lose customersif they’re going to charge $10 per, you\nknow, if you, you have $50 worth of Bitcoinand we, you get a $10 withdrawal fee, that’s\nreally heavy. Or $20.[00:03:17] Tuur Demeester: I mean, who knows\nwhere it’s going to go this year. So it’sit’s a problem that is solving itself. And,\nbut it’s true on the other hand that a lotof people have the same question. And I think\nit’s understandable because there’s alwaysa bit of an eternal September that happens\nin Bitcoin where there’s always newcomers.[00:03:34] Tuur Demeester: There’s always\nnew people that need to be educated. And soit’s, it’s great that people are asking\nthese questions.[00:03:40] Preston Pysh: I love the example\nof not hanging the picture on the foundation,and you have so many people that are literally\ntrying to buy the picture and it literallyput it on the foundation of Bitcoin.[00:03:52] Preston Pysh: Talk to us about\nthe, like what inscriptions are and when thisbecame capable to even do on the base layer,\nbecause I think there’s people that hearinscriptions and they have no idea what we’re\neven talking about. So give them a littlebit of context and kind of your thoughts at\nlarge at what this is and what it means.[00:04:11] Tuur Demeester: Actually, I’ve\nbeen leaning back about this. I haven’tdug in deep because I felt like, you know,\nfrom the get-go, it seemed like an odd thingto do on the main layer. I do think in the\nmain layer it can be a place for preservation.Like, you know, literally what you inscribe\non the main Bitcoin blockchain could be storedfor hundreds of years.[00:04:29] Tuur Demeester: So there, there\nis a, there is a, a meaning to it potentially.But I, I haven’t taken the deep dive. I,\nI still felt like I was a bit of a hype. Somaybe you can take my role here and, and share\nus with the audience what you’ve learnedso far, and we can kind of tell us a little\nbit about this.[00:04:45] Preston Pysh: Yeah, I mean, and\njust in general, the intention is, is thatthe storage in each block is for transactions.[00:04:51] Preston Pysh: I don’t think that\nthere was an intention for some of that storageon the base layer blocks to be used for things\nbeyond payment. But through the latest updateswith the Taproot update and SegWit and some\nof these other things, that there’s nowa way that you can actually inscribe data\ninto the base layer.[00:05:12] Preston Pysh: You’re going to\npay a fee to do it. And as we’re findingout, I think there’s 150 blocks or something\nlike, I mean, it’s a really high numberthat are in the queue of the mempool waiting\nto be. What’s the proper term I should use?Minted or found by the miners? What would\nbe the correct terminology for…[00:05:29] Tuur Demeester: Yeah, I mean maybe\nyou could say in inscribed or waiting to beto be broadcast, you know, broadcast on the\nnetwork and then inscribed in the ledger forever.And so in, in a way, it doesn’t even really\nmatter what it is that the, these people arewanting to inscribe, like clearly it’s related\nto some kind of a perceived idea of scarcity.Like a, there’s, there’s a collector’s\nvalue to having something particular inscribedin a particular block, and then you get to\nclaim something.[00:05:57] Tuur Demeester: I mean, people\nhave always, you know, for status sake, likepeople have built statues in the past and\nall kinds of things that cost money and that,that don’t have like clear utility. Other\nthan to like say something about the authoror the owner. And so I think it’s actually\nreally interesting to think about the quoteunquote waste because there is an ongoing\nconcern that the Bitcoin block rewards aregetting less, less every four years, so, so\nthis is what people generally think aboutwhen they think about mining Bitcoin, is that\nthere’s new bitcoins being minted and aregiven to the miners, and then on top of that,\nthere’s transaction fees that are earnedby the miners.[00:06:37] Tuur Demeester: But for the first,\nI don’t know, five, 60 years, there’sso little transactions happening that there\nwere no fees basically. And so that was thereward. But then the concern has been, well,\nif this keeps going and the new Bitcoins getless and less, because we know it’s going\nto stop at 21 million. So by probably in,in about 20 years from now, it’s the, the\nnew supply is is going to be virtually zeroalready.[00:06:59] Tuur Demeester: And so if we wouldn’t\nworried, like, well, how are the miners goingto keep making enough money to build that\nfirewall, to keep protecting Bitcoin, to haveenough hash power and, and, and throw enough\nelectricity at the network to deter attackers?And the answer is, is of course, fees, right?\nTransaction fees. And so you could argue thatwhen transaction fees are artificially low,\nsay for example, in a bear market, peoplewill come up with some kind of use for the\nmain blockchain, whatever it is, it’s ordinalsor it’s NFTs or whatever, some smart contract\nthat sounds funny or fancy or, or profitable.[00:07:31] Tuur Demeester: And they’ll,\nthey’ll stick it on the blockchain and ina way they’ll clog up the, slowly the, the\nmempool until it’s high enough. Which isthe mempool by the way, is like the queue,\nthe queue of transactions, until finally theblocks are getting full and the fees go up\nagain. So in a way, you could say it’s thisself-regulating mechanism if there’s not\nenough naturally occurring, just very kindof pragmatic transactions that there’s other\nuses that are eventually generating profitsfor the minors.[00:08:00] Tuur Demeester: So it’s an argument\nto say that rather than calling this spam,and we have to fight it at all costs, we can\njust be like, look, the, the block size isfixed, like blocks are never going to be more\nthan about four megabytes in size. And soyeah, let them throw whatever in those blocks\nbecause it’s going to help us fund the Bitcoinfirewall.[00:08:19] Preston Pysh: So Dylan LeClair\nhad a tweet yesterday that I think encapsulatesmy opinion and probably your opinion quite\nwell. He wrote, Bitcoin has a security budgetproblem. Fees aren’t sufficient. It needs\ntail emissions, which is the argument thatpeople were making when the fees were too\nlow. Now that the fees are really high, thisis the continuation of his tweet.[00:08:42] Preston Pysh: Bitcoin has a throughput\nproblem. Fees are too high, it needs biggerblocks, and so then he writes, your inherent\ndesire for human intervention at every turnis exactly what Bitcoin solved. Please just\nshut up.[00:08:57] Tuur Demeester: That’s it. Like\npeople should like print that on a posterand hang it on the wall or something.[00:09:02] Tuur Demeester: Or it should be\nlike a one of those car stickers.[00:09:04] Preston Pysh: You know, Saylor\ndid an interview and he was talking abouthow not tinkering with the base layer. And\nit being so difficult to implement changesat this point in the process, at the base\nlayer is akin to not being able to tinkerwith the laws of physics and how everything\ncan be built and constructed upon such a baselayer because people can base their development\nand base their engineering around these thingsthat are core principles.[00:09:37] Preston Pysh: That aren’t going\nto be changed. And it really goes to Dylan’squote that he, that he has there. And I really\nchallenge people to think about how importantthat is. Your inherent desire for human intervention\nat every turn is exactly what Bitcoin solves.It’s something we can build upon.[00:09:55] Tuur Demeester: Yeah. And, and\nthe Bitcoin’s immutability is, its bedrock.[00:09:59] Tuur Demeester: Like that is what\neverything is built on. And so what you’resaying, exactly what you’re saying is Satoshi\nintuited this, there’s this brilliant littlethrowaway message that he wrote on the forums\nback in 2010, I think, where he’s like comparingBitcoin to a boring gray metal. He’s like,\nimagine a boring gray metal that has likeno clear use in industry or, or technology.[00:10:24] Tuur Demeester: It’s just sitting\nthere. The only properties it has is thatit’s scarce and you can send it through\na communications channel. Like you can sendit around digitally at very low cost. Like\nwhat would happen? Oh, that, you know, hewas referring to Bitcoin, right? In his mind,\nBitcoin is like one of the atomic elements.[00:10:42] Tuur Demeester: It’s like a boring\ngray metal with fixed properties that youcan just send around the world. And so, yeah,\nit’s immutability and this is a learningprocess. People have to understand. They’re\nso used to everything being that you can engineereverything. And, and then we come from a financial\nparadigm where literally you want higher interestrates.[00:10:59] Tuur Demeester: We’re just going\nto sit in a room and push a button, and theinterest rates are higher. Like we can, you\nknow, we’re like the Wizards of Oz, likethe, the man behind the curtain. Like we’re\nso used to having that man around. So I thinkit’s understandable that people are trying\nto, whenever they’re anxious about something,they think the, the protocol needs to be tinkered\nwith.[00:11:17] Preston Pysh: I was at the Micro\nStrategy Conference last week and I had thepleasure of having a one-on-one chat with\nMichael Saylor and I, I said to Michael, well,how about from like an attack standpoint with\nthe inscriptions? And they’re just inundatingit with endless supply of fiat. And he just\nkind of like smiled and he says, okay, sonow they’re incentivizing use of the Lightning\nNetwork and everybody kind of moving to buildingthat out and loading that up with additional\nchannels so that they can transact with near,you know, frictionless fees on layer two.[00:11:50] Preston Pysh: He’s like, so it’s\na win. It’s a win for layer two. And I justkind of like smiled and I was like going back\nto things that you and I have been talkingabout for years. It just seems like every\nattack made on Bitcoin is an opportunity forit to grow and expand and become stronger\nin the area that maybe the attacker isn’tthinking is necessary, and then it doesn’t\neven address the fact that these higher feesare going straight into the pockets of miners\nthat then are either retaining that in Bitcoinor buying more rigs to deploy in the lowest\ncost energy environment, or location possible.I don’t necessarily know whether the whole\ninscription thing is good or bad, but wheneverI’m looking at this idea of not intervening\nand not messing with the code, it seems likethe build, it naturally incentivizes building\nin, in places where it needs to happen.[00:12:45] Tuur Demeester: Right. I mean,\nBitcoin is an ecosystem with clear rules,and so if you put stress on an ecosystem like\nthat, it’s going to grow around it and,and, and creatively build around the problem.\nAnd that’s why like, it’s brilliant likethat. We have these pressures. The fees are\ngoing up, people are starting to get uncomfortable.[00:13:03] Tuur Demeester: That’s what gives\nthe impetus for people to be like, I’m goingto install a lightning wallet on my phone\nfor the exchanges that I’ve been like, Imean, Coinbase has been resisting it forever.\nThe same with Binance and all the big exchangeslike the, the exchanges that have been cutting\nedge, that are kind of like, you know slowerplayers and they’re probably going to win\nin the long run.[00:13:21] Tuur Demeester: To be honest, they\nhave been implementing lighting for quitea while, like Bitfinex, Kraken, and it’s,\nit’s kind of like the big ones that havebeen running these casinos. They’re the\nones that are finally coming around now, andthat I think is closing the circle almost.\nI think that, you know, once these last chainsare starting to be lightning compatible, people\nare going to really experience the power oflightning.[00:13:44] Tuur Demeester: And I think you\ncould even make the argument that would ElSalvador have adopted Bitcoin if lightning\nwasn’t around? Because as far as I understand,I think Chivo was integrated with lightning\nso that if people wanted to buy $20 worthof Bitcoin or $10 worth of Bitcoin, it would.\nMaybe they had some kind of centralized, theywere like the central relay or something,\nbut I, I think that’s important.[00:14:06] Tuur Demeester: You know, these\nkind of things, they’re little steppingstones. So, yeah, and sometimes people just\nhave to kind of experience network effectsfor themselves. Like it, it or logarithmic\nevolution of things like, yeah, it’s growingat 20% a year, but they don’t think it’s\nfast enough. It’s like, well, let’s giveit a few years and you’ll see what that\nmeans.[00:14:25] Preston Pysh: Yeah. I had a moment\nrecently talking about layer one versus layertwo, so, I was using Nostr, everybody’s\nfamiliar with basically zapping Satoshi toother people, almost like their likes, you\nknow, on Twitter. And I tried out Cash App,so I was using Wallet of Satoshi to use the\napps and I was like, you know what?[00:14:43] Preston Pysh: Let me try out Cash\nApp. And I used Cash App and what was so amazingto me was I went into Cash App, I bought,\ncall it $20 worth of Bitcoin into the, intothe Cash app if I wanted to send that layer\none to another wallet. You know, I just putin the, the wallet address for a layer one\nBitcoin address and it just sent it.[00:15:04] Preston Pysh: But everything happening\non these Zaps on Nostr is layer two. It’simmediately settling lightning layer two.\nI go there and I’m zapping somebody’saccount with some SATs and I use cash app\nand it just immediately sent the SAT. AndI know that’s layer two, that’s that’s\nhappening. So, It’s already completely seamlesson Cash App, whether I’m using layer one\nor layer two, and I never, like, I just putthe the address for layer two in there and\nit’s just naturally new.[00:15:36] Preston Pysh: And if I put Layer\none in there, it’s just naturally new. Andso from a user experience standpoint, the\nuser doesn’t even have to understand anyof that. And I can’t, I mean, this is, I\ndon’t know the market cap, size of CashApp and Square, but I mean it’s probably\nlike a 30 billion company that has implementedthis.[00:15:52] Preston Pysh: And I think they’re\nthe first one that I’ve come across whereit was literally just seamless. Whether, I\ndidn’t even have to know what I was using.I just knew I was using quote unquote Bitcoin\nand I could put any address in there and itjust worked.[00:16:04] Tuur Demeester: Right. Yeah. And\nthis, this is the kind of stuff that is knownas like the 10 year overnight success.[00:16:09] Tuur Demeester: Like if you’ve\nbeen in the Bitcoin ecosystem, you understandthat people have been working on lightning\nfor so long. But if you’re an outsider,you’re going to, all of a sudden it’s\nlike the light is switched on. It’s like,oh, whoa. Like this is possible. Yeah. And\nand, and all of a sudden all these, like,all this concern monitoring about like, Bitcoin\nis slow and you can only do three, three transactionsa second and it’s never going to scale.[00:16:32] Tuur Demeester: Like all that is\njust going poof. Yeah. And then the same thingis happening, I don’t know if you’ve been\nfollowing that, is Andrew Pool Star’s miniscript. And all the incredible new solutions\nthat are opening up for Bitcoin custody andbasically smart contracts that are blowing,\ntotally blowing out of the water.[00:16:53] Tuur Demeester: These altcoin projects\nthat have been huffing and puffing that youneeded individual professor coin that is like\nspecially designed for smart contracts thatis just also going to go poof, and that’s\nalso going to be part of Bitcoin’s 10 yearovernight success. Is that like, Oh, but the\nfear mongers were always saying like, no,no, no.[00:17:14] Tuur Demeester: Bitcoin is just\nsome kind of weird E gold. You can never buildcontracts on that. And then all of a sudden,\nhere we are with, with Oros, with confidentialasset issuance. All of a sudden all the stuff\nthat supposedly you could only do on Altcoins,it’s right here. It’s in the Bitcoin world\nand it’s nuclear proof.[00:17:32] Tuur Demeester: Like it has that\nlike really solid bedrock of code that iscarefully designed, carefully, pen tested\nfor years so that if you built something,it’s not actually all apart. Let’s say\nit’s like the Lego blocks, like, you know,it’s, it has that internal logic where you\nalmost can’t do it wrong. And that’s justso exciting.[00:17:51] Tuur Demeester: And that’s, that’s\ncoming, that’s happening right now.[00:17:53] Preston Pysh: And what I’m so\nexcited about is if they’re trying to dothis and inscribe it into the base layer.\nIf they do it and there’s no actual usersand there’s nobody that’s actually using\nthis thing that they’re engineering, they’regoing to go bankrupt, they’re going to run\noutta, they’re going to run outta money,and they’re not going to be able to afford\nthe fees.[00:18:11] Preston Pysh: In order to make\nthese inscriptions and use up the space onlayer one, I’m hopeful that it’s all just\ngoing to naturally like the fee, and as thefees go higher, it’s just going to naturally\nsolve demand for a limited scarce amount ofspace every 10 minutes. And it’s going to\nincentivize miners to make, continue, to makethe, the network more secure. And, yeah, I\ndon’t know.[00:18:37] Tuur Demeester: I mean, people\nhave made this comparison with, you know,the Bitcoin, blockchain and international\nshipping, you know, the, the, the whole ecosystemof international shipping and, and, and the,\nthe, the format of the shipping containerand that you know, one, one Bitcoin block\nyou can compare to like a big container shipand you know, there’s only so many ships\nand they go pretty slow.[00:18:58] Tuur Demeester: But every block\ncan contain a huge amount of data, right?And just like a, every single container can\ncontain all kinds of stuff, and it’s makingthe world wealthier, and it’s such a, a\ngreat system. And like, no, we don’t wantbigger containers, right? It just trickles\ndown, like people just have to slowly understandthese, these concepts.[00:19:17] Preston Pysh: Why do you think\npeople have this urge to always step in andthink that they have to fix the base layer\nof Bitcoin? Because isn’t that kind of likeinherently the issue we’re talking about\nis how can we cognitively, how can we convincepeople, Hey, keep your hands off of it. That\nis truly the thing that was solved for wasthis, you know, laws of physics type.[00:19:39] Preston Pysh: Going back to that\nexample, why, why do people feel like theyhave to step in and that they have to do this\nchange?[00:19:46] Tuur Demeester: Yeah, that’s\na good question. It’s probably like, there’sprobably a multitude of like factors that\nplay into that. I think one is of course,that we’ve been living in the fiat era since\n1913.[00:19:56] Tuur Demeester: Yes. And that there’s\nall these economic theories that, that aretrying to justify why we need to print money,\nwhy we need to intervene, and so in a waythat that’s just been, and also why capitalism\nis flawed and free trade is flawed. And sowe need all this interventionism. It’s almost\nbecome the norm, right?[00:20:14] Tuur Demeester: It’s, we, we’ve\nliterally been spoonfed this stuff ever sincewe went to school. And, and you don’t even\nhave to have studied economics like it’sin the newspapers. It’s, and, and every\ntime something goes wrong Yeah. Like the sourcerapprentice has to, has to come up with some\nkind of big intervention. And, and I thinknow, interestingly enough, that paradigm is\nrunning, running on fumes.[00:20:37] Tuur Demeester: It’s kind of\nlike at a dead end and, and it’s going tostart deteriorating. And you know, in places\nlike Argentina, like people have been like,yeah, but I already voted for the interventionist.\nLike even young people, they’re like, Ivoted for Christina. Five years ago, 10 years\nago, but like everything got worse and worse.[00:20:52] Tuur Demeester: So what’s the\nalternative? And so I think that’s the beautifulthing, is that Bitcoin is such a constructive\nproject. Like it doesn’t, it’s not, itembodies very naturally all these, all these\nprinciples that I think people will, throughosmosis and, and just by handling it, they\nwill start learning.[00:21:08] Tuur Demeester: Learning a, a different\nway of thinking, like kind of like integratingsome of the thinking that engineers naturally\nhave into people’s everyday life when theythink about economics and finance and maybe\neven moral things like that.[00:21:23] Preston Pysh: One final question\non this. At what point would you say maybewe need to look at a change on the base layer?[00:21:30] Preston Pysh: Would it be something\nlike the fees associated with conducting atransaction exceed that of Fed Wire and they’ve\nbeen like this for four or five years? Isthat when we have to maybe as a community,\ntake a closer look at what’s actually happening?Or do you think that even raising the issue\nis, you know, not appropriate?[00:21:51] Tuur Demeester: I once was like\nflipping on Twitter and I said like one daythe cost of broadcasting a Bitcoin transaction\non the, on the Bitcoin blockchain is goingto be the same as leasing a shipping container.\nI know that’s probably, that’s probablyout there, like that’s probably excessive.\nStill the principle is there, like there arecertain things that are done in the real world\non a daily basis by people who are just verydeep into a certain market, like, you know,\nmoving a ton of physical gold, for example.[00:22:21] Tuur Demeester: That happens all\nthe time. And it’s just a very specializedthing, and it’s handled mostly by corporations\nand those kind of things. And so if he, youknow Gregory Maxwell had a great way of, of\nexplaining what the blockchain really is froma principal point of view. He said it’s,\nit’s basically a court system.[00:22:40] Tuur Demeester: You know, it’s\na going to court to resolve disputes and courtsare expensive, you know, and, and there are\nmany other ways to prevent disputes, to mediatedisputes by technology or by using mediators,\net cetera. And that’s the stuff that happensin the higher layers. But if, if you want\nto go to the highest court, that’s goingto be the blockchain.[00:23:01] Tuur Demeester: And so, yeah, it’s,\nit’s, I don’t think that would be a goodenough reason. The cost of the court are too\nhigh. It’s like, no, no, no. We capped theamount of disputes that can be resolved every\n10 minutes at this. This is the cap. And soif you cannot afford to get in that pool you\ngot, or, or to wait long enough to get it,you know, integrated in one of the blocks,\nthen you going to find another way.[00:23:23] Tuur Demeester: But I mean, if\nyou, you, your question was like, is thereany role to maybe, you know, tinker with the\nblockchain, I think, or, or with the rules,the consensus rules. The only thing over the\nyears that I’ve encountered that I, thatwould give me pause, is if there was some\nif SHA-256 was somehow compromised and, and,you know, the basic cryptography was compromised\nbecause of quantum computing or somethinglike that.[00:23:47] Tuur Demeester: But even then,\nsome people I’ve talked to said that youcould probably solve it with a soft fork,\nwhich makes sense. It would. It would meanthat people who want their, it’s almost\nlike there’s this biblical flood, right?All of a sudden the land that we thought was\nsafe is not safe and we have to move to higherground.[00:24:05] Tuur Demeester: So you could do\nthat with a soft fork is you create a certaintype of Bitcoin UTXO that is more protected\nagainst this aggressive form of computing.Something like that, or a different form of\nmining, or, I’m probably not explainingit right, but it’s, it’s in that direction\nso that a lot of people would have to takeaction, but you would still not hard fork\nthe the protocol.[00:24:25] Tuur Demeester: Yeah. So, so just\nto be, to give a short answer, no. I haven’tfound a reason why anyone would have to hard\nfork Bitcoin ever.[00:24:34] Preston Pysh: You have been writing\nepic profound pieces for quite a while. I’mjust going to name a couple. You have an article\ncalled the Bitcoin Reformation one calledBitcoin and Heavy Accumulation.[00:24:46] Preston Pysh: These were both in\n2017. You have another one. How to positionfor the rally in Bitcoin. This was back in\n2015 when the price was $200 a Bitcoin. I’mgoing to have links in the show notes to all\nthree of these articles so people can go backand, and read them. They are very robust.\nThey go into a ton of detail.[00:25:04] Preston Pysh: Some of the themes\nthat you were writing about back then wasscalability, which we discussed on the first\npart of the show user experience, which wealso talked about with the cash app and other\nwallets that are just way like insanely profoundcompared to what we were looking at back in\nthis period of time.[00:25:24] Preston Pysh: Regulatory issues,\ndisrupting power structures, commitment tothis long-term vision. When you look back\nand you audit yourself in what you were writingabout, is there anything that you feel like\nyou missed or something that you feel likeyou got really right? And I bring this up\nbecause we’re about to talk about your latestbehemoth of a report that just came out.[00:25:45] Preston Pysh: That’s phenomenal.\nAnd so I’m, I’m trying to kind of highlightthat to the reader as you’re just kind of\nassessing and auditing yourself.[00:25:52] Tuur Demeester: When I read through\nthese old reports, it’s easy to kind ofbe like, oh, I could have, you know, tweaked\nthis or tweaked that. But overall, I am reallyproud. I, I am, you know, I feel good about\nthe general content if I have to think aboutthat particular report.[00:26:06] Tuur Demeester: I would say I was\na bit overly optimistic about the liquid network,about how that fast that was going to be developed\nor side chains in general. Which is basicallysomewhere in the middle between the main chain\nand the Lightning network. It’s like theidea that you have a faster settlement and\nmore flexible settlement network.[00:26:26] Tuur Demeester: I do think that\nthe conclusion was talking about the nextfive years, so we’re still within that range.\nLike five years from the portably, 2024. Sosome of those things could really happen.\nYeah, and the financialization actually happened,like options and futures have become an important\npart of the Bitcoin project.[00:26:43] Tuur Demeester: And then I’m\nglad I didn’t venture too far into speculatingabout what all coins could do and the things\nthat we could see there because it’s, itis kind of by nature, such an unpredictable\nspace, and a lot of it plays on the what isalive at the moment, you know? Yeah. Like\nthese fads that come and go.[00:26:59] Tuur Demeester: And so I’m glad\nI did. I didn’t really pay much attentionto that.[00:27:03] Preston Pysh: Total clown wear.[00:27:06] Tuur Demeester: A lot of it, and\na lot of it is, is kind of showing us whatdoesn’t work. So maybe we should be grateful.[00:27:11] Preston Pysh: Yeah, no, that’s\na great point. It really is showing you whatdoesn’t work, and I think some of the technology\nis, things that people can think about is,is how can you incorporate maybe some of these\nideas into the base layer.[00:27:22] Preston Pysh: So that’s a great\nway to look at it. Okay, so let’s talk aboutyour newest report. How many pages was this?\nThis is like 20 pages or 25 pages or somethinglike that. So some of the themes you have\nin this that we can just kind of go one byone here. You say Bitcoin is on the brink\nof decoupling with stocks and crypto.[00:27:42] Preston Pysh: What are you getting\nat here?[00:27:45] Tuur Demeester: That’s a good\nquestion. I think that the year 2021 was aculmination of, I don’t know, something\nin the air that was like peak irrationalityor something like that, or peak animal spirits,\nor whatever you want to call it. There wasthe, what was it called again? For markets\nat large, you’re saying?[00:28:04] Tuur Demeester: Yeah, markets at\nlarge. So like the Wall Street bets were goingnuts, and they were going, you know, buying\nshort-term options on a M C and all thesecrappy companies. And then real estate just\ntotally boomed and peaked. And then in the,you know, I think NFTs were also such a big\npart of that huge rally, and Bitcoin was kindof caught up in that, in that slip stream.[00:28:25] Tuur Demeester: And then what we’ve\nseen since, like we’re only two years later,is that both those markets like crypto. And\nthe stock markets, but also the bond marketsand housing, they’re all deteriorating.\nIt’s all kind of coming down and, and itmakes sense because we had a huge rise in\ninflation followed by that.[00:28:44] Tuur Demeester: I think Michael\nSailor had a great metaphor of like, it’slike a fighter jet that like, you know, goes\ndown to the earth and then goes up straightinto the air and, you know, and then the,\nand then the pilot loses consciousness, youknow. It’s like that’s kind of what the\nFed is doing to the markets kind of –[00:28:58] Preston Pysh: And the wings get\nripped off. Don’t forget the wings gettingripped off. He, he also included that, right?[00:29:04] Tuur Demeester: Yeah. And so then\nit’s like, all right, well, so this is theeconomy, this is the 500 trillion economy,\nso where do we go, right? And so Bitcoin tome, is a huge part of the answer. It’s,\nit’s like we’ve been stuck in this theaterthat’s now actually on fire and a lot of\nthe exits are starting to look really bad.[00:29:21] Tuur Demeester: You know, people\nused to flee in bonds and they used to fleein real estate and, and maybe even, you know,\nsome of the utility stocks are not lookingso good anymore. So anyway, so that, that’s\nmy general framework for why do I think Bitcoinis going to decouple? Basically because, and\nthis has been my thesis since 12 years ago,is like, if you want to position.[00:29:40] Tuur Demeester: For an economic\ndepression, you want to have assets that havehigh liquidity and low counterparty risk,\nand of course scarcity because that that speaksfor itself. And that was the big aha moment\nwhen I found Bitcoin is like, oh my God, thisis a depression instrument. Mm-hmm. If, if\nwe’re going to have a giant wealth transferwhere the economy needs to recalibrate, because\nit’s been overinvesting and, and overextending,Bitcoin is going to be the funnel through\nwhich a lot of that is going to happen.[00:30:09] Preston Pysh: One of the other\nmain things that you talked about in thisnew report is Bitcoin Nation State adoption\nis set to become a big theme. I think everybody’swell familiar with the El Salvador, but I\nthink a lot of people were looking aroundand saying, okay, so there’s one country.\nThere’s really nobody else that’s donethis.[00:30:26] Preston Pysh: And you’re saying\nat this moment in time, you think moving forward,what in the next two years that we’re going\nto see a lot of other nation states startto do something similar?[00:30:36] Tuur Demeester: Yes, I think the\nprice will speak volumes. I think the reasonwhy there’s been a delay in adoption, because\nyou think like, oh, El Salvador is first,but they kind of announced pretty close to\nthe top of the market.[00:30:47] Tuur Demeester: And so then it’s\nlike once the, the market goes sideways andit goes down a bit and there’s more skepticism.\nPoliticians are pretty whimsical. Like they’renot going to risk their whole career on, on,\nyou know, some high volatility, that it couldbe a bubble. They don’t really understand\nit. And so I think in a way it’s good thatwe had this consultation period even though\nfor some people it was brutal financiallyspeaking.[00:31:08] Tuur Demeester: Yeah, I think it’s\nreally good. I do think based on what I’ve,the conversations I’ve had with people that\nknow a lot more about this, because they’reworking on, you know, Chivo wallet, they’re\nworking, they’re talking to politiciansall the time. Is that there’s still a lot\nof hesitation when it comes to like boldlydoing something so boldly as El Salvador.[00:31:29] Tuur Demeester: You know, he is\na bit of a maverick and he is seen that way.But it, it is possible that we’ll have new\nmavericks being elected. You know, that’spossible. People that run on a Bitcoin ticket\nthat are not in power now. And then also centralbanks are starting to get really uncomfortable\nbecause like they’re claim to fame.[00:31:48] Tuur Demeester: The reason why\nthey have supposedly a strong currency ora strong position, is they have that balance\nsheet that has all kinds of fancy assets andit has gold and this and that. And now those\nassets, those balance sheets are deterioratinglike the bonds and, and the four x reserves,\nthey’re all kind of declining and, and lookingvery, very shaky.[00:32:08] Tuur Demeester: And so, and then\nthey’ve been investing in tech stocks, someof these, you know, central banks and I don’t\nknow. And so I think it makes total sensethat in the next two years we’ll have some\ncentral banks start putting some money inBitcoin. And also interesting, there’s also\nkind of a game theoretical element at playwhere of course if you’re the first central\nbank to buy, you’re going to get a lot cheaper.[00:32:30] Tuur Demeester: Bitcoins of obviously,\nbut there’s also like politically speaking,People have noticed that the IMF has gotten\nreally uncomfortable about El Salvador. Yes.El Salvador being so bold and being like going\nagainst IMF and, and no longer being so subservient.And so even to like, let up a little balloon,\nit’s like, hey, we’re thinking about adoptingBitcoin.[00:32:51] Tuur Demeester: You know, you’re\ntalking to the IMF. It’s like, you know,maybe if we don’t like your terms, we’re\njust going to switch and we’re just goingto follow El Salvador. So it doesn’t mean\nthey’ll do it right away, but, you know,this is starting to become like a political\nbargaining chip potentially. And the sameas with mining, right?[00:33:04] Tuur Demeester: If, if you’re\ncut off from the world. You can be like, let’sjust build a bunch of Bitcoin mines or just,\nyou know, have low taxes and we want to fosterBitcoin, a Bitcoin economy in our country\nbecause we’re a brick, one of the brickcountries. Or you know, like, I mean it does,\nI don’t think it’s a coincidence thatEl Salvador adopted Bitcoin because they’re\nlandlocked and they have huge amounts of volcanoes.[00:33:25] Tuur Demeester: I think there’s\nover a hundred. So there is that long-termpotential of becoming a kind of a mining powerhouse.\nAnd there’s many other countries that havethe same problem of energy. Rich, but, but\nkind of constrained in terms of energy transportation.[00:33:41] Preston Pysh: Speaking of country\nadoption in Argentina, there’s a politicalcandidate right now who looks like he could\nbe a member of the, of the Beatles, and he’spro Bitcoin.[00:33:50] Preston Pysh: I know you’re familiar\nwith Argentina, so what are your thoughtshere?[00:33:53] Tuur Demeester: Yeah, Javier. Yeah.\nYeah. I, I am familiar, although I haven’tbeen in a long time, I, I really want to go\nback. I actually learned about Bitcoin in,in Buenos Air for the first time. Yeah. Javier\nMelay, from what I’ve seen so far is heis a economics professor.[00:34:09] Tuur Demeester: He is been teaching\neconomics for over 20 years. When he was akid in the early, I think it was in the early\neighties, he was 12 years old and there washyperinflation raging through Argentina, and\nhe said that when he was 12 is when he decidedhe’s going to become an economist. And and\nactually his, his his sideburns are probablya, a nudge to I forget his name now, but a\nfamous general in Latin American history whokicked the Spanish out kind of likes and equivalent\nof Peru and Argentina and Brazil, I believe.[00:34:43] Tuur Demeester: And so young people,\nthey, they grew up with these stories aboutthis general, and all of a sudden there’s\na guy who very much looks like him. Apparentlyhe’s pulling tremendously well among the\nyoung people. People are saying that, youknow, likely they don’t agree with all his\neconomic ideas, because everybody’s beenraised very much in the interventionist mindset,\nbut at least they understand that he standsfor something different.[00:35:06] Tuur Demeester: He’s been advocating\nfor competing currencies. So he wants to put,allow for the dollar to just circulate freely\nagain and so basically re dollarize the economyand then he’s not been critical of Bitcoin\nat all. When people ask him about it, he,he explains that it’s very important that\nwe have private currencies and that centralbanking is a scam because it robs people the,\nthe populace of money by means of the inflationtax.[00:35:29] Tuur Demeester: And it’s very,\nvery interesting how millennials are so galvanizedby this new person and new movement.[00:35:35] Preston Pysh: And for people that\naren’t familiar with Argentina, their inflationfor their local currency is a hundred percent\nannual. Right now. Bitcoin has already madenew highs in that country, in their local\ncurrency terms, and I recently read that theyhave cut off citizen’s ability to use apps\nto buy Bitcoin and basically accumulate itthrough like traditional exchanges like we\nhave here in the US and and abroad.[00:36:03] Preston Pysh: Yeah, I mean, it’s\ngetting really interesting. One of my mainconcerns on this one Tuur, if I just have\nto be quite frank, is I’ve been talkinga lot about this idea that if you’re not\na net producer, it’s near impossible foryou to store your savings or your retained\nearnings in Bitcoin because you’re a netconsumer, right?[00:36:22] Preston Pysh: And all of those\nbills and all those expenses for net consumersare often in the local currency that they’re\nliving in. And so why introduce the insaneamount of volatility that you get with Bitcoin\nwhen you’re a net consumer and you haveall these bills that need to be paid. By introducing\nthat volatility, sometimes you’re makingit way harder for yourself in order to complete\nthe obligations that you’re already accumulatingliabilities on your personal balance sheet.[00:36:51] Preston Pysh: So this applies for\nthe individual. This applies for the business,this applies for the country. And so when\nI look at a lot of these countries where theyhave really poor currencies, Argentina, you\nname it, like just go around the world. I’m,most countries are dealing with insane issues\nwith their local currencies.[00:37:09] Preston Pysh: A lot of these same\ncountries are net consumers. They’re notnet producers. Not all but, but a lot. And\nso where I think it’s hard for these, andyou also look at these same countries and\nthey’re heavily influenced by the IMF andthe World Bank that just snow continues to\nsnowball and roll their debt so that in nominalterms, the debt just keeps getting larger\nand larger and literally impossible to repayas they roll into the next loan, which is\nan even larger amount that they have to borrowjust to have liquidity in their system.[00:37:41] Preston Pysh: And so when I look\nat what’s happened in El Salvador, and heabsolutely is a maverick because they fit\nthat complete description that I just explained,right? And so many other countries are in\nthat same situation, and they’re lookingat the IMF and they’re like, okay, I can\nget liquidity, which will solve my short termissue.[00:37:59] Preston Pysh: I understand Bitcoin\nis the solution, but there’s no way forme to actually save and store this thing because\nI’m a net consumer. I’m not a net producer.So there’s kind of this quandary that’s\nplaying out where maybe the citizens are gettingit and maybe the, the, some of those citizens\nare net producers and they can store theirsavings in Bitcoin, but as you go up the architecture\nto the business, to the country, It’s reallyhard for that to flow up just because of the\nsheer overreach that has occurred with theIMF and the World Bank for a lot of these\ndomains that we’re talking about.[00:38:33] Preston Pysh: So I’m curious\nto hear kind of not that I disagree with your,with your thesis. I think your thesis is true,\nand I think we are going to see more of thisin the coming years. But that’s the hurdle\nI guess, that I see as we’re, as we’relooking at it.[00:38:47] Tuur Demeester: I definitely think\nthat it would be wrong to completely to kindof impose Bitcoin or something like that,\nright?[00:38:56] Tuur Demeester: I think that what\nwe want is let a thousand flowers blossomand we all speak our minds freely, and we\nhave competing currencies in the world, orthat the artificial tax on Bitcoin is removed,\nwhich we totally have, right? If, if you savein Bitcoin, in, in the us, you’re going\nto pay capital gains tax whenever you sellyour money.[00:39:14] Tuur Demeester: It’s kind of\nweird, right? You spend money, but the reasonwhy, because it’s treated as an investment\nin many places. So that’s basically theonly thing you would need to do is just remove\nthat tax and then let the economy slowly viaosmosis and, and kind of like, you know, Bitcoin\nis going to flow where the resistance is leasedand, and people that have low time preference\nand who have the luxury of being able to savewill be able to save some in Bitcoin.[00:39:37] Tuur Demeester: And then when there’s\na big bull market, then they have the moneyto build, to build out some infrastructure\nand start a business. I mean, it’s. You,you’re probably familiar, the the little\nrichest man in Babylon book, right? I mean,the Bitcoin is that kind of money. Well, you\ncan, that was the advice of the wealthiestman in Babylon is like, you just save a little\nbit of your money over the long run, and thenwhen the opportunity comes around, you invested\nin a business.[00:39:57] Tuur Demeester: But with fiat that\nis taken from you. That opportunity to builda nest egg, is it, is rug pulled from you?\nAnd, and also there’s that, you know, I,I don’t know if it’s a fair analogy, but\nI, I do, you know, when I, the Bitcoin reformation,I drew some analogies between organized religion\nand, and and money and Bitcoin.[00:40:15] Tuur Demeester: Today there is\nsome example, right where there was a newmovement, the Protestantism was first just\nkind of rebelling against the church, butthen they did certain things their own way.\nAnd in continental Europe, a lot of Protestantismbecame almost like that imposed version, like\nwe’re going to impose the Bitcoin standardand then you’ve got a lot of conflict because\nit was either or, either you were Catholicor you were Protestant and they kind of both\nbecame calcified and, and just the sourceof incredibly bloody conflicts and, and poverty.[00:40:45] Tuur Demeester: Whereas, you know,\nthe, the, I think the stellar example of theother way was New York new you know, new Amsterdam,\nand then New York City, which had freedomof religion from the get-go. And it just kept\non flourishing and flourishing because themarket just adjusted. And there was this general\ntolerance where individuals could make theirown choices.[00:41:05] Tuur Demeester: And that’s what\nI would like, let these technologies coexist.And it’s way too complicated for you and\nI individually to figure out what technologyneeds to be used were. I mean, that’s what\nthe Soviets tried to do, right? How many tractorsdo we need in this area? I’m like, this\nis impossible. We need markets to figure thosekind of things out.[00:41:24] Tuur Demeester: Amen.[00:41:25] Preston Pysh: Amen to that. Hey,\nthis was a powerful quote in your new report,you said, generally speaking, we can expect\nfor economic activity to switch from emphasizingthe production of consumer goods and services\ntowards goods at the very beginning of thevalue chain. Explain what you mean by this.\nI think this is a really profound commentand I think it can help guide people as they’re\ntrying to navigate the chaos in these markets.[00:41:51] Preston Pysh: Kind of as a guidestone\nto how to think about things from a very firstprinciples kind of way.[00:41:57] Tuur Demeester: Yeah. I’m going\nto draw an analogy and it’s a very simpleone and I know a lot of people are going to\nsay, that’s too simplistic and it’s not.So let, let’s try and go there. Basically,\nwe know that many economies have been livingabove their means.[00:42:12] Tuur Demeester: They’ve been,\nyou know, getting into debt way too much becausethe interest rates were artificially low for\nso long. And so this is the equivalent ofhaving a family living. And they are, they\nhave the opportunity to borrow as much asthey want at a half a percent interest per\nyear for however long they want, unlimitedtime to pay it back.[00:42:33] Tuur Demeester: So what are they\ngoing to do? They’re going to borrow lotsof money. On average, of course. They’re\ngoing to borrow lots of money. They’re goingto build a pool in the backyard, all kind.\nThey’re going to really have a lot of theirspending be focused on consuming consumer\nproducts, clothing, and all these nice things.And then imagine the same situation.[00:42:51] Tuur Demeester: The debt stays\nthe same, whatever they, they’ve accumulatedin debt. And then you’re like, oh, sorry\nguys. We’re changing the rules. The debtis now to be paid at 20% interest per year.\nLike that kind of shock is all of a suddenhappening. So how’s the spending going to\nchange within that family? Well, I mean, it’sgoing to be focused on just having enough\nheat.[00:43:11] Tuur Demeester: Having some food\non the table, very basic foods, maybe havingsome gas for the car. They’re probably going\nto sell some of their cars. They’re probablygoing to downside live in a smaller house.\nSo I imagine that happening on almost a globalscale, like that’s what we’re talking\nabout. And that’s that shift, and that’swhat Austrian econ economists talk about.[00:43:30] Tuur Demeester: When they talk\nabout credit expansion during the, the bullphase of the bubble, right? We, we’ve seen\na huge bubble accumulate over 40 years ofcredit expansion and, and all this spending\nabove your means. And now the piper’s goingto be paid. And so, so just think, keep that\nin the back of your head when you’re thinkingabout investing like Apple.[00:43:48] Tuur Demeester: Yeah. But it’s\na great company. Yeah. Yeah. But they sellconsumer products. A lot of the NASDAQ companies,\ngreat companies, but it won’t matter ifthe consumer doesn’t have the funds to keep\nconsuming those products. So it’s very simple.And so then what you go back to is basically\nthe market realizes we’ve been underinvestingin just simple things like pulling oil out\nof the ground and, and, and, you know, growinggrain and having like a store of value for\nyour family.[00:44:14] Tuur Demeester: Like because all\nof a sudden my pension fund blew up. All ofa sudden, my insurance company apparently\nwas invested for 75% in bonds that are evaporating.So my insurance is not going to be worth anything.\nI need to self-insure. How do I do that? Hardmoney, gold, Bitcoin, those kind of basic\nthings. So that’s my framework going intothis depression.[00:44:34] Tuur Demeester: I think it, honestly,\nI think it started with the pandemic. I thinkthat’s 2020 is is kind of my marker. And\nin my mind it’s like this is going to bea 10 year period where we’re going to have\nsome flareups and things going to look betterfor a while, and then they’ll kind of look\nworse and we’ll try and muddle through.[00:44:50] Preston Pysh: You know, I think\nit’s really profound because you’re talkingabout in your example, these, these families\nat locked in rates at 0%, but it’s evenmore profound than that term because if you’re\n60, 65 years old or younger, all you knowis that the rates have continued to go down\nfor your entire life, and so there’s a cognitiveconditioning bias that everybody has that\nthey can roll their debt.[00:45:17] Preston Pysh: Like let’s say\nyou took out a loan for 10 years and you didn’treally pay back the principle on it. You were\nmaking interest payments and you need to rollit. It was always easier. To roll it at a\nlower rate for everybody under the age of60 or 65 years old that are alive today. That\nwas their experience is I could just overconsume.[00:45:38] Preston Pysh: I don’t actually\neven have to pay back the principle. I canjust roll it at a lower rate. And so they’ve\nbeen totally conditioned into thinking thatthey can live in exuberance and just kind\nof expand their debt load for their wholelife. And then at the very, the, the icing\non the cake is what you’re saying, whichis then it got down to literally like a half\na percent interest and they really loadedup and they really went out on the risk curve\nat the absolute worst time possible.[00:46:07] Tuur Demeester: Often at the advice\nof their parents who knew the same thing,who knew the exact same thing.[00:46:11] Tuur Demeester: My parents bought\ntheir first house in their early twentiesin, in 1982. 14% interest rate and they’ve\nonly ever seen it decline. Yeah. It’s exactlywhat you’re talking about. And so, yeah,\nyou’re right. I mean we millennials, I dunnoif you’re still part of it or not, but Barely.\nBarely. Oh, it’s kind of like.[00:46:28] Tuur Demeester: It’s going to\nmean incredible, incredibly difficult adjustment.You’re totally right. There’s that mental\ncost of, of making that switch. And it’salso what we’ve seen is that people who\ndouble down on the rolling over, they’vegotten the rewards, like all the books about\nhow to get rich. We’re always about getone apartment, buy one apartment, and then\nuse that as collateral to get more, and then use that as collateral.[00:46:51] Tuur Demeester: It’s like the,\nthe sky’s the limit. And then meanwhile,if you’re like the, the prudent saver, you\nkind of look like a schmuck.[00:46:58] Preston Pysh: Well, yeah, there\nwas no way for you to, to outperform somebodywho was levered like that in a system where,you know, rolling debt just got easier and easier to to play. So, yeah.[00:47:07] Tuur Demeester: Until Bitcoin. [00:47:08] Preston Pysh: Until Bitcoin, yeah.\nYeah. What an exciting time.",
