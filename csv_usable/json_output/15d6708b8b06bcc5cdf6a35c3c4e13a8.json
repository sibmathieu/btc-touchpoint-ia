of the older ones or thelarpers the um I think it's actuallysome of the neurons no let's well so itthe newer ones who that's what you meanI mean many I I consider it like 2017 inthe past to be the neurons well evennewer than that there are even newerthan that of course when I say the newerones I mean like there's going to bepeople who are trying to make a name forthemselves and so it's hard to make aname for yourself going againstconsensus tell me a moment so you gowith consensus and he says I sometimesthink of it like I remember when pompsaid they're like extremists and he gotso much hate for it but like Iunderstood his point in that it feelslike a little bit like extremist it'slike who can be the most extreme yeahwho can be the biggest [ __ ] andsometimes you know that happensbut I've I I've stood my ground now forfive yearsmy friend I respect you for it and uhnow we have a army of lefties cominginto Bitcoin do it yeah which ones uh soJason Myers just written a book calledthe progressive uh a progressive casefor Bitcoinum Mark Goodwinum well Anita Posh but she's been aroundfor a while I don't know there's a bunchI mean there's also vegetarians orwhatever yeah I mean it's like I thinkif there was like a university course uhin in like Bitcoin and Bitcoin culturethe like classic homework assignments islike explain uh explain a left-leaningpersons uh while listening person woulduh like Bitcoin yeah and it's not sohard like you you don't even have to beleft learning to to understand it I haveno idea sorryis it like a trick to thisI don't know man it's an IQ testah there you go[Music]yeah I did it which side which what doyou pullI'm not telling youoh this is so tasty open[Music]umoh this water is so tastythere's a little bit of paper over itprotecting itit's all a bit unnecessary they've likereinvented the wheel here haven't theythey said that wheel's not round enoughit's Bitcoin ux God I feel it socustodial uh yeahumyeah I I am this book that Jason'swriting I think I think it's the mostimportant book being written about inBitcoinfor uh conservative Bitcoins yeah I meanyou need to you know yeah you need toalways even if you don't agree with apolitical opinion you need to be able toarticulate it in a strong way uhotherwise like you know you're justrepeating the same slogans I think for adifferent reasonI think we do not need partisan politicsin Bitcoinissue absolutely agree yeahand I mean it is a money the money forenemies so yeah you kind of I mean it isfor everyone it should be for everyoneand uh yeah I mean I I don't even seehow ithow it needs to to relate it's just athingBitcoin is just a thing it's an app it'san app on your phone yeah you have anumber on it and then you make a thingin the science of cryptographictransaction and the money consult on theother endwe just uh Sophia who's runningproduction for us today we gave her wegot to download her first wallet nice Igave her all the Bitcoin I've receivedon Nostra which is like 177 000 sets wowthat's a lot yeah cheers we've uh We'veorange product Oh all that also justconvert and sell them buy some beerslater and go yeah thanks Pete see youlater dick may you buy something niceyeah get that in there [ __ ]let's talk about that let's talk aboutzero comps because yeah let's let's justget out let's just get it straight welllet's let's get that one done and out ofthe way just so I fully understand whathappened because you know what I stilldon't fully understandwhat's been done that has kind ofaffected thatpart of your business model so explainyou actually get a chance to do a littlead here explain what bit and I won'tcharge youexplain what bit refill is and why zerowhat zero comes for and why they'rethey're an important part of yourbusiness sure so I meanyeah bitrateful is the number one uhlargest store yeah for real world thingswith Bitcoin uh yeah yeah I mean we'relarger than most Payment Processingnetworks yeah the Amazon Bitcoin yeahthat's the goal yeah and so in practicewith the main thing that we sell is giftcards right so you can go on bitratefuland you can buy a gift card for you knowfor hotels.com or for uh you know forgroceries or for electronics or whateverand then you can go on the e-commercesite or in the physical world or Uber orwhat have you and you just click clickand you redeem the code and you boughtsomething and with Bitcoin but at thesame time yeah you know you didn't don'tneed to educate everybody that works atthe merchant companies because they justsee it as a gift card and they know theyhave systems for how to deal with withthe gift card so it's in the end it'sactually like a faster more convenientyeah than even a regular credit cardpayments online with all of the 3Dsecures all the stuff that's going onthese daysumso uh I mean yeah gift cards are thenumber one non-crypto things that peoplebuy with Bitcoin and we're the leadingservice in that space yeah it's stillquite small you know we're we're Maybealmost medium-sized fish in a very smallpond I'd sayum and we're trying to make it growobviously and and like on a Visionarylevel we're trying to create thecircular Bitcoin economy like a worldwhere opening up your Bitcoin wallet uhto pay so long and you get paid orwhatever is No Stranger Than You Knowhaving a call over uh over Skype orsomething like thatandyeah and so we we accept Bitcoin and wehave lightning we're the first ones toto integrate lightning[Music]umwith the stable coins ethereum as wellandsome other stuffand when it comes to bitcoin uh if youif you're not using lightningand and today20 of Bitcoin users are paying withlightning but the other 80 are payingwith regular on-chain classictransactions is this lightning growingor is that 20 been stableit's uhso lightning is growing as a fraction ofthe Bitcoin share but the Bitcoin shareas a whole is is declining uh comparedto to the general volume okay okay Imean two years ago Bitcoin was 95 of ourvolume and today it's just under 30. anddo you do you know was your suspicion isthat because there's more crypto peoplecoming in or there's bitcoiners who arejust starting to use other cryptothere's a lot of reasons I think thebiggest thing is that in the last twoyears stable coins have really beentaken off okay yeah you have the rapidrise of uh tethering Tron in LatinAmerica and so on and because it turnsout that a lot of people I mean ifyou're getting paidin online yeah let's say you work remotethere whateverum maybe you don't want your uh yourmonthly paycheck to be in a currencythat is volatile even if it goes up morethan it goes down yeah like you know youneed to pay rent at the end of the monthor or whatever and so a lot of peopleprefer yeah to to use a stable coinwhich then I mean it has a lot ofdownsides exposes you to the risk of theissue and all of that stuff right andnonetheless a lot of people prefer thatbecause you get a normal number okay Ihave 10 bucks it's 10 bucks I don't haveto do the math of like how many setsthat is and and so onuh so so there's a lot of growth in inthose things and there's also I think atendency that in the broaderthe broader crypto ecosystem like itused to be that Bitcoin was the basemoneyright Bitcoin was the store value madehim exchange unit of account if you'retrading fit coins on an exchange and itused to be that you have to buy Bitcoinand you send it to a special a special[ __ ] coin exchange the trade you youcount how much Bitcoin you made in theend it was a medium exchange unit ofaccounts to evaluate and when the [ __ ]coins are are like in a bear Marketeverything is tanking so you have toflight to safety so you go out tobitcoin right that was a dynamic but inthis cycle we're seeing a differentDynamic right because big condominanceis not increasing yeah even though we'rein a pretty significant pair market andand the reason is because like that roleis more and more being played uh bystable coins right so yeah nowadays mostBitcoin casinos have Fiat on-ramps uhright away but if they don't you maybeget a stable coin you keep it in yourmetal mask wallets yeah you do whatevertrading gambling uh what type of youwant to do and you cash out back to yourstable coin yeah and so there is aflight to safety but that flight tosafety I think right now is happeningtowards stable coins right and so biggerpart of the crypto economy is moving tostable coins from Bitcoin but also thereis a lot of circular economy growth likereal people that are getting paid onlinefor doing work I mean this is a massiveTrend that I think we're just at thestart of it I mean like we live in aworld where more and more people are youknow what we produce is information andwhen you produce information it doesn'tmatter where you where you live and solong as you have internet on a laptopand so people workeverywhere I mean if you live in Nigeriait's a lot better to work in the US thanto work in Nigeria yeah and but how doyou get paid surprisingly hard yeah it'ssuper hard for the for the companies aswell I mean we have a bunch of people abetter work all over the place we havepeople in 26 countries on Wow sixcontinents and I mean if we had to dealwith the banking systems of all of thosecountries it would be a mess so justdoes everyone pretty much get paid oncrypto railssort of I mean we also use some likeemployer record and and so on for someof the bigger countries but but a lot ofpeople do so someone that can you giveexamples without giving stuff away aboutemployees can you give a example countryand what you do yeah I mean for uh youthey canfor European employees we we used like acompany that that company employs thepeople and that invoices us and there'scompanies that offer the servicebasically okay yeah but we also usethings like I guess I'll plug bit wageit's a great service yeah so we use thatto pay people in other places and thenthey can plug in you know how they wantto get paid if they want to get paid inin Bitcoin or in a stable coin or likein a Pioneer card or something else yeahkind of like just agnostic and justhandle that in a good wayum so anyway so there's a lot of peoplethat are like making a living online andfor a lot of them it's hard because thethe payment systems in each country arekind of designed in a world wherecountries like an island is isolatedfrom the rest of the world and likethat's not the world we live in we livein a very globalistic world where mostof everything we produce and consumersinformation and information travelsfreely and then it doesn't make sensethat money still follows like oldshipping rules yeah with customs andyeah andso there's a lot of growth in in thatregard and Bitcoin is still growing butlike stable coins are right now growingfaster and so the shares is growing upanyways you want to talk about the zerocost yeah yeah we digressed prettypretty far well listen like some peoplelistening uh won't know we won'tactually know what comps are or whythey're importantyeah well I mean when you make a Bitcointransaction yeahyou've probably heard of somethingcalled the blockchain right so yeah theidea is that when you make a Bitcointransaction you you have your acryptographic key thatshows that you're the owner of this thisunit of of Bitcoins yeah and you makeyou assign a transaction saying thisfraction of it goes It goes this wayyou publish it on the network right soyou probably heard of people runningnodes right the node is a is a piece ofsoftware that connects to the internetit talks to other nodes say thistransaction we validate it make surethat there's nothing if you're going onand then pass it around to all the othernodes right but but the thing isn't doneyet right because then you have theminers I mean there's been a lot ofepisodes about miners yeah so yeah andso uh in the time between that thistransaction in some seconds it getspassed around across the internet andthen it says waiting for an average ofsomething like 10 minutes until someMiner picks it up puts it in a blockmindset and then it's on the blockchainforever and it can't be reversed and allthat but before then it's called anunconfirmed transaction so everybody cansee it it appears in your walletstraight away like it appears sometimeswe always will learn and they shouldindicate that they shouldn't reallytrust this because it's not yet in ablog something something could happen toityou knowum I mean the point of Bitcoin is thatwe have Mining and so on but thetransaction is visible and it's thereand soum for the longest timethe way that Bitcoin nodes uh we'reworking and still mostly are is that ifthey see a transaction that conflictswith another transaction that they haveyeah they're they're gonna throw it awaybecause they say like oh no no I alreadyhave a transaction for thatcryptographic key yeah I don't needanother one uh go away so thosetransactions don't spreadyeah right and this means thatthere is a certain level of ofreliability to it in thatyou could still have like a minor orsomeone encodes with a minor that wouldbe like aha there's this transactionit's waiting to be confirmed let'sreplace it with another one and that'scompletely valid according to theBitcoin protocol rules but in practiceis quite hard right and if you're buyinga 100 Uber it's a gift card and peopledon't sort of go through the hassle ofinvolving miners to do something that issort of you know I think many peoplewould consider it unethical even thoughit's like follows protocol rules andwhatever so whenever you replace it isthat within when it's still in themempoolhere or just a block comes out andthere's a transaction that conflictswith it right yeah and if a block comesout with a conflicting transaction thenit was in the block is what counts rightthat's a new member it gets evictedautomatically right yeah butthis Dynamic makes it possible to havemuch less secure of course than aconfirmed transaction but it's stillsomewhat secure like like you canabsolutely theoretically invalid but inpractice it doesn't happen like we'vedone millions of transactions we'vegotten double spent I think once and itwas kind of during because of a bug manyyears ago that we fixed them so onedouble spend yeah it's in how manytransactions Millions so I mean it's uhit's uh sort of yeah super low risk bybase yeah I mean compared to creditcards where you have like uh fivepercent three percent of transactionsare fraud uh it's minuscule right butit's still there's still a risk rightit's insecure right it's not as secureas taking a flight but it's more securethan taking a busit's somewhere in there in in that orderof of security but since uh you knowit's not on the chain it's seen as sortof not as and we need perfect Securityeven though like even a confirmedtransaction there's scenarios in whichit can and get reverted in differentways like blocks can be or what you callit Rewritten and so on yeah exactlyyeah so but but that's seen I was likeoh I'm safe and you kind ofshouldn't do it but like everybody thataccepts payments with on-chain Bitcoindoes the same thing that we do which islike you see a transaction you check foruh for certain properties like you knowyou do like a risk analysis yeah and andit's not that complex and you acceptsort of like okay this is our level ofrisk that we can live with and for thesake of because it's a big difference uhsay that you're you're trying to doinstant you're trying to be commentsright I mean you know someone's tryingto their phone data run out yeahyeah and they're sitting on their phoneuh doing something exciting and then itjust stopped working and they need to torefill it right yeah and then it's likeyeah it's gonna be 10 minutes but maybenot it might be a half hour it might bean hour it might be two days yeah itmight be a week yeah it depends onthings that are outside of your controlyeah and that's kind of like the defaultuser experience like people kind of livewith it when it's an exchange but likewhen or you're you know you have yourshopping cart ready you're ready toclick and move on with your life youkind of just want it done right and andso what we found for us and again likeall of the other companies that dopayment stuff with Bitcoin have foundthe same thing is thatthe the amount of risk is uh is lessthan the benefits in terms of userexperience and you can sort of manage itlike there's a lot of safeguards andwhatever so it's not just like I'm notsaying that you should tweet anunconfirmed transaction like uh uh likea confirmed transaction it's veryclearly not uh but but it's there it'snot you know someone said that it's likeoh it's like writing something on apostcard like it's not it it'ssurprisingly hard like there was anincidentumlike a year or so ago there was aprominent uhBitcoin Community influential person whohas scammed somehow and was like how canI uh this is my transaction I need todouble spend it and this is a very wellconnected guy and I actually clocked ityeah because the transaction was fardown in the main pool and after I thinkit was likefour or six hours or so he managed toget in touch with a miner that thenreplaced the transaction for it yeah butso the requirement why did he want to dothat because he had gotten scammed andsent some some Bitcoin somewhere andthen realized along the way aftersending it that no no this was actuallya scam yeah and so he wanted to torevert and he actually succeeded yeahbut but it's required sort of to be awell-connected person to get a solidintro to to a minor get that transactionin the explain the situation to TheMiner get them to buy it and understandand then they did it but in thatscenario that minor has to find thatblock rightyeah exactly yeah whatever differentminor finds that block yeah well thenyou're out of luck but uh so it's a bitof a gamble as well yeah of course ofcourse that's the thing as well is thatif you're colluding with a minor and theminer has five percent of the hash rateyou have five percent chance ofsucceeding in each block right so ifyour transaction is some blocks downthen you can play You'll Play That Gamemany times so the chances go up a littlebitumand so there's this policy and thenBitcoin core nodes that dictate thisbehavior that it won't send around thetransaction the conflict with previoustransactions and there was a featureintroduced like five years ago andcalled replaced by fee which lets youreplace by fee and there was a specificflag and that if you have it then thistransaction is replaceable and the notesare like ah it's a replaceabletransaction I can replace it with thisone instead right and so what happens isMerchants such as us would be like ohthis is a replaceable transaction allright that guy's Gotta WaitSo if it's one that can be replaced youyou ignore you just you you wait forwhat yeah one confirmation two yeah oneconfirmation one confirmation yeah but Imean these are like that feature is onlyavailable like very power user walletsand so on so it's like this is someonewho knows what they're doing it's theirchoice yeah you know we'll let them dothe thing but you gotta wait becauseotherwise it's trivially abusablebecause that person might buy somethingfrom youand then once you've honored the salethey might replace their transaction andyeah and gift cards are irreversibleyeah right so yeah yeah it's very likedesirable for from a fraud forfraudsters and whateverum you know product so it's a usefulservice to you guyswhich being able to identify yeah sothere's this flag right and and so andthat flag was sort of it's like ondefault in certain walletsbut uh in practice very few people knowhow to use it and so in the end they endup with a transaction that's replaceablebut they don't know how to do it andthey don't know how to find the featurein their wallet what does mean the RBFwhat's that it's the three letteracronym blah blah blah like in practicewe we saw like during the binance dumpfor example where there was suddenlylike 100 megabytes of data showed up andsome people got stuck below it right sothey have to wait for at least a day andI and there was a researcher uh oxnbcthat actually uh we collaborate onProject I asked him like check thistransactions how many years thatfunctionality to to get unstuck and hefound thataround one percent yeah of the stocktransactions successfully use the theRBF functionalityumthe other 99 did not right even thoughthey were stuck and it was like theperfect scenario for when that featurewould be useful andbut I digress yeah andand so recently there was a push formaking a feature in in Bitcoin corenodes to have nodes to read alltransactions as replaceable always nomatter whatand it's off by default but there was apolitical campaign from certain coredevelopers talking to minors that youshould do this yeah why why do they wantevery transaction to be like that wellthere's many reasons first of allthere's certain attack vectors uh calledlike pinning attacks and so on that cancanwhat's the word uh like annoy peoplebecause you could like uh hey let's opena lightning Channel with each other andthen I'll I'll do this the pinning thingand then you can't move your Bitcoinsuntil my paying attach a transactionconfirms in a block which could be a dayand so I just froze your Bitcoins for aday haha right stuff like that inpractice I don't think uh I don't thinkthere's been ever been an instance of ofsuch attacks maybe correct me if I'mwrong in thisum but but it is a theoreticalvulnerability right and some other smartcontracts and stuff as well and so itwas decided and that let's let everynote decide you know should the shouldyou treat all transactions asreplaceable or not but also politickingthe miners right because in the end whatmatters is what's setting the miners runyeah a regular non-mining node it's likeokay you can think you have whatevertransactions what matters is whattransactions the miners haveand and so that's kind of where we arenow where there there is I think onemining pool that uhruns this settingum and we we still uh so far like wehave safeguards basically if we weaccept a certain amount of risk and ifwe ever get double spent once then thefeatured automatically disables and thenwe investigate what happened this issomething we can fix or not and when itwhen it flips and we're like yeah okayyeah it finally happened then thatfunctionality is going to be gone yeahand then everybody will have to wait forconfirmation even the people that don'thave RBF functionality in the walletthey couldn't replace they couldn't fitby bump even if they wanted to rightokay yeah right and so in the end theuser experience forthe vast majority of people that arebuying stuff with Bitcoin like with theyou know scanner QR code with your uhwith your wallet will no longer bealmost instant right yeah right and andthere's a significant like chunk oftransactions uh every monthuh that uh that are for Commerce yeahand yeah I think the thing convenienceof it will will reduce the the number ofuh Commerce transactions on on bitcoinuh which in the end is going to lead toa sub-optimal outcome even for theindividual Miner who sort of earned 10sets uh replacing a transaction but likefrom then on uh they're going to earnless because they're fewer transactionson the chainso that's going to lead to more of yourbusiness being coming from otheralternative cryptocurrencies yeah butalso lightning maybe and I mean we havelike accounts you can you can depositBitcoin to your account uh in advanceand so then you can just recharge fromyour account and it's going to go fasterbut but that's that's not great fordecentralization right you need topre-deposit there's custodial custodyyou need to trust us with your money asopposed to now where your mind is inyour wallet and you we only get whateverwe actually paid us it's kind of nice inBitcoin and so on andI mean and then like if every Merchantneeds to run an account and it's it'sgoing to be messy what if I want to buysomething on a you know some servicethat has an open node or another servicethat has a bit pay or something elseshould I have money with all of theseaccounts or what do you do just uselighting well you should just like me II love lightning again we've been bigbetter on Lightning but so far againlike 20 of Bitcoin users use lightningyeah but the other 80 do not right andyeah if you dig into it there's reasonsto it and and dynamic maybe we candiscuss that as well but I I don'tbelieve that the way to get more peopleto use lightning is by uh by making thebasic user experience worseright I think lightning is is goodenough to be competitive on its ownMerit yeah right and like some peopledon't use lightning not by choice butjust because like the exchange they useor whatever doesn't have thatfunctionality or the walletso with you running the essentially thelargest e-commerce business withinBitcoinum and you following your users ormonitoring the daytime users that mustbe a really interesting lens into howBitcoin is going how crypto versusBitcoin is going it must color yourviews on the industry andthe expectations or the goals that somebitcoiners have yesvery muchyeahbecause you're like you're a Bitcoin orhot definitely but your business willacceptyou know Theory I mean I think yesum I think and it's been a big debateright I mean in the olden days when uhyou know we first added Litecoin andthis and that and it would become still95 and so on yeah but at this point thequestion is I thinkI mean what what like are we a Bitcoincompany and like what is a Bitcoincompany at the end of the day nobodyreally knows and can Define it in a goodway and I think that we're like if yougo go up uh a level like what's Bitcoinabout in the the way that we use it it'sabout financial Parliament it's aboutletting people uh you know dotransactions on the internet yeah thatthey couldn't otherwise do yeah rightand so we're a financial empowermentcompany and I think uh that if a useruses a stablecoin in order to againachieve some kind of Commerce that theycouldn't otherwise do or whateverthen that provides empowerment to themand that's good and we support that yeahbut obviously that goes against the theBitcoin only vision and all of thesethingsumso that's where we've uh where we'velanded like we still it's not like weaccept every weirdcoin out there and these days we mainlylook at the stable coins and things likethat but we like look at the networks onwhich it's uh it's happening and we hada Tron a year or two ago and then stablecoins on ethereum and a polygon and soon do you get much [ __ ] further thanthesewe do yeah butI mean usually it's not [ __ ] from ourcustomers that's much rarer of courseyeah because I mean most people uh I wastalking to someone about this likeimagine you're installinglike for most people who use BitcoinBitcoin is a tool it's an app that theyuse to do whatever they want to do theythey don't uh you know think ofthemselves as a bitcoiner yeah right andlike we have hundreds of apps on ourphone like I don't identify witheveryone it's just an app on my phoneand I I use it because I got paid forfor a job I did and then I bought somestuff with it and that's it right andthink of it like you know if you want toinstall BitTorrent yeah if you want todownload something uh legal like a Linuxdistribution I'm not a I'm not a bittorrent maximalist I'm a yeah where's myfilm exactly yeah so you type inBitTorrent client in Google and youclick someone that looks legit you'renot gonna go into like I want one thatdoesn't have this that and that featureI want one I won the torrent one wherethe oh the Creatoronly eats steak and doesn't have seedoils otherwise I'm not using that[ __ ] turretsomething like that yeah and so yeahlike the absence of a feature is is nota big benefit for for most of our usersand even even of of the Bitcoin userslike we ranuh run a study on like which walletsthey're using and like the vast majorityof the wallets that are being used uhare wallets that have manycryptocurrencies yeah right and I meanthis is an exercise that anybody can dois just like open your phone click onthe app store or the Google Play Storeand you type in Bitcoin wallet and yousee what the yeah what apples orGoogle'salgorithms say are the most popular onesamong people that do that query whichwants to install I'm going to search forBitcoin on mineso the first thing that comes up isthere's an ad for plus 500 tradinginteresting enough that's the firstplace I ever traded Bitcoin there you gothere's a cfd that's how they got youyeah well no silver got me first butyeah uh buying Bitcoin on um localBitcoins which rip recentlyyou know it's shut down I thought thatwas very sad it was a pain in the assfor us here I could just buy and selllike thatso the first one is binance buy BitcoinsecurelyI mean it's more fair if you type inBitcoin wallet because now you're goingto get people to sell you Bitcoin yeahbut it's going to be a similar result sofirst one is an ad for white bit buy andsell Bitcoin never even heard of thosethen it's Bitcoin wallet by BTC and bchit's Roger via's wallet.com bitcoin.comthat isn't an adthen it's coinbase trust blockchain.comuh AML saveFinance Bitcoin wallet for coin ID andthere's so many crypto.comI mean it's dominated by ones thattraditional Bitcoins would hate yeahyeah um and and I mean we see that in inour uh our users as well uh you know thelike the the wallets that the BitcoinCommunity likes like you know electrumshows up uh blue wall at the moon showup uh you know somewhere in the top 20maybe one of them in top 10 but likemost of Bitcoin users are also cryptousers yeah andI think if you view it in through thelens of like again say you're aArgentinian web designer doing gigs yeahand somebody wants to pay you in inBitcoin yeah for work and you say yesand somebody else wants to pay you intether and trong you say yes and thensomebody else wants to pay in ethereum Isay yes yeah okay what wallet lets me dothisright yeah yeah and and so in the endyeah of the people that are transactingwith Bitcoinumyou see such wallets and especially withyeah I mean with stable coins I thinkkind ofI don't know I I think make stable coinskind of were the end of Bitcoinmaximalism because there's no way to fitit like hey maybe this can be a song byuh that like uh become maximalist likestable coins a little bit like juice forJesusfigure stuff out no I've had theconversation plenty of times I mean I Ithink it was uh Sven home I even had aconversation on Twitter aboutabout it with him what I was sayingit's very hard to deny people their owntruth in that uh Bitcoin is not theright answer for a lot of people ifyou're in ayou know it could be turkey LebanonArgentina anywhere you want some form ofdigital money which is has some amountof decentralizationuh that you can be able to get paid orpay in and some people really likestable coins like how do you square thatCircle where you hate [ __ ] coins butthis platform is providing a servicethat people want and now I think he'sstill like sorry come out if I've gotthis wrong but I think he still said nothey should just understand Bitcoin it'slike no you should understand their lifeand it's so there is a Rea and that'swhy I really struggle with that like butI mean it comes down to the Clash ofVisions yeah and and there is a clearClash of Visions where there's twomissions of Bitcoin there's the soundmoney vision and then there's the theinternet money Vision or the freedommoney and and they overlap to a largeextent yeah but the thing is with uhwith values uh is that like discussionsabout values are only interesting inrelation to other values that's why it'scalled values right they want freedom orProsperity yes both yeah but you have topick one in this situation and you haveto pick right yeah and so in in terms oflike do you want the sound money Visionyes do you want the internet motivationyes okay but the there's situationswhere they conflict yeah yeah and and soand you often say that inlike in the in the transactional usageof Bitcoin space like people talk tocustomers and so on they kind ofunderstand yeah you knowthat these things actually solve somekind of need for some kind of customerandumI mean like maybe we should talk moreabout like how this uh this uh thisVisions I think uh contradict rightbecause yeah I mean the sound moneyVision maybe I'm not doing it forjustice but like the idea is thatbecause it has a limited Supply andpredictable insurance and these thingsand it's going to be the best money andat first it's going to be a store ofvalue yeah and then one day some kind ofMiracle is going to happen we can callthat hyper bit conversation and thensuddenly everything will fix itself andeverybody is going to use Bitcoin allthe time rightyeah and it is slightly Messianic inthat sense uh yeah and then you havelike the internet money Vision which islike yeah okay somebody wants to make atransaction by making a cryptographicsignature and you know what you can maketransactions with a cryptographicsignature on things that are not Bitcoinand it achievesalso achieves Financial Empowerment ithas different sets of trade-offsumand you're free to choose that like Iwould still say that I think Bitcoin isbetter according to my preference andbut I can understand yeah why peoplewould choose some of these other thingsum and they're not my enemy uh I'm likemy enemy yeah like I want like morepeople to be Financial empowered to dowhatever they want right uh so if uh ifthey're like oh yeah I'll do it with astable con okay it's a bit I'll stilltry to to get them onto Bitcoin as welland Miss table coins who knows maybethey won't be even be around because ofregulatory reasons or whateverum butfundamentally there's a conflict thereright yeah because uh there is themaximalistic view and also like the morerecent the Bitcoin only view right uhwhich is that you must not have anythingthat is considered a [ __ ] coinum and uh and that's that and basicallyyou don't even need to have Bitcoinright I mean there was this a coupleyears ago and the the Bitcoin Pizza yeahI remember that you couldn't buy it withBitcoin but it was very compliant uhwith the ethos yeah because you couldn'tadvise with [ __ ] coinsum so versus the strong motivation likewhich in the end is is actually similarto how uh how other cryptocurrenciespromote themselves in that it's likeyeah it's like yeah one day everybody'sgoing to use it and look here's acelebrity that thinks it's good yeah andwe're gonna have a conference and invitethis random uh politician that's beendisgraced in their country or yeahsomething else yeahto show that they like the thing and butbut it's not so much anymore about usingthe thing right yeah so if we zoom outin like the origins of the BitcoinCommunity yeah like in the olden days uhBitcoin was a thing that some nerds usedyeah and they realized that uh someother nerds were using this thing andthey would hang out right yeah and talkabout using this thing and in that groupthey're formed a certain camaraderie anda set of shared values yeah right andand this grew and grew and also thingsthat this group did not like right therewas uh so-called pre-mines which wereum all scams and so there was this uhthis culture that all pre-mind Sourcecamps and it was like a strong norm andsort of like a community value and andthen like as time went on people wouldhang out in that community and talkingabout this thing and but in the end itwas less than less about the thing muchlike uh like you know bridge club forall lilies yeah over the years becomesless and less about the bridge and moreand more about the hanging out and theshared values and so on yeah soyeah and and so I think in the end likewe've landed at like a I mean you werejoking about seed oils and whatever butlike there's a lot of things that areimportant in in the Bitcoin communityand I I don't know where like signingsigning transactions for cryptographiccase ranks yeah but uh I I think it'slike it I would maybe think that itranks lower than you know not using [ __ ]coins for example yeah yeah andsomething like that and so then there'sa clash here right because there's theother group they're like yeah forfinancial empowerment and so on theymight use Monero for privacy or yeahthey might use lightning right uh andthey might uh use table coins whateverand so there is this even though thesetwo visions overlap to a very largeextent yeah there is attention betweenthem and that often it leads to this uhthis conflictsumin the end I think uh like I mean I Ishare the original ethos in terms oflike that yeah most cryptocurrencies orscams and we should not promote them andlike I agree with that I never promoteany cryptocurrency in any wayumwe still like don't accept yeah the vastmajority of cryptocurrencies nopeumand never will be right I mean we lookat where there's activity with peopleusing it there's some kind of to acceptDodgewe do and thosebecause it's got a big Community yeahnot anymore and it's Alchemy we addedDoge and I think 2018 as an April'sFool's joke uh where we went too far andwe actually did the joke yeah so wewe're like Victorville is kind of theDodge Coin yeah and we rebranded the[ __ ] refill and we had a Deutsche camerawe actually refill did you really dothat yeah yeah and I love it yeah yeah Iactually preferuh and uh and so we had a Dogecoin andsome people were using this we kind ofkept it wrong because like it doesn'tcost us a lot of upkeep and I actuallyat the time I thought those screen wasgreat because it's like it's funny youcan't like it uses humor as a defensemechanism right and it's somewhatdecentralized in the sense that there'sno like there's no leader there's nogood Deutsche Coin Company there's noone profiting from it it's because heRage Quityeah but that comes yeah I mean that'smaybe not entirely similar to Satoshibut yeah but I think over the last uhcycle uh when I got pumped I need a maskand all that a lot of people got hurtyeah of course yeah and and so I I don'tthink that joke is fun anymoreuh and uh I mean we've kind of said thatlike next time there's an upgrade neededthen there's one penny more there'sgoing on the tripleumso that's why I kind of side a littlebit because it's like it's complex yeahyeah we were in on the joke when it wasfunny and we kept it around a little bitlonger until it's not only funny and nowit's like yeah yeah but but like there'sstill some people not that many butthere are people every day and that arebuying stuff at Dogecoin and so it'salso like yeah maybe they're gonna beupset and so on like right it doesn'tcost us anything to and to keep it upwe'll build the stuffI'm trying to think out a word there sorunning a company that actually dealswithBitcoin users yeah and crypto users it'samazing yeah but we're hiringyeah how many do you need how many doyou have I mean you're growing fast yeahit's uh harder in the bear Market but wehaven't had a big downturn and uh we'restill going strong I mean we're stillsmall and given the world and the visionI can only offer you brand awarenessyeahum no what I'm saying sohow do you see the world differentlythan fromthe general kind of like there aredifferent sub communities in Bitcoin Iknow that but there is also that kind oflike this uhthere's some consistencyconsistent trains of thought orconsistent narratives with Bitcoinbut I I think a lot of these come frompeople who aren't running a businesslike you so how do you think you maybesee the world or the Bitcoin Worlddifferently from themwell I mean I see the users of Bitcoinwhich is a group that that overlaps butbut not not at all uh completely withthe people who participate in themovement yeah right and and Bitcoin isboth a thing a tool yeah and also like amovement Community right so for examplelike somebody who listens to a podcastabout Bitcoin is probably a like amember of the movement or identifies assuch they wish Bitcoin to succeed andthey maybe go go to a conference the theconsume content about it they learnabout it they maybe invested in it theytruly deeply wish for it to succeedrightbut some of these people might not havea need to make Bitcoin transactions on aregular basis right like I'm in thatgroup as well like a you know it canhappen that I a week weeks go by Ihaven't made any Bitcoin transaction andbecause you know I live in a country Ihave my own everything kind of justworks in in the old-fashioned way and soon right so I have a lot ofunderstanding for thatum but then there's also the people whouse the tool who are not part of themovement like we're talking aboutearlier right for them Bitcoin is an appyou type in Bitcoin and you searchthingy and you install the thing and youdo whatever you want to do and andthat's that right and they don't careabout uh Bitcoin and they wouldn't youknow like you might use a VPN but youwouldn't go to a VPN conference theywouldn't even think about it it probablyexists right you use a car every day andthere are car conferences but why wouldyou go there yeah right and so on likethere's a lot of debates in the carindustry about like a real car is arestaurant car no no a real car is awhateverand like when you're a transactionalusage uh of uh of uh of Internet moneycompanyyou talk to the people that use thething and again some of them are part ofthe movement but the vast majority arenot right yeah as was evidenced by likethis wallet experiment that we saw isthat you know you wouldn't get one ofthose wallets uh by after going to aBitcoin conference yeah or by listeningto podcasts or hanging out on Twitter orwhateverumand I think thatwithin this community there are certaindogmas andsometimesI mean you you asked me the question oflike how do I see the world differentlybecause I'm interacting with users ofBitcoin all the time right and but theother side of that is that many of thethought leaders in in our industry donot interact with users for Bitcoin allthe time and as such uh the the body ofknowledge within the community withinthe movement uh can be wrong yeah likeor not strong it doesn't accuratelyrepresent the user base of the thingthat the the movement is about ortrying to be as Fair as possible doesn'trepresent that part of Bitcoin thatyou're seeing because some other peoplemight say yeah circular economy doesn'tmatter what we need is Bitcoin to be bigenough that you know it holds so muchvalue that we can bring down to yourcurrency but it's a different ideologyabsolutely but in you know what in thatgroup as well if you like go say ohhodling is using okay sure yeah and youlook at that group you still have likethe vast majority of people that HollowBitcoin do not uh you know participatein in the community do not go toconferences and so on yeah for them it'slike ah you know risk off asset in mywallet click click in my stock exchangething and I just bought it and whateverrightumsoit's a it's always I thinklike that but I think that we've gottena little bit too far apart in these twothings yeah right in in that like wherewhere the community is and versus wherewhere the users are it's a little bittoo distant yeah right I mean it's superstrange that like a highly technicalconference you ask people like what arethe top three Bitcoin wallets by usersand like people don't don't know thenames of them and I think that that'sweird right if you're there's peoplelike building a wallet and like you'rebuilding a wallet you don't know thename of the largest wallets in the worldI mean you should at least look at themto see what they're doing right maybemaybe they're marketing at least orshould I tell you where I'm going withthis okayis thatis the missionis it losing a sense of purpose like thething about Bitcoin like I romanticizeabout what I wasn't part of but I cansee it there was like it was likeeveryone was on this Mission togetheryeah and now the mission has becomefragmented because there's so manydifferent users coming in for adifferent reasons there's speculatorsthere's Builders there's ogs there's butthat's also natural like over time everyCommunity you know I've been to internetconferences like that kind of silly yeahno I agree look it was always going tohappen but buttherefore there can't be a unifiedMission because there's multiplemissions sure you have a missioncircular economy right uh some Udi has amission for nftsum he's probably gonna telegram you knowthat's not my mission but like this I'vegot a mission to[Music]a bunch of football fans right and sowhat's your primary Mission then myprimary Mission because when there werethe moments where your Bitcoin Missionand your Bedford Mission uh are incontradiction so which one's yourprimary no actually my primary missionis to raise up my town right opportunityand success for my town right and rightnow what does that mean it's very smallwe've got 12 guys coming for EasternEurope I'm going out for dinner tonightwithin Bev it to meet you know what itis went out to uh Bitcoin BeachI was I was the first I think I was thefirst person to go out to meet mycoincidence project and I've watchedthat grow and now I get hundreds of 100yeah probably over 100 emails frompeople maybe 200 emails saying I'm gonnago to El Salvador I'm going to go tobitcoin is it safe yeah you should is itsafe where do I stay yada yada go andstay at Garten Hotel I always tell themand I was like wow isn't this cool andthen when I started the football team Iwas like I wonder if anyone will comeand they're coming I've had I've got 12guys who are coming in to Homer greennow maybe they've tied in the conferenceat the same time right but they'recoming in I have four guys flying beforefrom czechoslovakia'sum at Czech Republic sorryum I've had people who've come onholiday from Canada or the US andthey're in London they're like we'regonna go up to Bedford people are cominginto my town and spending money in mytown so here's the question hold on butalso I will go to the Bitcoin conferencein Miami and there'll be people walkingaround in t-shirts that just saybeverage on it this [ __ ] little town I'mfrom and then freaking amazing yeah yeahhere's the question yeah yourselftickets with Bitcoin and they pay theplayers for Bitcoin so okay we don't soyou can pay on bitcoin at the club so ifyou come to the club you want to buyyour tickets with Bitcoin your beer withBitcoin your Burgers you merchabsolutelyyou can buy a Merch online with Bitcoinyou cannot buy your tickets with Bitcoinbecause the ticket company we use don'taccept Bitcoin I absolutely want it sureis my number three full yeah no ticketTaylor you check out ticket Taylor theone we're using let's look into it Ilooked at Eventbrite they don't now thereason I went with ticket Taylor isthey're smaller and a bit unique so Ithought in my head I'm gonna work withthem for a year use their thing and thenI'm gonna go to them say hey I think youshould have Bitcoin and I'll connect youwith someone to do it and that would bereally coolhaving Bitcoin alongside Fiat currenciesis basically a big [ __ ] pain becausethere is no integration between the uhsay open node that we're using in thePOS which is zettel and so all theBitcoin payments we literally have aspreadsheet we write them down and thenI have to go into zettol and then knockthose it's just a pain some like someonehasn't solved that but yes we and wealsoumthe players could get paid in Bitcoin ifthey wanted nobody does because theydon't care too much about Bitcointhey're players we have one playerlarger who did Conor ocus who you allknowum but so that's that's not a thing butmy Approach with the football club isn'tto throw Bitcoin down people's necksit's like here's a football team comeand watch them oh by the way before thegame we've got a meet up do you want tocome oh yeah we'll come sure but if youcome to the game you don't feel likeyou've got one of the Annoying Bitcoinsgoing [ __ ] you know buy Bitcoin fitmoney's rubbish yeah like weit's there but it's not in their faceyeahum because you're a socialist having gayshut up man yeah yeah I'm a realist Yeahwell yeah and I mean you just explainedsome of the difficulties in terms ofgrowing this thing I [ __ ] hate thegovernment right now as much as anyoneright I am completely and my governmenthere in the UK is [ __ ] [ __ ] they arelike we've got unelected prime ministerwho is a cycle who I think is prettymuch psycho who's pushing forward cbdc'she talks to everyone like theirfive-year-olds he replaced like we'vejust got an appalling government andwe've got no uh viable crediblealternative they're both [ __ ] rightyou know what the other thing I shouldhave said to people it's not that I'mpro-democracy I think government is areality you get rid of government youget new government but you get rid ofthe democratic governments you might getsomething worse and so I'm a realistit's like how do we make this better howdo we in in a Democratic Society how dowe uh give more control to theelectorate and less control to theelected but but I'm not an yeah I'm nota burn it all down because if you burnit down it just it can come back worseyeah look at look at Turkey Turkey youknow it was a thriving democracy untilearly one took over it now it's he's a[ __ ] dictator who's killing theireconomy and that's I've seen that inmultiple countries so stronginstitutions and a strong electorate tome are important because government's arealityto explain that well yeah I mean I Idon't know is that controversialit makes you a status Kirk yeah yeahfair enough I guess uh but you own it uhand I mean I I I agree with this stuffso maybe I'm a status crack as well yeahI mean fundamentally the primaryfunction of a nation state is to protectyou from other people that have a nationstate and if you don't have a nationstage they will invade you and enslaveyou and rape your women and murder yourchildren and so on and we can watch thathappening in in Ukraine right now and wekind of learn the lesson that you maybelike we haven't figured it out yet asolution to that is better than nationstates for the specific case of againprotecting you from other nation stateswell if you if you got rid of all thenation states yeah well we don't knowsort of like what that world would wouldlook like I don't yeah so I agree withyou protect you from other nation statesbut I'm not talking this uh growth andprotect you from yourselfyeah I agree yeah it's likeyou know let us let us live free freelyas much as we can with our own countrywell the interest I think it's I find itso fascinating this this contrary and Ido think it's contrained the contrarianuh uh view that I've seen permeatethrough Bitcoin of a certain group ofpeople who are defensive about Putin anddefensive about Russia sure or if theiraccusation gets Putin and Russia thenwith that they're like wellyeah what about the UK or the US areexactly the same and I cannot for themlie for me which is likea classic Russian uh propaganda argumentI know it's called what about it yeahthere's an excellent Wikipedia page ifyou search for but in America they'relynching Negroes and which was like inthe 70s where uh the Soviet Union was acritiqued for or I forget we shouldtrust this yeah and they went to the endbut yeah but look in this uh they werethey were lynching Negroes like okay howdoes that make your thing better likeyeah you know like yeah but it's uh likewe just point to someone else doingsomething bad and then and we're noworse than that no well I had a weekbecause I um uh this I got this tweetsent to me by this layer High burn whenshe was uh tweeting about Putin sayingabout him being um making how is it hemakes so much sense in this weird worldand so I read read tweet and said wellno actually he's a psychopathic dictatormurders journalists um uhum assassinates opposition leaders uhhas invaded multiple countries and leadsan army of rapist and murderers I thinkthat's a fair kind of depiction of himand I saidsee below for what about ISM and likeliterally people kept delivering whatabout him and yeah look the the Alliedinvasion let's call it that because itwas the UK and U.S invasion of Iraq wasa crime absolutely George Bush and TonyBlair should have been up in The Haguebut to try and say that our countriesare the same it's absolutely [ __ ]ridiculousyou're literally repeating Russianpropaganda I know but I mean I I likesorry can I just can I just finish mypoint I was trying to get to is thatwhen I put it out these people aresaying ha you're just falling for BBC orWestern propaganda and I was like noyou're [ __ ] falling for Russianpropaganda but I mean it I mean a bigpart like I mean I've beengetting into the soul uh situation inthe past year with the Ukraine war andso on and I speak Russian and theconsumer contentabout those thingsI mean a Cornerstone of of thestrategies of of Russia also China notjust Russia and to undermine uh Westerndemocracies and is to show Discord uh inin society and and so whatever groupthey find uh they don't particularlycare about Bitcoin or [ __ ] coins oranything like that but they find a groupyeah that is against uh the status quoyou know it can be Bitcoin can bequranon it could be anti-vax it can be alot of these things and they will getinvolved and promote some stuff havesome Bots this and that like just makesure to amplify the message and to boostit and I'm completely sure that thisstuff is happening in the in the Bitcoinspace again I don't think or I don'tknow that they would pay particularinterest to bitcoin Community definitelyit's there yeah and it's just againthere is a very clear Red Thread rightthe Red Thread is I'm against thecurrent thing yeah and so any communitythat is against the current thingwhatever the current thing is is goingto get support from those sites I meanthey've been sponsoring the far rightand the far left yeah since always rightand you still now you go to like aso-called anti-war rally yeah andthere's gonna be you know Russian flagsand like anarchists left and like a farright anti-immigration all these guysthat are together in this weird Kumbayaand because they have a like and it'slike how why do they hang out togetherwell they share one thing they'reagainst the common the current thingyeah but the shame about that againstthe current which by the way wasbrilliant because as soon as I'm fullthe current thing came out so I mean hereally went well yeah but I'm againstthe current thing and so the the amazingthing about that is that a whole groupof peopleidentified that Ukraine is I part ofthem for the current thing and so then awhole group of people felt like well Icannot support Ukraine in this situationwhen they've been wrongfully andillegally invaded by another country andand but I mean it doesn't matter if thecurrent thing is the sky is blue yeahthere's going to be a set of people likedon't tell me which color this guy isyeah why can't we be nuanced about thecurrent thing let's be nuanced aboutthis let's discuss the facts where theyare but the real [ __ ] you're not anindependent thinker if you're alwayspolar opposite yeah to the mainstreamopinionwell I sometimes prefer some of themainstream opinion than I do from thiscontrarian opinion oh boy but thensometimes I'm on the control if you cansee some of your hits now yeah nosometimes I'm with the contrarians likeI'm contrarian with money I think itshould be out of the hands of the stateare you contrarian with Bitcoinyeah but like I stick to my guns on thatit's like you know one there's a fewthings I stuck to my guns on one I stuckto my guns on is that most people aren'tgoing to run a node or give a [ __ ]doesn't matter what you say they aren'tmost don't give a [ __ ] about what anx-bab is what a utxo is they don't carethey want to buy it see a number andmove it and that's it and however muchyou want them to care they're not goingto care they just don't and yes a smallpercentage will care but those smallpercentage tend to be the techie theearly ones and they think everyoneshould be like them and they won't bewhich brings us to another revisionconflict that we have yeah which wethink is important to kind of articulateand to think about it is like is thevisionso I mean everybody wants more people touse Bitcoin and whatever definition ofviews that you want to chooseum but do we wanteverybody in the world to be orangepilled and to share in all of the sharedvalues of of the Bitcoin community anddo we think that's a realistic goal uhright or do we want as many people aspossible to use Bitcoin as a thing eventhough they might not share in thevalues and just you know don't give a[ __ ] I think the one doesn't matter Ithink it's the reality it goes back tomy channel but also the first one Ithink is like it's unrealistic likethere's no ideology that's covered thewhole world ever yeah so yeah no one atleast yeah we have like Christianitylike a billion or two yeah and so onIslam it's a similar but like that butthat's still not just a fraction of theworld but but the the technical theadoption of Bitcoinis going to is going to happen fasterthan you can scale Bitcoin ideology or aBitcoin ideology that you think everyoneshould adhere to it's and that's whyagain going back to that earlier PointJason's books are important becauseBitcoin is now getting into Progressivegroups okay and it's getting intodifferent geographies in differentcountries and different cultures andtherefore we need to get out of thiskind of like this uh monoculture ofBitcoin which is kind of drift betweentends to go more to uh libertarian ideasand conservative ideas which havenothing against it's just that shouldn'tdominate well it's not going to dominatethe conversations in the future it'sgoing to be it's going to be just partof it's going to be a layer through allthe culture and so I think anyconservative bitcoiner who hates aprogressive should actually put theirhand out to them and lend them hands andteach them about Bitcoin and why it'sgood for progressives because we don'tneed to fight this issue yeahbut I mean I think fundamentally as wesaid like as communities grow yeah theyfragment and the fragment and thefragment and the Bitcoin commutersfragmented so many times I mean todaywhat we call the shitcon community wasyou know part of the Bitcoin Communityis fragmented and then it's fragmentedagain and in different ways and so onand so yeah in the end I I don't evenknow if it's the most worthwhile to tryto change the community becausethere's many flavors of it I mean todayalready there's very there's a lot ofBitcoin conferences they have this theyhave different flavors yeah and and youyou can I mean you can't go to all ofthem at this point so you have to choosea little bit and so on and you go to theones that more align with your visionand all of that which is great yeah butfundamentally I think thatcommunity at all does not scale enoughyeah I think the tool scales and thecommunity does not uh right becauseagain we're not going to come up with aset of shared ideals that we canconvince everybody in the world topartake in and I mean we can't evenexplain it in all languages yeah rightuh whereas if it's a thing and it'suseful and then actually a lot of peopleare going to be using it is going toempower them I can give you an analogyto thisI think that VPN is a good model for uhhow we can grow the transactional use ofInternet money right so VPN is is a 44billion dollar per year industry reallyyes it's totally huge and and so if yourun the numbers so say that half of thatis like corporate whatever yeah but theyeither have 20 billion is people who payfive bucks a month uh for for a VPNservice okay five bucks a month 60 bucksper year and then you divide 44 billionby 60 bucks and it lands at like to 300million people in the world use VPN soas to get free premier league footballright so so all of these people arebuying you know privacy and internetfreedom and empowerment uh but theydon't know that they're buying thatthey're they're buying primary watchPremier League football or watchAmerican Netflix they're they're payingfor I can do stuff on the internet theycouldn't otherwise too yes right andwhen it comes to the money stuff there'sa massive demand for that we talkedabout getting paid in differentcountries I mean even e-commerce in alot of countries is really hard likethere's a you know if you're in the USor UK like you don't know that if you'rewell banked and so on but like incertain countries like your your crediteven if you have a credit card which noteverybody does like your credit cardmight not be accepted yeah almoste-commerce stores because your countryis in us at high risk of Fraud and theydecided that ah it's just a couplepercent like that yeah yeah and they cutyou off and you can't buy in thesneakers that you want to buy and thereis a there are solutions like you youcan I acquire Bitcoin somehow you figureit out locally and for example thingslike this refill or you just find themerchant that accepts Bitcoin and thenit suddenly it lets you do things thatyou couldn't otherwise do yeah right andso if you think about how VPN got to thestage so VPN is a 25 year old technologyI'm sure there are conferences but againmost of these hundreds of millions ofpeople have never visited a VPNconference VPN firstthey've never listened to probably apodcast about VPN yeah they probablyheard ads about VPN and other podcastsabout other thingswhat vpns did yeah that's what we needexactly it sounds boring as [ __ ] a VPNconference or a VPN podcast sure but youknow what most of the world saysthe same way no I'm with you and so yeahhow did VPN get to that point yeah wellyou build something useful you dodifferent marketing tactics you you youpresent marketing messages to groups ofpeople that you think might be receptiveto the value proposition yeah right Imean it is like it's very basic stuff ifyou just zoom out from this like uh likethis all-encompassing Bitcoin Communitywhere you like hang on Twitter all dayyeah and so on you know who the leadersare and blah blah but like if you justzone out and like think of like normalcompanies normal businesses Industrieslike that is how things grow right youbuild something useful yeah and you tryto present it to somebody who might findit useful maybe they would maybe theywant to try different things and so onand it's grown steadily like there's nobig uptake there was no like one daywhere everybody signed up to VPN andit's just been you know steady statussteady steady steady and then people indifferent countries discover that ohwait actually okay I want to watchPremier League oh I want to watchcricket I want to watch American Netflixor yeah I want to buy a plane ticketfrom a different country and all ofthese reasons that are again veryconvoluted ways of saying I need privacyon the internetyeah and and then it grew right and I Ithink that we need to be looking atthese things because it's a similartechnology right it is like Freedomprivacy empowerment we should take corevalues of Bitcoin as well and to see howcan this thing how can we replicatethese things like imagine if a VPN toldyou like which food you should eatlike or not it or yeah which politicalopinions you should have uh or orwhatever right uh what's your stance onwearing a mask yeah or Putin or yeahlike they're neutral exactly softwarethey're a thing it's just an app yeahyou know it doesn't have to have apolitical opinion and that's same asBitcoin Bitcoin it's just an app therewe go yeah and uh and and that's I meanthat's what we're trying to grow atbitrifield and uh we're trying tointeract with all the other uh servicescompanies and people who want uh Bitcointo be this Global thing because I Ithink that I mean it can't be this isalso going to sound very simple it can'tbe the money of the world if it's notthe money of the world and it's it can'tbe it's not the money of the role if youcan't use it to buy stuff like it's verysimple you know it's like oh no no firstit must be some money and then it's likeno okay who came up with that and likewhat's the underpinning of that yeahrightum likewhere does that come from like how doyou know like ah this is what happenedto go like I very much doubt that therewas in the early days of gold thecommunity of people say I should buythis and it's going to grow up in valueand then one day everybody's totallygonna use gold like you know that's nothow it worked you know it has twoproperties it's a it has a scary Supplyand it's useful in Commerce right andyou combine these two things it becomesa good money hey Alexa Satoshi sit thereon the white paper specifically talkedabout online Commerce look everythingthat happens in Bitcoin uh was said bySatoshi and and in the following a placewithin six monthsSatoshi also said he might might want toget some in case the cash is on rightwhich like that was the kickoff of thespeculative Mania that is not justBitcoin but also the entirety of thecryptocurrency industry but also Bitcoinright yeah it's like it started rightthere it was like first weeks yeah andso on so so all of these things uh werethere but fundamentally yeahif if you couldn't use Bitcoin to maketransactionsthen it would just be an nft yeah Ithink yeah right it's just like a memething that people assign value to forsome arbitrary reasons and that goes upin speculative reasons because theythink that that value is going to go upand it becomes this game that likeBitcoin haters say it as yeah and uh youknow that's not my vision like my visionis again for everybody to be able toclick and click to pay you know a worldwhere remittances is in the same part ofthe dictionary as long distance phonecalls yeah it's like just an outdatedconcept that we don't have anymore whereif you can talk to someone you can paythem uh right if you can visit thewebsite they just click a button you paylike all of these things like if ifmoney worked in the way and that theinternet works like what an amazingworld wouldn't we have right and and Imean this is this was yeah and still isyou know the original version of Bitcoinand even though that now there's manydifferent visions of Bitcoin there'sstill a very Vibrant Community who whosee this as as the vision of Bitcoin Ithink that now in the bear Market wherethere is going to go up forever a visionof Bitcoin uh is kind of uh on thedownload temporarily yeah more and morepeople are questioning things and likeyou know maybe we do want uh a worldwhere your Bitcoin wallet is openedevery day for a reason or anotherwe could do this for hours I know butthat was such a lovely way you ended itmoney for the world uh okay like tellpeople where to go where do you wantthem to go gun show bit refill out andbring that [ __ ] refill I don't know ifthat domain works anymore but go tobitrateful.com uh if you uh if you wantto buy something with Bitcoin uh it's agood place to do so if you don't that'scompletely fine we love you anyway welllisten congratulations you've built acompany that's survived for many yearsin Bitcoin and has been growing andeveryone loves and respects what you'vedone uh and I love you and I respectwhat you've done as well man so I wishyou a wonderful weekend and uh yeah weshould do this again sometime I hope sowith Danny yeah we'll have Danny nexttime no offenseall right brother take care all rightthanksforeign[Music]",
