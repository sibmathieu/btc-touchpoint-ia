  "text": "all right good morning Natalie how areyou I'm doing great uh this this mightbe one I think it might be one of themost important interviews I make not notonly in the Sprint but potentially thisyear it's going to go if we talk aboutwhat I think we're going to talk aboutand these bloody flies are getting awayum I think this is going to be a reallyimportant interview to do uh and thereason let me tell you the reason whyyeah aboutabout six months ago eight months agoDanny will remind me because he'llremember but uh on Facebook sometimes Iput out content to my friends and familyand it's a very different audience fromTwitter it has to be very measured anduh very careful to introduce some of thetopics we talk about as bitcoinersbecauseum it's a massive leap from their worldto Wild World if they've got noexperience to bitcoin apart from hearingabout it in the news right and uh Richiesunach who was our Chancellor at thetime announced britcoin the idea that wewould have a cbdc and so I put out aFacebook message explaining why cbcs aredangerous bad and we should reject themand uh one of my friends mums said I'vehad enough of your conspiracy theorynonsense and blocked me oh no yeah andso my main worry about cbdc's is that issomething that a government is able tosleep walk people into accepting withoutrealizing the consequences that's rightbecause of the leap fromfrom where we are to where they are yeahwe've all gone through this you knowRabbit Hole of learning about money andhow money works and how currencies onblockchains work and how cbcs could bemisusedso I'm just going to tee this up and saythis is a really important interviewbecause this is one I want to send outto my friends yeah who aren't yet tohead down the rubber Hall okay fantasticyeah so um before we start just I thinkit'll be useful just to give people abit of your background introduceyourself to the audience sureyeah soum my background is actuallyum rather unusual in a number ofrespectsum I never really thought that I wouldbe working in technology I was ananthropologist and historian in aprevious lifeI was focused on questions of socialtheory political Theoryum you knowanthropology of religionum how the state as such gets formed byhuman communitiesum and then I ended up making atransition uh into the business Worldwhich I initially did through marketingadvertising as a brand planner and thenuh started working as at a softwareagency or a software company that umbuilt the very first Bitcoin baseddigital identity walletum this was a dallas-based companycalled learning machine and we built webasically launched a movement to buildOpen Standards for digital identityusing Bitcoin as a secure anchor oftrust and now that movement has you knowadherence all over the world and manycompanies are building on thesestandards and so I felt very privilegedto be at the birth of this movementI I ended up being the the businessdevelopment leader for that companyspearheaded its exit to the company Icurrently worked work at in 2020 and Icontinue to do basically scholarly workat the intersection of technology andSocietysoum I've done a lot of policy stuff andyou may be you know familiar with uhsome of my work with the Texasblockchain council which I I was thefounding board chairman for in 2020earlier this year I founded the TexasBitcoin Foundation which is a 501c3 thatis dedicated to specifically researchand education on the social andpolitical ramifications of Bitcoin so wehave a lot of technologists working inthis space we have you know a lot ofbrilliant people and I think we havepeople with very strong convictionsabout the way the world should bethose have to be systematicallytheorized they have to be spelled out ina rigorous way that can be defended butnot just defended that can offend canactually frame the conversation aroundwho we should become as a people anotherspeciesokay wow lots to go into there uhfirstlyit feels like it would be a good time toalign the brands of the Texas blockchaincouncil and the Texas Bitcoin foundationso yeah be nice to have the TexasBitcoin Councilyou know I 100 agree with youum I know the complexities yeah yeahthere's one of the reasons that Iactually created the uh the Texas uhBitcoin Foundation is becauseum I think the the blockchain councilsaw itself as more of a big tentorganizationum which I also think has valueum but there needed to be anorganization that you know had thisBitcoin forward focus and I wanted it toactually be a 501c3 becausebitcoin's value is not I mean it goes sofar beyond its existence as a tokenum it is really a nodal point forreimagining the relationship between astate and society and so there has to bean organization that can take that 30000 foot viewum without you know getting into thenitty-gritty of like specific politicaltactics and legislation but that bringstogether people from uh Scholars fromvarious disciplines who may not evenhave a point of view yet about Bitcoinbut can understand based on theirexpertise how it will change the world Iam in part just teasing Lee because Iknow he'll be listeninghi Lee hope you're well mate okayum so I would be interested thereforewith your background in anthropology andstudying you know society and politicalstructureswhat was your orange pill moment becausefor a lot of peopleit's quite difficult when you first hearabout Bitcoin everyone will tell youstories like oh I heard about it in 2012and then ignored it and then somethinghappened in 2014-15 and then I tookanother look and then I understood itand then I really understood it and overtime the conviction increases we veryvery rarely get somebody who says youknow what I've been in Bitcoin for 10years I've I don't believe in it anymoreyeah that tends to be the journey I I'dbe really interested in your kind ofmoment where you your aha moment yeah soI actually came to bitcoin throughdigital identityum you know like I was mentioningearlier the company that I was withactually partnered with MIT to buildsomething called block certsum which was the very first version ofwhat is now called verifiablecredentialsum this enabled a movement that today isknown as self-sovereign identity so Imean coming as I did my academic Focuswas the study of sovereignty and so Iwas very intrigued by the concept ofself-sovereignty and what does that meanin a digital world well bitcoin's valueproposition involves being a censorshipresistant peer-to-peerdigital currency internet native digitalmoney what if we could do censorshipresistant peer-to-peer internet nativedigital identitycould that potentially be an antidote tothe surveillance capitalism that hascreated this Nexus of Corporation andstate that just encroach further andfurther Upon Our everyday lives withoutmost people knowing let alone givingconsentor even approving and being sold on thethat this is good for them this isexactlythe surveillance Tech protects us fromterrorists and criminals and right weneed thisum I feel like there's become anacceptance that we don't really haveprivacy anymore yeah no it's it'seffectively a moot concept yeahum okay and then yourself as uh again asan anthropologist and somebody who'sstudied people and coming into a quite aa diverse community and when I saydiverse I mean in terms of uh politicalopinions yeah some people Loosely havesome strongly held uh quiteum vicious debates at times yeahdisagreements fights how do you analyzehow do you kind of view the kind ofsubculture of bitcoinersyeahum I I think it's actually to beexpectedno new fundamental technology well Idon't want to say no because that's anabsolute statement but it is very rarethat a fundamental technologicalinnovation enters Human Society withoutbeing stewarded by a passionatesubculture of people who uh protect itbelieve in it and nurture it to thepoint where it's ready for Mass adoptionso you know if you think about theorigin of you know things like uhmathematics geometry in ancient Greece Imean the the pythagoreans were literallya cultum they were religious uh order that youhad to have you know the right signs toenter the meetings andum there was a network of trust therethere you know is a long history ofsecret societies in Europe as kind ofincubating uh political movementsincluding things like the uh Americanrevolutionary movementum and these were not likeyou know always the nicest mostapproachable like uhmost easy-going people these were peoplewith a point of view they understood theum the violence of the social structuresthat they were living a month amongstamidst and also trying to change andthey understood the stakesum and so it doesn't surprise me at allthat the Bitcoin Community is as it isand in somebody who's also studiedreligion yeah are there similaritiesbetween how religions organizethemselves and perhaps these subculturesdo absolutely yeah in factum the the term religion is a very fuzzyoneum it's very contested you know what itwhat exactly a religion is how itdiffers from say a cultum and in fact the the root word cult iswhere we get you know cultureum it's it's in some ways a broader wayof thinking about religion as a set ofshared practices that are cultivatedum by groups of people over timeum and so religion is never static it'salways in motion towards somethingthere's a solving for that is happeningcollectively in these communitiesand so when you talk about Bitcoin beinga fundamental technology yeahhow important do you see itum I see it as criticalum I I believe that Bitcoin hasautomated one of the central functionsof the state which is uh the senior ageand management of money of sound moneythis is traditionally you know has beena prerogative of the state and in themodern period the central banks this isnot to say that there is no longer arole for the state or even for centralbanks but rather that there is now aparticular function of theseinstitutions that has been automated andmade Global and Universal by Design anddefault and so there is no localum let's say jurisdiction that Bitcoinemanates from it is a jurisdictionalthat that means a number of things oneit's a kind of financial DMZ ordemilitarized zoneum which as we can see in a world ofweaponized and political sized money canactually be the precondition for uhtrade between enemies because it is setup to be enemy money it is presumed thatyour counterparty in the transaction issomeone you don't know and don't trustum it also is something that anyone canmake use of so it is not the explicitpurview of a favored classum or you know a a cantion effect ofsome kindum so I think I think initially actuallywhat many nation states don't like aboutBitcoin will be the very reason theycome around to it because they willrecognize that they they can benefitfrom its neutrality not just lose outfrom its neutralityum and and then finally you know the theimportance of property I mean this isthis is one of thosefundamental rights you know that thepolitical theorists of the Enlightenmentwrite about and they often started withproperty becauseum it is in some ways the clearestum way of talking about ownershipOneness in other words what belongs tomeum versus say to someone else or to thecommunityum and that questionum it's it's never you know defined witha hundred percent certainty there'salways a debate about where theboundaries of onus kind of endum like where uh personal property uhbegins to transition but nevertheless ifyou don't have some sense of personalproperty at allum then you set individuals up for uh ineffect totalitarian control whether thatis the cage of norms whichum political science uh scientists uhDaron achimoglu and James Robinson havewritten about where you know the thevillage you know Lay's claim to whateverit is you happen to possess or you knowwhatever Fortune you have nobody canrise too high because you're obedientlycut down that's a sort of moretraditional small-scale Society approachum to this or you know the uh the moderntotalitarian state where there is an infact no private property and so anythingyou have can be confiscated at any timeby the stateum and so these are extremes but if youdon't have a theory of private propertyof Oneness then it's really hard tojustify any other rights politicallyum and so this is why Bitcoin is soimportant for the individual because itactuallyum enshrines in a materialinfrastructure a structure of ownershipthrough ownership of private keys andthe ability to use those private keys ina self-sovereign way to transact withanybody you chooseso that idea that any of your propertycan be taken by a totalitarian stateum I understand that what you're gettingthere and the the kind of States we'retalking about but at the same time I'mfrom the UK Western liberal democracyright but there are I can imagine aninstant scenario right now where thestate can take my property from me whenI talk about my property my home and mymoney right so there are certainscenarios say for example if I didn'tpay tax they can go into my bank theycan go train as my bank account and takethat money directly from right the bankand I can't stop it right but I can alsosee scenario say if I perhaps I wasinvolved in some kind of lawsuit whichwas a lawsuit that was unfair but I lostit and I had to pay the cost I can havemy home taken from me in those scenariosright so how how do you differentiatethe two right I think oftenumthese political labels likeliberal democracy and totalitarian stateareuh are used in very imprecise waysum liberal democracy is used to describethe good states that we like andtotalitarian state is used to describethe bad states that we don't like whichare blurring now right sowhat is I mean totalitarianism there'sthere's a history of of theorizing itum one could say that what characterizestotalitarianism is a certain type of NotMere outward compliance with the law buta demand that people inwardly be inagreement with the law so it is notenough to obey one must enthusiasticallyobey and enthusiastically encourage orcoerce others to obeyum so it's a kind of colonization of theinner disposition of the human beingthat political theorists have describedas totalitarian right that said whetheror not the state is totalitarian in thatregard its ability to confiscateproperty private property withoutrepercussionsum defines defines its Ambit ofsovereignty and so the what'sinteresting aboutum self-sovereignty is it's it's notsaying this is the only category ofsovereignty that can exist but ratherlet's posit that the individual also hasa form of sovereignty that is aCounterpoint to the sovereignty of thestate so that the jurisdiction of thestate cannot be said to penetrate morethan a certain degree into the lives ofeach individual that is also privacy uhso you know lo and behold privacyself-sovereignty these areum these are constituent components of afree Society a state that can confiscateproperty uh with complete impunity couldthe moment it flips to beingtotalitarian and demands thatideological Conformity do so without anyin effect Civil Society pushbackright okay so when you when you thinkabout this work that you're doing herewith Bitcoin yeah and uh you consider uhpolitical structureswhat is the end goal it it can it besummed up quite simply uh when I thinkof decentralization when people compareBitcoin and ethereum and they refer toboth being as decentralized someone saidone's more decentralized than the otherI prefer to think of directionally is isa blockchain is a network becoming moreor less decentralized and I see asBitcoin is constantly striving for moredecentralizationand I see his ethereum becoming morecentralized and that is how Idifferentiate the two is your workconsidered in a way where yourwhere you're pushing for more freedomavoiding hitting down the totalitarianroute is it can it be simplified thatlike that that's right preserving a freeSociety okayum freedom is taken from us generallybehind our backs andum sometimes with our enthusiasticconsentum if weif our theory of a good Society is onethat relies on people we agree withbeing in powerthat um is a hierarchical socialstructure that means we have toconstantly work often through violenceto ensure that the right people are inpower at all times I.E whoever you knowwe happen to agree withum what if we actually remembered someof the lessons of Enlightenment erapolitical Theory which is that powercorrupts an absolute power corruptabsolutely and so how do you ensurepower is not abused it's not by makingsure that the right people are in powerit's by setting power against itselffragmenting it through a separation ofpowers and then creating a system ofchecks and balances where no faction ofpower can rise too high that isultimately what preserves a free Societywhat what we've seen happen instead isthe consolidation of power in an elitefaction of society that's a kind ofrevolving doorum private sector public sectorexecutive branch legislative branchjudicial branchum you know some Central bank's largebanking institutions large financialinstitutionspolicy and and so in effect this this isa process that anthropologists havedescribed again and again with regardsto the collapse of complex societieswhen the elites of a societyum become so entrenchedum and their interests uh aligned whatwhat ends up happening is that Societybegins lurching into this kind oftop-down imbalance where the elites uhcolonize more and more of the resourcesof this society and the productiveeconomy of the bottom part of thesociety can no longer sustain themmaterially and so you have a growingElite Class that like regulatory captureis just one of the ways it exerts itspower but that is increasingly parasiticon the actual production of the bottomof the pyramid and at some point there'sjust resource limitations you know LynnAlden has spoken often about uh theenergy Supply crunch like there's I meanwe assume yeah in the UK I mean it'sinteresting there's so many bits of workthat we've been doing recently that arekind of converging into thisconversation yeah I recently made a filmthat's about I don't know about twoweeks away from being released where Iwent out to study inflation in the inthe UK yeah people understood about itpost filming that we've had an energycrisis in the UK and the energy crisishas gone from the point of peopleexpecting to pay maybe one thousand onethousand two hundred Euro energy coststo a predicted up to six thousand theonly way that's been protected is by thegovernment borrowingmassive amount of money to subsidizeenergy costs right at an individual anda business level because businesseswould have closed and people could notheat their homes and we already havepeople living in poverty right so we'vehad this crunch that not only at thebase of society but also in the middleclasses because the middle class is sostretched that their disposal of incomedoesn't stretch so far right to thatRising interest rates with people comingoff fixed rate mortgages we're expectingthere's going to be a surplus of housingas people can't afford to pay for theirhomes right that we also had aconversation yesterday with overcrow andyou know you know overk very well yeahuh love him and uh we were discussing uhthe cost of living crisis which isn'tjust here which is happening everywhereright everything you've just said to mekind of points to one of the things Imade a note overk aboutum and also Hearts back to aconversation I had with do you knowDominic frisbee no he's a he's a UKcomedian what would you call him acomedian yeahpolitical commentator a bit all sortsyeah he's written the books on taxationsand he made a very clear point he saidand I'm paraphrasing him but um he saidthat we used to have a a society basedon houses with one income yeah and thatyou could afford a house and a car and aholiday and your kids right we've nowgot uh We've now got uh families we'vegot two incomeswhere they can't maybe afford a house orcan't afford to pay the bills he sayswe've had Society stretch and one of thethings I I wanted to say to ovik isyou know I talked to him about thisproperty this place called Terminushouse it's in a town called Harlow it'sait's one of the most deprived 20 mostdeprived towns in the country they're soshort of social housing they startedturning old office blocks into blocks ofsocial housing essentiallythe UK version of a favela yeah get awise right dangerous yesterdayit's shocking now for me it's shockinglike I I'm from the UK despite whatanyone thinks about the UK we have quitea civil society that like protects themost vulnerable and the poorest we havea good social structure whether it'swith health or housing but we'll get tothe point where we're starting to housesingle parents and families alongsidecriminals into these environments whichare burdened by poverty drugs this to meis a sign of a collapsing culture and acollapsing countrywhich is happening on the back ofmassive GDP growth over the last twodecades so everything you've just saidto me that right you've just pointed tothat this is the elites right that havetaken up the resources rightwhich has left very little for those atthe bottom and what yeah here we gothat's inside that's inside yeah yeahnow look it's not easy to houseeverybody who needs a home but at thesame timeit's it to me it's just another signalof many signals that I'm seeing in thatwe have squeezed the poorest and we'resqueezing the middle class out of beingable just to function right right you'reyou're absolutely rightum they're one of the things we see tooin late stage Societies or late stageEmpires is the increased emphasis onrent seekingum as opposed to new productive growthum and so what happens you know as theelites begin to feel the resource crunchbecause they feel it tooum even though you know they have moresort of paddingum they begin to search for new sourcesof revenue and the easiest way to findnew sources of revenue is to um toextract rentsum and so you know we've seen we've seenrent-based business models you knoweverywhere in including in in areas ofthe economy that are truly productivelike software it means software as aservice is now like the the standardmodel you no longer can like perpetuallyown software in effect you have to pay arent for it I noticed that even recentlywith Microsoft Word yeah yeah I want Iwanted Microsoft Word and it wanted meto uh to have a subscription exactlyit's like hold on I I'm sure I used topay likeI don't know the amount 100 pound 50pounds whatever and I would just ownthat software right exactly but yeah sosubscription rent you know whatever itis this is this is part of what hasum uh caused a boom in growth of certainindustriesum like real estate like uh softwareum but it is also presenting a challengeum because in effect it creates uhongoing sort of operating expenditureum for the end user or you know thepreviously what we would have called theowner but now it's the client or thecustomerum and so this also kind of chips awayat us in a sense at the sense ofproperty ownership like what does itmean if I'm always renting my propertyum what what is my sphere of ownnessthat is so to speak inviolable wheredoes that begin and end you'll learnnothing and be happy yeah well and isthis is this one we've seen or one ofthe reasons we've seen the likes ofBlackRock who now own I think is 80 000properties and a lot of these big fundsmoving into owning properties on ascarce resource which means there's lessproperties available for people to buyit pushes up the price of the propertiesit pushes up the prices of rent is thatone of the reasons we've seen thatcertainly I mean it so if you're lookingto diversifyum in a world where the productiveeconomy is you know hitting some limitsum then you're going to want to createareas of your portfolio that can collectrents on you know what is already builtwhat is already thereum and and so this is where we get intothe question of how do we actually growthe pie like how do we move from arent-seeking economy uh to a more netnew productive economy and that actuallyappears to be a question of resourceabundance scarcity so you know we can wecan have a growing economy but we need acertain type of energy subsidy for thator not subsidy Supply uh for thatum that energy crunch that is beingexperienced now throughout the world isconstraining you know real GDP growthit's going to constrain new Industriesit's going to push down uh rentextraction further and furtherum into the pyramid and so this is thisis why you know I think on the left inparticular which tends to be you knowvery concerned about uh the poor uh themiddle class those who are economicallystrugglingum there often is a real disconnect onthis issue because they haven't thoughtabout energy as the underpinning of allprosperity and so there there is anemphasis on redistribution which youknow you can debate different readersdistribution models But ultimately ifthe pie isn't growing then you'reredistributing smaller and smaller unitsof value that are themselves losingvalue to more and more people which is arecipe for a revolutionum I just want to go back a step whenyou talked about the checks and balanceson powerumand you might you may not have anopinion on this but I'd be interested inyour thoughts on what's been happeningin El Salvador with Nairobi Kayleeum he's obviously become very popularwith Bitcoin is because he's madeBitcoin legal tender he's alsodismantled some of the uh checks andbalances that would exist to uh on thepower he hasum but at the same time he's verypopular yeah and historically it is acountry that's had a massive issue withcorruptionum all the way through the various umparts of the government where you knowwe have I think two of the previouspresidents are in jail for stealing tensif not hundreds of millions one fled toNicaragua one died mysteriously yeah sowhilst the checks and balances existedhe has dismantled them but he does feellike he is somebody who's trying to takeEl Salvador in a different direction nowyou may hear certain claims that he'sjust a populist whatever I don't reallycare but how do you feel about somebodyhaving that much power and taking itinto their own hands considered well Ineed to I need to extend my time I needto have a second how do you feel aboutwhat's happened there yeah soumpolitical historians have written aboutthis trap that um countries can fallintoum I'm trying to remember the the termthey used for it it's something like thecoup trap or something but there are anumber of countries around the world whohave gone through these repeated cyclesof coup dictatorship collapse new coupnew dictatorship collapse and regularlyin South Americaum I mean yeah on every continent okayum and and so how do countries Escapethat trapum I I suspect you know I want to extendtypical the good faith that he'sum trying to do what's best for hiscountry uh however the challenge for uhwhoever ends up being in the dictatorposition post coup and any type ofradical consolidation of space statepower I would characterize as a coupwhoever is in that positionum then has the responsibility to buildinstitutions that separate powers inpractice and that can function withoutthe the dictator you know without thepersonalist power of the intervention ofthat individual and so that's always thequestionum there have been you know militarycoups followed by dictatorships thathave transitioned into truly Democraticforms of governance they just tend to bemore rare because the work of buildingthose institutions is very hard and isit also hard for someone to let go ofpower absolutely what did can you thinkof any examples where this has happenedit's for my late night reading wellum you know I'm gonna say theparadigmatic example is the AmericanRevolution okayum this was this was a violent militaryconflictum that was you know won by an upstartColonial uh country that was highlyfragmented I mean we had basicallymultiple States who in effect sawthemselves as multiple Sovereign Nationsum we really only won the war because wemanaged to finagle the support of Franceum and you know then ended up with acountryum and the the consensus at the time waswe need a kingum or we need someone who's going tobasically function that wayum and it was it was Washington'sforesight to refuse that roleum that I think became an enduring modelfor representative democracy in theUnited States so what so he was offeredthat role yeah he refused to be king Imean I feel like I've uh studied a lotof American History post-civil war anduh I don't I've never heard that haveyou heard that no but to be fair it'snot something I've looked I've studiedvery much I just did not know that sowhat so there was a consideration of theus becoming a monarchy interesting rightum or in effect creating a uh presidentrole that was no different okay from amonarch in its in its powersum and this is this is the problem nowwith the the American presidency is thatwe've we've been actually we are now onthe tail end of Decades of consolidationof executive powerum that was even explicitly theorized bysome as the theory of the unitaryexecutiveum this was a reigning or prevailingTheory explicitly during the um George WBush Administration that you know thethe president or the executive branch isin effect the governing Branch TheSovereign branch of governmentum and so today the president NC doeshave in effect monarchial powers andeven Beyond monarchical Powers becausein in most constitutionalpower anymore like yeah they don'treally have power anymoreum and so what is the electoral contestthen it's a constant contest of who willbe kingum and you have some you know in effectlike our previous president whoexplicitly was very comfortable with theidea of you know being president forlife and uh in effect doing away withthe whole uh show of electoral democracyand so power consolidates there the Iwould I would argue that the separationof powers in the United Statesum was not able to sustain itselfthrough the information revolutionum that after the second world war ourGlobal Imperial posture and the rise ofthe internet of communication technologyum so Amplified our powerum that we we actually our institutionscouldn't adapt fast enough and so thisis now the challenge for whoever theAmerican president's going to be it'snot just bukele it's like in thiscountry how are we going to re-found ourinstitutions so that we don't have likea really really powerful version ofbouquet who has the entire Globalsurveillance and Military apparatus attheir command so how does that happenthen becausesomebody travels to America a lot bigfan of the countryumthere is considerable political divisionright now we had you remember that oneinterview we brought up this chart andit was it would showum the kind of uh where there would becrossing their arm on certainum uh issues and policies and over timeit it showed how there was like a blendof red and blue and every time they'rejust two separate blocks right and andnow there seems to be very little apartfrom maybe in Bitcoin which we saw withJilla Brandon Sethi Anonymous it appearsto be very little things that people aregoing to work on and it's now justbecome us and them right the wholecountry appears to become us and themrightis that part of the failure yes itabsolutely is yeah here we go I don'tthink it was actually it wasn't this wayit's very similar yeah yeahum and we can imagine I mean that 2014graph is probably even more polarizednow yeah yeah and and yeah and it's sadto watch becauseumI've been a huge fan of uh study andunderstand what the forefathers try todo and yeah I wouldn't ever try andexplain it or explain my understandingbut the idea that these this group ofpeople tried toimagine a structure for the future thatwould protect against the individualattaining too much power yeah like whatthey foresaw and what they did for mewas was brilliant yeah but but Americaseems very very long way from that andstrange to be honest because we know howmuch you study as children theimportance of the forefathers right Iremember it in Kindergarten Cop when thekids stepped forward yeah they they talkof the forefathers like it's somethingI've always been aware of and it feelslike America has almost lost itsamericanism about that thatit seems like the passion for thepolitical parties become more importantthan the passion for the country exactlywhich requires you know conceding oncertain things and and it doesn't feellike anyone wants to concede on anythinganymore yeah that that's right and wherethey do concede their you know they'reoften simply boughtum and so it's extremely crassum this is why so Bitcoin magazine hasum their new issues coming out soon it'scalled the Orange Party issue and it'sall about transcending this red versusblue political divideum and I have an essay in there calledit is time to re-found the AmericanRepublic yesum where I make this exact argumentum we have actually lost sight of whatmade the American experiment greatliberty and justice for allum a kind of ethos of individual uhability toum experiment to fail and to succeedthat has become lost to considerationsaround policing both the world anddomesticallyum and so you know the model of theprison is increa increasingly becoming amodel for you know American socialinstitutions whether we're talking aboutschools or or workplaces or um you knowtheprisons themselvesum and then globally there's a kind ofcommitment to projection of power forits own sakeum where that sphere of Oneness is nolonger something we can Define as acountry insteadum our leaders talk in terms ofinterests American interestsbut whose interests specifically inAmericaum and so in the Congressional briefingon cbdc's one of one of the slides Ishowed was this growth of U.Sintelligence agencies over time whereyou know the 20th century particularlyafter the second world war just spawnedthis explosion of federal intelligenceagencies this is to say nothing of theactual like you know executive branchand and the policeunconstitutionally well oftenum I mean that's always a question rightunder the privilege of uh or purview ofsome Branch or some agency within theexecutive branch of government that saidwe're going to spin this upum and so they're not they're notaccountable to the people certainlythrough the electoral process they maythrough some chain of command report tothe president but whether the presidenteven is aware of a lot of their activityis Up For Debate which sounds very steepstate right I mean so so this is thething theum the American right with its you knowgrowing skepticism of the deep State andand it's kind of what seems like aconspiratorial world view is actuallybeginning to speak the same language asmany parts of the American left whichhave been suspicious of the deploymentof State institutions to prosecute youknow activists uh journalists you knowpretty much any like black person whohappened to rise to any kind of fame ornotoriety and in the United Statesum so this is the thing a defaultposture of let's use the state to solvewhatever X problem is is increasinglygarnering bipartisan uh disdain orsuspicion and that's where I think a newtype of political Coalition can be builtwith bitcoiners interestingly as a kindof Center for thatso when you talk about sorry just wantto go back a second you mentioned therethe arrest and imprisonment orprosecution of journalists where hasthis been happening because the reasonthis comes to my mind is right now I'mpersonally to the disappoint of uh othersome other people very critical ofVladimir Putin because historically uhthere's been no well very little FreePress in Russia what was but what didexist yeah was kicked out between thewarum and historically certain journaliststhey are uh reporting on certain topicsmay end up falling out of buildings orwith bullets in the back of the head yepum something I've been very critical ofI support a free press as much as wemight hate the mainstream media theentire press isn't CNN and Fox News andwe do have good journalists out thereand I'd much rather have a free presswith its faults than State pressabsolutelyumbut where havejournalists been targeted in the USum ityou know this actually is not my area ofexpertise so I'm not gonna yeahum buta pattern that I have seen is thatjournalists in the United States whobegin to ask difficult questionsum about those in power regardless ofwhat level you know Municipal statefederalum begin to face difficultiesparticularly around access and so Iwould suggest that in the United Statesthe media has actually come to policeitself to self-censor this happens inevery you know repressive regime thedifference is that you know uh unlikesay in China the U.S media is notgetting weekly communiques from the theparty about what talking points theyneed to hit in their press coverage thisweek that's a very direct Hands-On formof censorship and control that the USgovernment does not exerciseinstead it becomes about celebrity 30about access aboutopportunities speaking engagements youknow book dealsum promotional opportunities and so thiscollusion or Collision Of The World ofJournalism with the world of celebrityentertainment has from my point of viewremoved the media writ large as aneffective uh sort of preserver protectorof democracy in the United Statesinstead we have media factions whofoment conflict and controversy to driveengagement to drive ad dollars inrevenue and ultimately to drive accessto Elites I mean that's that's one ofthe failures of the internet I can'tremember I think was it AndreasAntonopoulos wrote about this one of thefailures of the internet has been makingthe internet so free and easilyaccessible right we destroyed so manybusiness models that relied on maybesubscriptions or you know beforepurchasing a newspaper they've had todrive Revenue through clicks and if youdrive around view through clicks you'reincentivized for clickbait which iskind of sad I think that I think that'sso right on the press as well though Ilike I think people think that there'ssome high like Angry hire up tellingpeople what to report on but I from myexperience I think it's definitely acultural issue rather than that and it'sI think the promotional opportunities isthe mostsort of obvious of that like you have toyou have to work within the sort of therestrictions of your fellow workers andand they can be quite tight yeah becauseyou have the social pressures internallywhich we know exists like for example aplace like Twitter we know that existswe you know we know Spotify it existsbecause what happened when there was uhThe Joe Rogan controversy we know itNetflix existed when people walked outum based on the uh Dave Chappelle comedyshow we know we know this exists youhave the social pressures entirely I Iwould also argue that there are uh andsome people won't like me for sayingthis but there is self-censorship withinthe world of Bitcoin so yeah and Iwonder what your observation again youknow harping back to uh anthropologybackground is I feel like there is a aself-centric self-censorship thathappens because there is a grownsubculture around a specific set ofbeliefs and end goal and if you stepoutside of that subculture you can riskuh being banished or having your careerroom memed I mean we saw what happenedto Nick Carter I fundamentally disagreewith some of Nick Carter's points byconsidering my friend right and I'lljust discuss it with him but there is aan attack culture within Bitcoin and Ihave no doubt some people self-censorum I'm not sure I do do Ium you wish I probably would more don'tyou I don't know if you're self-centeredbut like I know for I've heard for afact from other Bitcoin as things thatthey cannot say in public yeah we've hadthat like private conversations whereit's there is a another cryptocurrencythey say that actually that is usefulfor this I can't say it publicly orcertain beliefs uh they have aboutpolitical structures whereby maybe theythink that you know the government'snatural or obviously good thing againthey're not going to say publiclywe prefer the opposite we prefer toprovoke right not provoke for the setwell early on I maybe would provoke forthe sake of it but uh sometimes Iprovoke because I want to see people'sarguments I want to see their colors andthat is why this show anyone can come onwhether you are a Libertarian or aprogressive whether you're a bitcoineror you're full of crypto person willhave anyone on to have the fullconversation but that self-censorshipexists within Bitcoin and I can't figureout whether that is a good thing or abad thing half of me thinks it is a goodthing because you have that tight coreof people keeping Bitcoin and protectingBitcoin yeah that to me is superimportant because we've got to protectand nurture this technology but at thesame time sometimes I feel like there'scertain discussions that need happeningbut they're off topic right and then Ialso feel that certain opinions get tobe held and disseminated and notchallenged enough rightum uh climate change is an important onefor me yeahright and I feel like we are heading ina direction where a large group ofpeople are now fundamentally disagreeingwith the science and call him you're anidiot or a statist or you know libtardif you follow the science if you agreewith the science right and understandwhere this comes from because they weretold to follow the science would sayvaccines which turn out there's somecomplications around those but they sellcensorship I've not figured out whetherit's a good or bad thing yeah yeah no II thinkum what ends up happening in most socialcommunities is thatum there's a certain amount of work thatpeople are willing to do to Nuance theconsensus but beyond that they don'twant to do the workum and at that point is where you enterthe realm of or the Overton window sortof ends for whatever that Community isand so the question from my point ofview is always whatever the topic isthat we are discussing you know is arethe people I'm speaking with herefundamentally interested in truth or arethey interested in policing a communityboundary didn't we say the exact samething yesterday just not as eloquentlyyeahand I'm not as well educatedum yeah it's like do you want truth ordo you want confirmation right rightexactlyum and often what ends up happening isthatum people just don't have for whateverreason they haven't had the language tofully Express their point of view and sothey they devolve into violenceum linguistic violence and perhaps youknow physical violence but perhaps ifthey had the language to say think in amore nuanced way about an issue then youcould have a more constructiveconversation with themum and so fundamentally you know I'm I'man educator like Ihave taught for a long time and I seepart of my role within the Bitcoincommunity and within the United Statesas like introducing ways of talkingabout contentious topics that don'timmediately need to devolve into aposition in fact not knowing somethingnot having an opinion about somethingshould be the default position we don'tknow most things about most things andthere's a particular I think culture inAmerica in part because of our sort ofglobal Supremacy that we've inheritedthat you know not only our governmentbut like often American people feel likethey need to have an opinion on everyglobal conflict or like every major youknow political issueum and and you don't same thing withsocial media like social media has giveneveryone a microphone which isincredibly empowering but also you don'thave to use it and in fact part of thework of characters knowing Wendy use itand when not to use it are you speakingto me directly I feel like you'retelling me no no no I I know what youmean that like I've got a habit of doingthat I I think having language isimportant as well but I also thinkcourage yeah I am definitely I think thecourage to uh admit you might be wrongright the courage to apologize when youhave been wrong you know yeah publiclythe courage to say I could be wrongabout this tell me right yeah I think Iand I think there's a I think it's aweakness of character to blindly followA Narrative of a subculture you're inwithout challenging it yeah um yeah andI think a lot of people lack thatcourage and I don't know why that is Idon't know if this is like a uhphenomenon that's come out of Twitterwhereby you end up in these groups yeahyou feel like you want to stick withyour groups yeahum I think audience capture is a massiveissue that exists as well definitely umbut I think I think language schools isone thing but I would definitely putcourage is equally important and I justthink that maybe doesn't existabsolutely because it's scary right wellI think some people are afraidum and then also like we need to behonest violence is fun like I mean a lotof a lot of people genuinely enjoy theprocess of attacking of watchingsomebody else attack get attacked of youknow amplifying the attacks likeviolence is Natalie Wynn has actually agreatum YouTube video she's she's a a kind ofleftist uh YouTube Starum who created a channel called Contrapoints initially to respond to some ofthe right wing content that was outonline and de-radicalize people who weregoing through the YouTube sort of meatgrinder of oh wow like right wingradicalization Have you listened to theNew York Times series the audio podcastwhat was it called it was called rabbithole and I think she was mentioned inthat was she I think so have you justheard of that yeah and that starts withthat guy who's that the guy whowho kind of go down those rabbit holesand end up finding themselves in a wholenew world like they find themselves acommunity right essentially a cult rightand uh yeah it's kind of super weirdright yeah so Natalie Rose to fameum or I remember learning about her forthe first time uh when she did herepisode on incelsum and she did another one uh relativelyrecently on violence okayum and uh she she's actually aphilosophy or philosopher who decided totake philosophy to YouTubeum and the claim that she makes is likelook guys like violence is fun likepeople people wouldn't be doing it somuch if there wasn't some level of likehedonistic pleasure that we derive fromit is is it something that is uhingrained in Us in in that animals orviolent creatures of violent uh you knowwe survive we have survived throughviolent violenceum is it something that is just part ofus I would I would say yes I would saythere's actually an an evolutionarytrajectory that has rewarded a certaintype of violence both interpersonal andin group out group violence I mean likeour this example is often used but oneof our closest genetic relatives thechimpanzees you know one of their uhfavorite forms of amusement for uh malechimpanzees is to just like literally goout and hunt and kill out group malesum and so there there is a uh there is away in which demarcating the socialboundary of who's in and who's outum is that's a violent actum and it's also a pleasureful act andso people's commitment to truth canoften be at odds with not only the theviolence they anticipate but also thispleasure that they want to derive frombelonging and being able to excludeothers are you aware of a film calledrise of the wire rapes no that wasmentioned yesterday it came up lastnight as a recommended to watch that huhso that's apparently to do with theviolence within yeah Apes okay that'sinteresting I know but you also see itlike growing up every kid wanted to getGrand Theft Auto right uh steal a carpick up a prostitute and kill her that'swhat they do again that's what everyonewould do right right and you knowwhenever you're watching you knowfootball like our football soccerwhen there's a fight on the pitch allthe officials come out and say oh what adisgrace right everyone's watching thislike oh that's [ __ ] good yeah youknow like during the World Cup Iremember no the Euros ingosh what was it Euro 2016.uh the Russians are particularly violentand the British are particularly violentthey always tend to fight each other butthe Russians went full let's go andfight everyone right they destroyedtowns and all sorts remember the guy whohad the yeah the GoPro on so you hadthis guy running around I think it wasMarseille and just running up and punchhim and like it was entertainment it wasweird yeah but it was entertaining itwas almost black mirror-like yeah but itwas entertaining sohow how have we learned to control andtame that because we are graduallybecoming less violent yes and I wouldmake an argument an uneducated argumentthat perhaps in Europe with a bit lessviolent than other places how has thatbeen tamed how have we controlled this II always see you knowthings like violence they're anexpression of energy they're anexpression of uh you know for lack of abetter term the human life force and soum what tends to not work is simplypathologizing it criminalizing itpunishing itum because that is actually a counterviolence and so the person inclinedtoward violence then says oh okay soviolence is okay as long as I use it inthis social policing kind of mode and sothen this is why you often see you knowthe biggest bullies become the biggestenforcers of the lawum because it's just uh becomes asocially acceptable way for them towield violenceand so how how does violenceumand optimally get socialized well itbecomes directed towards uh ends that insome way benefit the community uhwhether that is huntingum bringing that you know food back oryou know the the violence ofum the slow controlled social work thatbuilds institutions I mean humaninstitutions are ways of controllingviolence okay like you go to work youyou don't necessarily like everybody youwork with you don't necessarily agreewith the way things are structured butthere is a kind ofum inertia that holds things togetherthat enables you to achieve thingstogetherum and so the foundation of theseinstitutions is violence in fact uhthere's a long history of politicaltheory about the State and StateBuilding that that says you know thefounding Act of every state is violencelike there is no law that pre-exists anygiven state that brings that state intoexistence because it is the state as aninstitution that becomes the conditionfor lawumyeah and so it's always about what isthe violence being directed toward notis there violenceagreed love I've made a show with himyeah about this he talks often about thelogic of violence and that technologywill change the logic of violence and hehas a belief that Bitcoin will changethe logic of violenceI don't know if you've looked at thatum there yeah there's been a lot ofconversation I've seenum on Twitter particularly about uh therelationship between Bitcoin and Warum especially uh but but also sometimesviolence yeah so I haven't bought theconcept that uh Bitcoin will end allwars I just haven't bought that becauseWar existed before yeah certain commonuh easily exchangeable money yeah and soI don't buy that idea I understand theidea that uh it changes the potentiallythe industrial complex militaryindustrial complex it changes thatability to uh fund War but but you couldjust go to a scenario where war isfunded by bonds again rather thandeficit spending yeah absolutely so Idon't I haven't fully bought that oneand that's like Alex Gladstone's pointisn't it that it yeah it removes unjustWarum and because if you have to raisemoney from the people they have to agreewith what you're doing so you can't havesomething like the Iraq situation yeahyeah can't do it through officer theexistence as such of sound money doesnot to your point suddenly eliminate theexistence of creditso it's not a question of you knowis Bitcoinum a limited constrained supply fornation states but rather how will nationstates monetize Bitcoinum I mean the the existence of goldnever prevented Warum or or other you know hard commoditymoniesum rather you know States went throughthe predictable process of minting coinum then you know summarily debasing thecoin over time you know growing untilthey couldn't and until they wereliterally conquered or subjugated byanother people who then became Sovereignand so there is a parallel question ofhuman institutions political socialinstitutions that doesn't go away justbecause we now have Bitcoin okay I knowwe meant to begin on to cbdc's right umthere is another thing I want to ask youbecause yeah there are within theBitcoin Community a lot of kind ofanti-state people or Libertarians rightand every time I sit and discuss withthem I said this over and over Ifundamentally agree with themtheoreticallyum I am stilleven at this current time I'm asupporter of democracy yeah um I feelit's strange I mean at the moment in theUK that I could not vote for Liz trussand I could not vote for kirstamathere's no one I can vote for we've lostanyone to believe and get behind becauseand the reason is it's not fundamentallythe people themselves the system itselfis broken yeah I know now that whoevercomes into power is going to Bringingmore laws which reduce freedom andthey're going to destroy the moneyfurther and just I just I'm justaccepting of that now rightbut I fundamentally agree theoreticallywith a lot of what the Libertarians saymy problem is is that I thinkI think the state is a natural monopolyand I worry if you bring or burn downthe state start again you can end upwith something worse I mean you'vestudied political structures I assumeyou you've studied why you getdemocracies in one country and you gettotalitarian as another country and whythat happens My worry is that if wetry and end or move on from democracy weget something that's worse right withoutthe checks and balances right well andthis is why I don't particularly carewhat people are against what are theyfor that's what interests meum okay and you don't like democracywell what is your positive politicalproject what what are you advocating forexactly Anarchyyes but then but then the questionbecomes what is anarchy is the family ananarchist unitum families still have hierarchies thereare still people who are dependent andothers who provisionum and soI actually think your your question isspot onthere's been a lot ofum sort of Socialist Communist politicaltheory in recent decades on the leftthat's been kind of the main focus thereand then that then more on the rightwe've hadum you know ethno Stateum theorizations we've had uh secretaryexecutive ethnic State yeah like youknowum basically racial kind of or ornational Supremacy arguments okay thatyou know governments are for and by aparticular people who are ethnicallydemarcated in in these ways so likeDugan and Russia is a great example ofthisum but you know there are also manyproponents in other countriesumso we've had these various politicaltheoriesum but what we haven't consistently haduh well theorized is an anarchistposition like what is what does thatmeanum and so one of the interesting thingsthat Bitcoin introduces into the thepolitical conversation is the notion ofrules without rulersum a system that is designed to beself-sustaining and sort of selfum maintaining in terms of itsgovernance uh procedureso that is where as a political theoristI'm actually interested in doing somemore work well if you do it please sendit yes I'm interested in it becauseagain I mean I've spoken to anarchistsand theoretically everything that sellsI agree with everything they say but I Idon't agree with the reality of whatwill happen when you put humans in thisposition and look I'm not a smart personI'm not eloquent like yourself but Icannot I can understand or I do havebasic questions is and I do fully expectthat hierarchy will come again if youbreak hierarchy new hierarchies will bebuilt yeah and will we create somethingworse that's always what I worry aboutand my expectation as humans is that wewill yeahum we fought Wars and for decades andcenturies to have the freedoms we haveum I feel relatively free as a Britishperson I can travel freely yeah I can Ican I can stand outside down in streetwith a placard complaining about Liztruss if I want right I I feel fairlyfree I feel like my freedoms areshrinking but I still feel fairly freeright I don't want I don't want to livein a Russia or a China certainly not aChina so I I just feel like the the ideathat it's become for someone to believesupport democracy that that's pejorativeis Right Madness to me right no exactlywell this is this is the questionumdo youum do you believe that communitiesshould govern themselves okay so now youhave a group of people who areself-governing a state uh right so whatwhat is the mechanism by which theygovernum and uh you know a monarchist mightsay well you know one of them gets to bethe king and then they're you knowheredity sort of rules or makes acertain makes a certain amount ofdecisions on behalf of the collectiveothers might say well you know the mostprosperous citizens should ruleum oligarchy and actually I I think thata lot ofum people who publicly profess to beanarchists or Libertarians are cryptooligarchs they actually believe thatthose who are the mostum powerful Financial financiallyeconomically they've kind of won and sothey they get to make the rulesum which is not uh you know certainlythe system that I ascribe to then thereare various flavors of you knowdemocracy the people rule the demos rulewell who are the demosum and how do you uh how do you positionthe demo Us in relationship to theelites because to your pointhierarchy is a social technology it'sone of the most primitive human socialTechnologies it arises as a way tostreamline decision making andcoordinate social action at scalebecause if you have everybody makingevery decision about everythingthe the species dies out the collectivedoes nothing and so one of one of thequestions that the Texas BitcoinFoundation is is actually taking upum is uh is precisely this question ofgovernance what is the relationshipbetween State and Societyum in in a democracy and how doeshow does scale impact that you know ifyou're governing a community of 150people which is the Dunbar number youknow you may have very different form ofgovernment or self-government than ifyou're governing a state a bmoth of astate with 400 million people like theUnited Statesum and from my point of view the largerthe scale the fewer decisions the stateshould make because there's so much moreimpactful and so much more likely to gowrong and negatively impact and so thisis one of the challenges of refoundingAmerican institutions is I think alsorelocalizing decision making in localcommunitiesOkay soif you don't if there isn't thisrefinding of Institutions yeah what arethe risks that you've identified fordirectionally where the USA is headedbecause it it feels likeAmerica you knowit's the land of free land ofopportunity land of Economic Opportunityuh an open Free Fair countryas a brandnot always in reality yeahumbut it is also a surveillance State asas the UK is and it feels likedirectionally it is mirroring what of alot of what it hates about China yeahabsolutelybut doing it worse because it isn't atotalitarian regime that's right soand I've often thoughtif America sees China as a threatdon't copy China and do it worse rightbeat China of Freedom rightand therefore cbdc'sare the wrong answer right Bitcoin to meis naturally the right answer rightbecause it's a freedom technology that'sright yeah no and this is the argumentthat I make in the white paperum on cbdc's is you know I start withthis contrast between the American modelof political economyostensibly from our past and then theChinese model of political economy notbecause China is actually unique in thisregard but because it is the new modelthat virtually every country in theworld is adoptingum and that is a strong state that leadseconomic life directs economic life andalso fully surveils the populationum and so the theory behind that is thatif you have full surveillance you nolonger need democracy because thegovernment can now know what you wantbased on your behaviors which can befunneled through you know a series ofpredictive analytic you know algorithmsto tell the government what policies arefavored and disfavored by the populationbut do states Sleepwalk into this or isthere is this centrally planned as thisis this would be best for our country uhboth I would say a little bit of bothum I would sayum a lot of people do Sleepwalk into itum because they simply can't imagine thepossibility that power could be misusedum you know and it's it's technology oneof the reasons this happens because yeahyou start to look at some of the worstin technology if you if you think duringwhat happened with the covert crisisthis crisis or not but with theconsideration of uh vaccine passportsyeah nowobviously you know especially within ourcommunity people rejected thesepassports the idea that you could haveto prove your health yeah you knowtraveling across borders which by theway sometimes you have to do anyways gointo certain uh jurisdictions you haveto have some inoculations but but thatidea just was a step too far but I cansee how somebody within governmentthinks this is a good idea because theyhave the technology and it makeseverything more efficient without fullyconsidering what this actually means asa societal construct right right no itthat's exactly rightum you knowwe've had we've hadum proof of vaccination requirements fora very long timeum you know in different socialinstitutions at different scales prettymuch ever since vaccines were inventedum for example it's very hard to enrollyour child in a public school in in theUnited States without having uh proof ofvaccinations MMR do you have the MMRhere uh yeah and a whole bunch of otherstuff okayum and so you have to like you knowdemonstrate that your child is not goingto be a vector for other children whichI think you know at the level of thatschool is a very reasonable request tomakeum the problem is when you then create avaccine policy you for 400 millionpeople that has enforcedum you know to enter and exit bordersthat has enforced you know in contextwhere perhaps it has nothing to do withwith the actual you know purpose of thattransaction or that interaction and soit's the sort of AML kyc vacation yeahof everything yeahum where there's no distinctions anymorebetween the information I need and theinformation I want just give me all theinformation but see I see it with uhwhen I look at the Chinese model yeahsocial credit scores I just see this ascontrol the decisions based on controlbut I can see in kind of more Westernliberal democracies that it's donethrough naivety sometimes maybe controlyeah but I can see how we sleep walkingthese decisions because the logic of thetechnology makes sense right and I couldI could come up with 10 differentexamples immediately of different wayswhere technology seems you knowsurveillance you can make the argumentfor surveillance uh you know crimereduction you know in the UKum I listened to an interview withsomebody who worked for MI6 and theytalked about all the different plotsthey foiled and we've had terroristplots we had the tube bombings uh we hadthe failed two bombings we've had anumber of knife attacks we had the onesstarving on London Bridge London BridgeBorough market so we've had successfulterrorist attacks right where innocentpeople have died it was what was it 52on the uh I think it's 52 in the um thetube attacks and the borough Market Ican't remember 13 14 people just stabbedto death right and he was talking abouthow they use surveillanceuh both uh technology but actually uh umstationing uh offices to track peopleand then follow people makes a very goodargument for uh the safety andprotection of the country usingtechnologyit's an art it's an argument it's hardto disagree with but that when thatcomes to the point where everything issurveilled NSA standard you know you cansee how that's a problem and I don'tknow what the right answer is it's the10 most surveilled cities in the worldand they're all in China apart fromLondon well don't they have some Neilsend that article they've got 55 orsomething of all yeah I tweeted aboutthat recently hold on London isn't inChina no they're all in China apart fromapart from London yeah yeah so it's nota good list to be on though it is not agreat list to be on but we've alwaysknown we're one of the most yeah butalso at the same time I give anotherexampleum did you hear a couple of years agoago in the UK a young girl called Saraheverard was murdered a blonde girl wasmurdered by a policeman oh I think yeahI did hear about this yeah so she was myfriend uh yeah she worked for me I hadan advertised agency in London sheworked for me for five yearsum knew her very well andwhen she went missing my old businesspartner olly uh messaged me said ho umSarah's Sarah's gone missing and Saraheverard I was like really he said yeahshe's not been seen for 24 hours I waslike huh so I had a friend who worked atthe Met place and I phoned him up and heexplained me what was going to happennow he was very clear if she's not foundwithin 24 hours it's a very high chanceshe's been killed yeah okay if she'sbeen killed you want the perpetrator tobe caught right you absolutely want thatperson to be caught because you don'twant them to do this to somebody elseright the way he was caught was on theroad he was on there was a camera in thebus right so buses now have cameras inthem to protect the the bus driversright they caught the moment where hehad her at the side of the road as apoliceman and he showed his uh warrantcard and he arrested her anotherum something to do with the covid actthat she shouldn't have been out sheshould have been home because we're onlockdown we can avoid we don't have todebate all the lockdown rules yeah thepoint being ishe was caught because of that cameraright at the moment and what not onlydid it capture him and capture his carand his number plate right they trackedthe number plate to the car the rentalcompany that you rented it from andfound him right then and he's now injail he's been given a full lifesentence again you can see especiallyyou know young women in London afterthat would want there to be cameras andsurveillance because they might feelmore protected yeah and this is there Ifind super tricky because I I fullyagree with that we we should be the mostsurveilled I fully agree that we shoulddeserve privacy but I can also see thedefense of why you would have theseright right exactly and I don't knowwhere to fall on this well this is thisis why every city in the United Statesis investingum significantly in camera technologyand other surveillance Tech I mean someof the biggest technology startups inthe US are surveillance technologystartups and the way thatum public consent for this is uh youknow to chomsky's word manufactured iscrime prevention and crime reduction andthere's a lot of data that thesecompanies can point toum that the Chinese State can also pointto I mean like theone of the uh cities that I was readingaboutum for this white paperum installed you know a bunch ofsurveillance at an intersection wherebicycles were regularly being stolen andyou know bike thefts dropped to zeroum so people want the ability to recovertheir property if it's stolen they wantthe ability to you know findperpetrators of crimesum that's all true uh the questionbecomesum and I and I actually think this needsto be answered predominantly at a locallevel is for the Integrity of thiscommunitywhat type of policing practices and Iwould put surveillance Under theUmbrella of policing what type ofpolicing will be most effective can wehave good surveillance thenwe can we separate it from what is aninvasion of privacy I think weabsolutely canum and the answer for that is going tobe different in different communitiesright and so this is also where we getinto a very interesting question uh thedifference between laws and normsNorms are actually the social fabric thepractice is the expectations the valuesthat hold Society togetherwhen you have a collapse of norms andyou start relying on laws exclusively topolice a society that's a collapsedState I would say that Society it hascollapsed and this is what's happeningat what we see in the United Statesum not just locally but at the highestlevels of government like there arethings that presidents do that peopleroutinely ask well can a president dothat well it's not illegal becausenobody ever thought to legislate thatbecause the thinking was that that apresident would comport themselves witha certain kind of character and andadhere to certain Normsum if we can't assume shared Norms Iwould suggest we don't have a societyum and so the process of refounding Ithink starts at uh the local level ofunderstanding what are our shared Normsin this communityum and then scales from there can youpoint to some of this breakdown beingbecause of the failure of money is thatone of the reasons becauseI know for example nowmy children will not be able to afford ahome at all the only reason they're notgoing to be saddled with debt is becauseI'm not allowing them to but plenty oftheir friends and peers will be yeah andthey have this expectation that theythey can't get on the ladder anymoreI've had this conversation with my sonlike howhow do I even get to where you got howdo I get to a like I just I just can'tsay and we know we know there's thiskind of a amongst you know the youththis is kind of like detached from fromthem between themselves and the waygovernance occurs I mean you've didn'tyou talk about that in your article yeahyeahso like what do we do about that yeahwell a big part of this is[Music]umso some of this is structural yeahactually most of it is structuralone of the markers of a declining orcollapsing Society is that this fear ofnew economic activity shrinks right umand when you're young and you you knoware not capitalized you're not very wellresourced what do you have to make yourway in the world you have yourproductive labor and so you need placesto be able to start you need a a zeropoint to start fromum in societies where those initialsteps on the ladder are not availabletypically what young people do is theyexit they go to other societies wherethey are available and soum you know there's a historian namedPeter turchin who has written aboutum the colonization of the Americas uhand not just him many other historiansin effect as the project of second andthird sons of European nobility who werenot inheriting the family fortunes andand basically couldn't find anythingelse to do they wanted to be the mastersof something they wanted to be PropertyOwners they wanted to be wealthy sowhere did they go they went to the newworld where they could you know conquerand well we know this happens like uhDanny you might know this better than mebut like a place like Tonga I mean Lordwhat's his name Lord fusotuo yeah he hetalked and he talked about the idea thatthere's no opportunity for for littleopportunity for young people in Tonga sothey ended up going to New Zealand andAustralia yeah right I know Irelandspecifically has an issue outside ofDublin my father lives in Ireland and alot of people there will like one of hisneighbor both if their children havemoved to Australia to work becausethere's opportunity because there's nowork right locally within the era thatthey're from an island and then a lot ofpeople in Ireland will move to the UK toget jobs is that basically what you'retalking about yeah like that you know onthe one hand there's the magic of thefrontier which is kind of this open uhat least in the minds of you know thosegoing there to make their fortunes thisopen space where they can start fromnothingum as the Frontiers close then itbecomes a question of how fast is thepie the productive economy growing inareas whereum it's growing quickly then there arethese zero points where people can enterin areas where it's stagnant ordeclining they can't enter this is whywe have to solve the energy problembecause yeah well so I wonder itdoes this problem occur becausethe state has interfered too much or notinterfered enough so when I sayinterferred too much have they createdtoo too many barriers for people forEconomic Opportunity or thinking aboutthe work that ovik does have they're nothave they not created enough opportunityyeah and I don't know where and perhapsit's a mixture of both rightum you know the the generation of uheconomic value is I would say most mostsuccessfully demonstrated by politicaleconomies that haveumthat privilege a free marketum with some amount of Stateinterventionum to enforce a set of shared uh gameconditions okay soum that is a thesis that is Up ForDebate some would say no no Stateinvolvement whatsoeverum like markets truly you knowunfettered others would say no the statemust direct markets this is the Chinesemodelum and in terms of just sheer growth youknow they they haven't been proven wrongthe question is how much of the valuethat the Chinese economy has generatedover the past decadesis actually piggybacking on the valuegenerated in more free market societiesum so the technology The Innovation thecorporate forms that it you know getsborn in the U.S and then picked up inChinaum and so this is the thesis or theargument that I make in the cbdc paperis like we can see historical examplesof this in the medieval period in Europewhere those those local jurisdictionsthat adopted Freer Market Normsum then became Innovation hubs thatpositively impacted even theauthoritarian jurisdictions that werenearby because they created a risingtide and so this is a balance thereisn't going to be one set of policyprescriptions for every Communityum I think that every Locale needs toanswer this question for themselves butbroadly the a a inclination toward aFreer Market I think think has beenshown to create bottom-up value muchmore effectively than a top-down modelof State driven growth excellent Okay somoving on to cbdc's yeah we got there90 minutes in I think Danny promised youan interview with less than an hour anda half I'm really enjoying this thankyou yeahum so think considering a cbdc'ssomething we again seem to besleepwalking into potentially what wereyou what is at stake here yeah I mean atstake isand cbdc specifically is the eliminationof the last sphere of financial autonomythat remains and that is physical cashum you know although the the FederalReserve and the ECB have you know issuedpublic statements to the effect thatthey're not I carry physical cash alwaysrighthere though yes yes yeah I carry theseto be replaced with the King soonindeed to get onebut but yeah I mean that's that's what'sat stake because the the last non-kyseed form of financial transacting isphysical cash andum every cbdc design model has positedthat full identification will benecessaryum to both receive cbdc's directly fromthe central bank and then to transactwith them later on even without cbdc'sthough do you not see the elimination ofphysical cashum I think yeah I think governments oneway or another are going to work toeliminate it I'll give you anotherexample of why you can Sleepwalk intothis as wellum uh do you know I own a football clubyeah so so uh I've actually had to startlearning about running a part of abusiness's cash base we have a bar andfood and people come and they can paywith Bitcoin they can pay with a card orpay with cash yeah cash is a pain it's areal pain you have to have a float thefloat has to have the right amount ofcoins to give change right and you haveto count it and back it's a paineverything that's paid on by the card iseasy right I can see why you Sleepwalkinto removing cash because it's easypeople who don't think about money don'tthink about surveillance don't thinkabout kyc don't don't think about any ofthis because they've not been throwndown this Bitcoin rabbit hole which isthe vast majority of people yeah I cansee how you Sleepwalk into getting ridof cash yeah 100 I mean this is how thisis how the internet has come to be ownedby a small group of of megacorps is theconvenience and ease of navigating uhyou know TCP and https uh through aplatform that is very easy to use that'sbeautiful that you know you know exactlywhere to click to do whatum that is how we've captured the worldthe early internet was not this way Imean the early internet was peer-to-peerit was basically only nerds using itum like they knew how to use this in aself-sovereign way but as adoptionscaled and then as the webcommercialized it became a new newplatform for for Commerce it had to getradically simpler so that anybodyregardless of their technical knowledgecould use the infrastructure and so thisis the challenge with Bitcoin and peoplesaid this over and over again it has tobecome uh super easy to use in order tocompete with these more centralizedforms of moneyum what is the um what is the state ofdevelopment of cbdc's within Russia andwhere is America currently at with thisyou knowum Russia has made announcements aboutit I I don't know where they are sorryI'm in China yeah in Chinaum they've been piloting cbdc's in anumber of cities and interestinglythey're running into the same challengewhere people are like well money'salready digital like I already useum we we pay and Ollie pay foreverything so why do I have to use thecbdc now and they're completelysurveilled through alipay and we payright exactly and so this is part of myargument in the paper too is the digitaldollar banking system is already fullysurveilled so like why do you needactual like digital cash that's aliability of the Central Bank why can'tthe commercial money that's alreadyfully surveilled uh achieve this purposebut uh yeah so China's you know pilotingit interestingly they're not thefurthest along a number of countrieshave alreadyum issued cbdc's smaller countriesum who particularly uh the Bahamas uhEastern Caribbean Nigeria I believeum they're they're named uh in the inthe paper it's unclear to what extentthey're actually being used okay the U.Sis currently in the stage ofmoving from the research stage to theimplementation stage so it's a verytricky stage to be in the FederalReserve the treasury the White Houseoffice for Science and Technology policyof all released reports about cbdc'sum you know not not recommending themexplicitly but also not not recommendingthem and saying if you were to design acbdc here are the requirements that itwould have to meet so in effect they'vecreated a blueprint for a cbdcum all the while saying oh no don'tdon't worry we're not planning toactually do thisum we would need a law from Congressso okay so at least that part of thepolitical process still functions butCongress is on itum so there was uh something called uhthe e-cash bill that was introduced afew months ago by a group of senatorsdisappointinglyum you know including some members ofthe squadum to introduce uh to require the U.SSquad yeah the progressive you know uhyoung female uh congressionalrepresentation what's the squadum you know AOC yeah but what's the nameis that like a known name yeah that'sthat's the name for likeum her kind of codery of not just herbut like a group of young ProgressiveDemocratic uh female uh women of colorwho were elected to congress so you didlast few years this is one of thereasons like uh recently we've beenmaking a hard push on the show to havemore uh Progressive leftists bitcoinerson the show we've had Jason Meyer who'sright writing a book look we've hadLogan Bollinger who else we have we'vehad loads of Mark Goodwin I guess yeahthat was a little different show but thepoint being is that you know Bitcoin isuh has mass awareness Bitcoin is growingit's certainly been adopted more by theconservatives right and then theprogressives and I've always seenAmerica as the front line for Bitcoinright if America accepts Bitcoin ifAmerica you know uses Bitcoin a lot ofthe world will follow yeah if Americarejects Bitcointhere's no there's a big incentive forother states to reject it so it's reallysuper important for me uh rather thanfocus on what you hate people on theleft for right or think Libs of ticktock represents every Progressive InAmerica which it clearly doesn't whichis a small minority of morons like youget a small minority of morons on therightwe should accept Bitcoin is coming yepwe should accept progressives are goingto see Bitcoin and we should beexplaining to them why they should careabout it this is why we were so Keen tohave Jason on because Jason is writingthe book a progressive case for Bitcoinwe should embrace this this is good forBitcoin this is good for everyone elsewhich means that you have rather thanyou know what has happened when you seesomeone like AOC well no specificallyElizabeth Warren tweets something aboutBitcoin which is fundamentally wrong yousee all these progresses underneath thegreen with her and yeah saying the sameI think we have to do a much better jobof actually educating these people aboutBitcoin not yeah which I'm a hypocritenot say have fun being poor not callingthem libters actually introduce them sayno no look at how Bitcoin can uh improvewealth equality look at how Bitcoin cancreate more inclusion look how Bitcoincan help mitigate against climate changewe should be doing that work right rightbecause of the squad right no I 100agree um in fact I had invited uh themto the Texas blockchainmaybe no uh but maybe one of these yearsthey'll they'll decide toum I think I think the challenge is thatum thethe progressive left has embraced a kindof redistributionist politics thatincentivizes them at this moment towelcome cbdc's because what they want isuh direct fed accounts for everyAmerican they want to press a buttonyeah they want to be able to press abutton and have the stimulus just pop upin your account no checks no thingsgetting lost no things getting stolenlike everything can just be seamlesslyuh redistributed that way conditions onwhat you can spend the money on but thisis the problem because if you createthis structureum money giveth you've also now createdthe rails for taketh away so now you canput you know a negative two percentinterest rate on that fed account andsay you just spend them right you betterspend that before it runs outum and that negative two percent I meancan be deducted at any time interval itcould be daily it could be weekly itcould be monthly it could be yearly itwhatever you can't buy beer with thatyou can't buy beer with it you can't youcan't shop at this store because youknow they're uh flagged as a terroristrisk you can't you know go here becausethe owner of this is like underinvestigation for X Y or Z and sosuddenly you've created in effect acompany storeum out of the entire American economyuh yes uh what happens to sorry I wasabout to say something but what happensto the likes of Visa or Mastercard inthese scenarios with the cbdc they willbecome like most likelyum if if a cbdc gets rolled out in theUnited States it will use the CommercialBanking sector and the establishedcredit card companies as payment railsbecause one one of the things thatscares me or scares me but I don't likeabout the cbdc that I think other peoplehaven't thought about isit's a good thing that the financialsystem is fracturedyeah sometimes the banks go downsometimes American Express goes downlike if I'm going to pay andmastercard's gone down right I can go tocash right or I can go to my AmExexactly I've got all these I've gotBitcoinphysical cash right MasterCard Visaright Express anything can break andI've got something else I can use if wehave oneblockchain controlling money which bythe way I'm not even sure techno theycan they can technically do this yeahyeah um and uh and it's built on Solanowe know like every other week it's gonnait's gonna stop working and then thewhole financial system collapses rightno exactly and this was one of theexamples I gave with the uh the EasternCaribbean's uh implementation of theircbdc D cashum where it just it just went down for afew months either earlier this year or2021 and it was because you know theyused a hyperledger fabric uh privateblockchain implementation and justwhoever's job it was didn't update theSSL certificateI mean it's so [ __ ] stupid it's liketwo months the entire cbdc was unusablebut it's so stupidum and this is why governments arelikely what they're going to do isthey're going to the contract out to theprivate sector so the bank bank ofinternational settlements bisum has been partnering with the SwissNational Bankum and a company called six which is abank Consortium that has built a privateblockchain ledger to Pilot cbdc's nowthey're very quick to say this doesn'tmean Switzerland is rolling out of cbdcdon't get any weird ideas but they havedemos they have presentations they'vewritten papers about itum and so you know what's happening inthe US is you know Amazon is positioningtheir blockchain as a service offeringuh you know particularly to the ECB withum with a major Global software vendorspositioning themselves as theimplementers of this and so what's goingto happen is private software companiesare likely going to deliver and maintainthe currency of the realmhow does that really sit from uhconstitutionality political Theorystandpoint I don't knowDanny did I ever tell you about whenMasterCard got in touch to sponsor thepodcastI I think you did but you should tellthe story yeah so we had MasterCardreach out just once the podcast I waslike oh that's interesting well it's theold world but I mean I use MasterCard Imean rightwhat is it you want to promote and theyhad a couple of things and they said ohand we want to advertise that we areready for cbdc's and I was like are youaware my show is a Bitcoin do you knowwhat we think of cbdc's yeah so thatthat never really went aheadum Okay sowe all understand the threat yeahum what can we do about this like whatare you doing what what do you wantpeople just going back to that does thatnot highlight how even MasterCard aren'taware of what this might be I just don'tthink most people consider it rightbecause I think people are soconditioned now to be in surveilledfinancially yeah I expect every singletransaction I do through my bank accountto be surveilled all right I expect thebank to give that information willinglyI know the bank look at it themselvesbecause I lost a bank account becausethey phoned me up to ask me about mypayments I told them to [ __ ] off it'snone of their business I was at myaccount closed down so I know they'redoing it I know the government is I knowI know I know to have privacy we have totake into our own hands I'm notparticularly credit but that's why Ialways have cash because there's certainthings I just don't want to be trackedfor but yeah I think they sleep walkinto it I think someone like Mastercan't think oh this is a new innovationthat's coming this is great for peopleoh this is blockchain yeah you know Ithink I think they sleepwalking yeahum yeah so people are listening to thiskind of what message do you want to getacross to them and are you trying toare you trying to create action do youwant action from people do you wantsupport what is it you're you know whatdo you want to get out of this yeahabsolutely how can we help the only waythat tyranny is prevented is a strongcivil society that the state actuallybecomes concerned about and so right weneed institutions yes what we need ismassive pushback from the Americanpeople against cbdc's that means writingcalling your um Congressman your Senatorum any any you know media outlet that iswilling to publish letters to the editoror op-eds talking about it on your blogson social media there has to be apolitical price for implementing thispolicy in the United States andum this is you know one of the thingsthat you know I write about in thebeginning of the paper is thisdisturbing tendency that we've seen inamong the American electorate tocontinue voting for people who uh youknow further the surveillance State aslong as you know we like one of theirpolicies on something else or theiridentityum you know who they areum the problem with that is that ifeveryone we're voting forum continues consolidating state powereventually there will be nothing to voteforum the problem you were describing whoam I going to vote for who actuallyrepresents me on this roster I mean thisis a problem I think in most politicaljurisdictions so it feels like to methat one of the most important things todo is break thisthe political war this partisanproblem that America like we've got itgrowing in the UK but it's not as badbut that's like thisspecific partisan problem you have hereyou've got to break thatand then you with that you've got tohave stronger leaders and youit's like how do you bring you kind ofgot to bring people together whichBitcoin does right that's the idea rightright the orange party right but you'renot going to get an orange partytomorrow and the you know BrettWeinstein I think it was who tried toattempt to do uh a party which would uhwhat was it called the I can't rememberwhat it was called on Twitter and theytried to bring together likeum it was Andrew Yang on one side and itwas a republican on the other side therebut yeah I meanis everything like you're speaking thesame language to me every problem thatyou've seen that I'm seeingI just don't know how it happens yeahlike I feel like we need strong leadershave you got any allies I mean I knowTexas blockchain council are very goodthey've got good relationships withpeople in DC have you got alliesabsolutely so last weekum I did a congressional briefing forfor the US Congress andumrepresentative Tom emmer from Minnesotahow was that by the way uh were younervous you know did you nail it maybe alittle but I think I nailed itum uh representative Tom emmer uh gavethe opening remarks and he he actuallywas the first to introduce a billum to prohibit the Federal Reserve fromlaunching a cbdc in the United States ohso we like this guy um so yeah so it wasabout we were talking about coming onthe show really he's a senator yeah uhuh Congressman Congress yeah yeah forwhich Minnesota huh yeah so we'll tryand get him yeah well we can get himwe'll we'll get him yeah I'll tell youwho else is in Minnesota soon because wego up there yeah coolum yeah butum he would you know he's a fantasticAlly and then only a couple of monthslater Texas Senator Ted Cruz introduceda companion bill in the Senate that'sbasically the same language as Emmer'slanguage but in the Senate and so thatsuggests that there is momentum againsta cbdc I know cruises but is Tom uhRepublican as well he is and this is thechallenge the e-cash bill is allDemocratsum and sothe partisan narrative that has emergedaround money is one of the walls that wein the Bitcoin Community need toactually seek to break down right yeahokay so a nation cannot survive withoutideasthis is the premise for the TexasBitcoin Foundation it's great to dopolicy workum it's great to build businessesum but you can do that even underauthoritarian regimes likethe the thing that makes America a freecountry is the ideas that are embodiedin these activities and so in order tohave ideas that are worth building on weneed institutions like the Texas BitcoinFoundationum to do that work and so what I wouldinvite your audience to doum is if they are so inclined to make adonation to the Texas Bitcoin Foundationwhere 501c3 it's fully tax deductibleinstead of giving more money to thebmoth of the state perhaps give it to acharity that is doing this researchbecause what we'd like to do next yearis put on events that areinterdisciplinary where with historiansanthropologists sociologists politicalscientists economists bringing peopletogether across the political divideswithin Academia itself because it's notjust the broader Society like the socialsciences are often completely you knowpolitically different from the hardsciences and so we need to have thesetheoretical conversations and we'regoing to start small you know we'regoing to have some some small events inAustin but if we can raise you know eventwenty thirty thousand dollars likethat'll help get these Scholars here andhaving these right conversations sotwenty thirty thousand dollars whatfunds you for how long or funds oneevent yeah it'll fund you know one eventokay maybe two events okay well we'llmake a donation oh well of coursefantastic so um give us the detailsafterwards uh and we will support whatyou're doing yeah uh I've Loved thishonestly I absolutely love this andDanny Danny said to me a while ago wasthis the one you're most looking forwardto on the trip I think so yeah yeah hewas like he was like I cannot wait foryou to
