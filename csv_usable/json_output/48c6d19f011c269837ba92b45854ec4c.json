globalizingdigitizing societyand then we havefiat introducedand where does that take ussoif i can't use goldi need i'd need money that's going to bestronger andfaster and smarter sowhat is an example of stronger moneywell i'm in london i have a hundredmillion dollars worth of money i need toget it to roami need to get itto roam on a telegramor i need to move it to rome at thespeed of a single horse and i can't haulthat much goldsoi use a letter of creditright if i if i can project moneyvia some credit network whether it's therothschilds networkor it's an imperial network or somethingelsethen i've got stronger money and i'vegot faster moneyandif i canif i can offer you that moneyin return for three percent interest itbecomes smarter moneythe smarter meaning i created anapplication that does somethingcomplicatedlike when i give you money for 30 daysand at the end of 30 days you have topay it back to me plus 4i created a derivative rightof the base layer moneyor a security of sortsso the ability to create securitiesand the ability to project themdistances with speedenables a more sophisticated economyand is good for economic productivitysohence the idea of a fiatand i you know i think the earliestfiats were yeah they could liketrading stations you know in frenchin the french territories of canadarightthey had credits you know credit systemson ships merchant credit systemsthere's there have always been privatecredit systemsand then eventually there becamemunicipal credit systemslike the mayor of the city state orsomething or mayor of a hamlet and thenyou get to statewide systems and federalsystems andagency systems andwho knows whether or not churches didn'tgenerate their own credit systemsand we know when the military themilitary generates credit systemsyou know sometimes they you know they'llcredit vouchers or travel vouchers inthe militaryor writei remember umyou knowi remember the airlines used to give youthese uh these tickets where you couldfly space availableand they would give them toum uh to their employees like flightattendantsso the fight attendants are able to usethat and give one to their wife orhusbandand they sell those things thereactually became a secondary market andtravel vouchers yeahand because they have monetary valueyeah and so you have um your privatemonies and you have public monies andthen you havequasi public monies for many you knowany kind of food stamp or institutionalvoucher or military voucher that givesyou a right to something of valuebecomes moneyin and of its own in timeso the real question iswhatwhy does fiatfailwe know why it worksthe reason it works better than goldis because you put on a piece of paperand ultimatelythe rise of databases along with theability to shuffle paper around meantthat you couldit's a lot easier to create anapplication of fiat base layer money byall i got to do is take a check everytime i write a check i created anapplication rightheypay robert breedlove 797 dollars and 52cents doing thatand a fiat standard takes about20 secondscreating792 dollars and 27 cents of goldis impossible for all but one anda hundred thousand people yeah and wouldtake a dayyeah so it's pretty obvious why it worksbecauseyou can create applications fasteryou can create morebeautiful complicated applicationstypes of credityou can move them around fasterandand you cantravel with them further distancesandalso uhthey don't invite violence to the samedegreeum for exa you know very famous exampleof a private moneyuh that was created uh in my youthwas american express travelers checksand i don't know if you rememberamerican express traverse checks theyactually became popular before thecreditcard if people were going to travelinternationallyand you were going to go to someplace they would say well you knowbefore you go you should convert yourmoney into american express travelerschecksi mean literally this is a big businessand and the number one use case was thatway if you lose themor they're stolenyou can get them replaced[Music]it was like i guessthe idea was you were less likely uh tobe robbedif you're carrying the traveler's checkit's likean analog multi-sig maybe something likethatyeah like a multi-signature version ofmoney or wrapped money yeahand american express made all theirmoney because people would buy a hundredmillion dollars of travelers checks andonly redeemed 95 millionand there was the float and then therewas the unredeemed amount and that wasthe that was the difference and sopeople used to be very umthey were very excited about these sortof thingsi mean a traveler's check is almost likea derivative of a derivative right righti mean the paper money is on top of thegold or or itself although now i guesspaper money is just base layer money andthe traveler's check was on top of thatand people like that idea and i supposecredit card is just another example of afiat applicationand the idea is you know you send yourkidyou would send your kid on vacation witha credit cardfeeling comfortable that you couldreload the credit card if they ran outof money but if your kid said you knowdad i need 25 000in cashjust in case i have an emergency and ineed a i need emergency appendectomy orsomething like thatlike there's no way you want themtraveling with that and of course theycouldn't even get across the border withten thousand dollars of cash right tryit rightsoso 99of the world has more than 10 000dollars that they could put on thecredit cardbut nobody can take 10 000 in cashso the fiat standard is appealingbecause of the portability of thepurchasing power and because it doesn'tinvite violence if someonesteals your credit card you could cancelthe credit card they stole your travelschecks you could cancel the traveler'schecksthings like thatand i was like make sure you write downthe serial numbers of your traveler'schecks right yeah yeah yeah all of thesethingsso but why doesn't it work in the in themodern erai mean the fundamental problem is westart with inflation againthe government can create more of it buthere the inflation problem is not aminor problem like gold is a majorproblem right instead of getting aguaranteed two percent inflation with anoccasional 20 percentyou get a guaranteedi think sephidine suggested the numberwas more like 10 or 11 percentguaranteedseven percent guaranteed in the u.smore in other countries so you'regetting a guaranteed inflation ofsomewhere between seven and elevenpercent a yearand you're getting a occasionalinflation of 30 percent or 40 a yearyepso the base layer protocoldoesn't work so well right it's uh it'snot conservativeright and and uh so if you havea sharedledger that's not conservativeright it's it's collapsing andand that ratesyou know the there's just nothing i iyou know i said to people there's noengineered machine or structure thatworks with that degree of error orinflationif if you had a two percent leak in yourgas tankover what period[Music]rightif you're leaking two percent a day yourcar won't workand uh and so leakage of your swimmingpool or a balloonoror any kind of electrical system or anythermodynamic system at alljust doesn't work without much leakageso the inflationironically right inflation impliesyou're getting more but reallyit's uh dilution in a wayit's guaranteed pollution or depletionso that number the first problem withfiat is it's just depleting energy attoo rapid a rateif we if we just said 10 a year onaveragethen a system which is losing 10 percentof its energy every single year almostone percent a monthit's kind of a crippling first orderproblem on the base layer right it'salmost like building on uhif i'm building on sand and the sand wassinking10 feet a yearright what structure can you buildrightright when you when you're building onsomething you want to build on graniteand you want the minimum deflectiongranite doesn't deflect steel doesn'tdeflect sand and clay def deflectsswampland deflectsso the problem that we start with is thebase layer is collapsingthe second problem of the fiat standardis confiscation as the government canseesthey can seize your currency or they canseize the assetumand you know to a lesser extent otherpeople can seize iti mean you can'tif you carry your cash around rightthere's that the famous uh image ofpablo escobar you know sitting andburning hundred dollar bills to staywarmif you can carry it around someone witha gun can seize it so that's a problemif you don't carry it aroundthen the counterparty that you trustedit with generally the bank can seize itand in all cases generally thegovernment can seize itand so these are threefundamental defects with the fiatstandardyour property rightsare weakunder the confiscation risk yeah andyour property is defective because ofthe constant inflation you literallybought swamp land in florida that'ssinking it's it's worse than that rightbecause swampland doesn't sink foreveryou know it's pretty much as bad as it'sgoing to getthis is worse than that because it justkeeps getting worse and worse and worseyeah yeah righti mean the thirdsorry just to insert one thing here thisthere's like a conundrum of money herewhere this is the the tool or theeconomic medium that's intended to betrust minimizedso you can put your wealth there and youdon't need to trust anyone else it'slike a safe place to park wealthbut to get thatit's you come with all these limitationsof gold historically so to pick up thesestronger faster smarter qualities ofmoney it comes with the cost ofcounterparty riskso it's like the conundrum is gold youcan you know trust nobody you don't needto trust anyone but you can't reallytrade with anyone because of all of itslimitations or you can use fiatin which you need to trust a lot ofcounterparties but you can trade with alot of people so there's this this kindofconundrum we've been stuck betweenhistorically and bitcoin is like theanswer right it's the collapse ofcounterparty risk yeah we go fromheavyweightindestructible money that's a brick thatis too heavy to pick up off the floortolightweight cotton candyyou know which iswhich isreally easy to move aroundbut ultimately not satisfying and blowswith the winwith time yeahand i mean and the counterparty risk youknowis the explanation for inflation rightthe government's inflating it and thecounterparty riskis the root problem with confiscationbut you know again even if you had yourcash in your pocketyou don't have counterparty risk in thenear term but what you do have is aninvitation to violenceand and it's too difficult to move itthen then you've gotcounterparty risk in the form ofhypothecation which is the third problemwhich is you put your money in the bankyou know maybe they won't steal itbut they're making more of it rightbecause they're loaning it out with areserve ratio of 10 to 1 1 to 10 or 1 to20 and so you put a million in the bankand they create 10 million more whichdilutes your millionso the hypothecation is is the thirdfailing of a fiat standardthe fourthis the authentication againbecause remember we wanted to actuallybe able to move it distances but youcan't authenticate it over a distance inits bearer instrument form because youcan't pay for something with cash so theway to authenticate it is through acounterparty so i have to put my moneyin a bankthe bank has to issue a credit cardthen i have to input the credit cardinto the websitethen maybe the credit card gets approvedthen i have to do the transaction thenmaybe the transaction gets approved andmaybe it doesn't get approved and itdoesn't cross all bordersit would be impossible to do atransaction via a credit cardyou know with a vendor in cuba ornigeriaor china or i mean all sorts of placeswhereif you cross central banks the creditcards don't cross those jurisdictionsso that that is another way of sayingit's an authentication and atransportation problemright how do i transfertransport fiat currency well how do itransform transport a million dollarsi do you know anyway that any privateindividual that's ever moved a millionin cashover a commercial airlinelikethere's almost a presumptionthat if you had a million dollars ofcash in your luggage that you're acriminal rightisn't that interestingthere's a presumption that if you try todo it yourself it's a bearer instrumentthat you're a criminal and so it's thatwhat we have is we have a monopoly ontransportationthrough the banksyeah but the banks only can really movewithin the central bank networkotherwise they have to cross centralbanksand so the monopoly is at the bank levelthat the central bank level and then thecentral banks answer to the governmentstate departmentsso the central bank of the u.s won't dobusiness with the central bank of cubarightperiodwon't happenso transportationacross jurisdictionis difficult and dangerouswhere it's possible it either worksyou're either in the zone where it'sworking like you're in the us movingmoney between bank of america and groupat 3 p.mon a tuesdayand then maybe it works although thetruth is like i get deniedi try to do little credit cardtransactions between my credit card andmyphonei get denied like a third of the timewhat type of transactionifliketry to move twenty five hundred dollarsto cash appfrom your uh yeahthe bank you know from your bank and thebank might actually stop it yeah oranything like thatyou know if it if it looks like it's ait's a transferyou get all sorts of all sorts of limitson the rate at which you can move moneyand if you want to go to higher volumesif you wanted to move 50 000 or 100 000invariably those are you have to have aperson a trusted banker a human beingthat's calling you on the phoneto move those wires yeahand sothe way that we move large sums of moneyis between nine and five pmwith a trusted banker with a manualauthentication andi mean it feels to me like that hasn'tchanged in 30 years right rightyepso you can't you can't move outside ofthe nine to fiveand you can't do itwithout that trusted banker and youcan'tyou can't cross any kind of technicaljurisdiction or any kind of any kind ofpolitical jurisdictionthat's not in theirfree-fly zonerightand the result of that is that theimpedance to movethat money is extreme so on one sideyeah it might take you 72 hoursand the real cost is hundreds of dollarson the other side if we go back to thecredit card network thoughyou have a monopoly in the credit cardnetwork and the result is there's a twoand a half percent credit card fee rightso where the money does movethere's a two and a half percent feeand uhand that's under the best of cases rightbut the remittance not where it gets upto ten percent sometimesso you've got you've got feesthat range from two and a half to tenpercent if you're lucky you get onethose cash back cardsand so the effective cash back is oneand a half percent or something so theeffective cost is only one percentbut it's 100 basis pointswhich is a huge amount of money insanelylarge amount of money and the networkreally isn't competitive and it hasn'tchanged much in 30 yearsyou know and there's massivefraud chargeback issues and all of theseimpedances you're describing i wouldargue tooare essentially an impairment ofproperty rightswhere in a pure property right youshould be able to send express receivemovemove the asset however you choose butwhen you have to then answer to acounterparty or go jump through thesehoopsor wait all of these things impair yourproperty rights and moneyyeah i would agree with you on that ithink that your propertyyour property is impaired it is taxedand is either taxedit's it's either explicitly taxed by agovernment a municipality a state or afederal government or it's uh privatelytaxed by the money transfer networkthat's charging you a fee to move itaroundand uh that's a challenge sotransportationeither difficult or dangerous or it'simpossible or it's expensivethose are the problems with that andthen that leads to two other realdeficiencies in the fiat standard oneyou've got a lot of credit failuresbecause lots of complex debt is layeredon top of the base layer money andthat's complex debt and creditinstruments with counterparty riskyou knowcheck kiting right check fraud or anyanything like that where someone stoodinto uh to pay lots of fraudand lots of credit failure and thenyou've gotsecurities fraudand i guess with security fraud what imean by that isthere's too many complex applicationsthat are constructed based upon acounterparty's representation to youand there's no way for you totransparently authenticate or or assureyourself thatthat the application is properlyconstructed and properly backed rightright so and and you're destined to havethat someone saysoh we have two billion dollars inreservesbut they don'tbut you don't know they don't and thenthere's a collapse of the securitiesthey issued or the credit or thevouchers or whatever they issuedand so those things are inevitable andthe question is whywhy do you have credit bubblesand then why do you have securitiesfraud on top of the fiat standardand i think the answer if we come backto our baseour our base first principles isthe base layer protocolof fiat is defective the base layermoney isdefectiverightis it a shared immutablecorrectledgerand the answer is no it's not sharedit's not immutableit's not correctyeahright it's a it's aquasi it's an imperfectly uhheterogeneously sharedright uh mutableincorrect ledgerso i guess what you could say is it's aledgerright yeahit's a legendyeahbut it's not sharedit's not immutable it's not correct youknow you don't have final settlement soyou have massive fraud on the creditcard network you have transfers thatdidn't take place that are representedto have taken placeyou have balance sheets that don't existthat are represented to exist yeahyou have you have um you have an issuethere with the base layer the secondproblem you haveis the application layer protocolit's random and manual so the protocolby which i would create applications ofbase layer money like a security is anapplication a credit card is anapplicationall of these thingsare there's no there's no technicalprotocolor it's programmable there's no apiit's a manual protocolso every single bankcreates their ownapplication like a bank loan is anapplication of fiat and every bankexecutes their own set of loans andthey're all expected to maintain acertain degree of reserves rightyeahbut they're auditedand the fact that they have to beaudited uh is proof that they're alljust manually executed and heterogeneousyeah so there's no transparentuhno transparent perfected applicationprotocoland the result of thator the implication of that is that theapplications in the fiat standard haveno integrityright they haven'tthey have no integrity in a mathematicalsense or a technical sense or anengineering senseuh you know a physical metaphor isin the real worldit's i'm standing on solid groundand in the fiat worldmy eyes are closedand someone told me i could take twosteps to the left andi would be standing on solid groundrightbut i don't know that i'm standing onsolid groundumi don't know that i'm a hundred feetfrom the cliff i might be one foot fromthe cliffsomeone told meand i don't have a protocolto ascertain whether it is true or nottrue right and uh and soyou know you could generously saypeople just make mistakes all the time ithought you were ten feet from the cliffand you only were nine and so that's whyyou're deadmaybe it's just an honest mistake rightyeah but then againmaybe it was in my vested interest totell you you wereten feet from a cliffand you were really five feet from thecliff and this gets straight to theheart of bitcoin right where you it'sremoving the need to trust it's you knowdon't trust verifyand the the securities fraud you'redescribingi mean it culminates in the the weaponsof financial mass destruction with thishuge gigantic derivatives marketwhich is reallypremised i would argue largely on thisthis gap we have between trade andsettlement in the fiat system there's nofinal settlement occurring which is theverification mechanismso in that gapwe have an accumulation of hidden riskthat ultimately becomes systemic andlead to giant systemic blow upsand you know to your point there beingno integrity it's like of course there'sno integrity thesei would say the lack of integrity issynonymous with corruptabilityand so not only does it not havemathematical integrity or or financialintegrity but you could ultimately saythere's no moral integrity because thesesystems they just don't hold up tocorruptioni can't take uh i can't take personalcustody of a billion dollars of goldso therefore i trust it to the bankand i take their gold derivativeand i assume that that is base layermoney and i can't take delivery of abillion dollars of currency or fiatso therefore i entrust it to the bankand i take their credit instrument as mybase lawyer moneyandyou could say that what you've got istwo fundamental shortcomings herethat uh that cause these two systems tobreakone isthe base layer protocol is defectivethat you need a base layer protocolwhere you can take final settlementat any scaleyes can you take final settlement of 387dollars can you take final settlement of38 million dollars can you take finalsettlement of 38 billion dollarscan you take final settlement every dayif you can take final settlement at anyscale at any frequencythen you then the underlying goldstandard or fiat standard would havesome integrity at least a modicumthe second problem is there's noapplication protocolso there's no way to create a securityor derivative or some layer twoapplication on top of the layer oneuh monetary tokenwe we need the we need the applicationsright the world needs more than justbase layer money like you need credit oryou want yieldor you want to build an insurancecontract yesor maybe you need to be able to post asecurity depositand you need to be able to get thesecurity deposit back or maybe you wantto put something in trust with amulti-signature arrangement for 37 yearsthere are lots of applications that makethe world workbut there's no application protocolyeah so both in both cases with gold andfiatthe base layer protocol is defective andthe application protocoliseither non-existent or defectiveand what what makes bitcoin specialand what makes it digital moneyisbitcoinbitcoin uh gives you a base layerprotocolto take final settlement and it givesyou an application level protocol tooeitherwe could debate back and forth right isthe application protocol on the basechain the blockchainif so it's a bitcoin transfer or is theapplication protocol on the lightningyou know using a layer too yeah welleither of thoseyou know could be viewed as anapplication protocolyepand uhyou're still maintaining the option forfinal settlement even on lightning rightso i think the core and this is socritical for if people can understandthis that the the anti-fragility of theworld economy even is dependent on thissimple factif we can have higher frequency finalsettlementwe can have more verifiabilityin the economic structure which meansless corruption and less blow upswhereas the fiat system right now is thecomplete reverse of that very lowfrequency final settlement very lowverifiability tons of corruption lots ofblow-upsyeahfinal settlementwith high frequencyumcreates realityyesthat's what the blockchain is rightit's realityyes and umyou know youevery single secondgravity is testing your structureand testing your orientationyou know there's that phrase can youdefy gravityand you know and the answer ismaybe if you're a great athlete for asecond or two rightfor for a very short period of timecan you defy gravity it requiresextraordinary strengthextraordinary agilityand it still comes at great perilright i mean you could try to do abackflip and you can land on your headand you can break your back and you'llbe dead or paralyzed for life within acouple of secondsso there is there is a final settlementyou know it'swhen you look at umif you're considering a crypto assetnetwork like bitcoin and bitcoin is thegreatestmaybe the only successful example butcertainly the greatest example of acrypto asset networkthe uhthe frequencyparameter and the block size parameterfor a crypto asset networkis the equivalent to the space-timeconstantsin our unit in a universesothe frequencythe 10-minute frequency that's how fastthe universe evolvesand the block sizeis the gravitational content how doeshow much mass or what is therelationship between mass and energy andand umhow tightly packed ismatterand uh once you've established those twoconstants you've you've defined theconstants that run the universe righteverything else evolves around those twoconstants if this is why you would neverwant to change thembecause changing them is playing godand you only get to play godoncelike when you start the universeif you change the frequency and theblock sizeof bitcoinyou invalidate all work that's comebeforeright you uhyou imperilall structures that have formed in theuniverse since the beginning of timeyouyou impair every mechanism that's beencreated within that set of structuresyou you impair them and maybe break themand you throw the future into chaosyeah rightall of those things it's i mean itcouldn't be clearer to me but if youwant the physical metaphors like what ifi triplegravityon the surface of the earth right now ifi could snap my fingers and triple gapgravity how many pieces of furniture doyou have that crumple how many chairscollapse right how many people's heartsstop rightrighthow many ships sinkhow many planes flyhow many factories keep workingright stuff breaks not just not justfactories start breaking buildings startcollapsingbridges collapsetires deflateright and and uh and so and the personthat worked for a hundred years tocreate that great company or that therockefeller center and it just crumblesyeahokay so like and so you worked for ahundred years and you did something andit was beautiful until oh it'severybody's dead yeah what what happenedwhile you changed the gravitationalconstant you change the space-timeconstant and therefore the structurewhich had been carefully constructedsince all of eternity forwardthe structure is now rendered null andvoid and it collapsesit's umships are designed based on the reynoldsnumber there's something called a hallspeedand um the hall speed is a function ofthe shape of the hole and that's afunction of of the way that fluid flowsand and these are basic constants and nomatter how fast you push that hole itwon't go any faster because the waterpushes back right as hard as you push itthat's why a 150 foot vessel that's 30foot wide will cruise at 12 and a halfor 13 knots and it doesn't matter thehorsepower of the engine in it yeahit's just the way that the world worksanother example of that is shock wavesand the speed of sound yeah there's areason for the speed of sound i meanit's it's a fundamental constantyou go faster than the speed of soundthen you're moving faster than the aircan move out of the wayyou get a shock wavelots of devastationwhat happens if you change the speed ofsoundbut uh what happens if you what if youchange the speed of light well yeahexactly this is thatso i love this because maybe we'recreating another meme here that bitcoinis the e equals mc squared of moneyand that to your point you only get toplay god once and satoshi did thatsatoshi set the rules umand this you know the strategies webuild based on those constantsthey are dependent on the invariance ofthose constants if you go and changethem that all the strategies that havebeen built up around them collapseyeah yeah like lots like all the theentire bitcoin mining industry it's allpredicated upon bitcoin coming out at acertain speedand the protocol tapering off and thevalue of all transaction fees arepredicated upon the block size if youincrease the block size the transactionrevenues collapse if the transactionrevenues collapse the bitcoin miningprofitability collapses if the bitcoinmining collapses the energy usagecollapse the security collapses thenetwork collapses rightright like uh you you don't you don'tyou know what's what's going on withsome of the proof of stakers is if youflip from proof of work to proof ofstake you destroy your entire miningindustry rightif you destroy your entire miningindustryall of the security all the socialpolitical economicthermodynamics security collapsesif it collapses you know the integrityand the durability of the moneycollapsesthere are all sorts of second orderthird order fourth order consequencesto thisand fund now the fundamental basis ofintegrityisone has to know thatgod is not going to change the rules onyouif you spend your entire life working onsomething right if you want to drivepeople insane change the rules like if ijustyou knowyou know i changed the speed of lightand the speed of sound and i quintuplegravity beforeyou compete in the olympics and thenwhen your competitor starts competing iturn i dial down gravity to the moongravity and they jump 180 feet in theair and they beat youright and then and then what happensnext you're like well that guy had moongravity and i had saturn gravity and myknees are my legs are broken and my hipsare broken and i'm lying on a gurneywith an iv in my arm and my heart'sabout to stop and the other dude isbounding over the stadiumdoesn't seem quite fair okay and at somepoint when the when the gods toy withyou like thatthen you say well i'm not going to playthis game anymore right rightexactly and and uh people withdraw fromthe ecosystem it's like what would youdo other than run as hard as you couldaway froma random universe that wanted to killyou rightwe're back of coursesorry we're back to the originalintroduction ofimmutability how important that is formoneyi've said this before but i think whatthe way you're articulating here reallyunpacks it is it this is really whatbitcoin's doing it's radically changingthe worldby virtue of being unchangeableit's like the first unchangeable set ofrules we've ever had so it's causing usall to reorient our strategieswhereas fiat is a constant changing ofthe rules so you talk about drivingpeople insane that's why we're going madin the world with every election cycleyeah you could arguewith every political appointee yesthere i mean because i could evenappoint a different head of the fedtomorrow rightand i would get whateverthe immutabilitythe immutability of bitcoin though is umit's an emergent propertypeople would say there's nothing that'sabsolutely immutable like short of beinggod it's not absolutely immutable it'san emergent property but as bitcoinbecomes more decentralizedthe uhi guess the thermodynamic inertia of thething increases and it becomes moreimmutable yeah when there were a hundredholders it was something when there wasa million it was more immutable whenthere's 100 million there's moreimmutablewhen the bitcoin mining spreads furtherwhen the holders spread further whenthere are more institutions andorganizations and jurisdictions holdingthe more it spreads the more immutableit gets and and thereforethe higher to give confidence you canhavein the integrityof the entire thingsothat you know that that is what'sinterestingaboutthis entire phenomenai mean i i've define i've kind ofdescribed it as a fire in cyberspace butbut you know a better metaphor mightvery well be a monetary virusin cyberspace rightit's a it's it's a living creatureand we can go back and forth over whatkind of live living creatures it's aliving creature that's uhmassivelymassively decentralized massively faulttolerantthat's got a genetic uh genetic codeand it's uh it's a swarm creature rightit's it's genetically reproducing itsdnaand uh the the more it reproduces themore it uh it spreads the the moredecentralized it gets the moreimmutableright it gets the more vitalit gets and the stronger it getsand it's therefore paying us to live insymbiosis with it that's how it'sgrowing right it's just it's paying orincentivizing everyone to interact withits network favorably whether you're aminor a holdera developer everyone's aligned with thesuccess of bitcoin by virtue of itsincentive designyeah it's like it's some kind ofswarmcloud of truthlivingthe living truth nebula yesthat's allsorry i tweeted this out the other day ithought you might like it thebecause fiat i think is suchit's the opposite again it's like acloud of self-deception you know wethink we can just print more money andmake things okay paper overpass mistakesand the remedy to self-deception uh i'vebeen talking to this guy john vervickyhe says is wisdomso you might say it's this cloud swarmoforganism of wisdom as well too thatwe're getting back to the principles ofmoneyyeahuhextraordinary thingextraordinaryand to outsiders we sound crazysothe human race tried with metal moneyand then it went on to fiat moneyand uh and then we invented uh computersand then we put them on a networkand then we perfected cryptography andand uh so once weonce we checked off the computer box thenetwork box and the cryptography boxthen you had all the components youneeded in order to createa crypto asset networkyeah or and that's what bitcoin is rightmaybe not the first but the firstsuccessfulcrypto asset network that thatemerged as the ideal technology formoneyall right guys that was episode 11 ofthe sailor series and this episodei think sailor just did an amazing jobofgoing through fiat currency point bypointexplaining its history its emergenceand really all of its failings uh at avery detailed levelsoi think the simplest way to understandthis again if we get back to thatoriginal definition of money one of theoriginal definitions of money isas a device for expressing value acrossspace and timeandwe know gold historically was selectedthrough this free market process as thebest asset for storing economic valueacross timebut due to itsphysicality its bulkwhich effectivelycaused it to have technologicallimitations as money right it could notadequately express value across spaceweas a species were forced to abstract itinto a currency to try and augment itsportability to try to make it better fortransacting across spaceand uhyou know thisgave us a lot ofadditional functionalityum but it also came with a lot of riskyou know the biggest of which is we wentinto is counterparty risksoas sailor puts thisyou know weby abstracting gold into currency wegain another enoughwe gain a lot of advantages right thehardersmarter faster strongermoney umis is able to becaptured at a fiat currency layerbecause we can do additionaluh technological things to it at thatlayer that you can't do with gold rightgold's just the shiny dumb rock itdoesn't have apis it's not programmableum it cannot becannot be beamed through atelecommunications networkwhich you know if we're looking at moneythrough that ideal lens again thisspread immutable truthful spreadsheet inthe skygold is just very limited in thatrespect soone of the thingsabstracting and currency did was itallowed us to have smarter applicationsum smarter here meaning thatit would allow you to generate yieldon your savings or on your assetsand this is in fact this is the originalpurpose of banks right so aspeople would accumulate savingstypically in in gold or silver you wouldcustody that money with a bank for acouple of reasons one to secure yourstash right you didn't want to keep itin your home the economics of securinggoldactually were favorable to centralizingits custody to a central counterpartyand twoyou could then optionallyas a saver right you have savings youcould optionally let the bankmatch your savingswith a borrower so an entrepreneurperhaps trying to go out into the worldand create some new project or add valuethey could then borrow your savings atinterest which would allow you to earn ayield on your savingsso this was somethingthis this maturity matching function andrisk matching function is somethinghistorically provided by banksand again this this was due to the uhthe custodianship of money that banksprovidedsothis you knowthat's what led us into and that's why ithink this is the best way to thinkabout banks is it's a money warehouseright this is actually how it emergedoriginally is we had thesecentralized custodians that were justwarehousing the money and issuingwarehouse receipts that were redeemablefor money redeemable for goldand it allowed us to have all of theseextra features but the problem was theneed to trust the counterparty as we'vecovered before sothat paper certificate that wasredeemable for goldactually becamea debt-based money right it is athe paper itself is not the money it'snot the instrument of final settlementit is a claimi'm sorry not a claim it's a call optionon the money so you can take that papercertificateto the bank and call your money liketake possession of the goldandwhat this does though and the thepernicious thing about this is that youget into this sequence of deferredsettlement so every time you and i tradethis paper note in a transaction whichagain is much more portable much moretransactable much easier to doin day-to-day transactions especiallythan physical goldwe are not actually settling withfinality i haven't actually given youmoney i've given you a call option tomoney and it's only when you take thatto the bank and redeem the actual moneythat you have been settled with finalityyou have no more debt on your balancesheetso this is a very importantaspect to understand about currency andfiat currency especially is that it is adebt based instrument if it cannot beredeemed for money then it is not moneyit is a money substitute effectivelyand when we went off the gold standardin 1971that's what put the globe onto this fiatcurrency standard that is now anirredeemable debt certificate right thedollar is not redeemable for gold oranything else it's a pure confidencegame or pyramid schemeand that's why things from asocio-economic standpoint have come offthe rails since 1971.soyou know it's it's pernicious because wedidn't have another option it's like wehad gold or we hadcurrency which added all this featureset to money but came with this thisreallyreally potent form of counterparty riskthat you know and many times throughouthistory wiped people out you know peoplehad their entire savings wiped outum either through inflation or outrightconfiscationsoanother advantage of these you know andsay the point that these debt basedinstruments they're actually they changethe incentives to violence somewhat andhe gave the example of amex travelerschecksin thatyou didn't have to walk around with thisbearer asset money right like gold coinsif they were stolenthere was no mechanism to uh to reversethat that involuntary exchange of theftbut if you had something like an amextraveler's check which is one of theolder fiat applications effectivelyum you would always write down theserial number on your amx travelerscheck so if you took them travelinginternationally and they were lost orstolen for some reasonyou could then contact the counterpartyin this case american express providethem with the amex travelers checknumber and then they would re-instateyour traveler's checkand i'm not completely sure on all thedetails of that system but that was thepurpose essentiallyand you know it's kind of like if you'rethinking about this to a bitcoin lensit's kind of like an analog multi-siguhbut the counterpartywith a multi-sig you choose who holdsthe shards of the key this would be kindof a centralized multi-sig model wherethe counterparty isnot only are they monetizing the floatso that would be all the funds providedto it before they were redeemed you knowthey have a time value of moneyumbusiness opportunity there and they alsoi think sailors said they only redeemedor about five percent of the funds wentunredeemed so that would effectively befree money to the counterpartyso thatkind of highlights the advantages anddisadvantages of credit based money andfiat applications more generallybut this i mean the maintheme here i think is thatcredit based or debt based money fiatcurrency this was athis was very important for aglobalizing society we needed highvelocity money to satisfythe needs of a globalizing marketplacefranklysothen we got intothe major problem of fiat currency whichis a component of this counterparty riskwe've been discussingand that is inflation right this isit is a monstrosityin the world economy and i don't thinki'm overstating it umit'sthe termwe've been conditioned bykeynesian propaganda and traditionaleconomic curriculum to think that it's anormal part of economic activitybut it is in fact nothing more thanarbitrary reallocation of resources tosay it nicelyviolation of property or theft to say itmore accurately in my opinionandsailor you know in his engineeringmindset he describes this as the errorrateand i think in the usroughly when you look athow much inflation we've suffered in thedollar historically it's been aroundseven percent on averageand abroadtends to be a little bit more like 10because you get the not only the usdollar inflation but also the inflationof the other uh the weaker currenciesthemselves sothis isan error rate and a rate of theft that'sbeen integrated to our monetary systemfor a really long time and theconsequences of thisare really bad and i you knowagain as sailor says there's noengineering system in the world thatwould tolerate such a high error rateuh or another way of saying this is likeleakage of energythat thisinstrument that is designed to expressvalue or energy across space and timeis just bleeding out andeven when it's not being transacted evenwhen it's just being held and stored forfuture use it's just bleeding outand this isyou knowyou could imagine if you were trying tobuild a house or something and the thevalue of the meter was constantlyin flux right constantly being dilutedor deterioratedthat it would just makeplanning really difficult and that'ssort of what we have with money today wewe lacka universal metric system or somethingcomparable in the sphere of money welack an engineering standard for moneyand that's really what bitcoin is rightit is this first universalmetric system or value system for moneyand it can't be violated it can't bechangedand this is very important forharmonizing human action at scaleand this you know the other perniciousthing about inflation is thatit's nominally deceptive because youthinkokay my house was worth four hundredthousand dollars now it's worth fivehundred thousand dollars i'm richer butwhat's actually happened is it that unitofeconomic perceptionmoney right as we're using it as a unitof account function it's integrated intoour mental softwareit's actually been depreciated so you'reyou're perceiving the value of your homethrough a diminishedaperturethat is what's happened you're notactually richer the dollar is actuallyworth less and this has just beenthe most simple yet brilliant illusion ithink ever perpetrated as people justthink they're getting something fornothing all the time via inflation whenin fact the opposite is true they'rebeing robbed constantly in broaddaylightumit's it's it's a bitter pill to swallowbut i think when you really come to seeitas it is um[Music]it's an important awakening i think formost peoplesoyou know it has this nominal deceptionwhere you think things are gettingmore valuable but what's in factoccurring is there's a destruction ofvalue in real termsand the second order effect of this isprice signal distortioni've talked about this separately butagainwhen entrepreneurs are unable toproperly conceive or perceive of theworldthen they're led into a misallocation ofcapital so they'llyou may think that you could borrowmoney at a certain rate and then executea project at a higher with a higherexpected rate of return and net thedifferencebut what this fails to account for isthe inflation itself so when theentrepreneur borrows and then he goesout and tries to buy inputs for hisbusinessthe inflation starts to manifest itselfthe cost of inputs increases and all ofa sudden thesebelieved to be profitable projectsbecome unprofitableand thisthese cumulative misallocations ofcapital caused by fiat currencyinflation this is the boom and busbusiness cycle that we all think iscompletely normal and it just happens wehave these gigantic economic crisesevery 10 or so yearsthis is a direct consequenceof manipulation in the market for moneyby central banks but full stopthere's always volatility there's alwaysumyou know errors in the market but themarket is what clears errorswhen we paper over the errors umin the marketplace we're interruptingthe evolutionary process the errorclearing process of markets and we allowthe errors to grow much larger and muchmore significantand it's just very disastrous all theway aroundand so thisyou know it's effectively a non-solidfoundation and this is kind of the coremessageyou never want to build your house onsand right so why would you want tobuild your civilizationon a fluctuating currency on anon an uncertain rule system right wecannot even developa strategy around it because you don'tknow what the rules are going to be youdon't know what the money supply isgoing to be you don't know what theinterest rate's going to be you don'tknow how much more it's going to changein the futureand this you know the great example hereisuh wittenstein's ruler who said a longtime agoif you measure a table using a rulerand you can't trustthe reliability of the ruler then you'renot sure if you're measuring the tableor you're measuring the ruler you getinto this domain ofcompleterelativism whereeverything is only evaluated to the lensof something else there's no absolutestandard by which to evaluate somethingand again you know it'swe would never accept this in the realmof spatial or temporal measurement rightif this if the value of the second orthe hour fluctuated randomly based onsome central control board or the valueof the meter or the mile it would justwould make no sense and it would throwall human cooperation into totaldisarray yet that is exactly what wehave in the market for moneysoit's really bad fiat's really bad youknow it's just not worth the trade-offsevenumthat we made for it right uhsothe other problem with fiat is thatconfiscationis enabledyou know the counterparties or thecurrency issuers in this casethey can just confiscate property veryeasily very cost effectively so insteadofa government for instance having to gooutinto the world and directly explicitlyvisibly violate the property rights ofan individual homeowner right likecoming to their house kicking them outperforming imminent domain or whateverit may bethey can instead just print moneyand again so long as everyone's caughtup in this spell that printing money issomehow a net positiveand they don't ask too many questions orpush backthen government can just get away forwith us for a very long time yet it isin fact the same thing right they areagainallocating themselves this call optionon property called moneyandexternalizing all of the inflationarycoststo property holdersso it is it again it's not it's nothingmore than a violation of property rightsit's justdone in a much less visible fashionbut therefore done at a much largerscale because people don't see it orunderstand it enough to push backagainst itsothis kind of leaves us in a conundrumright so we have this conundrum of moneywe talked aboutyou can have gold which is a trustminimized asset holds its valuereally well over time because its supplyis relatively predictableyet it comes with extremely hightransaction and security costs so tomove gold over time you know move goldacross spaceor even to secure gold in a vault overtime like the costs are very high andthe costs tend to scale with the amountstoredsothat causecauses market actors to then wantto amortize that cost into a centralizedcustodian so this develops a businessmodel for centralizing goldso then we get currency or or you knowlater fiat currencywe get all these advantages of loweringthe transaction cost of gold we'veincreased its portability across spaceso now we have a high velocity money butwe've we've assumed now we've given upsome some attributes of gold and we'venow assumed the interpersonal trustand counterparty risk that comes withcentralizing the custody so theconundrum is we're stuck betweendo we want to express value well acrosstime with gold or do we want to expressvalue well across space with fiatbut each onecan't do the opposite right gold doesnot express well across space fiat doesnot hold its value over timeso we're stuck between these two worldsand you know historically we just didn'thave a good option we've just hada boom and bust in civilization drivenby this technological conundrum betweengold and currencyandyou know the other problem withfiat clearly is the hypothecation issuesohypothecation and rehabilitationessentially means re-borrowing orreusing collateraland this is also called in the bankingsystem the money multiplier effectso if a banktakes in 100 of depositsright that is a liability to theircustomer they owe their customer 100but if they then in turntake say that and this is a premise onthe reserve ratio so typically it'saround 10 right now it's at zero percentwhich is a real problemwith the 10 reserve ratio banks are thenallowed to take90 of the 100100 liability the money they owe theircustomer and they're able to loan thatto another customerso they've effectively increased themoney supplyuh by ninety dollars so the money supplygoes from 100 to 190and then this same effect repeats fromfrom bank to bank and thatyou know you get into these moneymultiplier effects where the originalone hundred dollars in deposits can beexpanded even on a ten percent reserveratio in 10 plus x so a thousand dollarssay increase uh increase to the moneysupplyand thisjust injects a lot of leverage into thesystem so we again we're amplifyingthe boom and bust business cycle we'recausinguha perceptual disturbance in the economicsystem that actually causesumthe accumulation of hit and risk andblow-upsuh it's really bad right you're we wecould very simply think of leverageas a tool that that amplifies gains orlosses right so if you bet correctlywith leverage you can have outsizedgains if you bet incorrectly withleverage you can get liquidated andwiped outso it's it's nocoincidence that when we start injectingleverage into our monetary systemwe polarize the outcomes rightwe've hadthe stock market up seven percent yearover year for a decade straight rightjust seems like really strong economicgrowthbut what we're not seeing is whatpercentage of that growth is actuallyjust the dollar being diminishedand then in year 10 or around about thenyou have a correction back to economicreality which is like a 2008 type eventor even a march 2020 type event so we'rewe're doing this to ourselves right it'sthethe corruption and the undependabilityof money that's injecting these hiddenrisks into the economic system this isnot the natural order of the worldwe are doing this to ourselves throughthe corruption of moneyand the other problemfiat introduces isthisauthentication problem right soif you want to move money especially uhfirst of all you can only move it withinbusiness hourswhich is a painyou can only move it within certainjurisdictional boundsumthere's typicallylarge fees to move larger amounts ofmoney so the expense of moving moneyscales with the amount moved there aredelays right if they don't know if thebank questions the counterparty you'resending the money to then they may delayyouum it could be days could be weeksthere are the possibility of accountclosuresso all of thisall of thesestricturesin in the market for money in the systemof liquidity these are effectivelylimitations on your property rightsso again property like this is the basisof civilization if youown property free and clear you can dowhatever you want with it right so longas you do not transgress against theproperty of others yet in the bankingsystem we tolerate this impairment thatsome overlord gets to decide when youget to move your money how you get tomove your money they get to askquestions you know who is this companywho are theyum this gets into all the problems ofkyc and aml like it's it's honestly justone giant scam right it's onegiant mechanism of attempted top-downcommand and control over your propertyso this is a a force that iscountervailing to civilization itselfyet we tolerate it as if it's the normand it'shard to believe things have gotten thisfar especially in the 21st century wherewe consider ourselves to be so advancedumso in this dynamic you know centralbanks and banks effectively become thedeputies of governmentthey're constantly checking on who'smoving money where and determining youknow if it's if they're good actors orbad actors but all of thisis relevant to the aims of thegovernment itself and you know onemanifestation of this is the censorshipyou commonly see and this takes place inmany parts of the worldumin the interface layer between bankingand crypto platforms so many people havereported this trying to send their moneyonto an exchange to buy bitcoinumthey're often getting censored orthey're getting their bank accountclosed or they're getting delayedand this is just because again you don'thaveabsolutecontrol over your property when it's inthe bank right you have an iou from thecounterparty and all of a sudden whenyou go to redeem that which when you buybitcoin it's at it's equivalent tobeing in a bank in the you know early20th century and taking your dollar intoredeem gold you're basically swappingyour money substitute for real moneybut this again shows you where the banktries to stop you from doing thatbecause they have a vested financialinterest in keeping you in their custodyright where they get to control you andprofit from youthat's a real problem right this is alimitation on propertyand therefore is a de-civilizing forceand i meanlikeit's your money right it's your moneyyou sacrifice your time your mostpersonal property which is yourself andyour time your skills your ingenuityyour know-how you sacrifice thatevery dayto obtain this moneyokay that's property right and money themost important property right we haveoutside of our own control of ourselvesis moneywe put it inside of an institution wherewe do not have complete control over itso we are sacrificing and servingthis panopticonuh this this institution that impairsour property rightsand when you start to think of it likethat it isit's quite mind-blowing in my opinionsoi mean the point here is that the baselayer of fiat currencyis defective right it's subject topolitical whim they can violate yourproperty at willand then importantly it doesn't scale umyou know it's got a lot of fraud builtinto itumwhich is basically an unsound substratefor human civilizationand then we start to look at theapplication layer i think sailor made agreat point about this the base layer isdefective but then we roll up to theapplication layerit's not automatedlike each little bank is performing itsown manual review process they they'rebecause they're running their ownprocesses the base layer is defectivethey can't communicate on a standardprotocolso it does not scale it's a veryinefficientmonetary systemand you know nick zabo wrote a greatpiece on this umi forget the title of the piece but ifyou just google nick zabos-z-a-b-oand his term that he coined socialscalabilityhe talks about the importance of scalingsystems where we needto be able to create systems thatconduct important operationswithout us having to allocate humanbrain power to every movement rightthat's how we scale as a civilizationwhen we can systematize importantoperationsand then free ourselves to go and focuson other aims that we can't systematizethat's how we scalethat's how we economize and that's howwe create wealth in the worldthe entire layer of banking isantithetical to that processit's anti-entrepreneurial it'santi-civilizationit's destructive um and this is why youknow a lot of people use that parasitehost analogywhich i think is very apt you know it'sjust a rent-seeking group siphoning welloff off of productive economic actorsand you know withoutengineering standardsyou can't have apis so the applicationlayer itselfnot only does it not scale but itdoesn't interact right you have theselittlesilos of applications which you you willhave noticed depending on what banksyou've used they all kind of have theirown custom thingand without thatthe the application there lacksintegrityright there's nomechanism through which to settle theapplication layer into final settlementright the fiat dollaris incapable of final settlement it hasdebt and counterparty riskintegrated into itand that risk is being constantlyrealized through inflation so thegovernment is effectivelygoing through a slow motion default ofits debt through inflation so it's justprinting money to pay off its debts andkeep itself sustainable pushes that costonto society so everyone and this is soimportant becauseyou work depending on your tax brackettwo to six months out of the yearfor governmentyou work to pay for governmentthat's your direct tax bill right that'syour say twenty to fifty percent umeffective tax rate depending where youare in the world i mean everyone's gottheir own coefficientthis does not account for the factfurther that the currency is beinginflated and that inflation is beingused to further tax population sowithout an ability to settle withfinality right to get out of dollarsinto something that can't becan't steal from you into a money thatcan't steal from youthat you're just being further andfurther subjected to this economictyrannyand so in that sensethis is why we talk about the differencebetween deferred settlement and finalsettlement final settlement is truthright final settlement meansyou have received an asset that is 100equityand 0 liabilityand this is the equation in accountingby the wayassets this is your balance sheet assetside of your balance sheet equalsliabilities plus equitysofor a dollar you have asset side equalsa percentage of liability which is allof this counterparty risk you assumeplus a percentage of equity that youhavebut with bitcoin or physical gold youhave an asset that is zero percentliability it's a bearer assetwhich means 100 of your asset valueis equity value in your hands the ownerright it's a full and robust propertyrightand soyou know this mec to have a mechanism offinal settlement is what keepsan economic system honest and thisreminds me of the oldbuffett quotewhen the tide goes out you see who'sswimming naked right somany actors can do really well when themarket's moving up and you're borrowingand reborrowing and reinvesting andeverything's uh againdebt amplifying your gains but when thetide goes out and pulls back it's thosewho havestrong equity positions so strongbalance sheets or or um are in asolvent positionthat do welland an instrument of final settlement ora money that's pure equity is completelynecessary to be in that positionumand that's what is so different aboutbitcoin is thatyou know gold was a great instrument forfinal settlement but it could not beconductedat high velocityand for the first time with bitcoin wehave a system that can settle anywherein the world to the base chain this isthis is ignoring lightning network andother features that accelerate itfurtherwe can perform final settlement anywherein the world typically within an hourso what we have now is a moneyon which to build our economic systemthat is capable of conducting highfrequency final settlementwhich is to say high frequency truth orhigh frequency verifiability all rightthis is this isback to the ethos of bitcoin don't trustverify i don't need to trust theindividual i can just trustthe bitcoin network that the transactionand the money has been verified whenit's sent to methis createsan anti-fragileeconomic systemwhereas fiat is the exact opposite ofthis rightwe have no final settlement not even lowfrequency it's not even possible youcan't even settle outside of the dollarsif you're purely within the fiat systemso you just have deferred settlement ontop of deferred settlement just gettingjust expanding with more and more hiddenriskuh as the economy booms and then when itbusts it's it's cataclysmic rightand you know so no final settlement lowverifiability and therefore extremelyhigh fragility and that is whatthe economic system especially since1971 has been characterized by extremebooms extreme busts extremely highfragilityand this has real consequences in thelives of peopleand it's all rooted in this right it's apoorengineering standard it's a non-wellthought out systemof economic activity and it literallycan be fixed right this is why we allsay bitcoin fixes thissoyou know to finishbitcoin is changing the worldby virtue of being unchangeableit's a really big phrasebut to sailors pointif you want to drive people insane justconstantly change the rulesand you know this intuitively right ifyou walk into a poker room at a casinothe the hand rankingsin the poker game and the rules and therake and all these different uh aspectsof the gamethey don't change right you needinvariant rules in a game so thatplayers can develop strategies andcompete with one anotherif the rules change then all of a suddenthe incentives are twisted towards wellhow do i control the rules and bend themto my favorand that's exactlywhat fiat is fiat is a constantlychanging set of rulesdriving the world insane and causing themostunscrupulous among us to fight forcontrol over the rules so they canbenefit from this free lunchsothis is whyi am so passionate about education andshowing this for what it is right we arewe are doing this to ourselves this fiatcurrency isself-deception at scaleandif wisdomis that which allows us tocleanse ourselves of self-deception atthe individual level then i would arguethat bitcoin is the wisdom of moneyright it's something that it's atechnology that prevents us fromdeceiving ourselvesby thinking we can print money to solveour problemswhichif no other lesson of history has beenlearned that one has been learned sostrongly so repeatedlyand so in that way you know bitcoin isjust this absolutely invariant rule setand that's why it's suchhaving such an impact on the world it'sforcing everyone to adapt theirstrategies to these unbendableunbreakable rules right you see it atthe individual level we're seeing it uhmost recently at the corporate levelright with companies like like sailorsmicrostrategy adding bitcoin to theirbalance sheet anticipating futureadoption because they understand thesedynamics very fundamentallyand that same dynamic will be playingout at the nation-state sovereign worldfund and central bank levels as wellbecauseall of what all these things have incommon right is they're all strategiesright life is a strategyorganizations are a strategy organismsare a strategy communities are astrategy and what do they dothey adapt tothe rules that best favor theman invariant rules that you can dependon for consistency over time are themost favorable rules to play byso in this way bitcoin isinducing everyone to play its game overtime and that's why it wins that's whyit's such a big deal and that's why it'san answer to the insanity being inducedby fiat currencysoi hope you enjoyed this this was againepisode 11 of the sailor series we'vegot more coming down the pipe i'll seeyou guys back here again soon[Music]",
