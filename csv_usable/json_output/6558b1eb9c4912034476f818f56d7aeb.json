It’s a\nmindset of abundance and fairness, a new way of looking at value—value in\ngeneral, but digital value in particular.\nIt is hard to put a finger on the V4V lifestyle, but one could summarize it as\nfollows:\n\nNo expectations\nNo entitlement\nNo bullshit\n\nIt is a trust in the universe and its people, a trust that if you produce something of value, people will find it valuable and give back. If you ask them, that is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV4V\n\n\nHome\n\n\nContribute\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSomething missing? Found a typo? Open an issue on GitHub.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
