importantto us this is an example of what you canorder through your computerit combines the power of your computerwith the convenience of your telephonewe saw that information technology couldcreate a 1984 style tyrannical top-downcontrol society or it could develop intosomething that is a decentralizedenabler of human freedomand even back then our dream was toenable the future of human freedomin the late 1980s at the dawn of theonline age a group of young computerscientists in silicon valley startedgrappling with what this new technologywould mean for society we took a look atthe potential of computer systemsand saw that for everything aboutcivilization that enables it to work wecan enable it to work much better themost influential figure in what wouldbecome the cypherpunk movement was thephysicist tim may who envisioned thefuture internet as a place for what hewould dub crypto anarchy wherelawbreakers radicals and politicaldissidents could shield their activitiesfrom government surveillance and controlpeople doing things that didn't requirepermissions from anyone because thepeople were untraceable it couldn't bestopped but there was another group thatsaw the potential of computers to remakesociety gradually from within bydecentralizing commerce and improvingthe dissemination of knowledge they weredubbed the high-tech hiaquids becausetheir worldview was influenced by thework of austrian economist friedrichhayek the fundamental insights ofhayeking economics was how separatelyformulated plans tend to mesh well andwe saw electronic media as aenabler of coordination

horoscopes or go shoppingyou can buy items from department storesranging from nordstrom's to neimanmarcus all via computer screensalen whose outlook was shaped by hiscareful reading of hayek understood thatthese services weren't merely acuriosity or a digital version of theold mail order catalog they were thebeginning of something that had thepotential to one day erase nationalboundaries

companyand had co-authored a congressionalstudy critical of nasa's wastefulspending but in his view there wascontinuity between his interests inspace travel and computing because inboth industries technology's purpose wasto drive down the transaction costs thatimpede human activity making it feasibleto explore new frontiers and interact inways that would otherwise beprohibitively expensivenow thanks to breakthroughs in computingthe ability to buy or obtain exactly theinformation you need when you want it inthe form you want it is about to explodeat a speed unmatched since the inventionof printingbut salen was foremost an entrepreneurand in the mid-1980s he set out tolaunch one of those platforms for buyingand selling informationhe called it the american informationexchange or amex this business thatwe're doing is to make possible a newkind of thing which is being able to buyand sell informationonline amex was a radical idea in themid 1980s users could buy or sell adviceabout the real estate market writingsoftware or what companies to invest innow you can say to somebody so it's likeebay or like priceline or like amazonwhen we tried to explain this to peoplethey simply couldn't get it they couldnot wrap their heads around this some ofthem i think couldn't imagine thecomputational end of it milton friedmandidn't get it though it was similar inways to the online marketplaces thatwould launch a decade later amex wasmore than just an idea before its timewhat set it apart was its grounding inpolitical philosophy and its lofty goalof elevating individual decision makingover central planning it was aninstantiation of austrian economicsnow put into code and put onlinesomething like this could have profoundhuman consequences and that was thevisiona fluid

fascinatingemergent social behavior amex's chiefarchitect was the pioneering softwareengineer chip morningstar who had comefrom a stint at george lucas'sproduction studio where he oversaw thecreation of habitat which was one of thefirst online virtual communities afterjoining amex morningstar co-authored anessay which argued that in building aworld in software detailed centralplanning is impossible the world is justmore complicated people are morecomplicated you cannot know what alltheir goals are what you can do is youcan put them into an environment inwhich certain kinds of things arepossible what you can't do is tellpeople what they wantphil sale and mark miller and chipmorningstar's ideas about how a futureinternet could decentralize societyinspired tim may to first articulate aradically different vision may who wouldgo on to become the most influentialfigure in the cypherpunk movement wasintroduced to salem by morningstar indecember of 1987. chip said there's thisguy out in santa cruz that you ought totalk toas a scientist at intel may had solvedan issue affecting the reliability ofthe company's memory chips called thealpha particle problem rich on stockoptions he'd been spending his days atthe beach reading science fiction novelsthinking about how networked personalcomputers could turn some of theirfuturistic scenarios into reality so imet with phil in redwood city and hedescribed how amex would work and i saidpeople aren't going to be sellingmeaningless stuff like surfboardrecommendations in may's view amex couldbe useful as a tool for underminingstate power but only by shattering legaland social norms i said it's going to becorporate information it's going to bebomber plans for the b1 bomber who wantsto buy that a competitor a company whowants to sell that someone who hasaccess to that information it's twodifferent types of libertarians hedidn't understand the extent to whichyou could benefit the world by loweringtransaction costs for everybodylike salem in the high-tech kayakiansmay saw the personal computer asenabling technology for sweepingsocietal changes but he had a differentvision of a virtual marketplace for anyand all goods and services which hedubbed blacknet or a technological meansof undermining all governmentson amex user activity was out in theopen but black net would be imperviousto government tracking and surveillanceand perhaps it would be a network withno owners at allmany people's first response would be tosay that black net won't be allowed tohappen perhaps but technology wouldprobably make it inevitableif you don't physically meet the personif you don't even know what continentthey're on you can't coerce themtim may's a smart guy he you know he wasgreat forhoning our ideas and technologiesagainst but you know i think him as sortof the shock jock for uh cypherpunksi want to live in the world thatsurrounds us rather than try andconstruct one from scratchwe saw this as emerging from inside theworld and carrying the world along withitin 1988 amex was acquired by thesoftware giant autodesk a growing sceneof young technologists came togetheraround salem and the high-tech kayakiansall working towards a common vision ofenhancing human freedom throughnetworked personal computing it was thishot house of ideas from which a worldview was brewingsalem died of cancer in 1991 the sameyear that the world wide web becamepublicly available but his intellectualcontributions and conflict with may hadlaid the groundwork for what would comenext for the cypherpunks the long effortto build a self-sovereign and anonymousform of digital money and the embrace ofa branch of mathematics calledcryptography which they came to view asthe key to personal liberation on theinternet[Music]the title of the book is the rise of thecomputer state what i'm saying is thatlarge bureaucracies with the power thatthe computer gives them become morepowerful and that they are escaping thechecks and balances of representativedemocracyin 1983 the new york times reporterdavid burnham warned that theintegration of computers into everyaspect of daily life could lead to alevel of automated surveillance unknownin any previous age for society tochange course burnham argued citizenswould need to rise up through thedemocratic process and demand new legalprotections to safeguard their privacythere are ways to deal with it we havedone it and all i hope is that we're onour toes enough andalert enough tosee them and go after them this is justpolitical jaw boning a few years later aphysicist named tim may argued thatputting faith in representativedemocracy was naive he believed thatonly innovation could save us from theorwellian state the interesting thingsthat had happened had been technologicalchanges the telephone copy machine thevcrcomputersmay became a co-founder of thecypherpunk movement which came togetheraround the idea that a recentbreakthrough in the field ofcryptography was the key innovation forcombating tyranny comparable to how thecrossbow enabled individuals to go upagainst medieval armies it's an epiphanyit's like standing on top of themountain and seeing that this is outtherecoming up reason takes a look at how onecommunity came to see cryptography as apowerful weapon for defeating bigbrother here's part two in a four partseries on how the cypherpunk movementanticipated the promise and the perilthat lay ahead when the internet upendedthe world[Music]in the late 1970s there was anastonishing breakthrough in the field ofcryptographyi saw this as the critical fork in theroad for the future of human freedom ireally didin the summer of 77 mark miller was a 20year old student at yale working for acounter-cultural tech visionary namedted nelson like many future cypherpunkshe would learn of this groundbreakingdiscovery when the august issue ofscientific american arrived at his doorand i'm reading[Music]i'm reading martin gardner'smathematical games column i just getincredibly excited just incrediblyexcited i call up ted in the middle ofthe night and i tell ted we can preventthe ministry of truthas gardner told his readers a discoveryhad been made that would revolutionizethe entire field of secret communicationit was the work of teams ofmathematicians and computer scientistsat mit and stanfordincluding a young researcher namedwhitfield diffieif you look at1791 at the moment of the bill of rightsimpenetrably private conversationsdominated what the framers didn'tforesee is that private communicationwould happen via computers sendingmessages across the world that couldeasily be intercepted public keycryptography gives you a mechanismwhereby you can recover this ability tohave an impenetrably privateconversation between two peoplelook at this a cipher well let's go backto the office and get started on itsending a secret message used to involvetranslating words through a secret codethat spies in government agents couldpotentially crackphili think i've got it goodzis dvis e anyone sending and receivingmessages also had to have a copy of thesecret key or translation device justlike the decipher rings collected byamerican school children starting in the1930s here's how you can get one foryour very ownfirst get a jar of chocolate flavoredovaltine public key cryptography madedecoding devices unnecessary andfiguring out the pattern effectivelyimpossiblethe big breakthrough was an easy tosolve mathematical formula that youcould funnel words into just as easilyas dropping them through a trap doorbut if you flip the problem around andtried to pull the message out the otherside in that direction the formula wasalmost impossible to solve such thateven a super computer trying randomnumbers would need 40 quadrillion yearsto service the answer but the person whoset up the mathematical formula ortrapdoor held the answer to the problemor secret code making it possible forthat person to retrieve the originalmessageit could also be compared to the mostubiquitous trapdoor system for sendingmessages consider a mailbox anyone canthrow a letter in a mailbox but only themailman who has a key can take it outanyone in the world could set up one ofthese equations serving as the mailmanof his or her very own impenetrablevirtual letterbox and because thatindividual could prove ownership of themailbox by opening it with the onlyknown key public key cryptography alsomade it possible to set up a provableidentity on the internet completelydisconnected from any real-worldpersonal informationknowing economics what you do andlooking at what's happening with theinternet what do youwhat can you see happening way out therein the future the most strikingnon-obvious thingis that current technologies are in theprocess of giving us a level of privacywe have never had before essentiallythere are nowwell-knownways available in free software ofencrypting messages so that only theintended recipient can read them so thatif the fbi intercepts them it'sgibberish to themone way of reading the second amendmentis that it was a way of making sure thatif the government tried to suppress thepeople the people would win and themilitia wouldn't be very good but itwould outnumber the professionalsin the modern worldthe weapons that the army has differ bya lot more than they did in the 18thcenturybut i also think that if you look atwhat politics are like nowadays the realwars between the government and thepopulation are information wars notphysical wars encryption means that theycan't arrest you they can't blackmailyouryouryour key people can't do any of thethings governments might doto make sure that public information iswhat they wantedmeanwhile the u.s intelligence communitywas doing everything in its power tokeep this new tool out of the hands ofthe public well somebody once said to meif you think new directions had animpact on the outside world you shouldhave seen the impact it had at nsain part three in this series we'll lookat the u.s government's effort to haltthe widespread use of public keycryptography by threatening criminalprosecutionand the legal and public relationsbattle waged by one founding member ofthe cypherpunks for freedom of speechand software[Music]a hurricane of unrestrained joy sweepsthrough every part of a war sick worldthe breaking of encryption was essentialto the war effort[Music]england would probably have fallen ifthey'd not been able to read the enigmamessages because every time the germanssent bombers the raf knew where theywere sending them and could mass theplanes there to defend if anysignificant fraction of those attackshad gotten through england would havebeen much more helpless may well havefallen in the world course of world warii may have changed and that is theorigin of the regulations that said thisis a munition this is an item of war andthe problem was they didn't really takefreedom of speech freedom of inquiryacademic freedom into account in thatbut on the matter of encryptionterrorists are going to have these arelaw enforcementand get vital information i think that'sthe same choice coming up the story ofthe us government's long battle to keepstrong encryption out of the hands ofits citizens and how first amendmentactivists fought backhere's part three in a four part serieson how the cypherpunk movement of the1990s anticipated the promise and theperil that lay ahead when the internetupended the world[Music]in 1977 researchers at mit made anastonishing discovery a mathematicalsystem for encrypting secret messages sopowerful that it had the potential tomake government spying effectivelyimpossiblebut before these mathematicians couldpublish their research the nsa made itclear that doing so could land them infederal prisonthe u.s government considered thesemathematical systems modern weaponstechnologies and distributing them was acrime under the international trafficand arms regulations mit halted plans todistribute the paperi decided quite literallythey are going to classify this over mydead bodymark miller was a 20 year old student atyale who had read about this discoveryin scientific american so i traveled tomit managed to get my hand on a papercopy of this thing i went to a varietyof different copy shops so i wasn'tmaking lots of copies in any one place isent them to home and hobbyist computerorganizations and magazines all acrossthe country and i gave copies of thepaper to some select friends of mine andi told themif i disappearmake sure this gets outearly in 1978 the u.s federal governmentbacked off and decided to allow thepublication and the world has been on adifferent course ever since it gotpublishedbut the crypto wars were just gettingstarted in the late 70s the nationalsecurity agency declared theunrestrained public discussion ofcryptographic research threatened ournational security the privatecryptography community and thegovernment have been sparring over theissue ever sincemarshall mcluhan said that one day wewould all live in a global village wellthe global village has arrived and itsmain street is called the internet theinternet also created an electronicsurveillance apparatus there was likenothing the world had ever seen whichmeant that the cryptographybreakthroughs of the 1970s were nolonger a rarified topic they wereprivacy salvation internet users couldshield their online activities fromspying and that sent the intelligencecommunity once again scrambling to stopthe dissemination of this powerful toolin 1991 a software developer named philzimmerman released the first relativelyeasy to use secret messaging systembuilt with strong encryption which wascalled pgpsomehow it got overseas now that it'sover there people are using it and i'mdelighted to hear good stories about howit's used in places wherethere are oppressive governments so theu.s justice department launched athree-year criminal investigation ofzimmerman on the grounds that by makinghis software accessible outside thecountry he could be guilty of exportingweapons under the arms control actmeanwhile the national security agencyargued that zimmerman's software wouldbe used by child molesters and criminalspgp they say is out there to protectfreedom fighters in latvia said thensa's general counsel but the fact isthe only use that has come to theattention of law enforcement agencies isa guy who is using pgp so the policecould not tell what little boys he hadseduced over the net child pornographersterrorists money wanderers take yourpick these are the people who will beinvoked as the bringers of death anddestruction well it's true it's trueit's trueso they're rightyesbut all technologies have had badeffects the telephones allow extortiondeath threats bomb threats kidnappingcasesuncontrolled publishing of books couldallow satanic books to appearthe cypherpunks argued that pgp was likeany other published material becauseunder the hood it was just a series ofinstructions to be carried out by amachine restraint on freedom ofexpression of software writers isanathema in a free society and aviolation of the first amendment wrotethe economist and entrepreneur philsalen in a 1991 essay titled freedom ofspeech and softwareencryption can't be controlled whetheror not it's powerful or has impacts onthe government because it's free speechin the early 90s john gilmore who was aco-founder of the cypherpunk movementrisked going to jail in his campaign toforce the government to acknowledge thatregulating encryption violated the firstamendment we basically had a communityof a thousand people scattered aroundwho were all trying different ideas onhow to get around the government to getencryption to the masseswhat we're afraid of several years fromnow is the terrorists both hit theirencryption button on the telephone andeven though we have access we can'tunderstand what they're saying on areal-time basis the clintonadministration told congress thatamericans have no constitutional rightto choose their own method of encryptionand push for legislation that wouldrequire companies to build in amechanism for law enforcement agenciesto break in we're in favor of strongencryption robust encryption we justwant to make sure we have a trap doorand a keyunder some judge's authoritywhere we can get there ifif somebody is planning a crime thecypherpunks look for ways to undercutthe government's case by pointing outthe similarities between encryptionsoftware and other forms of protectedspeechwith phil zimmerman under federalinvestigation for making his softwareavailable for download outside the us toprove a point he convinced mit press tomirror his action in the analog world byprinting out the pgp source code addinga binding and shipping it to europeanbookstores the government knew if theywent to court to suppress thepublication of a book from a universitythat they would loseand they would lose in a hurry therewere people who actually got encryptioncode tattooed on their bodies and thenstarted asking can i go to a foreigncountrywe printed up t-shirts that hadencryption code on them and submittedthem to the government office ofmunitions control can we publish thist-shirtultimately they never answered thatquery because they realized to say nowould be to invite a lawsuit they wouldlose and so the best answer was noanswer at all talk a little bit moreabout encryption technology no nothank youi i hesitate even to make use the wordbut i'm not using it any more wayin 1996 the justice department announcedthat it wouldn't pursue criminal chargesagainst phil zimmerman and major courtvictories came when two federal judgesfound that encryption is protected bythe first amendment the crypto wars arestill ongoing what we won in the firstround was the right to publish it andthe right to put it in mass-marketsoftware but what we didn't actually dois deploy it in mass-market softwarenow there are major companies buildingserious encryption into their productsand we're getting a lot of pushback fromthe government about this we're aboutthe rule of law but we don't want tocreate spaces that are beyond the reachof the law in the united states rightit's not just the reprehensible behaviorof sexual predation on children butmyriad additional forms of serious crimeenabled by end-to-endencryptioni'm not optimistic that privacy willprevail in the crypto warsit's an ongoing strugglein the early 90s at the same time thatgilmore was fighting his legal battlefor freedom of speech and software thecypherpunks were exploringcryptography's potential in the contextof collapsing political borders and therise of liberal democracy part four inthis series will look at how thosedreams turn to disillusionment the deathof the cypherpunk movement and itsrebirth following the invention ofbitcoinyou're looking at this and going wowwouldn't it be amazing if this workedand then you realized oh my gosh it doeswork national borders are just speedbumps in the information super highcryptography is really really strong wecan do whatever we want people mightprovide the equivalent of whatgovernment does in a decentralizedfashion i talk about collapse ofgovernments i think we actually saw thatin the middle ages probably as a resultof the printing pressthis is the story of a community ofscientists mathematicians philosophersand activists who believe that theinternet combined with recentbreakthroughs in the field ofcryptography would upend society andusher in a new era of sovereignindividualismwe have it in our power to begin theworld over again right now and it'sinternal clash over the optimal path toachieving that goal can evil be donewith this technology yesand so what so then deal with ithere's the final installment in afour-part series on the origins of thecypherpunk movement and how it helpedshape our modern world[Music][Music]we see a free world that has achieved alevel of prosperity unprecedented in allhuman history mr gorbachevtear down this wallif you had asked me 10 years ago is itpossible that communism could collapseby the year 1992 that i would have saidabsolutely ridiculousthe fall of the berlin wall wasimportant to me because i thought it wasthe end of history and that nationalborders would cease beingthe walls ofprisonsand so a couple years later when idiscovered the internet i thought ohthis is part of this pattern whereborders and distance stop being barriersto peoplethen i discovered a wholeclan of people who self-identified ascomputer peoplefound my tribe and among that clan wasthe cypherpunk's mailing listif you want to subscribe to our mailinglist send a blank email message and justsay subscribe cyberpunks and what is acypherpunk what do you guys stand forcyberpunks are cryptography activiststhe cypherpunk's email list whichstarted in the fall of 1992 one yearafter the launch of the world wide webbecame a gathering place for a globalcommunity interested in usingcryptography to allow individuals tocommunicate and transact on the internetprivately and without interference froma central authority in the last 20 yearsthe basic techniques to do all sorts ofimpossible seeming thingshave suddenly emerged put them intopractice many cypherpunks were inspiredby the work of the computer scientistdavid chong who demonstrated that it waspossible to use cryptography to build ananonymous payment network that ran onthe internet because of the cypherpunksand because of the science papers ofdavid chom i thought the third thing isgoing to happen is economic freedom thatpeople are going to be no longerconstrained by national borders anddistancefrom cooperating and sharing resourcesandhelping each other but at this watershedmoment of collapsing borders there was adivide within the cypherpunk communityover whether these cryptographic toolswould lead to more individual freedomfree trade in the spread of democracy orthe end of government altogether thecypherpunk movement's most influentialfigure was the physicist andintellectual provocateur tim may whocoined the phrase cryptoanarchy he sawthe fall of the berlin wall as evidencethat the societal institutions we takefor granted could collapse in shortorder just as they had in the middleages we saw the little principalitiesthe monarchies the religious the papalstates we saw those collapse probably asa result of publishing printingmay penned a one-page summary of howcryptography would upend society so ijust sat down at my little macintosh andloosely patterned this after thecommunist manifesto the spectre ishaunting the modern world the specter ofcrypto anarchycryptography is really really strongwe can be protected from anythingwithout fromthe observers from the watchers from theimposers of the past upon the futurewe're trying to createmay was skeptical of the idea thathumanity was witnessing an unabashedvictory of economic and politicalliberalism or that it was possible toovercome tyranny through collectiveaction as the political scientistfrancis fukuyama argued we as humanbeings want to be recognized with acertain dignity this is the essentialdriving force behind democraticrevolutions whether they take place ineastern europe or in asia or in latinamerica may embraced a technology-basedtheory of historic change summed up bythe movement's tagline which was coinedby the mathematician eric hughescypherpunk's write code what eric meantby cypherpunk's right code is don't beone of those guys who goes to alibertarian party conference and sitsabout getting somebody elected to thelos gatos city councilthat way lies madnesswhereas the interesting things that hadhappened had been technological changesthe telephone the copy machine the vcrthe philosophy that i really gotinterested in is that you don't just goand ask the regulator oh we need moreprivacy online we go fix it arguing andcomplaining and lobbying and politicshave nominal effect on what changes theworld is technology adoptionandyou know society movingshifting spew pointsfor crypto anarchists like may writingcode meant building systems foranonymous transactions on the internetthat made the arbitrary divisions of thepolitical world irrelevant nationalborders are just speed bumps on theinformation super highwayonline cryptographic networks would bestructured like a geodesic dome a formhailed by the counterculturaltechnologists of the 1970s for being inharmony with nature and highly resistantto external attack networks with noowners with many interconnecting nodesthat would be basically unstoppablein a geodesic market economics will nolonger be the handmaiden of politics thecypherpunk writer robert hettinger notedand nation-states will eventually be asceremonial as modern-day constitutionalmonarchs this idea of a many to manyconnection was clearly going to happenbut it was much easier to build afunctional network for cooperation andtrade when you can rely on a centralauthority to enforce the rules how canweuse this weird crypto technique to solvethis strange esoteric little problemthat in the real world you just solvebecauseoh i know what your social securitynumber is or you have to have your youknow government issued id that you knowyou take into the bank so you can openup your bank account and they can linkthe two together and say okay if jimmccoy walks out on this hundred thousanddollar loan well we know where to findthem i was trying to deal with thoseproblems you can buy and sell propertyin cyberspace using cryptographicprotocols the idea of ways in whichpeople might provide the equivalent ofwhat government does in a decentralizedfashion tim stole some ideas from mymachinery of freedom and he reprocessedthem with all this technology and then istole them back a function of governmentthat was particularly hard to replicateusing cryptography was the issuance ofmoney the cypherpunks attempted to builda borderless internet currency system asanonymous as cash and that like goldheld its value without the backing of acentral bank gold makes very good moneybecause nobody can manufacture more ofit very readily pretty mildly rightwhereas bits are perfectly copyable soturning bits into good money is quitedifficult tim me and many othersconsidered electronic cash to be theholy grail because it completed thepicture a private and decentralizedmonetary system may argued was a keycomponent in constructing a newborderless world where the activitiesand assets of individuals would beresistant to government control andconfiscationyou don't physically meet the person ifyou don't even know what continentthey're on you can't coerce them[Music]but there was another faction within themovement that rejected tim may's visionof cordoning off a new world incyberspacethe high-tech kayakings were people likeeric drexler mark miller phil salemthey were focused on designing securecomputing systems based on economicinsights particularly those of theaustrian-born nobel prize winnerfriedrich hayek instead of building anew virtual world shielded fromgovernment interference the high-techhayekians sought to use technology todemolish walls and divisions within theexisting worldthey imagined that introducing new toolsfor human coordination would graduallyerode the government's ability toimpinge on our freedoms we did lots andlots of fantasizing about how the worldcould be different but we saw this asemerging from inside the worldcryptography was a tool for portingeconomic concepts and legal structuresonto the internet but the aim was tofoster new forms of peer-to-peercommerce and knowledge sharing and thehigh-tech kayakings believe that evenimperfect systems can transform societygradually from withinthe overall arc of world history istowards rule of law towards lesscorruptible systems ifthe emergence of the world of cryptocommerce creates systems that are vastlyless corruptiblebut under a whole mix of differentmechanisms and governance regimessuch thatthey're not always everywhereuncorruptablei think that's finethere's a lot of power in providingpeople tools such that they cansuccessfully start to act more like youwould like them to as opposed to you'vegot to come over here where it's reallyhard edge encrypted and it works exactlythe way we want no no you know let'slet's you know raise people's levelsincrementally and and that's animprovement in the worldfor many cypherpunks the darker side ofcryptoanarchy was epitomized by thewritings of the chemist and electricalengineer jim bell a participant on theemail list who in the midcompared aggression by the state to thatof muggers rapists robbers and murderersand posited a cryptographicallyprotected marketplace in which anonymousindividuals could in effect pay to havegovernment employees killed with thegoal of destroying the statein 1997 bell was arrested and went toprison for among other things dropping astink bomb on a government building timmay distanced himself from bell'swritings and activities whilemaintaining that marketplaces forassassination like the one bell haddescribed might be both inevitable anddesirablecan evil be done withthis technology not just the internetbut especially the crypto part of it yesand so what so then deal with itand zimmerman once told methat he sometimes regretted everintroducing pgp to the world because itcould be used by al qaeda or the talibanor whatnoti say so whati'm not morally responsiblewould have happened whether we hadexisted or notbecause technology has its own logicand people want to do what they want todo i meanthey want free [ __ ]they want freedom to do things even ifthey say this should be regulatedthey'll oftenmake the conscious decision to copymusiccopy videotapes they want to seeblack net is a negative consequence i'mnot interested in creating thatwhen you build technology to solveproblems then you create then there arethere are consequences that we try tothink ahead of and look at and figureout how we might address and get aheadof the the downsides of what we buildand that's responsible development andwe certainly engaged in that andand and and talking with tim may and andputting on that you know what if i was ablack cat kind of thing was certainly auseful foilfor working through those kinds of ideasbut that's absolutely not whatcypherpunks wereso the progress of the spread ofdemocracy you know if you take asufficiently long-term view of it hasbeen reallyquite remarkableour dream was to enable the future ofhuman freedom and we had this bizarreconfidence about how the future wouldunfold and to you know using alan cave'sfamous phrase to have a huge hand ininventing itbutthe road had a lot moreweeds and detours than we could haveanticipated when we first launched wewere hoping for you know maybe 400 500people now we're at 100 000 people sowho knows where we're going using theever-growing storage capacity of serversbelonging to companies like googleinstead of it being on your server underyour desk that stuff is being taken careof for you professionals keep track ofall the programs and who doesn't want asimpler life i find this way of workinghalf a gigabyte of information on yourcustomers what do you do with that theywant to know everything about you sothey can sell

directiongovernment is not a monolithic thingwhich is your enemy it's a multitudinousthing which is your enemyour dream was to enable the future ofhuman freedom in the early 1990s a groupof mathematicians misfits hackers andhobbyists came together around a sharedbelief that the internet would eitherdemolish artificial walls or lay thegroundwork for an orwellian state we canprevent the

importantto us this is an example of what you canorder through your computerit combines the power of your computerwith the convenience of your telephonewe saw that information technology couldcreate a 1984 style tyrannical top-downcontrol society or it could develop intosomething that is a decentralizedenabler of human freedomand even back then our dream was toenable the future of human freedomin the late 1980s at the dawn of theonline age a group of young computerscientists in silicon valley startedgrappling with what this new technologywould mean for society we took a look atthe potential of computer systemsand saw that for everything aboutcivilization that enables it to work wecan enable it to work much better themost influential figure in what wouldbecome the cypherpunk movement was thephysicist tim may who envisioned thefuture internet as a place for what hewould dub crypto anarchy wherelawbreakers radicals and politicaldissidents could shield their activitiesfrom government surveillance and controlpeople doing things that didn't requirepermissions from anyone because thepeople were untraceable it couldn't bestopped but there was another group thatsaw the potential of computers to remakesociety gradually from within bydecentralizing commerce and improvingthe dissemination of knowledge they weredubbed the high-tech hiaquids becausetheir worldview was influenced by thework of austrian economist friedrichhayek the fundamental insights ofhayeking economics was how separatelyformulated plans tend to mesh well andwe saw electronic media as aenabler of coordination

technology's purpose wasto drive down the transaction costs thatimpede human activity making it feasibleto explore new frontiers and interact inways that would otherwise beprohibitively expensivenow thanks to breakthroughs in computingthe ability to buy or obtain exactly theinformation you need when you want it inthe form you want it is about to explodeat a speed unmatched since the inventionof printingbut salen was foremost an entrepreneurand in the mid-1980s he set out tolaunch one of those platforms for buyingand selling informationhe called it the american informationexchange or amex this business thatwe're doing is to make possible a newkind of thing which is being able to buyand sell informationonline amex was a radical idea in themid 1980s users could buy or sell adviceabout the real estate market writingsoftware or what companies to invest innow you can say to somebody so it's likeebay or like priceline or like amazonwhen we tried to explain this to peoplethey simply couldn't get it they couldnot wrap their heads around this some ofthem i think couldn't imagine thecomputational end of it milton friedmandidn't get it though it was similar inways to the online marketplaces thatwould launch a decade later amex wasmore than just an idea before its timewhat set it apart was its grounding inpolitical philosophy and its lofty goalof elevating individual decision makingover central planning it was aninstantiation of austrian economicsnow put into code and put onlinesomething like this could have profoundhuman consequences and that was thevisiona fluid

fascinatingemergent social behavior amex's chiefarchitect was the pioneering softwareengineer chip morningstar who had comefrom a stint at george lucas'sproduction studio where he oversaw thecreation of habitat which was one of thefirst online virtual communities afterjoining amex morningstar co-authored anessay which argued that in building aworld in software detailed centralplanning is impossible the world is justmore complicated people are morecomplicated you cannot know what alltheir goals are what you can do is youcan put them into an environment inwhich certain kinds of things arepossible what you can't do is tellpeople what they wantphil sale and mark miller and chipmorningstar's ideas about how a futureinternet could decentralize societyinspired tim may to first articulate aradically different vision may who wouldgo on to become the most influentialfigure in the cypherpunk movement wasintroduced to salem by morningstar indecember of 1987. chip said there's

loweringtransaction costs for everybodylike salem in the high-tech kayakiansmay saw the personal computer asenabling technology for sweepingsocietal changes but he had a differentvision of a virtual marketplace for anyand all goods and services which hedubbed blacknet or a technological meansof undermining all governmentson amex user activity was out in theopen but black net would be imperviousto government tracking and surveillanceand perhaps it would be a network withno owners at allmany people's first response would be tosay that black net won't be allowed tohappen perhaps but technology

cancer in 1991 the sameyear that the world wide web becamepublicly available but his intellectualcontributions and conflict with may hadlaid the groundwork for what would comenext for the cypherpunks the long effortto build a self-sovereign and anonymousform of digital money and the embrace ofa branch of mathematics calledcryptography which they came to view asthe key to personal liberation on theinternet[Music]the title of the book is the rise of thecomputer state what i'm saying is thatlarge bureaucracies with the power thatthe computer gives them become morepowerful and that they are escaping thechecks and balances of representativedemocracyin 1983 the new york times reporterdavid burnham warned that theintegration of computers into everyaspect of daily life could lead to alevel of automated surveillance unknownin any previous age for society tochange course burnham argued citizenswould need to rise up through thedemocratic process and demand new legalprotections to safeguard their privacythere are ways to deal with it we havedone it and all i hope is that we're onour toes enough andalert enough tosee them and go after them this is justpolitical jaw boning a few years later aphysicist named tim may argued thatputting faith in representativedemocracy was naive he believed thatonly innovation could save us from theorwellian state the interesting thingsthat had happened had been technologicalchanges the telephone copy machine thevcrcomputersmay became a co-founder of thecypherpunk movement which came togetheraround the idea that a recentbreakthrough in the field ofcryptography was the key innovation forcombating tyranny comparable to how thecrossbow enabled individuals to go upagainst medieval armies it's an epiphanyit's like standing on top of themountain and seeing that this is outtherecoming up reason takes a look at how onecommunity came to see cryptography as apowerful weapon for defeating bigbrother here's part two in a four partseries on how the cypherpunk movementanticipated the promise and the perilthat lay ahead when the internet upendedthe world[Music]in the late 1970s there was anastonishing breakthrough in the field ofcryptographyi saw this as the critical fork in theroad for the future of human freedom ireally didin the summer of 77 mark miller was a 20year old student at yale working for acounter-cultural tech visionary namedted nelson like many future cypherpunkshe would learn of this groundbreakingdiscovery when the august issue ofscientific american arrived at his doorand i'm reading[Music]i'm reading martin gardner'smathematical games column i just getincredibly excited just incrediblyexcited i call up ted in the middle ofthe night and i tell ted we can preventthe ministry of truthas gardner told his readers a discoveryhad been made that would revolutionizethe entire field of secret communicationit was the work of teams ofmathematicians and computer scientistsat mit and stanfordincluding a young researcher namedwhitfield diffieif you look at1791 at the moment of the bill of rightsimpenetrably private conversationsdominated what the framers didn'tforesee is that private communicationwould happen via computers sendingmessages across the world that couldeasily be intercepted public keycryptography gives you a mechanismwhereby you can recover this ability tohave an impenetrably privateconversation between two peoplelook at this a cipher well let's go backto the office and get started on itsending a secret message used to involvetranslating words through a secret codethat spies in government agents couldpotentially crackphili think i've got it goodzis dvis e anyone sending and receivingmessages also had to have a copy of thesecret key or translation device justlike the decipher rings collected byamerican school children starting in the1930s here's how you can get one foryour very ownfirst get a jar of chocolate flavoredovaltine public key cryptography madedecoding devices unnecessary andfiguring out the pattern effectivelyimpossiblethe big breakthrough was an easy tosolve mathematical formula that youcould funnel words into just as easilyas dropping them through a trap doorbut if you flip the problem around andtried to pull the message out the otherside in that direction the formula wasalmost impossible to solve such thateven a super computer trying randomnumbers would need 40 quadrillion yearsto service the answer but the person whoset up the mathematical formula ortrapdoor held the answer to the problemor secret code making it possible forthat person to retrieve the originalmessageit could also be compared to the mostubiquitous trapdoor system for sendingmessages consider a mailbox anyone canthrow a letter in a mailbox but only themailman who has a key can take it outanyone in the world could set up one ofthese equations serving as the mailmanof his or her very own impenetrablevirtual letterbox and because thatindividual could prove ownership of themailbox by opening it with the onlyknown key public key cryptography alsomade it possible to set up a provableidentity on the internet completelydisconnected from any real-worldpersonal informationknowing economics what you do andlooking at what's happening with theinternet what do youwhat can you see happening way out therein the future the most strikingnon-obvious thingis that current technologies are in theprocess of giving us a level of privacywe have never had before essentiallythere are nowwell-knownways available in free software ofencrypting messages so that only theintended recipient can read them so thatif the fbi intercepts them it'sgibberish to themone way of reading the second amendmentis that it was a way of making sure thatif the government tried to suppress thepeople the people would win and themilitia wouldn't be very good but itwould outnumber the professionalsin the modern worldthe weapons that the army has differ bya lot more than they did in the 18thcenturybut i also think that if you look atwhat politics are like nowadays the realwars between the government and thepopulation are information wars notphysical wars encryption means that theycan't arrest you they can't blackmailyouryouryour key people can't do any of thethings governments might doto make sure that public information iswhat they wantedmeanwhile the u.s intelligence communitywas doing everything in its power tokeep this new tool out of the hands ofthe public well somebody once said to meif you think new directions had animpact on the outside world you shouldhave seen the impact it had at nsain part three in this series we'll lookat the u.s government's effort to haltthe widespread use of public keycryptography by threatening criminalprosecutionand the legal and public relationsbattle waged by one founding member ofthe cypherpunks for freedom of speechand software[Music]a hurricane of unrestrained joy sweepsthrough every part of a war sick worldthe breaking of encryption was essentialto the war effort[Music]england would probably have fallen ifthey'd not been able to read the enigmamessages because every time the germanssent bombers the raf knew where theywere sending them and could mass theplanes there to defend if anysignificant fraction of those attackshad gotten through england would havebeen much more helpless may well havefallen in the world course of world warii may have changed and that is theorigin of the regulations that said thisis a munition this is an item of war andthe problem was they didn't really takefreedom of speech freedom of inquiryacademic freedom into account in thatbut on the matter of encryptionterrorists are going to have these arelaw enforcementand get vital information i think that'sthe same choice coming up the story ofthe us government's long battle to keepstrong encryption out of the hands ofits citizens and how first amendmentactivists fought backhere's part three in a four part serieson how the cypherpunk movement of the1990s anticipated the promise and theperil that lay ahead when the internetupended the world[Music]in 1977 researchers at mit made anastonishing discovery a mathematicalsystem for encrypting secret messages sopowerful that it had the potential tomake government spying effectivelyimpossiblebut before these mathematicians couldpublish their research the nsa made itclear that doing so could land them infederal prisonthe u.s government considered thesemathematical systems modern weaponstechnologies and distributing them was acrime under the international trafficand arms regulations mit halted plans todistribute the paperi decided quite literallythey are going to classify this over mydead bodymark miller was a 20 year old student atyale who had read about this discoveryin scientific american so i traveled tomit managed to get my hand on a papercopy of this thing i went to a varietyof different copy shops so i wasn'tmaking lots of copies in any one place isent them to home and hobbyist computerorganizations and magazines all acrossthe country and i gave copies of thepaper to some select friends of mine andi told themif i disappearmake sure this gets outearly in 1978 the u.s federal governmentbacked off and decided to allow thepublication and the world has been on adifferent course ever since it gotpublishedbut the crypto wars were just gettingstarted in the late 70s the nationalsecurity agency declared theunrestrained public discussion ofcryptographic research threatened ournational security the privatecryptography community and thegovernment have been sparring over theissue ever sincemarshall mcluhan said that one day wewould all live in a global village wellthe global village has arrived and itsmain street is called the internet theinternet also created an electronicsurveillance apparatus there was likenothing the world had ever seen whichmeant that the cryptographybreakthroughs of the 1970s were nolonger a rarified topic they wereprivacy salvation internet users couldshield their online activities fromspying and that sent the intelligencecommunity once again scrambling to stopthe dissemination of this powerful toolin 1991 a software developer named philzimmerman released the first relativelyeasy to use secret messaging systembuilt with strong encryption which wascalled pgpsomehow it got overseas now that it'sover there people are using it and i'mdelighted to hear good stories about howit's used in places wherethere are oppressive governments so theu.s justice department launched athree-year criminal investigation ofzimmerman on the grounds that by makinghis software accessible outside thecountry he could be guilty of exportingweapons under the arms control actmeanwhile the national security agencyargued that zimmerman's software wouldbe used by child molesters and criminalspgp they say is out there to protectfreedom fighters in latvia said thensa's general counsel but the fact isthe only use that has come to theattention of law enforcement agencies isa guy who is using pgp so the policecould not tell what little boys he hadseduced over the net child pornographersterrorists money wanderers take yourpick these are the people who will beinvoked as the bringers of death anddestruction well it's true it's trueit's trueso they're rightyesbut all technologies have had badeffects the telephones allow extortiondeath threats bomb threats kidnappingcasesuncontrolled publishing of books couldallow satanic books to appearthe cypherpunks argued that pgp was likeany other published material becauseunder the hood it was just a series ofinstructions to be carried out by amachine restraint on freedom ofexpression of software writers isanathema in a free society and aviolation of the first amendment wrotethe economist and entrepreneur philsalen in a 1991 essay titled freedom ofspeech and softwareencryption can't be controlled whetheror not it's powerful or has impacts onthe government because it's free speechin the early 90s john gilmore who was aco-founder of the cypherpunk movementrisked going to jail in his campaign toforce the government to acknowledge thatregulating encryption violated the firstamendment we basically had a communityof a thousand people scattered aroundwho were all trying different ideas onhow to get around the government to getencryption to the masseswhat we're afraid of several years fromnow is the terrorists both hit theirencryption button on the telephone andeven though we have access we can'tunderstand what they're saying on areal-time basis the clintonadministration told congress thatamericans have no constitutional rightto choose their own method of encryptionand push for legislation that wouldrequire companies to build in amechanism for law enforcement agenciesto break in we're in favor of strongencryption robust encryption we justwant to make sure we have a trap doorand a keyunder some judge's authoritywhere we can get there ifif somebody is planning a crime thecypherpunks look for ways to undercutthe government's case by pointing outthe similarities between encryptionsoftware and other forms of protectedspeechwith phil zimmerman under federalinvestigation for making his softwareavailable for download outside the us toprove a point he convinced mit press tomirror his action in the analog world byprinting out the pgp source code addinga binding and shipping it to europeanbookstores the government knew if theywent to court to suppress thepublication of a book from a universitythat they would loseand they would lose in a hurry therewere people who actually got encryptioncode tattooed on their bodies and thenstarted asking can i go to a foreigncountrywe printed up t-shirts that hadencryption code on them and submittedthem to the government office ofmunitions control can we publish thist-shirtultimately they never answered thatquery because they realized to say nowould be to invite a lawsuit they wouldlose and so the best answer was noanswer at all talk a little bit moreabout encryption technology no nothank youi i hesitate even to make use the wordbut i'm not using it any more wayin 1996 the justice department announcedthat it wouldn't pursue criminal chargesagainst phil zimmerman and major courtvictories came when two federal judgesfound that encryption is protected bythe first amendment the crypto wars arestill ongoing what we won in the firstround was the right to publish it andthe right to put it in mass-marketsoftware but what we didn't actually dois deploy it in mass-market softwarenow there are major companies buildingserious encryption into their productsand we're getting a lot of pushback fromthe government about this we're aboutthe rule of law but we don't want tocreate spaces that are beyond the reachof the law in the united states rightit's not just the reprehensible behaviorof sexual predation on children butmyriad additional forms of serious crimeenabled by end-to-endencryptioni'm not optimistic that privacy willprevail in the crypto warsit's an ongoing strugglein the early 90s at the same time thatgilmore was fighting his legal battlefor freedom of speech and software thecypherpunks were exploringcryptography's potential in the contextof collapsing political borders and therise of liberal democracy part four inthis series will look at how thosedreams turn to disillusionment the deathof the cypherpunk movement and itsrebirth following the invention ofbitcoinyou're looking at this and going wowwouldn't it be amazing if this workedand then you realized oh my gosh it doeswork national borders are just speedbumps in the information super highcryptography is really really strong wecan do whatever we want people mightprovide the equivalent of whatgovernment does in a decentralizedfashion i talk about collapse ofgovernments i think we actually saw thatin the middle ages probably as a resultof the printing pressthis is the story of a community ofscientists mathematicians philosophersand activists who believe that theinternet combined with recentbreakthroughs in the field ofcryptography would upend society andusher in a new era of sovereignindividualismwe have it in our power to begin theworld over again right now and it'sinternal clash over the optimal path toachieving that goal can evil be donewith this technology yesand so what so then deal with ithere's the final installment in afour-part series on the origins of thecypherpunk movement and how it helpedshape our modern world[Music][Music]we see a free world that has achieved alevel of prosperity unprecedented in allhuman history mr gorbachevtear down this wallif you had asked me 10 years ago is itpossible that communism could collapseby the year 1992 that i would have saidabsolutely ridiculousthe fall of the berlin wall wasimportant to me because i thought it wasthe end of history and that nationalborders would cease beingthe walls ofprisonsand so a couple years later when idiscovered the internet i thought ohthis is part of this pattern whereborders and distance stop being barriersto peoplethen i discovered a wholeclan of people who self-identified ascomputer peoplefound my tribe and among that clan wasthe cypherpunk's mailing listif you want to subscribe to our mailinglist send a blank email message and justsay subscribe cyberpunks and what is acypherpunk what do you guys stand forcyberpunks are cryptography activiststhe cypherpunk's email list whichstarted in the fall of 1992 one yearafter the launch of the world wide webbecame a gathering place for a globalcommunity interested in usingcryptography to allow individuals tocommunicate and transact on the internetprivately and without interference froma central authority in the last 20 yearsthe basic techniques to do all sorts ofimpossible seeming thingshave suddenly emerged put them intopractice many cypherpunks were inspiredby the work of the computer scientistdavid chong who demonstrated that it waspossible to use cryptography to build ananonymous payment network that ran onthe internet because of the cypherpunksand because of the science papers ofdavid chom i thought the third thing isgoing to happen is economic freedom thatpeople are going to be no longerconstrained by national borders anddistancefrom cooperating and sharing resourcesandhelping each other but at this watershedmoment of collapsing borders there was adivide within the cypherpunk communityover whether these cryptographic toolswould lead to more individual freedomfree trade in the spread of democracy orthe end of government altogether thecypherpunk movement's most influentialfigure was the physicist andintellectual provocateur tim may whocoined the phrase cryptoanarchy he sawthe fall of the berlin wall as evidencethat the societal institutions we takefor granted could collapse in shortorder just as they had in the middleages we saw the little principalitiesthe monarchies the religious the papalstates we saw those collapse probably asa result of publishing printingmay penned a one-page summary of howcryptography would upend society so ijust sat down at my little macintosh andloosely patterned this after thecommunist manifesto the spectre ishaunting the modern world the specter ofcrypto anarchycryptography is really really strongwe can be protected from anythingwithout fromthe observers from the watchers from theimposers of the past upon the futurewe're trying to createmay was skeptical of the idea thathumanity was witnessing an unabashedvictory of economic and politicalliberalism or that it was possible toovercome tyranny through collectiveaction as the political scientistfrancis fukuyama argued we as humanbeings want to be recognized with acertain dignity this is the essentialdriving force behind democraticrevolutions whether they take place ineastern europe or in asia or in latinamerica may embraced a technology-basedtheory of historic change summed up bythe movement's tagline which was coinedby the mathematician eric hughescypherpunk's write code what eric meantby cypherpunk's right code is don't beone of those guys who goes to alibertarian party conference and sitsabout getting somebody elected to thelos gatos city councilthat way lies madnesswhereas the interesting things that hadhappened had been technological changesthe telephone the copy machine the vcrthe philosophy that i really gotinterested in is that you don't just goand ask the regulator oh we need moreprivacy online we go fix it arguing andcomplaining and lobbying and politicshave nominal effect on what changes theworld is technology adoptionandyou know society movingshifting spew pointsfor crypto anarchists like may writingcode meant building systems foranonymous transactions on the internetthat made the arbitrary divisions of thepolitical world irrelevant nationalborders are just speed bumps on theinformation super highwayonline cryptographic networks would bestructured like a geodesic dome a formhailed by the counterculturaltechnologists of the 1970s for being inharmony with nature and highly resistantto external attack networks with noowners with many interconnecting nodesthat would be basically unstoppablein a geodesic market economics will nolonger be the handmaiden of politics thecypherpunk writer robert hettinger notedand nation-states will eventually be asceremonial as modern-day constitutionalmonarchs this idea of a many to manyconnection was clearly going to happenbut it was much easier to build afunctional network for cooperation andtrade when you can rely on a centralauthority to enforce the rules how canweuse this weird crypto technique to solvethis strange esoteric little problemthat in the real world you just solvebecauseoh i know what your social securitynumber is or you have to have your youknow government issued id that you knowyou take into the bank so you can openup your bank account and they can linkthe two together and say okay if jimmccoy walks out on this hundred thousanddollar loan well we know where to findthem i was trying to deal with thoseproblems you can buy and sell propertyin cyberspace using cryptographicprotocols the idea of ways in whichpeople might provide the equivalent ofwhat government does in a decentralizedfashion tim stole some ideas from mymachinery of freedom and he reprocessedthem with all this technology and then istole them back a function of governmentthat was particularly hard to replicateusing cryptography was the issuance ofmoney the cypherpunks attempted to builda borderless internet currency system asanonymous as cash and that like goldheld its value without the backing of acentral bank gold makes very good moneybecause nobody can manufacture more ofit very readily pretty mildly rightwhereas bits are perfectly copyable soturning bits into good money is quitedifficult tim me and many othersconsidered electronic cash to be theholy grail because it completed thepicture a private and decentralizedmonetary system may argued was a keycomponent in constructing a newborderless world where the activitiesand assets of individuals would beresistant to government control andconfiscationyou don't physically meet the person ifyou don't even know what continentthey're on you can't coerce them[Music]but there was another faction within themovement that rejected tim may's visionof cordoning off a new world incyberspacethe high-tech kayakings were people likeeric drexler mark miller phil salemthey were focused on designing securecomputing systems based on economicinsights particularly those of theaustrian-born nobel prize winnerfriedrich hayek instead of building anew virtual world shielded fromgovernment interference the high-techhayekians sought to use technology todemolish walls and divisions within theexisting worldthey imagined that introducing new toolsfor human coordination would graduallyerode the government's ability toimpinge on our freedoms we did lots andlots of fantasizing about how the worldcould be different but we saw this asemerging from inside the worldcryptography was a tool for portingeconomic concepts and legal structuresonto the internet but the aim was tofoster new forms of peer-to-peercommerce and knowledge sharing and thehigh-tech kayakings believe that evenimperfect systems can transform societygradually from withinthe overall arc of world history istowards rule of law towards lesscorruptible systems ifthe emergence of the world of cryptocommerce creates systems that are vastlyless corruptiblebut under a whole mix of differentmechanisms and governance regimessuch thatthey're not always everywhereuncorruptablei think that's finethere's a lot of power in providingpeople tools such that they cansuccessfully start to act more like youwould like them to as opposed to you'vegot to come over here where it's reallyhard edge encrypted and it works exactlythe way we want no no you know let'slet's you know raise people's levelsincrementally and and that's animprovement in the worldfor many cypherpunks the darker side ofcryptoanarchy was epitomized by thewritings of the chemist and electricalengineer jim bell a participant on theemail list who in the midcompared aggression by the state to thatof muggers rapists robbers and murderersand posited a cryptographicallyprotected marketplace in which anonymousindividuals could in effect pay to havegovernment employees killed with thegoal of destroying the statein 1997 bell was arrested and went toprison for among other things dropping astink bomb on a government building timmay distanced himself from bell'swritings and activities whilemaintaining that marketplaces forassassination like the one bell haddescribed might be both inevitable anddesirablecan evil be done withthis technology not just the internetbut especially the crypto part of it yesand so what so then deal with itand zimmerman once told methat he sometimes regretted everintroducing pgp to the world because itcould be used by al qaeda or the talibanor whatnoti say so whati'm not morally responsiblewould have happened whether we hadexisted or notbecause technology has its own logicand people want to do what they want todo i meanthey want free [ __ ]they want freedom to do things even ifthey say this should be regulatedthey'll oftenmake the conscious decision to copymusiccopy videotapes they want to seeblack net is a negative consequence i'mnot interested in creating thatwhen you build technology to solveproblems then you create then

importantto us this is an example of what you canorder through your computerit combines the power of your computerwith the convenience of your telephonewe saw that information technology couldcreate a 1984 style tyrannical top-downcontrol society or it could develop intosomething that is a decentralizedenabler of human freedomand even back then our dream was toenable the future of human freedomin the late 1980s at the dawn of theonline age a group of young computerscientists in silicon valley startedgrappling with what this new technologywould mean for society we took a look atthe potential of computer systemsand saw that for everything aboutcivilization that enables it to work wecan enable it to work much better themost influential figure in what wouldbecome the cypherpunk movement was thephysicist tim may who envisioned thefuture internet as a place for what hewould dub crypto anarchy wherelawbreakers radicals and politicaldissidents could shield their activitiesfrom government surveillance and controlpeople doing things that didn't requirepermissions from anyone because thepeople were untraceable it couldn't bestopped but there was another group thatsaw the potential of computers to remakesociety gradually from within bydecentralizing commerce and improvingthe dissemination of knowledge they weredubbed the high-tech hiaquids becausetheir worldview was influenced by thework of austrian economist friedrichhayek the fundamental insights ofhayeking economics was how separatelyformulated plans tend to mesh well andwe saw electronic media as aenabler of coordination

high-techhayekians was the economist andentrepreneur phil salen now if you own apersonal computer we are told you canshop at home in what's called theelectronic mall it was a few yearsbefore the

horoscopes or go shoppingyou can buy items from department storesranging from nordstrom's to neimanmarcus all via computer screensalen whose outlook was shaped by hiscareful reading of hayek understood thatthese services weren't merely acuriosity or a digital version of theold mail order catalog they were thebeginning of something that had thepotential to one day erase nationalboundaries

companyand had co-authored a congressionalstudy critical of nasa's wastefulspending but in his view there wascontinuity between his interests inspace travel and computing because inboth industries technology's purpose wasto drive down the transaction costs thatimpede human activity making it feasibleto explore new frontiers and interact inways that would otherwise beprohibitively expensivenow thanks to breakthroughs in computingthe ability to buy or obtain exactly theinformation you need when you want it inthe form you want it is about to explodeat a speed unmatched since the inventionof printingbut salen was foremost an entrepreneurand in the mid-1980s he set out tolaunch one of those platforms for buyingand selling informationhe called it the american informationexchange or amex this business thatwe're doing is to make possible a newkind of thing which is being able to buyand sell informationonline amex was a radical idea in themid 1980s users could buy or sell adviceabout the real estate market writingsoftware or what companies to invest innow you can say to somebody so it's likeebay or like priceline or like amazonwhen we tried to explain this to peoplethey simply couldn't get it they couldnot wrap their heads around this some ofthem i think couldn't imagine thecomputational end of it milton friedmandidn't get it though it was similar inways to the online marketplaces thatwould launch a decade later amex wasmore than just an idea before its timewhat set it apart was its grounding inpolitical philosophy and its lofty goalof elevating individual decision makingover central planning it was aninstantiation of austrian economicsnow put into code and put onlinesomething like this could have profoundhuman consequences and that was thevisiona fluid

fascinatingemergent social behavior amex's chiefarchitect was the pioneering softwareengineer chip morningstar who had comefrom a stint at george lucas'sproduction studio where he oversaw thecreation of habitat which was one of thefirst online virtual communities afterjoining amex morningstar co-authored anessay which argued that in building aworld in software detailed centralplanning is impossible the world is justmore complicated people are morecomplicated you cannot know what alltheir goals are what you can do is youcan put them into an environment inwhich certain kinds of things arepossible what you can't do is tellpeople what they wantphil sale and mark miller and chipmorningstar's ideas about how a futureinternet could decentralize societyinspired tim may to first articulate aradically different vision may who wouldgo on to become the most influentialfigure in the cypherpunk movement wasintroduced to salem by morningstar indecember of 1987. chip said there's

phil in redwood city and hedescribed how amex would work and i saidpeople aren't going to be sellingmeaningless stuff like surfboardrecommendations in may's view amex couldbe useful as a tool for

loweringtransaction costs for everybodylike salem in the high-tech kayakiansmay saw the personal computer asenabling technology for sweepingsocietal changes but he had a differentvision of a virtual marketplace for anyand all goods and services which hedubbed blacknet or a technological meansof undermining all governmentson amex user activity was out in theopen but black net would be imperviousto government tracking and surveillanceand perhaps it would be a network withno owners at allmany people's first response would be tosay that black net won't be allowed tohappen perhaps but technology

as emerging from inside theworld and carrying the world along withitin 1988 amex was acquired by thesoftware giant autodesk a growing sceneof young technologists came togetheraround salem and the

cancer in 1991 the sameyear that the world wide web becamepublicly available but his intellectualcontributions and conflict with may hadlaid the groundwork for what would comenext for the cypherpunks the long effortto build a self-sovereign and anonymousform of digital money and the embrace ofa branch of mathematics calledcryptography which they came to view asthe key to personal liberation on theinternet[Music]the title of the book is the rise of thecomputer state what i'm saying is thatlarge bureaucracies with the power thatthe computer gives them become morepowerful and that they are escaping thechecks and balances of representativedemocracyin 1983 the new york times reporterdavid burnham warned that theintegration of computers into everyaspect of daily life could lead to alevel of automated surveillance unknownin any previous age for society tochange course burnham argued citizenswould need to rise up through thedemocratic process and demand new legalprotections to safeguard their privacythere are ways to deal with it we havedone it and all i hope is that we're onour toes enough andalert enough tosee them and go after them this is justpolitical jaw boning a few years later aphysicist named tim may argued thatputting faith in representativedemocracy was naive he believed thatonly innovation could save us from theorwellian state the interesting thingsthat had happened had been technologicalchanges the telephone copy machine thevcrcomputersmay became a co-founder of thecypherpunk movement which came togetheraround the idea that a recentbreakthrough in the field ofcryptography was the key innovation forcombating tyranny comparable to how thecrossbow enabled individuals to go upagainst medieval armies it's an epiphanyit's like standing on top of themountain and seeing that this is outtherecoming up reason takes a look at how onecommunity came to see cryptography as apowerful weapon for defeating bigbrother here's part two in a four partseries on how the cypherpunk movementanticipated the promise and the perilthat lay ahead when the internet upendedthe world[Music]in the late 1970s there was anastonishing breakthrough in the field ofcryptographyi saw this as the critical fork in theroad for the future of human freedom ireally didin the summer of 77 mark miller was a 20year old student at yale working for acounter-cultural tech visionary namedted nelson like many future cypherpunkshe would learn of this groundbreakingdiscovery when the august issue ofscientific american arrived at his doorand i'm reading[Music]i'm reading martin gardner'smathematical games column i just getincredibly excited just incrediblyexcited i call up ted in the middle ofthe night and i tell ted we can preventthe ministry of truthas gardner told his readers a discoveryhad been made that would revolutionizethe entire field of secret communicationit was the work of teams ofmathematicians and computer scientistsat mit and stanfordincluding a young researcher namedwhitfield diffieif you look at1791 at the moment of the bill of rightsimpenetrably private conversationsdominated what the framers didn'tforesee is that private communicationwould happen via computers sendingmessages across the world that couldeasily be intercepted public keycryptography gives you a mechanismwhereby you can recover this ability tohave an impenetrably privateconversation between two peoplelook at this a cipher well let's go backto the office and get started on itsending a secret message used to involvetranslating words through a secret codethat spies in government agents couldpotentially crackphili think i've got it goodzis dvis e anyone sending and receivingmessages also had to have a copy of thesecret key or translation device justlike the decipher rings collected byamerican school children starting in the1930s here's how you can get one foryour very ownfirst get a jar of chocolate flavoredovaltine public key cryptography madedecoding devices unnecessary andfiguring out the pattern effectivelyimpossiblethe big breakthrough was an easy tosolve mathematical formula that youcould funnel words into just as easilyas dropping them through a trap doorbut if you flip the problem around andtried to pull the message out the otherside in that direction the formula wasalmost impossible to solve such thateven a super computer trying randomnumbers would need 40 quadrillion yearsto service the answer but the person whoset up the mathematical formula ortrapdoor held the answer to the problemor secret code making it possible forthat person to retrieve the originalmessageit could also be compared to the mostubiquitous trapdoor system for sendingmessages consider a mailbox anyone canthrow a letter in a mailbox but only themailman who has a key can take it outanyone in the world could set up one ofthese equations serving as the mailmanof his or her very own impenetrablevirtual letterbox and because thatindividual could prove ownership of themailbox by opening it with the onlyknown key public key cryptography alsomade it possible to set up a provableidentity on the internet completelydisconnected from any real-worldpersonal informationknowing economics what you do andlooking at what's happening with theinternet what do youwhat can you see happening way out therein the future the most strikingnon-obvious thingis that current technologies are in theprocess of giving us a level of privacywe have never had before essentiallythere are nowwell-knownways available in free software ofencrypting messages so that only theintended recipient can read them so thatif the fbi intercepts them it'sgibberish to themone way of reading the second amendmentis that it was a way of making sure thatif the government tried to suppress thepeople the people would win and themilitia wouldn't be very good but itwould outnumber the professionalsin the modern worldthe weapons that the army has differ bya lot more than they did in the 18thcenturybut i also think that if you look atwhat politics are like nowadays the realwars between the government and thepopulation are information wars notphysical wars encryption means that theycan't arrest you they can't blackmailyouryouryour key people can't do any of thethings governments might doto make sure that public information iswhat they wantedmeanwhile the u.s intelligence communitywas doing everything in its power tokeep this new tool out of the hands ofthe public well somebody once said to meif you think new directions had animpact on the outside world you shouldhave seen the impact it had at nsain part three in this series we'll lookat the u.s government's effort to haltthe widespread use of public keycryptography by threatening criminalprosecutionand the legal and public relationsbattle waged by one founding member ofthe cypherpunks for freedom of speechand software[Music]a hurricane of unrestrained joy sweepsthrough every part of a war sick worldthe breaking of encryption was essentialto the war effort[Music]england would probably have fallen ifthey'd not been able to read the enigmamessages because every time the germanssent bombers the raf knew where theywere sending them and could mass theplanes there to defend if anysignificant fraction of those attackshad gotten through england would havebeen much more helpless may well havefallen in the world course of world warii may have changed and that is theorigin of the regulations that said thisis a munition this is an item of war andthe problem was they didn't really takefreedom of speech freedom of inquiryacademic freedom into account in thatbut on the matter of encryptionterrorists are going to have these arelaw enforcementand get vital information i think that'sthe same choice coming up the story ofthe us government's long battle to keepstrong encryption out of the hands ofits citizens and how first amendmentactivists fought backhere's part three in a four part serieson how the cypherpunk movement of the1990s anticipated the promise and theperil that lay ahead when the internetupended the world[Music]in 1977 researchers at mit made anastonishing discovery a mathematicalsystem for encrypting secret messages sopowerful that it had the potential tomake government spying effectivelyimpossiblebut before these mathematicians couldpublish their research the nsa made itclear that doing so could land them infederal prisonthe u.s government considered thesemathematical systems modern weaponstechnologies and distributing them was acrime under the international trafficand arms regulations mit halted plans todistribute the paperi decided quite literallythey are going to classify this over mydead bodymark miller was a 20 year old student atyale who had read about this discoveryin scientific american so i traveled tomit managed to get my hand on a papercopy of this thing i went to a varietyof different copy shops so i wasn'tmaking lots of copies in any one place isent them to home and hobbyist computerorganizations and magazines all acrossthe country and i gave copies of thepaper to some select friends of mine andi told themif i disappearmake sure this gets outearly in 1978 the u.s federal governmentbacked off and decided to allow thepublication and the world has been on adifferent course ever since it gotpublishedbut the crypto wars were just gettingstarted in the late 70s the nationalsecurity agency declared theunrestrained public discussion ofcryptographic research threatened ournational security the privatecryptography community and thegovernment have been sparring over theissue ever sincemarshall mcluhan said that one day wewould all live in a global village wellthe global village has arrived and itsmain street is called the internet theinternet also created an electronicsurveillance apparatus there was likenothing the world had ever seen whichmeant that the cryptographybreakthroughs of the 1970s were nolonger a rarified topic they wereprivacy salvation internet users couldshield their online activities fromspying and that sent the intelligencecommunity once again scrambling to stopthe dissemination of this powerful toolin 1991 a software developer named philzimmerman released the first relativelyeasy to use secret messaging systembuilt with strong encryption which wascalled pgpsomehow it got overseas now that it'sover there people are using it and i'mdelighted to hear good stories about howit's used in places wherethere are oppressive governments so theu.s justice department launched athree-year criminal investigation ofzimmerman on the grounds that by makinghis software accessible outside thecountry he could be guilty of exportingweapons under the arms control actmeanwhile the national security agencyargued that zimmerman's software wouldbe used by child molesters and criminalspgp they say is out there to protectfreedom fighters in latvia said thensa's general counsel but the fact isthe only use that has come to theattention of law enforcement agencies isa guy who is using pgp so the policecould not tell what little boys he hadseduced over the net child pornographersterrorists money wanderers take yourpick these are the people who will beinvoked as the bringers of death anddestruction well it's true it's trueit's trueso they're rightyesbut all technologies have had badeffects the telephones allow extortiondeath threats bomb threats kidnappingcasesuncontrolled publishing of books couldallow satanic books to appearthe cypherpunks argued that pgp was likeany other published material becauseunder the hood it was just a series ofinstructions to be carried out by amachine restraint on freedom ofexpression of software writers isanathema in a free society and aviolation of the first amendment wrotethe economist and entrepreneur philsalen in a 1991 essay titled freedom ofspeech and softwareencryption can't be controlled whetheror not it's powerful or has impacts onthe government because it's free speechin the early 90s john gilmore who was aco-founder of the cypherpunk movementrisked going to jail in his campaign toforce the government to acknowledge thatregulating encryption violated the firstamendment we basically had a communityof a thousand people scattered aroundwho were all trying different ideas onhow to get around the government to getencryption to the masseswhat we're afraid of several years fromnow is the terrorists both hit theirencryption button on the telephone andeven though we have access we can'tunderstand what they're saying on areal-time basis the clintonadministration told congress thatamericans have no constitutional rightto choose their own method of encryptionand push for legislation that wouldrequire companies to build in amechanism for law enforcement agenciesto break in we're in favor of strongencryption robust encryption we justwant to make sure we have a trap doorand a keyunder some judge's authoritywhere we can get there ifif somebody is planning a crime thecypherpunks look for ways to undercutthe government's case by pointing outthe similarities between encryptionsoftware and other forms of protectedspeechwith phil zimmerman under federalinvestigation for making his softwareavailable for download outside the us toprove a point he convinced mit press tomirror his action in the analog world byprinting out the pgp source code addinga binding and shipping it to europeanbookstores the government knew if theywent to court to suppress thepublication of a book from a universitythat they would loseand they would lose in a hurry therewere people who actually got encryptioncode tattooed on their bodies and thenstarted asking can i go to a foreigncountrywe printed up t-shirts that hadencryption code on them and submittedthem to the government office ofmunitions control can we publish thist-shirtultimately they never answered thatquery because they realized to say nowould be to invite a lawsuit they wouldlose and so the best answer was noanswer at all talk a little bit moreabout encryption technology no nothank youi i hesitate even to make use the wordbut i'm not using it any more wayin 1996 the justice department announcedthat it wouldn't pursue criminal chargesagainst phil zimmerman and major courtvictories came when two federal judgesfound that encryption is protected bythe first amendment the crypto wars arestill ongoing what we won in the firstround was the right to publish it andthe right to put it in mass-marketsoftware but what we didn't actually dois deploy it in mass-market softwarenow there are major companies buildingserious encryption into their productsand we're getting a lot of pushback fromthe government about this we're aboutthe rule of law but we don't want tocreate spaces that are beyond the reachof the law in the united states rightit's not just the reprehensible behaviorof sexual predation on children butmyriad additional forms of serious crimeenabled by end-to-endencryptioni'm not optimistic that privacy willprevail in the crypto warsit's an ongoing strugglein the early 90s at the same time thatgilmore was fighting his legal battlefor freedom of speech and software thecypherpunks were exploringcryptography's potential in the contextof collapsing political borders and therise of liberal democracy part four inthis series will look at how thosedreams turn to disillusionment the deathof the cypherpunk movement and itsrebirth following the invention ofbitcoinyou're looking at this and going wowwouldn't it be amazing if this workedand then you realized oh my gosh it doeswork national borders are just speedbumps in the information super highcryptography is really really strong wecan do whatever we want people mightprovide the equivalent of whatgovernment does in a decentralizedfashion i talk about collapse ofgovernments i think we actually saw thatin the middle ages probably as a resultof the printing pressthis is the story of a community ofscientists mathematicians philosophersand activists who believe that theinternet combined with recentbreakthroughs in the field ofcryptography would upend society andusher in a new era of sovereignindividualismwe have it in our power to begin theworld over again right now and it'sinternal clash over the optimal path toachieving that goal can evil be donewith this technology yesand so what so then deal with ithere's the final installment in afour-part series on the origins of thecypherpunk movement and how it helpedshape our modern world[Music][Music]we see a free world that has achieved alevel of prosperity unprecedented in allhuman history mr gorbachevtear down this wallif you had asked me 10 years ago is itpossible that communism could collapseby the year 1992 that i would have saidabsolutely ridiculousthe fall of the berlin wall wasimportant to me because i thought it wasthe end of history and that nationalborders would cease beingthe walls ofprisonsand so a couple years later when idiscovered the internet i thought ohthis is part of this pattern whereborders and distance stop being barriersto peoplethen i discovered a wholeclan of people who self-identified ascomputer peoplefound my tribe and among that clan wasthe cypherpunk's mailing listif you want to subscribe to our mailinglist send a blank email message and justsay subscribe cyberpunks and what is acypherpunk what do you guys stand forcyberpunks are cryptography activiststhe cypherpunk's email list whichstarted in the fall of 1992 one yearafter the launch of the world wide webbecame a gathering place for a globalcommunity interested in usingcryptography to allow individuals tocommunicate and transact on the internetprivately and without interference froma central authority in the last 20 yearsthe basic techniques to do all sorts ofimpossible seeming thingshave suddenly emerged put them intopractice many cypherpunks were inspiredby the work of the computer scientistdavid chong who demonstrated that it waspossible to use cryptography to build ananonymous payment network that ran onthe internet because of the cypherpunksand because of the science papers ofdavid chom i thought the third thing isgoing to happen is economic freedom thatpeople are going to be no longerconstrained by national borders anddistancefrom cooperating and sharing resourcesandhelping each other but at this watershedmoment of collapsing borders there was adivide within the cypherpunk communityover whether these cryptographic toolswould lead to more individual freedomfree trade in the spread of democracy orthe end of government altogether thecypherpunk movement's most influentialfigure was the physicist andintellectual provocateur tim may whocoined the phrase cryptoanarchy he sawthe fall of the berlin wall as evidencethat the societal institutions we takefor granted could collapse in shortorder just as they had in the middleages we saw the little principalitiesthe monarchies the religious the papalstates we saw those collapse probably asa result of publishing printingmay penned a one-page summary of howcryptography would upend society so ijust sat down at my little macintosh andloosely patterned this after thecommunist manifesto the spectre ishaunting the modern world the specter ofcrypto anarchycryptography is really really strongwe can be protected from anythingwithout fromthe observers from the watchers from theimposers of the past upon the futurewe're trying to createmay was skeptical of the idea thathumanity was witnessing an unabashedvictory of economic and politicalliberalism or that it was possible toovercome tyranny through collectiveaction as the political scientistfrancis fukuyama argued we as humanbeings want to be recognized with acertain dignity this is the essentialdriving force behind democraticrevolutions whether they take place ineastern europe or in asia or in latinamerica may embraced a technology-basedtheory of historic change summed up bythe movement's tagline which was coinedby the mathematician eric hughescypherpunk's write code what eric meantby cypherpunk's right code is don't beone of those guys who goes to alibertarian party conference and sitsabout getting somebody elected to thelos gatos city councilthat way lies madnesswhereas the interesting things that hadhappened had been technological changesthe telephone the copy machine the vcrthe philosophy that i really gotinterested in is that you don't just goand ask the regulator oh we need moreprivacy online we go fix it arguing andcomplaining and lobbying and politicshave nominal effect on what changes theworld is technology adoptionandyou know society movingshifting spew pointsfor crypto anarchists like may writingcode meant building systems foranonymous transactions on the internetthat made the arbitrary divisions of thepolitical world irrelevant nationalborders are just speed bumps on theinformation super highwayonline cryptographic networks would bestructured like a geodesic dome a formhailed by the counterculturaltechnologists of the 1970s for being inharmony with nature and highly resistantto external attack networks with noowners with many interconnecting nodesthat would be basically unstoppablein a geodesic market economics will nolonger be the handmaiden of politics thecypherpunk writer robert hettinger notedand nation-states will eventually be asceremonial as modern-day constitutionalmonarchs this idea of a many to manyconnection was clearly going to happenbut it was much easier to build afunctional network for cooperation andtrade when you can rely on a centralauthority to enforce the rules how canweuse this weird crypto technique to solvethis strange esoteric little problemthat in the real world you just solvebecauseoh i know what your social securitynumber is or you have to have your youknow government issued id that you knowyou take into the bank so you can openup your bank account and they can linkthe two together and say okay if jimmccoy walks out on this hundred thousanddollar loan well we know where to findthem i was trying to deal with thoseproblems you can buy and sell propertyin cyberspace using cryptographicprotocols the idea of ways in whichpeople might provide the equivalent ofwhat government does in a decentralizedfashion tim stole some ideas from mymachinery of freedom and he reprocessedthem with all this technology and then istole them back a function of governmentthat was particularly hard to replicateusing cryptography was the issuance ofmoney the cypherpunks attempted to builda borderless internet currency system asanonymous as cash and that like goldheld its value without the backing of acentral bank gold makes very good moneybecause nobody can manufacture more ofit very readily pretty mildly rightwhereas bits are perfectly copyable soturning bits into good money is quitedifficult tim me and many othersconsidered electronic cash to be theholy grail because it completed thepicture a private and decentralizedmonetary system may argued was a keycomponent in constructing a newborderless world where the activitiesand assets of individuals would beresistant to government control andconfiscationyou don't physically meet the person ifyou don't even know what continentthey're on you can't coerce them[Music]but there was another faction within themovement that rejected tim may's visionof cordoning off a new world incyberspacethe high-tech kayakings were people likeeric drexler mark miller phil salemthey were focused on designing securecomputing systems based on economicinsights particularly those of theaustrian-born nobel prize winnerfriedrich hayek instead of building anew virtual world shielded fromgovernment interference the high-techhayekians sought to use technology todemolish walls and divisions within theexisting worldthey imagined that introducing new toolsfor human coordination would graduallyerode the government's ability toimpinge on our freedoms we did lots andlots of fantasizing about how the worldcould be different but we saw this asemerging from inside the worldcryptography was a tool for portingeconomic concepts and legal structuresonto the internet but the aim was tofoster new forms of peer-to-peercommerce and knowledge sharing and thehigh-tech kayakings believe that evenimperfect systems can transform societygradually from withinthe overall arc of world history istowards rule of law towards lesscorruptible systems ifthe emergence of the world of cryptocommerce creates systems that are vastlyless corruptiblebut under a whole mix of differentmechanisms and governance regimessuch thatthey're not always everywhereuncorruptablei think that's finethere's a lot of power in providingpeople tools such that they cansuccessfully start to act more like youwould like them to as opposed to you'vegot to come over here where it's reallyhard edge encrypted and it works exactlythe way we want no no you know
