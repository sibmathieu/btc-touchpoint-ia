  "text": "Eminent writer and philosopher, Professor Sir Roger\nScruton, has for over three decades taughtat institutions on both sides of the Atlantic,\nincluding Birkbeck College, Boston University,and more recently, the University of Buckingham.He is an author of over forty books.In his work as a philosopher, he has specialized\nin aesthetics with particular attention tomusic and architecture.He has written several works of fiction as\nwell as memoirs and essays on topics of generalinterest.He engages in contemporary political and cultural\ndebates from the standpoint of a conservativethinker and is well known as a powerful polemicist.He is a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature\nand the British Academy.He has been officially honored by the Czech\nRepublic by the city of Plzeň-- I hope that'sclose-- and by Virginia's general assembly.In 2004, he received the Ingersoll Weaver\nPrize for Scholarly Letters.In 2015 he published three books, all of which\nwere chosen among the people's books of theyear.In 2016, he was recipient of the Polish Lech\nKaczynski foundation's medal of courage andintegrity, was awarded the Italian Mossy Prize\nfor the culture of wine in recognition ofhis book, \"I Drink, Therefore I Am\" and was\nknighted that year in the Queen's birthdayhonor list.We're glad to have with us Professor Roger\nScruton.As you heard, that was on the verge of becoming\na list of my sins.I realize that, in this place, I’ve got\nto be on my very best behavior, so I shallbegin by thanking the Wheatley Institution,\nand Richard Williams especially, for invitingme and for thinking about this important question\nof what these three great concepts reallyembrace and what they have to do with each\nother.Richard Williams got in touch with me saying,\n“Look.You’re an expert on aesthetics, and we here\nin the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-daySaints believe in the beautiful, and the good,\nand the true, but we don’t know how to saywhat we believe.You have been working all your life on this,\nso you should come and tell us.”All I can say at this point is that, perhaps\nbecause I’ve been working all my life onthis, I don’t know how to say anything about\nit.Always, I come back to questions, and the\nonly benefit of having thought about thesequestions for so long is that there’s a\ncertain clarity in asking them, but no furtherclarity in answering them.Now, that shouldn’t depress you, because\nin a true philosophical approach to things,it is the clarity of the question, in the\nend, that really matters.That enables you to fit the subject matter\ninto your own life and make the decisionsthat you have to make about it.Let me say a few things about art and truth\nfirst of all.The enlightenment—by which I mean that mass\nof thinking and idea-mongering that beganin the beginning of the 17th century and went\non through the beginning of the 19th—broughtwith it, as I’m sure you know, a certain\nloss of the religious anchor in everyday life.Maybe in this part of the world, that loss\nwas not felt so much.But of course, there was nobody living in\nthis part of the world just then.But, there were your ancestors lost somewhere\non the way to this place who did, probably,feel a residue of this great movement of ideas\nthat began in Europe and recognized that thescientific worldview, which had come to the\nfore with Newton, was posing a certain threatto the more naïve of once religious beliefs.Among educated people (especially in France\nand Britain, and in Germany, too) there wasan attempt to find a rival source of meaning\nto the religious—to find that rival sourceof meaning in art, because for various reasons,\nart struck people as having a different statusfrom science.Science was a threat to religion.That’s true, because it was undermining\nthe old explanation of things in which Godtook such an important place.But, art seemed to represent a different way\nof looking at the world from science, onewhich preserved the mystery of things and\ndidn’t undo the mystery.Since the mystery was so important, why not\nlook to art as a source of meaning?So, art suddenly became prominent as a human\nenterprise, and with it the birth of the subjectof aesthetics—aesthetics being the philosophy\nof art and the philosophy of beauty.There are three important figures that I mention\nthere: Shaftsbury, Baumgarten, and Kant.Shaftsbury was an English philosopher, third\nEarl of Shaftsbury, who was a pupil of JohnLocke (who wrote very influential essays about\nthe role of the beautiful in the formationof the human spirit).Shaftsbury was an educationist and somebody\nwho felt that it was his duty to draw theattention of his contemporaries to the complexity\nof human life and to the consolations thatwe find in human life, and beauty is one of\nthem.He was very influential, though his theories\nare somewhat all over the place.Baumgarten was the person who invented the\nword “aesthetics” as a name for a discipline.He wrote a book called Aesthetica, which was\nabout the art of poetry.The original word is a Greek word, as I’m\nsure many of you know, for feeling.We have it in our word “anesthetic.”The burden of his book, Aesthetica, was that\npoetry communicates truths about our condition,but communicates them not through abstract\nthought, but through concrete feeling.Therefore, it’s a different kind of truth,\nand it has a different role in our lives anda different value for us.He began the whole enterprise of distinguishing\nthe artistic way of looking at the world fromthe literal-minded and possibly scientific\nway.Kant, who was much influenced by Baumgarten,\ntook this up and wrote the first systematicwork of aesthetics.These great thinkers raise the question: what\ndo we learn from art?Is what we learn from art a kind of truth—a\ntruth that we, perhaps, couldn’t learn fromany other human activity?Well, for a start, art is not one kind of\nthing.There is abstract art and representational\nart.Abstract art is like music or like abstract\npainting, abstract sculpture.It doesn’t actually have a subject matter.That’s the whole point of it.You’re supposed to appreciate it for what\nit is in itself, for the harmony of linesand figures, for the ways in which things\nbalance against each other.It’s supposed to attract attention purely\nfor its own sake and not for the subject matterthat it represents.Already, that makes it rather difficult to\nsay exactly what it is that we learn from artAnd then, of course, what about fictions?The realm of art includes things like novels,\nplays, films, poetry—all of which are aboutthe world in some way, but they don’t give\nyou literal truths about the world.They are about fictional worlds, and it requires\nan effort of the imagination both to createa fiction and also to appreciate it.When you read a great novel, like Jane Austen’s\nEmma, it’s not in order to find out aboutsome person called Emma Woodhouse.You know there is no such person.But you do know, nevertheless, that in the\ncreation of this fiction, Jane Austen hasput some part of herself, and some part of\nher deep observations of the human condition.But, there aren’t literal truths about a\nparticular person’s life.What kind of truths are they?Or, is there another kind of truth?That’s one of the problems that we encounter\nin this area.Then, there is the problem of the role of\nexperience.If you read a poem to yourself, or recite\na poem, you know that what matters is thesound of that poem, the structure of it, the\nway the verse unfolds, the form of it, butnot what it literally says—or, at least,\nnot what it literally says when extractedfrom that form.It is not like a textbook.If you are curious about a nuclear physics,\nyou might pick up a textbook of nuclear physics,read it, and having absorbed it and being\ndiligent students, memorized the whole lot,you put it on the shelf.And that’s it.That’s the last time you look at it, because\nyou’ve extracted the information from it.But that’s not the way that people appreciate\npoems, is it?It’s not that they extract the information\nand then never visit it again.On the contrary, a good poem is one that gains\nfrom repetition, even when you know it byheart, and even when it says something that\nseems extremely light.Even if it touches with a light touch on the\nrealities of this world, like Robert Frost’s“Stopping By Woods.”It doesn’t say very much, but the form,\nthe rhythm, and the way in which it seemsto touch something deep in you, mean that\nyou will want to repeat it, want to go onreading it again and again.One thought, then, is that we don’t actually\ngo to art for information.The information content is not the primary\nthing.It’s the experience.But, of course, not all truth is information.We have lots of different ideas of truth.Christ said, famously, “I am the way, the\nTruth, and the Life.”He didn’t mean “truth” in the sense\nthat scientists use that word—that he issomehow a true representation of the world—He\nmeant something deeper.He meant that you can trust in him; and by\ntrusting in him, you come to know somethingabout yourself—how far you can go in whatever\ndirection and with what kind of hope.Perhaps that use of the idea of truth, which\nbrings in a notion of trust, is a more importantone for considering art, because we find support\nin the person we trust.It’s like that with art as well.In many works of art, we feel that we are\nin the presence of a genuine spirit.Many people feel this, of course, about the\nworks of Beethoven, who described his MissaSolemnis, in the preface, as “from the heart\n. . . to the heart.”What he meant was that this was an utter,\nsincere outpouring of what he felt, and heexpected the audience to engage with it in\nthe same spirit, trusting in him to be theguardian of their emotions for the hour-long\nexperience that he was offering.That kind of an idea of truth is a very different\none from the scientific one, but it stillseems to be an idea of truth.Now, this brings up the topic of desire and\npleasure.Huge topic.I have to say that I’m talking here as a\nprofessional philosopher.I know many people in this audience are studying\nother subjects, are simply curious about theintellectual world, and are not used to thinking\nin this abstract, philosophical way, so Iapologize.I just hope that I will inspire you to go\non and pursue the matter further.There is a connection between desiring something\nand feeling pleasure on obtaining it.If you really want a glass of water, then\nupon obtaining that glass and drinking, youfeel pleasure, the pleasure of satisfying\na desire.But it’s not a simple connection, because\nwe know that many things that we desire don’tgive us pleasure when we obtain them.This is one of the most important parts of\nmoral education: to recognize the differencebetween those things that you desire which\nwill bring satisfaction when you obtain them,and those things which you desire which, when\nyou taste them, you push them away with revulsion.I won’t go into that, but of course, you\nmight think that maybe art has something todo with that, too.Maybe it can teach us in advance about the\nthings which we won’t enjoy when we possessthem.There are many kinds of pleasure.There’s pure sensual pleasure.You sink into a hot bath at the end of the\nday.This is a pleasure of the senses as the warmth\nspreads through your body.It doesn’t tell you anything about the world.It’s not based on any kind of thinking,\nbut it’s the kind of pleasure that animals haveBut, we also have intellectual pleasures—pleasures\nwhich come from thinking things.The pleasure of reading a book is not a sensory\npleasure at all, is it?It’s a pleasure of the mind, the pleasure\nof following an argument, of playing withwords, and so on.And then there’s what I call intentional\npleasures.The word “intentional” means directed\noutward onto the world, like the pleasureyou take on somebody’s giving you a present,\nor the pleasure you take when you go to seeyour child take part in a hundred meter race\n(or in the long jump or whatever) and yousee in the playing field—there he is!He’s done it!He’s got the first prize!That’s a pleasure about something.When you have a pleasure about something,\nthat means you can make a mistake as well.The race was at the other end of the field,\nand it looked exactly as though your son hadwon it.Only later do you discover it was someone\nelse, a look-alike.So, was your pleasure real, or not?In a sense, it was real, but it was also a\nmistake.So, there are mistaken pleasures, and that’s\na very interesting fact.So, pleasures can be at something.I can take a pleasure at the beautiful scene\nout of the window.I can take a pleasure about the triumph of\nmy son in the long jump and so on.Aesthetic pleasure is of the first kind.It’s pleasure at something.It’s not like pleasures of taste.When you eat a strawberry ice cream and take\npleasure in it, that’s a pleasant tastein the mouth.When you look at a profound picture and are\nmoved by it, that’s not a pleasant feelinganywhere in you, is it?It’s not a sensation of pleasure.You’re pleased at this thing that you’re\nlooking at, and pleased by it, maybe pleasedabout what it’s saying.It’s completely different from a sensory\npleasure.There’s a question, therefore, that we must\nask: what is the relation between tastes infood and drink, and tastes in music and painting?They’re not the same kind of thing at all.You like strawberries, and I like blueberries.Fine.There’s no real disagreement between us,\njust different tastes.But, you like Beethoven and I like Heavy Metal.This is a bit more like a disagreement, especially\nif you then go on to say, “Your liking heavymetal is a sign of the degeneracy of your\nsoul.”The argument can begin then.It may not be possible to resolve it.But the fact is, in matters of artistic and\naesthetic judgment, we do argue, and the argumentsare very important to us.Maybe you don’t think this, because you’re\nnot interested in Beethoven or heavy metal,but there are always going to be areas where\nyou are interested.Suppose you live in a little town which has\nbeautiful houses and beautiful streets, andyou’re really pleased with it.Your neighborhood is charming and somehow\nconsoling because of its orderliness.Then, someone puts in a planning application\nfor a huge skyscraper in bright orange tiles.You start getting together with your neighbors\nto campaign against this.There will be arguments put forward as to\nwho is right and who is wrong.These arguments matter enormously to people.Looking at the architectural mess between\nSalt Lake City and Provo, I suspect that Americansdon’t think about this as much as they should.But, on the other hand, anybody who has been\nto Europe will recognize that there, peopledo think about these things and argue about\nthem all the time.And, as a result, all sensible tourists don’t\nspend their holidays here, but in Europe.Anyway, that’s another matter.The great question, then, is: what is the\nvalue of this kind of pleasure—the pleasurethat we feel in works of art and aesthetic\nobjects?Can it be a vehicle of truth?It’s very interesting that we can feel pleasure\nin works of art, even when the works of artare sad, or even tragic.We take pleasure in a sad story, because the\nstory does something to the sadness.The weepy movie may have enormous appeal.You may feel like it hasn’t worked if you\nhaven’t had a bit of a weep during the courseof it.The sadness is part of what was promised.It’s part of the deal.And yet, it can’t be real sadness, because\nnobody voluntarily submits himself to that.It’s something like sadness put in a frame.The story puts it in a frame and makes it\nsuch that it doesn’t hurt you in the waythat, for instance, the death of someone you\nlove would hurt you.That framing of our emotions seems to be one\nof the things that works of art do for us,isn’t it?We seem to be able to come to terms with the\nsadness of human life, partly because we canrepresent it in ways that make it more meaningful—framed\nand isolated.To pleasure, we always say “Come again,”\nbut to knowledge, we say, “Thanks.”Once you’ve obtained the knowledge, that’s\nit.You’ve got it.The pleasure, you’ve had it once, but you\nwant it again.Especially in the case of works of art, the\nrepeatability of the pleasure is what it’sall about.But, perhaps there is knowledge in repetition.So, let’s just think about that for a moment.Though, I want to say something about art\nand virtue first.What is the moral value of art?What kind of moral improvement can art generate\nin us?Has it got a particular role in presenting\nthe moral world and improving our own engagementin it?Well, obviously, art is a source of moral\nexamples, but the work of art does not merelypresent the example.There are lots of examples which prompt you\nto sketch for yourself ideas of good behaviorand bad behavior.It puts us in a position of judgment.I mention there Henry James’s portrait of\nIsabelle Archer (which I’m hoping you youngpeople will be about to read, if you haven’t\nread it yet) in Portrait of a Lady, in whichHenry James presents to us a good woman who\nis also naïve and exploited by a cunningand evil man.James doesn’t judge these characters himself.He puts us in a position to make a judgment\nand to make the judgment through the eyesof Isabelle Archer.The reader gradually comes to understand her\nsituation as she comes to understand it.That’s real art.Henry James never says anything.He makes you think it, but think it for yourself.That might have a special moral value, mightn’t\nit?Rather than just telling you what to think,\nmorally, making you think it for yourselfso that it’s a course of education in the\nemotions that he’s directed at you.Well, that all looks quite plausible for fiction\nand for representational art, but what aboutabstract art?People think that abstract art—art which\ndoesn’t have a representational content—canalso have some kind of moral value.That’s what Beethoven was saying about his\nMissa Solemnis—and what many people sayabout music generally—that it is telling\nus something about our emotions by leadingus to feel secondhand, so to speak, what those\nemotions are.There’s a kind of emotional education going\non there, too.But then, there are real problems, and this\nis one that Richard Williams wanted me totalk about.It’s a very difficult one to talk about.What happens when you encounter a work of\nart that presents vice, but aestheticallyin such a way as to make the vice attractive?I take the example here of Salome.Here is the problem, as you remember, of Salome,\nthe story of the daughter of Herodias whodanced before the king.She coveted the head of John the Baptist (perhaps\nbecause her mother had put her up to it),and had finally persuaded the king to give\nit to her.In other words, she had persuaded the king\nto kill the prophet that he had been reluctantto kill up to that moment because of his manifest\nholiness.This was made into a play by Oscar Wilde,\na rather clever play, and then that was setto music by Ricard Strauss.His music is full of a distraught lasciviousness,\nbut it’s very beautiful and seductive.I won’t play it to you.I’ll leave it to you to encounter it.It’s all over YouTube, of course.This music kind of brings you to Salome’s\nside.You feel that somehow she’s in the grip\nof an emotion that she can’t deal with.She’s got to satisfy it, but as represented\nby Strauss and Oscar Wilde, Salome goes thewhole hog and takes hold of the head and kisses\nit.Here’s the kind of thing that you see in\nmodern opera productions.Modern opera productions are designed especially\nto be offensive to members of the Church ofthe Latter Day Saints, so don’t worry.They’re usually much worse than this, but\nhere is Salome, having sung her incredibleAria of sensual ecstasy over the severed head\nof John the Baptist, seizing it and kissingit in this unacceptable way.Well, most people would feel that’s going\ntoo far, and perhaps people did think thatit was going too far.This opera did have quite a bit of trouble\nin its early life, but now it’s part ofthe repertoire.And yet, it seems to take a kind of ghoulish\npleasure in artily perverted behavior, andthe music seems to put that behavior in a\nkind of enchanting light, because the musicis drawing you in all the time.You find similar things in other works of\nart of the mid-to-late 19th century, art thatrescues evil by making it seem beautiful.Baudelaire’s Fleur Du Mal (which I’m sure\nsome of you who’re doing French here willbe reading and studying) is a very good example\nof this.He takes the excesses and the degeneracies\nof life in a modern city and looks for a meaningthat lies concealed within them.He does this through incredibly powerful imagery\nand beautiful verse forms that make it lookas though there is a spiritual meaning behind\nall this that redeems it.The spiritual is revealed, even though what\nis described denies the possibility of thespiritual.It’s as though, by denying things in the\nright way, we can affirm them.I think that’s what Baudelaire himself thought,\nand often people have described him as a Christianpoet, precisely for this: he rescues from\nthe heart of corruption and despair that littlegerm of spiritual purity which lies in the\nimagery of his verse and which we take awayand then make to grow within us.I’m not sure if that is true, but it’s\nan interesting thought.In Shakespeare, of course, there’s a lot\nof evil—the evil of the character of Iagoin Othello, for example, and also Macbeth,\nwho is a self-doubting evil man.But, it’s straightforward.Shakespeare doesn’t expect you to be on\ntheir side in any way.He certainly doesn’t do a Salome on them,\nalthough at a certain point, there is a lotof sympathy for Macbeth.Milton’s Satan in Paradise Lost is another\nvery important example of an evil characterwho is so portrayed by the verse that you\ncannot fail to be on his side.His wounded pride is something you immediately\nidentify with, and you come to see that there’sa kind of nobility about it.This is what the verse is doing.Is this immoral verse, therefore, that’s\nbringing you to the side of Satan?Blake, in his illustrations for Paradise Lost,\nseems to think that.So, there are some other examples that I give\nyou there: Claggart, the Bosun in Herman Mellville’sTale of Billy Budd (another one that you’re\nprobably about to read), sexed and made intoa brilliant opera by Benjamin Britten.Then there’s Dimitri in The Brothers Karamazov,\nby Dostoevsky.What do we think about him?Is he just confused, or are we being, again,\nbrought into the world of a character whois unable to make moral judgments for himself?Are we also, perhaps, confused about whether\nwe can make those judgments?One of the questions that will arise here\nis: what is the distinction between moralart and moralizing art?Here is a piece of Russian revolutionary art\nfrom the 1917 revolution, which is manifestlymoralizing.It’s telling you that these people are obviously\nmistreated.So what?Is it saying anything that helps you to understand\nthat mistreatment, or to take a differentstance towards it?Or, is it just like a moral tale, just an\nillustration to something else?Many people feel that art shouldn’t moralize\nas directly as this.It’s too crude.It should be more like Henry James in The\nPortrait of a Lady, making you do the moralizingrather than doing the moralizing itself.Well, that may be so, but let’s go on.I want to say a little bit about beauty now.I’ve said some things about art’s relation\nto truth, something about its relation to goodnessIn both cases, it’s extremely complicated.It seems that there’s nothing simple that\nyou can say.What about beauty?There’s a certain kind of habit that arose,\nespecially in the late 19th century, connectedwith people like Oscar Wilde of putting aesthetic\nvalues first, saying that these are the thingsthat matter.Wilde famously said, “In matters of grave\nimportance, style, not sincerity, is the vital thing.\"And he lived his life, or at least pretended\nto live his life, as though that were hisguiding principle: to be elegant and soothing\nto the eye and to ignore all those simple,old-fashioned moral values which got in the\nway of that.But in his works of art, he didn’t think\nthat.To put aesthetic values first is, or might\nbe, a kind of immoralism.Osmond, who is the husband of Isabella Archer\nin The Portrait of a Lady, is somebody whoreally does put aesthetic values first, and\nhis delight in collecting beautiful thingsand living this aesthetic way of life has\nled him to great pecuniary need.He needs money, and she has money, so he marries\nher in order to get ahold of that money, andalso in order to collect her.She was beautiful, too, so he collects her\nas a beautiful object, but doesn’t love her.Oscar Wilde does a slightly cruder version\nof the same idea in the character of LordHenry Wotton in The Picture of Dorian Gray.There are two sides to the aesthetic experience.There’s the kind of relishing side, and\nthe exploring side.Relishing a beautiful work of art or a sublime\nwork of music is something that you can dowithout necessarily exploring the depths of\nthe human heart, even though the work of arttouches on them.And, perhaps, this kind of aestheticism means\nforgetting the cognitive dimension of aestheticpleasures and realizing that they’re not\njust sensory pleasures.They’re not just pleasures in the way you\nexperience things.They’re also directed toward a vision of\nthe world.Each of those goals that I’ve talked about—truth\nand goodness and beauty—is important becausethey are what you’re focusing on, but they\nseem to reduce art itself to an inadequatemeans.They seem to leave out the aesthetic dimension.Only when combined in a unity do these values—the\nkind of truth and the kind of goodness ofwhich beauty is the sign—mark out a path\nfor art.If beauty is the way in which truth is presented,\nthe way in which goodness comes to your consciousness,then we seem to have something like an account\nof the value of art.There’s also a question here about meaning\nand form.The meaning of a work of art—and this goes\nback to Baumgarten—lies in the form andis not really detachable from it.If you try to translate a poem into straight\nprose, say what it means, and give its equivalentin simple language, then you lose the meaning.The meaning is not just what it says; it also\nresides in the form and is not detachablefrom that.This is a little bit like religion and revealed\ntruth.In much religion, there’s a promise of another\nway of seeing the world, what we might calla God’s-eye perspective.It’s not just that there are theological\ndoctrines, such as: God exists, Christ isthe son of God, etc., although those are important\nto the Christian religion.There is also revealed truth when you meditate\non these things, and suddenly you see theworld in another way, as though from God’s\nperspective.Perhaps in those circumstances, the form of\nthe language that you’re studying in a sacredtext, for instance, is very important, just\nas it is in poetry.That’s why those great texts have been preserved,\nnot just for what they say but for their wayof saying it.And again, in religion, as in art, repetition\nis very important.You repeat the service every week.You say the Lord’s Prayer every day.If somebody said to you, “What a waste of\ntime.You’ve said it once.Why say it again?You know what it means.You know the words.What’s all this about?”You know that that’s not what prayer is\nfor.Prayer is about putting you back into the\nrelation with God that you’re constantlyslipping out of.Therefore, it demands repetition.And there are truths that have to be rehearsed\nif they are to be owned and in order for youto know exactly how to feel something and\nwhat to feel towards the world around you.You might feel you know it one moment, but\nyou’ve lost it the next.And getting the right words helps you to recapture\nit.That idea of revealed truth that comes to\nyou through repetition (as in prayer) is abit like the aesthetic experience as I’ve\nbeen describing it.Perhaps it gives you a secular version of\nrevealed truth.That’s what people like Nietzsche and Wagner\nthought.They went further and thought that, actually,\nart could therefore be a substitute for religion.That’s what we really should be now devoting\nourselves to.We have art, as Nietzsche says, so as not\nto die of despair.Art is still there, giving us this meaning,\neven when we’ve lost faith.Finally, some thoughts about the intrinsic\nvalues of art.Poetry and plays and paintings present imaginary\nworlds.Representational art gives us an opening onto\nthe world of the imagination, and they allrescue their subject matter from a purely\ninstrumental conception of its significance.Things portrayed in art are not portrayed\nas useful.They’re portrayed as interesting for their\nown sake.They’re rescued from the instrumentality.That’s why every allusion matters; the image\nis a distillation of the thing depicted.Poetry and painting work in the same way.Here is a landscape by Van Gogh, which everybody\nknows, probably.The brush strokes there imbue the landscape\nwith an observing consciousness.They are marks of the moral being for whom\nthis is not a thing, but a vision.To absorb that, you recognize that it’s\na very long way from the way a field of wheatwith a flock of rooks above it would look.This doesn’t look in any way realistic,\nbut somehow it has a power that it wouldn’thave if it were wholly realistic, because\nthe brush strokes of the painter imbue thatlandscape with his own soul.It’s as though the imagination of the painter\nhad reworked the thing that he’s paintingso that it isn’t just the thing.It’s also that thing distilled into his\nown consciousness.In the imagination, we are thinking about\nabsent and nonexistent things, but the consciousnessinvolved is a creator of its own object, as\nin that case of Van Gogh.The imagination is something that we can will.I can ask you to imagine some things.I can say, “Imagine a field of wheat.”You won’t be able to imagine it like Van\nGogh did, but nevertheless, you will summonit up in obedience to that order.That is an interesting thing.Through works of the imagination, we bring\ndistant things into close relation with each other.That’s what we do in figures of speech,\nin poetry.We’re bringing things into relation with\neach other.The brush strokes in the painting bring a\nhuman action into relation with a landscape.These imaginary worlds that we create can\nstrike us as true, or as false, and I wantto contrast that Van Gogh with a painting\nby Thomas Kinkade.This is one of his visions of paradise.This is a controversial painter, as you know.Van Gogh died in poverty.Kinkade died leaving $53 million, and died\nof drink.I think 1 in 10 Americans have a Kinkade above\ntheir mantelpiece, because it’s a soothing thing.For some people, this is a vision of what\npainting should be.It’s much truer to the appearance of things\nthan Van Gogh, but there’s a question about it.What is that question?Many people would say there’s a falsification\nbehind this painting.I don’t want to cast judgment on it, but\njust say a few things about it.Why does this strike so many people as false?In one sense, it’s truer than the Van Gogh.It’s closer to the way things actually look.But the falsification, if it exists, is the\nfalsification of the observer rather thanof the observed.It shows a world presented through a veil\nof self-congratulatory sentiment.That’s at least what the critic would say.It tells you that you’re a good person and\nno further efforts need to be made.Van Gogh is not telling you that at all.He’s telling you that life is rough, and\nyou need to make efforts even to see this.It tells you that further efforts need be\nmade, and that meaning lies in the forms and colors.There are pastel shades smeared over the landscape\nlike a disease.Well, is that right?I’ll leave it to you to think.But, this brings us back to the parallel between\nart and religion.Religion provides us with truth, but it’s\nnot just straightforward, literal truth aboutthe way the world is.There are all sorts of things that we believe,\nbut there’s a much more important dimension to it.A spiritual truth tells us how things really\nare for us and what our position really isin the world of human relations and human\nemotions.In religion, we recognize that there’s no\nredemption through falsehood, and the sameseems to be true of art.That’s what those two pictures, I think,\nlead us to suppose.Art, too, has its own way of presenting the\nspiritual truth of things, and if it falsifies,then it doesn’t produce the kind of redemptive\nconsolation that we’re looking for.This might explain sadness in the works of\nart.It might explain tragedy.In tragedy, you go to the depths, but you\nfind a kind of rescue there.Only if you go to those depths, however, will\nyou be rescued.Enjoying sadness for its own sake, in just\na sentimental and pretense of grief, is notgoing to help, but in actually going to the\nfull encounter with mortality and what itmeans, as in a real tragedy, maybe there is\na help.Maybe that does take us to a point where we\ncan learn something that we need to learn,and learn it in our hearts and in our emotions,\nlearn to bear this thing.Perhaps that is why we want to go to tragedies\nagain and again.So, art is certainly not going to be any help\nto us if it loses sight of what we are andwhat we need.And we do recognize that there is a distinction\nbetween true and false emotion.False emotion comes about when the ”I”\neclipses the “you.”Most real love is about you, the other.Sentimental love pretends to be about you,\nbut it’s really about me—me feeling thiswonderful thing and showing thereby my moral\ndistinction.We find that kind of sentimentality in art,\nand also we find art which challenges thatsentimentality.Thomas Kinkade is all about me being a lovely\nperson, whereas Van Gogh is all about the“you” that appears to him, even in a field\nof wheat—because, of course, that’s Godwho’s appearing to him.As I go back to what I said about Henry James,\nremember that real art doesn’t judge; itopens the world to judgment and \ninspires that judgment in us.I wanted to finish with some difficult examples.In The Brothers Karamazov (another book that\nyou might be on the verge of reading, or onthe verge of not bothering to read) Dostoevsky\ndoesn’t judge.He invites us to judge in his stead, but what\nhe’s inviting us to judge is a whole communityof people who don’t judge, but just do in\nthe most horrifying way.And this is a very challenging book.Dickens, in The Old Curiosity Shop, the death\nof little Nell lays it on with a trowel.They’re trying to make us weep over the\ndeath of this innocent little girl who’sforgiving everybody for dying before her time,\nand it’s not only unrealistic and implausible,but real schmaltz.Oscar Wilde famously said about this, “A\nman must have a heart of stone not to laughat the death of little Nell.”Which is a brilliant way of summarizing it.Salome, though, is a realization in imagined\nform of a grim state of mind—a really horriblestate of mind—but realized without any negative\njudgment.That’s the great problem: this is music\nof sublime power which simply happens to havebeen applied to this horrible situation.Strauss was able to do that.He once said that, “If you gave me a railway\ntime table, I’d set it to the most beautifulmusic.”Is this a fault?Again, just to conclude, to get you to compare\ntwo portrayals of the crucifixion.Grunewald, is the famous Isenheim Alter Piece\nin Germany, gives a hyper realistic portrayalof the horror of the crucifixion, such that\nnobody can say that he’s denying the realityof this or that he’s turning away, or falsifying.There’s no falsification.But, somehow it leaves you without hope.It’s as though it really is just that: the\ndeath and destruction of a person.Whereas, in Tintoretto’s case, you see the\nmost extraordinary sequence of events in which,actually, not just of the resurrection of\nChrist, but the redemption of mankind is foretoldin every detail of the painting.And this, therefore, is not a horrifying painting\nat all, but a consoling one, and one in whichyou see just why it is that Christ had to\nbe sacrificed.From Grunewald, you don’t know why it is.It’s just yet another inexplicable and horrifying\naccident of human degenerate life.Those are two examples that you might take\naway to think about, and I think I’ve goneon for long enough now.I can invite some questions.Thank you.We'd invite you, please, to use the microphone. We have a few minutes for questions. Then, Dr. Scruton hasagreed to autograph some books. They are available for purchase. If you'd like, he'll be there for a few minutesand would be happy to sign some for you as soon as the Q&A is over.We'll go about 10 or 15 minutes.Q&A\nQuestion: Myquestion is this: I have a dilemma as a listener\nto music, or other art forms, when I knowthat this particular artist is, perhaps, living\na life of dissipation, or is immoral in someway, and yet the art they’re creating seems\nto be an art full of light.Is that my difficulty that I’m not seeing\nthe dissipation in their art?Is that something that I should be judging\nor listing to that?Scruton: You can live an immoral life, and\nas it were, compensate for it by putting allthe virtue that you fail to have into your\nworks of art.And this is not unusual, actually.Quite a lot of the romantic artists were like\nthat.Schubert led a fairly dissolute life, but\nyou won’t hear any of it in his music.You’ll hear tragedy and pain and suffering,\nbut also the pure love of the human condition.So, there isn’t any reason to think this\nis not possible.One of the problems these days is that we\nknow too much about artists, and they do tendto live in a slightly wild way.Not all of them, but there are very few great\nartists whom one can imagine living a respectable,middle class, married life with 2.5 children\nand dressed in a three-piece suit every day.It just doesn’t seem to work that way, but\nthere were some in the past.They weren’t necessarily the best.Question: So, divorce the art from the artist?Scruton: Yeah.I think that, in the literature on this, there\nare quite a few people who write about thingscalled the intentional fallacy.It’s a fallacy to think that works of art\nhave to be understood in terms of the intentionof the artist.And there are others who write about the death\nof the author: the author disappears behindhis work.All we have is his work.Dostoevsky was a completely degenerate character,\nbut his novels are imbued with the highestkind of Christian orthodoxy.Question: I’m curious more about what you\nwere saying on aesthetics, and specificallywhen you talked about relishing vs. exploring.What I interpreted that to mean was relishing\nin the style or the specific manner of theart and then allowing yourself not to be confined\nto that.Is that what you meant, or is there something\nmore?Scruton: I meant that there are two different\nattitudes to art.The first is the attitude of the connoisseur,\nwho wants to experience new things and evermorerefined emotions and enjoys those emotions\nfor their own sake, and regards himself assomehow a kind of virtuoso of feeling.There is that response, which is sort of the\naestheticist response, and then there’sthe response of somebody who sees the work\nof art as a means of exploring the world,something that’s taking him on an adventure\ninto knowledge and into the moral reality,which is a more healthy attitude.That’s all I wanted to say.Question: Okay, and you’re saying they need\nto be merged together?Scruton: Well, both are there, but the question\nis: which are you going to emphasize?The emphasizing of the relishing can lead\nto this kind of narcissistic concentrationon the self.Question: My question is, basically, that\nwe have a lot of art that is great and wonderfulart, but has been tarnished not by the artist’s\nrepresentation himself, but by society.Certain pieces of art, such as the operas\nof Wagner (or some of the less politicallycorrect works of Gilbert and Sullivan, or\nother artists in all different medias) havebeen tarnished, not because of who these artists\nwere (well, maybe somewhat in the case ofWagner) but because society has deemed these\npieces of art “immoral” based on how theyare used or how they are viewed in the light\nof today’s society.What are your thoughts on that, and how ought\nwe to respond to that kind of art today?Scruton: Well, of course what you mean is\nthat works of art can pick up bad associationsthrough their use, and it’s not very different\nfrom what the first question was about.Does this affect the intrinsic value of the\nwork of art, or is it just an extraneous thing?We all know, in the case of Wagner, that he\nwas tainted with the brush of anti-Semitism,and that was his fault.He certainly was anti-Semitic.He wrote the most horrible things about the\nJews, but he wrote them a hundred years beforeHitler without envisaging anything like that.But the Nazis took a serious interest in his\noperas and always presented them as thoughthey were celebrations of the Nazi ideal of\nthe Arian race.And this did lead to many people being totally\nput off them and thinking that they can onlybe used in that way because there is something\nin them that lends them to that use.That’s one of the great questions for Wagner\nlovers: can you rescue his works from thataccusation?This is an important question for me, because\nI just tried to do this with a book I’vejust written on \"The Ring of the Nibelung,\"\nwhich, at least in my view, does rescue Wagner.Question: I’m glad that someone’s going\nto rescue Wagner, because I love Wagner’sRings.Scruton: Well, there you are.You’re on the right lines.All you have to do now is save up and buy\nthis book.Question: Poor college student in Provo.Probably couldn’t afford it.Question: What’s the \nmost beautiful color, objectively?Scruton: The most beautiful color, objectively,\nis the pale violet used by Tiepolo in paintingthe lips of degenerate women.Question: What’s the most truthful one?Scruton: I think that one is equally truthful.Question: Back to the Kinkade and the Van\nGogh.Between the two of them, I think I’ll take\nhome the Van Gogh.I think I’m with you on that, and my response\nto the Kinkade that you presented, when Isaw it, was a kind of revulsion.I’m kind of perplexed, though, by a pang\nof sympathy that I imagine myself feelingfor someone who might look at the Kinkade\n(which I would say “Kitschy” is what Iwould call that).I can imagine someone of religious sensibility,\nmaybe not my kind of religious sensibility,looking at the Kinkade and feeling a kind\nof genuine moral edification from a picturethat I would call kitschy, and I’m curious\nabout my own reluctance to dismiss it entirelyout of hand for that reason.Scruton: This is a very important observation.Of course, the natural description of it is\n“kitsch”, but it’s a very difficultconcept to define, or to put your finger on\nexactly what’s wrong with it.It is even more difficult to put your finger\non what’s wrong with the person who loveskitsch.Maybe there’s nothing wrong with that person\nat all; it’s just that he or she has notaste in art.But it doesn’t follow that his religious\nemotions directed towards the Kinkade, forthat reason, are false.And this is the real question.There’s a very beautiful story by James\nJoyce called “The Dead,” which is thelast story in Dubliners (another book that\nthe young people are about to read), in whichhe describes a reunion of people whose emotions\nare all wrapped up with sentimental songsand weak little memories of the past, but\nthere’s a real regret and a real love in thereThey are directing all their emotions through\nkitsch objects and kitsch language, and yetthe story itself is completely redeemed from\nkitsch.It’s about kitsch, but not itself kitsch.That’s a very interesting revelation, because\nit’s a forgiving story which shows that,indeed, people can latch their emotions onto\nthese unworthy objects, and that we who seekto see through them are maybe actually not\nsuch good people as the people who love thosethings.Question: The sort of corollary would be a\nkind of malicious judgment that I might seeon someone that I see in a European museum\nwith their guidebooks, knowledgeably scrutinizinga religious painting that I suspect means\nas little to them as an irreligious painting,however aesthetically formed it may be.Scruton: Yes, but in the end we do want the\ncontent of a religious painting—the religiouscontent—to somehow match the aesthetic experience.The Tintoretto isn’t just a beautiful painting.It’s a triumph of religious thinking, as\nwell.Question: I loved what you had to say about\nrepetition and prayer, that “truth mustbe rehearsed if it is to be owned, knowing\nwhat to feel” and that prayer puts you backinto the relation you are constantly slipping\nout of.My question is two-fold: what would you say\nabout the role of imagination in prayer?And then: what would you say—because, on\nthe one hand I completely agree with you aboutthe importance and primacy of form in prayer—but\nwhat would you say to people who suspect thatform becomes rote and belies sincerity?Scruton: Form becomes rote?Question: Yes, that somehow form could take\naway from the sincerity that we are striving for.Scruton: Yes.It’s difficult.There’s a famous Victorian hymn that begins\n“teach us how to pray aright” We all lackwords with which to pray for the simple reason\nof the huge distance between us and the object,and that distance can be overcome just like\nthat with the right words.All religions have those basic, rote-learned\nprayers which help the people to overcomethe distance—something like the Hail Mary.Every Catholic is able to put himself immediately\nin the presence of God with that prayer.Or the Hear, O Israel of the Jews, and so\non.We need also to make our particular requests\nand establish our particular relation withGod, and there imagination is important.But, on the other hand, it’s a little bit\nlike the Kinkade example, again.We might just end up uttering total platitudes\nand clichés.God must think to himself, “I’ve heard\nall that so many times, and I gave you thisreally good prayer.Why don’t you say that?”There are real questions as to how to go forward\nwith the imagination and how to go forwardsafely, really, and I think that’s one reason\nwhy religious poetry is so beautiful to us.Someone like George Herbert gives us new prayers\nof his own which also correspond to bits ofus which haven’t been put into the language\nof prayer before.I think that’s all I can say, though.Question: I’m hoping to major in communications,\nand I’m fascinated by how you speak of theimportance of ruminating over art and allowing\nit to teach us different truths.I feel like in the world today (especially\nmy generation—the “I” generation asthey say—the social media generation), it\nseems to be more focused on rapidity of sharinginformation and less on reflection.It’s more about who can get what out first.I guess my question is: as a man who has spent\nhis entire life studying aesthetics and appreciatingart, what would you say to someone in my shoes\nwho finds themselves in this world that seemsto discourage this type of artistic reflection?Scruton: This is a very important question.My own children have this question, obviously,\nas they’re slightly younger than you.There are two things to say: one is that,\nof course, social media has changed the natureof communication, because it’s taken away\nthe filters through which people communicated.When I was young, to communicate something\nreally important (like your love for someone)you would write a letter.There would be lots of crossings out, and\nthen you would do another version.The written word filters out all the clichés\nand all the nonsense, and eventually, if you’relucky, you got something that she can keep\nand treasure.Or, if you’re not lucky, to throw away.That’s the kind of filter that forces you\nto improve what you’re saying to the pointwhere you, yourself are conscious of what\nyou’re saying.As you know from Twitter (I said I wouldn’t\nrefer to Trump, but this is such an obviousexample), there you can just throw out into\nthe world half-formed thoughts in which allyour incompetence and illiteracy are perpetuated.Should you do that?Maybe that’s the way things will be.But if you’re studying communications, what\nyou should be addressing is the question ofwhether you can keep the value of these immediate\ncommunications—of Twitter and Facebook andso on—and gradually improve the form.Can you introduce a filter?The only filter on Twitter is the number of\ncharacters, but on Facebook you could perhapsstart a movement whereby people learn how\nto despise the badly arranged wall and theilliterate words and so on.Introduce criticism into social media.That might be a step forward.I admit, it won’t get you to the point where\nT.S.Eliot might have joined Facebook.Alternatively, of course, there is the possibility\nof not using social media at all.There is a real question then of whether you\ngain from that or lose.You certainly gain a better quality of contacts\nbut far less quantity, and for many youngpeople, that’s the problem.It’s the quantity of contacts and the immediacy\nof the relations with them which is reallythe temptation.I don’t really have anything to say that\nwould give you a cause for hope.This social media is now with us, and that’s\nthe way we’re going to be governed, it seems,as well as the way in which we establish relations\nwith each other.Maybe in the end, there’ll be small communities\nof savages who don’t use these things, likeme, but our circle of acquaintances will get\nsmaller and smaller until we can all be containedin one museum.",
