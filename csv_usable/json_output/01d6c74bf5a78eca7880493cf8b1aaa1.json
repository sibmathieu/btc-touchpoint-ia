wrong about a lot ofthings but luckily we have panels likethis next one to do a lot of floodbusting from all that energymisinformation that's out there socoming up next we have how Bitcoinmining incentivizes renewable energybuild out moderated by Natalie Brunellhost of coin stories and hard moneyplease give her a very warm welcome[Applause]all right it's hard to follow thatum but I hope you guys are ready foranother awesome panel with some greatexpertsso I used to work in mainstream newsmedia that's how I transitioned intoBitcoin media content and commentary andone of the biggest things that I seewith my former industry is fud fearuncertainty doubt about bitcoin's energyuse I think it's a very important topicas we battle sort of this new Narrativeof ESG and just how much energy is beingused by by Bitcoin and what that's doingto our our world and so I'm excited tohave this panel but first we're going tohave a special presentation from yaronmellorude he's a research analyst atArcane research and the presentation isgoing to be about how Bitcoin miningincentivizes renewable energy build outso please give a hand to euron[Applause]hello everyone I'm yaron malarud I'm aresearch analyst focusing on Bitcoinmining and today I'm going to talk abouthow bit commanding incentivizesrenewable energy build outfirst I'm going to explain what exactlymakes Bitcoin honors unique energyconsumersBitcoin mining is price responsiveinterruptible location agnostic modularand portablethis unique combination of these fiveproperties makes Bitcoin miners uniquelyflexible energy consumers that can solveseveral energy problems I will nowexplain all these propertiesbid commanders are price responsiveenergy consumers around 80 percent ofthe operating cost of Bitcoin mining isenergyso Bitcoin owners are always monitoringtheir energy price and their financialincentivized to respond to changes inthis energy priceif a Bitcoin miner always knows it's umit'sum energy price what energy price itshould shut off its machine set so ifthe energy price goes above this levelthe Bitcoin manner will shut off itsmachinesBitcoin mining is also an interruptibleprocess this interruptability of Bitcoinmining becomes clear When comparing aconventional data center to a Bitcoinmining operation on the left side hereis one of Facebook's data centers it isnot interruptibleit protects in many Advanced processesthat you can't easily pause and it mustalso maintain uptime due to itscustomers a Bitcoin mining operation onthe other hand is interruptible it onlydoes one thing solves the shot 356algorithm and it sells hashes to theBitcoin Network the Bitcoin Networkconsists of thousands of servers aroundthe worldand it is not dependent on any one ofthese servers so this servers can shutdown if if they need to and it takesless than one second to shut down a bitcommanding Farmbid commanding operations are alsolocation agnostic a Bitcoin miner onlyneeds cheap energy and an internetconnectionthis makes it possible to establish aBitcoin mining operation practicallyanywhere in the world and for the firsttime in history it's possible to takethe energy consumer directly to theenergy sourcea bit commanding operation can also bescaled modularlyit all depends on the number of machineslet's say you have five megawatts ofavailable energy okay then you get 1500Bitcoin mining machines if you have 10megawatts well then scale it up to 3000machines so you can exactly match youravailable energy with the Bitcoin miningload of the exact same sizeyou can also design a Bitcoin miningoperation to be portableso on the left side here we see aportable Bitcoin mining operation wherethey have designed the operation insidethe shipping containers that are veryeasy and cheap to ship aroundthis increases the portability and thelocation agnosticism of miningso the unique combination of these fivepropertiesand makes Bitcoin manners uniquelyflexible energy consumersuh that can be used as energy tools tosolve several energy problemsone of the things Bitcoin miners can dois to incentivize renewable energy buildoutI will not now talk about how bitcoinerscan strengthen electricity grids so thatwe can safely integrate more wind andsolarwe're in the middle of an energytransition where we replace acontrollable fossil fuels withnon-controllable weather dependentrenewable energy sources like wind andsolarthe International Energy agencyestimates that in 2040 42 percentof our electricity will come from windand solarso the energy supply of the future willbecome much more variable and weatherdependentand in an electricity system the demandand Supply must always be in perfectbalancethat only means that when the energySupply will become more variable we needto adjust the supply after the demandand the demand must become more flexiblethe concept of a flexible energyconsumer that adjusts its consumptionafter the available demand is calleddemand response and the InternationalEnergy agency estimates that in 2030 weneed to have 500 gigawatts of demandresponse capacity globally that's upfrom only 50 gigawatts in 2020 a 10xincreasethe International Energy agency shouldlook to Bitcoin mining for this capacitybecause Bitcoin mining is the bestalternative we have for demand responseBitcoin manners are able to instantlystop consuming during energy scarcityand they're also financiallyincentivized to do soso bit commanders are phenomenal demandresponse resources that can help tointegrate this variable renewable energyin a safe wayBitcoin mining also improves economicsof wind and solara large share of wind and solar willlead to more wasted energy wasted energyisvery very cheap and is thereforenutrition for Bitcoin minershere we see a map of the development inin percentage of hours of negative powerprices in the US between 2015 and 2021during this period the central part ofthe U.S saw a massive development ofwind powerand we can seethat during this period as this wind wasdeveloped the percentage of hours withnegative power prices drasticallyincreased this is due to how a wind bidsits energy into the market at zeromarginal cost of productionthis is very very negative for theeconomics of wind projects and alsosolar projects and it can prevent thefurther development of search Proprojectsone example is West Texas which hasabundant wind and solar resourcesWest Texas has seen a massivedevelopment of wind energy the previousyears and also now see an increasinglyshare of solar as wellthe problem is that West Texas is adesert and it barely leaves people thereso you have all this energy produced bywind and solarbut you have almost no local demandin West Texas there's also too littletransmission lines to transport thiselectricity to the East part of thestateso you get all this stranded wind andsolar resources when wind and solarproduces at its maximumthis is all this previously wastedenergy has led to a massive developmentof Bitcoin mining facilities in WestTexas as you can see on the mapmost of Texas Bitcoin mining facilitiesare located in the West in the middle ofthe desert close to this wind and solarprojects and that's not a coincidenceBitcoin miners are helping the economicsof this wind and solar projects in WestTexasmany people talk about how Bitcoinmining incentivizes wind and solarbut I don't hear that much about how itcan unlock stranded hydrangeothermals soI'm going to talk a little bit aboutthat as wellhydro and geothermal resources haveseveral common characteristicsthey are often very often strandedenergy sources they require largeCapital Investments it's not possible tobuild out these energy sources in amodular way and they're often locatedfar from the demandbecause of this these energy sources areoften undevelopedlet's say that you have the possibilityto build a 100 megawatt Hydro powerplant in in a regionbut you have only 50 megawatts of localdemandthat is not enough to justify thedevelopment of this hydropower plantwhere can you get the the 50 megawattsof access capacity you need to developthis plantyou can bring in Bitcoin minersand by bringing in Bitcoin miners youhave uh have enough energy demand tojustify the development of this uh thisprojectthis will this will give the localpopulation access to 50 megawatts ofenergy which they otherwise would nothavethis is particularly interesting indeveloping countries especially inAfrica Africa has a massive energypotentialonly 11 percent of the hydro potentialin Africa is developed and less than onepercent of the geothermal energypotential in Africa is developedI believe that Bitcoin miners in thefuture can incentivize development ofmore Hydro angiothermal projects inAfricaand thereby unlock massive amounts ofenergy for the continentyesterday Obi talked about how Bitcoinmining in Africa already unlocks smallerscale Hydro projects but I believe thatas Bitcoin becomes biggerand a bigger part of society we willalso see Bitcoin mining financing largerhydro and geothermal projects in Africathis presentation is based on a researchreport published by Arcane research onemonth ago which is called higher Bitcoinmining can transform the energy industryyou can find a full report at arcane.nogive it a read and thank you for yourattention[Applause]",
