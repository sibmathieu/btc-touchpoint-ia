which readsvery much like a regular email addressthat people can then send to and you canreceive funds and you can also link itup with your own existing lightningwallet and your own lightning node ifyou have one running so prerequisitesherebasically maybe you want to just befamiliar with how to use lightningtransactions how to send and receive buteven still even if you're notum this will get you started and I willmake references to any uh videos thatcan be helpful along the way as we getthis set up pretty much if you're if youwant to be utilizing Bitcoin and you'reinterested in using it on things likeTwitter and YouTube and Reddit and othersocial platforms and I'm sure they'llexpand to more then yeah just followalong and uh follow with me as we goso this is the main Albi page it is getalby.com a-l-b-y uh and pretty much allyou're going to be doing is I'm onChrome browser right now uh if you go totheir website and you hit install Albyit will take you to the Chrome web storeand uh it's already installed here butit'll just say install uh on Chrome andit will ask you for permission andyou'll get this a little icon here AlbyBitcoin lightning walletum and so that's pretty much all youneed to do click a button in the Chromeweb store and you will be set so let'stake a look at what happens when we goand click on that so that's going toopen up a new window for us and it saysHey power of Bitcoin in your browser youcan send in one click lightningtransactions all happen in your browserno alternative tab or QR scanning oranything needed there's no more annoyingpaywalls you can Define individualbudgets for websites to enable seamlesspayment streams no more paywalls againprivacy first use lightning toauthenticate and control your privacyand then it's free and open source sothe code is completely open source itcan be audited by anyone no stats ortrackers you are in control and sobasically we can just get started rightaway here by clicking the get startedbuttonso when we click first you're going toset up and unlock password and you'regoing to double check it so I'll do thatright nowand then we'll hit nextnow it says do you have a lightningwallet and I'm going to switch to justthe full monitor only so you can see allthe options here but nonetheless you canuse you can create or log in to youralbe account you can use lnd if you havean l d node running Ln bits lnd Hub bluewallet eclair Citadel umbral my nodestart 9 raspy Blitz Bitcoin Beach walletBitcoin jungle wall and BTC pay serverthere is a bunch here so that's supersuper awesome so if you are anindividual that does not yet have anylightning wallet uh then your easiestoption just to get started here isprobably going to be the Alby wallet orblue wallet um as those take minimalsetup you can get running right away nowdown the line I'd say it's a good goalto maybe look into running your own notein terms of ease of use and just havingan interface that is not too difficultto parse umbral is is a good way to berunning a node but again I'm runningI've got a Mino and I've got start nineum I've got a rasp by Blitz obviouslybecause I'm doing a lot of tutorials soif you're curious about any of those Iwill list videos to them all in the shownotes and we will be looking at how toconnect those things later on but forease of use today let's go ahead andlet's choose the Alby wallet and let'sassume that you have none of this otherinfrastructure set up at the moment soI'll go ahead and click that says okayyou're going to create or log into yourAlbee account so I'm going to use aan email address hereand then down below it says choose yourlighting address which is optional but Iwant a lightning address this is goingto be an easy way for people to send mepayments sohopefullyI can get BTC sessions at get albie.comlet's hit continueall right it says awesome you're readyto go you have I now have BTC sessionsat get lb.com thankfully nobody snaggedthat from me beforehand uh it says nowyou've connected your wallet would youlike to go through a tutorial let's takea look and say give it a try nowall right so it says uh get to get toknow the power of the Bitcoin lightningNetwork in your browser here's what youneed to know uh to get started sothere's a variety of websites and youcan approve them uh if it wants toaccess your lightning functionality forthe first time you'll be a pro promptedto approve the site you can confirmpayments whenever there's a paymenthappening so when a website requests apayment you will be prompted forconfirmation directly in your browser noQR code scanning nothing like that youalso get to set a budget for eachwebsite if you so choose the budget hereit says you can give websites a budgetwhenever the website then requests apayment the wallet will act on yourbehalf and automatically pay invoicesuntil the budget is used experience yourfavorite online content withoutinterruption you can track all of yourtransactions manage budget allowancesand keep track of all the lightningwebsites you've used and you can log inwith lightning so you can forgetusernames and passwords log in with yourlightning all using Ln URL auth andwe'll be taking a look at that in alittle bitand so it says try now here's a simpledemo that'll requests 25 sets try itmultiple times and test the budgetfeatures so we're going to say payit says hey uh do you want to allow getAlby to request approval transactionsand requests invoices and lightninginformation so this would be a promptthat you get when you get to a websitethat's requesting a paymentwe'll say connect it says hey uh 25 SATsis what's being asked for and I can sayit gives meum basically a general idea of what thatis in dollars it's it's a very smallamount so it doesn't even register as asa as a full Penny and then on top ofthat it gives a description and I canremember and set a budget if I so chooseuh so I'll just I'll click that there mybudget yeah let's just leave it at 250sets which around five cents so I'll saypayand of course right now I'm going to getan error message but this is what itlooks like when it says uh when you wantto pay but of course I do not have anyfunds in my wallet so we'll go ahead anddo that now uh so we'll hit cancel hereand there we go okay so let's take alook now at our lb wallet so it sayshey here is your wallet we have a dropdown we can add new accounts manageaccountsum we canuh send receive there's settingsfeedback help we can lock the wallet andif we get back out of this page we justhave kind of a general again send andreceive uh our recent transactions andany incoming transactions so let's takea look at how to actually fund our lbwallet and get using it right awayso for this part of the video in orderto fund get Alby I'm going to beutilizing Moon wallet to send funds toAlby all right this is a mobile walletand the beautiful thing about it is ifyou've never used lightning payments andyou don't have a lightning wallet butyou do have Bitcoin well it's verysimple in that you can send a regularBitcoin payment to Moon wallet and thenyou can send it out as a lightningpayment so you don't have to do any ofthe thinking of lightning channels andall the stuff that goes on in thebackground with lightning to get it towork it's pretty simple so again just tokind of show you what this wallet lookslike very simply when it's all set upthere's a send and receive button andwhen I do hit receive in Moon wallet itwill show a regular Bitcoin address thatI can send to but there's also alightning tab on the other side that Ican tap if I want to receive a lightningpayment nonetheless if you have Bitcoinand you want to get it into to lightningthen just download Moon wallet send aregular Bitcoin transaction to it andthen you'll be able to send out to Albyand fund that walletso what we're going to do here is let'ssee the full screen again we'll jump toAlby now we don't even really need toswitch tabs or nonetheless we'll hit theAlby uh extension there and we'll justhit the back button we're going to hitreceive how many satoshi's do we want toreceive so I'm going to send over aboutfive thousand satoshi's it's about adollar at the time of recording thisvideo and you can put a note here soI'll just put it's coming from my moonwallet and I'm gonna hit create invoiceand so that creates this invoice herewhich I can then scan with my moonwallet so just on on my moon wallet hereI'm going to hit the send button and uhand I'll show you a little bit closerhere but uh in the top right there's alittle square that I'm going to tap andthat will open up my cameraand now I can scan the code that is onthe screen that just popped upbeforehand and I will get an invoice onmy phone that says heydo you want to send 5000 SATs so I'mgoing to tap that send button off screenhere will bring up our Albi wallet andwe'll see what happens so I'll hit sendoff it goespayment received so our funds are nowreceived in our albu wallet we now haveaccess to 5000 sets and it can be usedon websites to tip people however we seefitand again side note I will have a linkdown below to a full tutorial on how touse Moon wallet but I didn't want tospend an entire video how to use anotherwallet while we're exploring Alby soanyways links down below for thatlet's do a little bit more navigationhere with an Alby so again this is justget alby.com but on the main page herethey have a few things they have valuefor value for podcasters obviously theinstall button which we saw before butthe dashboard is another thing you canclick on so when I click here it willask you to log in if you've navigatedaway from the page uh and you would justuse your email address and the passwordthat you had made up before but you'llsee this dashboard here and you will seeany previous payments you can navigateto wallet it'll let you know how muchyou've got there it'll also sayuh wallet connection credentials you canaccess this remotely with something likeZeus mobile or blue wallet so you canconnect a mobile wallet to your Albeeaccount for when you're on the go and itdoes have connection credentials we'llget back to that you can also connectthis for podcasting 2.0 and uh andactually get yourself set up to receiveboosts if you have a podcast that youcreate yourself so creators you can usethe credentials down below I'm not goingto scroll to them right now and I havecovered podcasting 2.0 uh in anothervideo I'll link that down below butthese same lessons apply there and itwill have all of the relevantinformation to paste in uh to thepodcasting 2.0 application to getyourself set up and then finally if yougo over to settings you basically haveaccount settings email password all ofthat you can also check out your Albipage in which you can add a name and animage so I willgive myself a name on my lb page andwe'll get a quick image going in thereand we'll just hit updateall right let's take a lookokay there we go so that you can createyourself a tip page here and again itends up being get alby.com P slashwhatever your username is and it hasdefault amounts where you can tap acertain amount of sets and you can leavea message and send satoshi's to anybodythat has Albie so you can link this on awebsite whatever you like there okayand finally if we navigate back tosettings again there's the option toconnect your own nodeand you would simply paste in theprovided uh the provided credentialshere and it says Please provide theconnection details to your lnd nodeagain this information will be found onyour lightning node we'll look intocreating another account and connectinga node momentarily but I just wanted togo through the navigation of everythinghereso at this point let's go ahead and uhlet's go tip some peopleso I'm here on Twitter and I just did aquick search of uh get Alby on Twitterand I can see there's a few people thathave actually their Albyum uh lightning address listed in theirprofile I also see that there's peopletweeting about it but um in particularthere's a tweet uh just down here wherethis person has tweeted out heyum you can actually transact directly onTwitter here all you need to have isyour Albi lightning address and that'strue because first I want you to take alook up at the the lb icon up here andwatch as it changes as I click actuallyon this tweetit changes to Blue and so when itchanges to Blue it means that you canactually tip somebody so here I can seethat somebody has included their Albylightning address with the lightningEmoji in front of it and that'simportant because whenever you put thison a page it will auto populate or itwill auto recognize the Albi app willthat this is a person you can tip andsend so this person has tweeted out thiswas just a few days ago hey you canactually tip me via this I'm going to goahead and do that so I'm going to clickthe Alby button it says hey it AutopopulatesPaul Jones and says you can sendsatoshi's you can send receive outgoingincoming so I'm going to go ahead I'mgoing to hit send satoshi's and then howmuch am I going to send let's send overa hundred satoshi's leave a comment uhwe'll just sayhey you're in my tutorial video nowI'll sayfrom BTC sessions and I don't need anemail there will I confirmthere we go 100 sets around two centsyou're welcome uh we're sent to PaulJones and that's it message received souh whenever Paul happens to check hislightning wallet on Alby he'll see wellyou got a hundred stats there so awesomeand this applies again we'll go backhere but uh there's people that haveaddeduh there's people that have added theirAlby address uh to their profile solet's let's search people here andhere's Mitch and I've interacted and Ifollow Mitch on Twitter but I can seehey there's his Albee lightning addressand once again it's blue here so I cango ahead hit send SATsum I can hit the default amountyo here in my video now and I'll justput sessionsand then I'll hit confirmand sure enough 100 sats are off toMitch and he'll see that in his walletso this can be on really any page itcould be on a website can be on yourYouTube channel it can be on Reddit itcan be a lot of different places solet's experiment and try adding itsomewhere and see if the blue populatesfor our own stuff so I'm gonna go aheadI'm gonna edit my YouTube channel toinclude the get Albie lightning addressand I'm going to also edit my Twitterprofile to include the get Alby addressso here on my Twitter profile what I'vedone is I've just put in a lightningemoji and my Associated get Albylightning address it's important thatyou do put in the lighting emojiotherwise it will not work if you'restruggling how to do that on yourkeyboard you can just go toemojapedia.org and you can just searchfor a lightning emoji and it will pop upyou can just hit copy and it'll allowyou to paste it in but nonetheless let'sjust save this here and hey as soon as Isaved it look blue and it auto populatesall of my information of who you wouldbe sending this touh so yeah that's pretty much it let'sdo the same for a YouTube channel andsee how that worksso just on YouTube really simple I canjust hit uh customize Channel when I'mon my own channel and logged in ofcourse uh and then we can go tobasic infoand then I'll just paste in what I havebeforeand we'll just hit publishand hopefully that looks all good we'llhit view Channelit's does auto play there uh but as soonas I hit view Channelit looks like it has Auto populatedand it says I can now send satoshi's tothis YouTube channel that I'm I'msitting on right nowum again all of that is auto populatedit's under the about tab hereumand yeah it just shows I can send setsand we'll just do a test one for 10.it's funny because I'm sending it tomyself I'm not going to add anyanything here but it's uh basically acircular transactionum and then I can close that and hey Ijust got a few seconds ago I got 10 setsbut I sent it to myself so not asimpressive as sending to somebody elsebut case in point it worksnow I want to show you a quick exampleof another way you can integrate thisinto YouTube too because if somebody'swatching an individual video of yours itwill not show that tip option however ifyou include your Albi lightning addressin the description of the video and itdoesn't matter how far down it is so forinstance here I put it way down it'sjust a little footnote here okay butit's still blue all right if I go to anyof my other videos right now that don'thave that it will not show up but ifjust as a practice of your own youinclude that I'll be Link at some pointin the description it will show up andit will be tippable on YouTube so againthis can be anywhere this could be on awebsite you can just add it to any pageif somebody's on that page and you havethis plugin installed in your browseryou can tip that person or receive tipsfrom anybody that has this pluginso we're now going to connect anexternal wallet to Alby so that you caneasily interact with your balanceoutside of your browser and have accessto all the funds that come into itthrough tips and you can use them on thego as you see fit so I'll justtransition here this again is getalby.com and we're going to go to thedashboard here so I've got that open upin another Tab and we're going to go towallet the middle option there and thenit says wallet connection credentials welooked at this just a moment ago andwe're going to use blue wallet for thisso if you don't have blue wallet uh bluewallet dot IO you can see it here andyou can get it both on iPhone and onGoogle Play Store for Android but eitherway you're just going to download thatapplicationand then here on the screen it says showyour connection credentials so when Ishow this and it does say keep itprivate you don't want to show this toanybody else because then they'll haveaccess to your funds but I'm going tooff screen I'll click this and it willshow a QR code that I can then scan solet's just take a look at what we dowithin blue wallet so within blue walletat the top you're going to see addwallet and that's what you're going tochoose when you're setting up you'regoing to add now you're going to getsome options on this first screen butyou're actually going to choose down atthe bottom where it says import walletyou'll get to this screen and at thevery bottom you're going to hit scan orimport a fileand this will open up your cameraand you're going to Simply scan actuallyyou'll hit show your credentialcredentials on that page we're just onthere's now a QR code in front of mewhich I can scan so I'll do thatand it is going to quickly connect withthose credentials and I can now seethere's my wallet if I tap on it I cansee the previous payments going into andout of this wallet and I now have fullaccess to send and receive and dopayments from this wallet which isconnected to get Alby in my browser andbasically they'll both be the exact sameexperience in terms of I will seeupdated balances and be able to interactwith it seamlessly whether I'm on myphone or whether I'm on the browsernow let's take a look at the options toadd more accounts and manage setaccounts so just from our browser if wetap on Alby and we'll just uh back outin the drop down here so you have yourBTC sessions again I'll be or whateveryour uh your wallet is you can do a dropdown and it says the it gives theoptions to switch accounts so you canhave multiple accounts here so you canadd a new account or you can manage yourexisting account so when you hit add newaccount it will open up a new windowwhich I do have right here and this is afamiliar screen we've seen this beforeand I'll just get myself out of thepicture here so you can see everythingagain we have lots of options here toconnect our own node and so we're goingto go ahead and we're actually going toconnect an umbral node so I've donevideos on the umbral Node this is aninstance where you may have gone throughand set up your entire own lightningnode and you'd like to rely on that asopposed to a custodial option whichwould be what we've done with thedefault Alby wallet those funds well youdo have access to them you are trustingthat the lb wallet is maintainedproperly and that there's not going tobe some problem with the funds in thefuture so you may prefer again your ownnode so if we click on umbraluh it says connect to umbral node inyour umbral dashboardum go to connect wallet now this haschanged since here so I'm going to showyou I'm going to walk you throughum because these instructions are alittle bit dated but we do need thisinformation here lnd connect rest URLokay so we're gonna go find that I'llshow you where so here I am logged intomy umbral node now if you're unfamiliarwith umbral you're wondering what thehell is going on here I do have a fullvideo on how to set up use and maintainyour lightning node on your umbral butif you have not done any of this yet itmay sound a little bit like Greek tooyou may be unsure exactly what's goingon here but at least if you feel likefollowing along you can see how to do inthe future if you decide to go ahead anddo this so from my main dashboard hereI'm going to click on my lightning nodethis will take me into my existinglightning node with all of my availablefundsum and I can see all my transactions allthat kind of stuff here in the top rightthere is uh three little dots and if youclick on them there's an option to hitconnect wallet this is going to give youa bunch of information about your nodeincluding the necessary information topaste into the lnd connect rest URL okayso I'm going to go ahead I'm going tograb that off screen here and I'll I'llkind of give you a Lowdown on what I seeafter the fact so as I said on theumbral lightning node you're going tohit the three dots in the top right andyou're going to hit connect wallet nowthis will bring up a pop-up which I'vedone a screenshot of it looks like thisand it's going to have a whole bunch ofinformation a QR code a host namemacaroon l d connect URL this is whatyou're looking for the l d connect URLnow this field up here is a drop downnow you can either go rest local or resttour I'm going to go tour because I'dlike to be able to access this outsideof my local network meaning if I have mylaptop out and about and I feel likeutilizing Alby well I'd like to be ableto connect to that so I've chosen tor uhand then I would go and I'd tap the copybutton right here we'd go back to thatAlbee page we were just on and we pastein the necessary informationit will give you a message that sinceyou're trying to connect via tour ifthat's what you've chosen then you needto download a companion app and we willgo ahead and do that momentarilyso here's a screenshot of the page andthe second I post in that or paste inthe Tor address here it auto fills thisother information it says you're tryingto connect behind Tor to do this youeither have to have lb companion appinstalled or tour running when you'reunsure we recommend the Alby companionapp and you can tap to click to downloadit it will prompt you to download andyou're gonna see this thing when youdownload it you're gonna open up thefile that you've just downloaded and itgives you the option to install it forany browser that you may have at whichpoint you can then close thisapplicationthat's pretty much it it will automateeverything for you it'll say it needs togo into your applications folder it willdo that for you but basically justapprove what it needs to do and thenyou'll be able to connect to your nodevia torof course once you've done that on themain page you're going to hit continueand it says awesome you're ready to gomy umbral node is now connected and nowit's an option here and I can swapbetween those accounts so I can go backto my uh albe account and I can go backand forth between that and my umbralaccount same thing in the top rightcorner here there's my accounts dropdown and I have the option to switchbetween them and do as I see fitso again to differentiate we had acustodial lightning wallet createdthrough get Alby or through Albyum and funded with a minimal amount ofSATs alternatively we have a lightningnode that was set up and maintained byourselves with our own channels in ourown custody at all times and we're ableto connect that via Albie and spendthrough it so an example here again I'mon Twitter and somebody has replied withtheir Alby uh address their lightningaddress and it's lit up blue if I clickI can see I'm connected to my umbralnode so I can go ahead and sense Toshi'sdirectly from my node and let's send 100sets we'll hit confirmand there payment sent it went this timenot through my previously created Albywallet but directly out of my ownlightning note and that's super awesomereally cool to seenow I can go and I can actually edit thenames of my accounts or remove accountsif I would like to so if I go up to thealbe app here and under accounts I dothe drop down and there's our option toadd new accounts but I can also go tomanage accounts all right and there'sthe Alby one that we created that ishosted by Albee itself and there's ourumbral that we just added now if we tapon the right here we can edit export orremove now I would like to if you hitedit by the way it's just the name ofthe account but let's say you wanted toremove the ability of your node tointeract with Alby for whatever reasonor another account that you've maybeadded you just simply hit the threebuttons hit removeand says hey are you sure you want toremove this cannot be undone if usedthis account to log into websites youmay lose access to those so it just kindof lets you know that hey you know thisis you're going to have to add it againlater if you need that account so I'llhit okayand there we go so it's all gone and Ican jump back to and it auto jumps backto my original albe account as there'sno other account to jump back to so herewe are back with our singular accountand again you can connect any node whenyou like and don't forget there was lotsof other options here I showed umbralbut there is instructions for my nodeand start nine and Citadel and raspyBlitz and a whole bunch of other onesand all the instructions are there I'mnot going to go through all of theseoptions just wanted to show some easyoptions therenow of course Alby isn't just forsending and receiving tips you can useit as an actual wallet to make andreceive regular payments as well andjust as a proof of concept here I dohave blue wallet open up on my computerso let's say we wanted to send alightning transaction from Alby tosomewhere else and this could be toanother person or to one of our ownwallets but just in blue wallet here Ican hit receive and maybe I want toreceive uh we'll just say a hundred setsand we'll hit create invoice so this isgoing to generate of course the regularQR code but down below there's alightning invoice that is a string ofdigits you just click to copyand then here in my browser I'll go toAlby and I'll just choose send andyou're going to paste in a recipient nowthis can beanybody's lightning address this can bea lightning an Ln URL an invoice we havean invoice so we're just going to pastewhat we copied over from Blue walletwe're going to paste it in it autofillshey 100 SATs or go in here would youlike to pay we'll hit pay nowand 100 stats successfuland it pops up hereand our blue wallet as well so invoicewent through no problem now there'sobviously other ways that you canutilize Albi so for instance if you goto the top right here and you clickwebsites it's going to give you a listof different websites in which you canspend and receive lightning one of thereally cool ones obviously that I use alot is bit refill so if you get a decentamount of tips and you want to gopurchase gift cards there you go veryvery simple to use and you can payobviously in lightning so there's a tonof great things on hereanother cool one that's worth looking atis stacker.news or stacker news and thisis basically lightning incentivize styleReddit so you can post interesting linksand and content that maybe you'vecreated or something that you think iscool and you want to add here and a lotof it again is Bitcoin and lightningrelated but nonetheless you caneffectively earn and spend Bitcoin onhere if if you like somebody's articleyou can give it a a lightning tip justby clicking on it and then you have anative wallet within stacker news so ifI go to my wallet well I can fund it soI can send a transaction which we justsaw what that would look like or I canwithdraw here as well and uh you you canconnect here so it asks if you want toauto connect via Albie and so I'm goingto hit connect yesand so it's going to give me an optionI'm going to create an invoice maybejust for a hundred SATs okay withdrawfour at BTC sessions on stacker news I'mgoing to hit confirmthere we go sent 100 SATs we should seethat show up in our lb walletif we back outuhincoming there we go 100 SATs came intoour wallet and it came from stacker newsso we successfully withdrawled and allof it was automated there now if itwasn't automated again you could hitreceive you could paste inum you know you could paste in an actualinvoice uh via the top right receive andyou could create an invoice and pastethat into the wallet that it would becoming from or send that to somebody andthey'd be able to send you a transactionbutum a lot of these websites uh that arelisted under the websites tab there theywill have some sort of automation whereit just does everything for you which issuper convenientoverall I find LV to be a nice simpleand easy way to interact with Bitcoinand the lightning network via yourbrowser with very
