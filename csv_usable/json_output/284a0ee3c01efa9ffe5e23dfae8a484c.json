thatmakes good bodies of everybody do thatthe most universal disease in the worldis the decay of the pee andunfortunately we have not known thecause until we've gone to the primitivepeople to find how they prevent toothdecay our difficulty is that we areadding too much white flour and sugarand do not get enough of the foods thatcarry the minerals and vitamins when theprimitive people adopt the food moderncivilization their teeth decayed just asours do he first visited Switzerland tostudy whether greater nutrition could beobtained from foods produced at higheraltitudes such as in the Swiss outlineshe discovered the isolated legend tallValley a community compelled by its veryisolation to eat locally produced foodshere he made physical examinations ofteethrecorded data collected menus and madephotographs of the people samples offood and saliva were taken for lateranalysis in his laboratorythe children had well-formed teeth goodphysiques and an apparent immunity todisease and dental problems they atemainly dairy products olai bread andplant foods such as potatoes and cabbagemeat was eaten sparinglyusually only once a week in contrastSwiss children living in moderniseddistricts at widespread tooth decayfacial and dental arch deformities andgreater susceptibility to disease theirdiet refined flour a high intake ofsweets chocolate sweetened fruits and areduced use of dairy products[Music]on his next journey dr. price visitedthe Outer Hebrides located off the coastof Scotland here he made similar studiesamong the Gaelic people who inhabitthese isolated islands these ratherbarren Islands have very few trees andlittle fertility the islands are oftensubjected to rough seas and blizzardsfrom the North Atlantic most of thepeople are up early Scottish descentpossessing a physique that rivals thatfound almost any place in the worldtheir teeth are of unusual perfectionthe basic foods of these Islanders arefish and food products such as oatmealwhole grain breads and

in 1933 dr. and mrs. pricevisited Alaska to study the Eskimos oneof the last examples of a Stone Agepeople the area's they visited wereisolated Travel was often very difficultamong the Eskimos dr. price discoveredexamples of physical excellence anddental perfection seldom found anywhereelse in the world living in isolateddistricts on native foods they haduniformly broad dental arches andtypical Eskimo facial patterns theirgeneral health was excellent[Music][Applause][Music]the Eskimos ate foods rich in mineralsand vitamins mainly caribou kelp berriesfresh fish organs of large sea animalsand seal oil when the Eskimos wereexposed to the foods of Commerce therewas a marked rise in dental decay and achange in facial and dental archformation dental service was not readilyavailable and dental pain was oftenacute among these people these Indiansinhabited northern British Columbia andthe Yukon Territory an area inside therocky mountain range this isolated areahad to be reached by water and overroads that often were almost impassable[Music]long ago these Indians discover that thewhite man got scurvy when forced to livefor long periods of time in this areawhere fresh fruits and vegetables wereoften not availableto avoid this dreaded disease theIndians ate the adrenal gland and organsof moose and caribou this gave them thenecessary vitamin C the vitamin thatprevents scurvy primitive groups ofIndians consistently had well-formedfacial and dental arches thatrepresented the tribal pattern but newgenerations exposed to the foods ofCommerce obtained at trading posts orthrough government agencies showed MUCchanges in facial and dental arch formsextensive tooth decay was quite evident[Music]by 1934 dr. price decided to study thevarious people who inhabit the manyislands of the South Pacific New Zealandwas also included in his studies dr. andmrs. price lived with these peoplecollecting and studying data about theirliving conditions not surprisingly hefound the people who ate the foods ofthe area shell and scale fish plantroots and tropical fruits had developeda very high immunity to dental decayalso they had well-formed faces and gooddental arches in their primitive stateless than 1% of their teeth wereattacked by tooth decay but as thoughechoing a warning from Nature herselfthe message was clear those who atefoods outside their natural diets had arise in tooth decay of over 29%[Music]by 1935 dr. and mrs. price went on oneof their longest trips some 6,000 milesto study 30 different African tribalgroups these people lived in the SudanEthiopia Kenya the Congo and TanganyikaAfrica was a fertile area for studyingprimitive peoples last of the largecontinents to be invaded and explored bycivilized man it had one of the largestnative populations living underprimitive conditions the primitiveAfricans were healthy robust people theyhad good teeth and phayam dental archestheir overall physique was excellent[Music][Music]their diet dairy products fishvegetables and eggs of certain speciesan important source of fat solublevitamin is the blood of steers it is abasic food of the Masai people aboutstanding physiques for those who ignoredtribal nutritional laws characteristictypes of deformity and tooth decayfrequently developed[Music]one of dr. and mrs. prices last journeyswas to Peru[Music]here he compared modern Peruvian societywith the ancient Incasthis was done by examining more than1,000 human skulls of the ancients dr.price did not find one significantdeformity of the dental archeshe also found examples of early brainsurgery evidence of the high degree ofcivilization of the Ancients[Music]primitive Peruvian Indians subsisting onnatural foods indigenous to theircountry were healthy and robust withfine teeth and sturdy bodies but thosewho ate the foods of Commerce weredegenerating and dying rapidlythis was another warning anotherindication to obey nature's lawsdr. price discovered that withindividuals undergoing a degenerativeprocess a chemical analysis of the fooddisclosed a marked reduction in theintake of some of the important vitaminsand minerals even primitive societiesshare our plight when they eat our fooddr. price discovered a substance hecalled activator X it belongs in the fatsoluble group he recognized that the fatsoluble vitamins a d e and F had beendeficient in practically every case ofactive tooth decayhe found that an essentialcharacteristic of the successful dietaryprograms of primitive societies relatedto a liberal source of the fat solubleactivator group such as is found inseafood especially fish roe birds eggsbutter fat of mammals milk organs ofanimals and insects even though thediets of primitive people differedgreatly as to type and source all dietsprovided a large increase inwater-soluble vitamins over modern dietsby at least a factor of four and atleast 10 times more of the fat solublevitamins and mineral activators than thedisplacing diets of commerce qualityrather than quantity was the importantfactor since these foods were unrefinedthey also supplied from two to eighttimes the minimum daily requirements ofcalcium and phosphorus and up to 28times that of magnesiumthe entire treatment of food fromplanning to preparation was importantdr. price believed that changes innutrition could occur with a change inagricultural methods and that there wasa direct relationship between poorquality foods and the depletion of theminerals in the soil primitive societieswere aware of the relationship betweenwhat they ate and their own reproductionso nutrition was carefully planned forexpectant mothers when the foods ofcommerce were substituted for theirnatural diet there was evidence ofabnormal facial patterns andsusceptibility to certain diseases thisMaori family demonstrates the linkbetween nutrition and birth deformitiesthe eldest child has a normalwell-formed bodyafter her birth the parents moved to aplantation and began to eat the foods ofcommerce their second child has adepressed face flat feetthe next child has club feet the parentsreturn to a primitive diet and later twochildren were born without defectsproper diet helped produce childrenwithout deformities giving hope for allparents of the future[Music]",
