the savings aspect of hisstartup and change the fundamentals ofthe rent seeking health insuranceindustry andy schoonover how'severything going man life is good thankyou so much for having me appreciate ityeah and you know how's you know yourlife been the last couple of yearsbecause everyone i thinkhas hadyou know weird experiences and stufflike that and trying to go throughwhatever it is how's it been yeah man weso we've got a three and a five year oldso that's always always interesting butand challenging clearly but i mean ithink we've we've really thrived overthe last couple of years i'vetalked to some friends who you know aremarried and it seems likethe family goes one way or the otherlike they really kind of thrive being onmission together or they really strugglebecause you knowso much of what they have going on is isoutside of the family which you know gotcut off in many ways over the lastcouple of years butit feels like we've really reallythrived over the last couple of years soit's been been been okay for ussoi have kind of actually kind of enjoyedthe getting rid of some of the outsidesources of entertainment and and reallyfocused onyou know entertaining ourselves in ourhome with each other and and growing andbonding as a family so it's actuallybeen been kind of nice to be totallyhonest with youdespite the worldwide pandemicsi'm generally an introvert too so youknow it's kind of probably easier for usintroverts to to have have gone throughthe last couple of years than theextroverts but we've actually donepretty wellum what do you think was the secret tolike having that versus you know manyother people whoobviously struggled you know i've heardof a lot of like covet divorces andthings like that you know what do youthink was the difference oh you know iknow that you're you're a uh of guy ofof faith and hopefully that's okay totalk about on this podcast but i reallydo believe it of courseit'syou know just giving each other a lot ofgrace giving each other a lot of graceand you know not to go too personal herebut my wife and i i think i've told youthis our first daughter passed awayabout 10 hours after she was born and sowe went throughyou know just hell for two years afterthat you can kind of imagine right likewhat you're you know within the firstyear of our marriage we moved to a newcity austin we had a got pregnant had achild lost a child and so we've beenthrough some some stuff and so i feltlikeyou know you know one first james youknow says you know find it pure joy whenyou face trials of many kinds for itproduces perseverance and so i thinkthatthe trial of of losing our daughterreally kind of built some perseverancewithin usand so we kind of looked at thispandemic and we're like manthis is nothing compared to you knowstuff that we've that we've been throughand so i think it was just by god'sgrace allowed us to to kind of reallythrive over the last couple of yearswell so let's talk about that becauseyou do have a very interesting story umyou know especially regardinghealthcare and your children andeverything else can you tell my audiencelikeyou know where you come from what's yourbackground andyou know why you're so passionate aboutthis time sureyeah you know and it's funny enough inever thought i was going to be in inhealth care but again you know i thinkjustyou know not my sovereignty someone youknow god sovereign he put me into thehealth care space andso give you a little background whatwent to stanford for b-school myroommate and i uh were out there andgraduated in 2006. so you know funnystory for those folks who've seen thatmovie the social network there's asubplot of that movie where zuckerbergis going and trying to figure out how tofind i forget what it was in the moviesixteen or eighteen thousand dollars torent this house so that he could bringhis buddies from boston to siliconvalleyand the house in that movie was actuallyour house sohe came and he handed us this check he'slike yeah i got the startup companymoving it to silicon valley i need aplace to stay and so they stayed in ourhouse while we were all out during ourdoing our internships between the firstyear and second year of business schoolso that all that to say was like it wasa crazy time in silicon valley and butwe wanted to do something a little bitdifferent and so we raised some moneyit's called a search fund raised somemoney to to go and find a company to buyalmost kind of like a spec but it's youknow this was 15 years ago so therewasn't really spacks back then butso we ended up finding a little companyof all places dayton ohio so you cankind of imagine what our b-school youknow you know classmates were saying youwent from silicon valley to dayton ohioand uh bought this little healthcarecompany that was doing i've fallen and ican't get up so i'm sure most of yourlisteners have seen the silly commercialyou know the old lady i've fallen ican't get up it looks like thecommercial was made in like 1985 rightand so we bought a little company thatcompeted with them and turned thatcompany into more of a remote patientmonitoring company so we were startingto monitor blood sugars and bloodpressure and weight and things like thatout of the home so that was my firstforay into healthcare sold that companyin 2014 and as such didn't have healthinsurance because most of ouryou know folks get health insurancethrough their employer so went tohealthcare.gov i was i was ignorant atthe time didn't kind of fully understandwhat that meant but went tohealthcare.gov got a plantwelve hundred dollars for me my wifeand my uh my two girls and i kind ofjoke it worked until i had to use it somy my little one was having recurringear infections and so she had to gettubes in her ears off we went to thehospital got tubes in her ears15 minute procedure got the bill it was8 000and i was like wow eight grand for 15minutes right and i was like well atleast my health insurance will pay foritand uh i get the bill in the mail andthe health insurance plan put a littlenote in there that says we think this ismedically unnecessary and therefore wewill not pay for it so they rejected itand so i had to write an 8 000 check tomy local hospital and um i was pissed iquit health insurance i've beenuninsured for the last two and a halfyearsand have started building some toolsthat allow people to operate outside ofhealth insurance andkind of the culmination of that is iscrowd health and i can get into moredetails on what that means but and howthat works but that's kind of theorigination of my my current company butall that to say is i've been in care fora long time you know uh health care ismy my primary language bitcoin is my mysecondary language uh but um yeah i feellike i've been put on this planet toreally do some things and change somethings in healthcare because it's a it'sa tragedy you know what our health caresystem is today from my perspective yeahall right so you go out to dayton ohioafterstanford business school and of coursepeople are like what what are you doingwhat was the logic behind that and likeyou you seem to have stayed with thatcompany for quite a whilewhat did you learn there and what wasthe business and what about healthcaredid you understand from doing that yeahso i think just a contrarian by nature iwant to do something different than therest of people are doing andyou know everybody in silicon valley atthat time wanted to go work for thesehigh-flying tech companies i got a bunchof people who went to work for googleand facebook and you know all thosefolksi wanted to do something a little bitdifferent even though what meant goingto dayton ohio and so you know the thingthat kind ofinterested me in this companyspecificallywas that it was focused primarily on theelderly population and i hadfour grandparents still in my life atthe time they were all in their 80smy grandpafell one day got stuck between the chairand the wall and had one of these littlebuttons you know i fall and i can't getup buttonsand you know his gallbladder had burstand if he didn't have one of thesebuttons he would have died i meanthere's you know he had internalbleeding and all kinds of stuff going onso you know i was just like wow like canwe make an impact you know throughgetting this into more people's homesbecause i see firsthand you know theimpact it had on my grandpa he's stillalive and soi think it was the impact nature of thatthat really got me interested in in thatcompany i think has kept me interestedin in healthcare if we can do somethingon a daily basis that's making an impactin the lives of of other human beingslike what an awesomething you can do you know for your dailywork i meanthe impact and truly changing the waythings are done gets me fired up andlike i said i'm kind of a contrarian inin that finding gaps in the market wherepeople aren't you know filling themappropriately is something i really getexcited about soyou know all that to say is umi was with that company in total forabout uh almost 10 years almost a decadeand that's where i got you know kind ofcut my teeth a little bit on on thehealthcarekind of part of my work historywhat were the economics of a companylike that like i i'm always interestedin sort of like the monetary aspect ofeverything because my suspicion is thatfiat money like sort of enters into allof this stuff so sure yeah just curiouswhat what was that like so there's kindof like i'll touch on two componentsbecause i think the first one isinteresting you knowthe way that we structured our deal wasthat wewent out and got investors to fund thisacquisition so i didn't buy it myself umwe basically set up a little privateequity firmso that we would get 20 of the upside soyou know we bought the company for 15million dollars and then sold it formany many times that but that's kind ofthe economics for us and how we wereable to do that kind of out of stanfordwith like zeromanagement experienceand you know the economics of of thebusiness were kind of interestingbecause you know this is something andone of the reasons we love the businessit was a recurring revenue model so youknow every month these people would giveusyou know 30 to 100 bucks depending uponwhat what service they were providing inand the cost of us doing that wasprobablyyou know again depending upon theservice was somewhere betweenfour dollars and[Music]15 or 20 dollars you know somewhere inthere so you know on a 30 service ourcost our cogs were four bucks and so theeconomics of that worked outyou know very very nicely so it's apretty high margin it was a you know allin ebitda margin of 35 or 40 percent soit was a great businessand were you being subsidized in any wayby medicare oryou know health insurance or anythinglike that yeah it's so funny becausehealth insurance you know while i railagainst it now as was what was my mainmain customer you know back in the dayduring that during that companyand i think i've i've learned a lotbetweenthen and now to understand a little bitabout just the perverse incentives of ofhealth insurance plans and while i'm i'mthankful that to them for making me abunch of money back in my last companyi'm looking toto right the wrong now and giving peoplea true you know alternative to whatthey're doingwell so what were they did did they payfor all of these like you know 30 to 100things and how much of it did thepeople pay at all if anything nothingyeah the people paid nothing the healthplan paid for all of itand it was mostly medicare i imaginebecause they're over65 i imagine yeah it was actually a dualeligible population so that means theywere on medicare and medicaid at thesame time so it's it's old and folkslivingyou know somewhere under 300 of thefederal poverty lineumso that's interesting that the healthcare like they didn't really know aboutthe cost then they just sort of likegot it as part oflikewhat were how do you even do sales in ina situation like that where they're notpaying the costyeah well i mean that's one of thereally screwed up things of our healthsystem right is we the ultimateconsumers of healthcare us me you haveno idea how much this costs right and sowe just have an incentive to consume andconsume and consumeand the way we sell that is we had tosell directly to the plans so the healthplans hadyou know humana was our largest customerhas you know tens of millions of peopleon their their plan and they take a lookat all the people who would needsomething like this they would send us alist and then we would go and sign thosepeople up and we'd say heyyour health plan is giving you somethingfor free they think it's going tobenefit you are you interested and ifthey said yes then we would you know getthat that system installed in their homeif they said no he'd move on to the nextperson so these were already peopleengaged by the health plan the healthplan thought that would be good for themto have ityou know ultimately it was the healthplan trying to reduce costsbut you know that's that was theultimate goalum okay and they did it because someactuary and at their company figured outthat if theygive these bracelets to these peoplethen you canlike reduce costs somewhere along theline and preventative care i guess yeahwell you know ultimately what we did wasthese little bracelets they wereyou know initially they were just i falland i can't get up like it was just youpress the button it would activate asystem the system would call us we wouldthen talk to you over that kind ofspeaker microphone and get you help youknow and when we looked at thatoriginally we said this is cool but it'syou know very reactionary you knowyou're already in you know deep doo doowhen you when you when you're using thatright so how can we be proactive aboutyour health and that's when we startedwe inserted a bluetooth module in thatdevicewhich then could connect directly toblood pressure guffs and and glucometersand weight scales and pulse oximetersand a whole host of devices so that icould get a bettersense for what was going on with you inthe home right and these were folks withchronic conditions our average customerwasi think 83 they had 2.3 comorbiditieswhich means they had you know multiplechronic conditions and the hosp that thehealth plan was trying to monitor themso that if something went out of whackright like your blood pressure spikedyour blood sugar spiked or somethinglike that then we could get engaged withyou with a we had a call center ofyou knowyou know hundreds of people many ofwhich were nurses who interact with youand say okay so why is this going on andso we could intervene prior to you goingto the hospital so you know you walk ifyou're 84 years old and you walk intothe hospital it'syou know 12 grand probably minimum bywalking in the doorwow and so if they could pay30 to 100 bucks a month for somebodylike this and we could reduce your theiryou know four hospitalizations a yeardown to even three hospitalizations ayear the return on investment of thatwas was significantso that was the sale that we were youknow pitching to these health plans andyou know and many many times they theysaid yes and we showed the roi andthat's whyyou know the the company when we boughtit was i don't know 20 employees when hesold it was 450 employees or somethinglike that and so that's why where thegrowth came from the health plan sawthat this had a really return goodreturn on investmentand and you were able to work with theseinsurance companies so tell me about youknow after you saw the company andyou're going to healthcare.gov andall of this other stuff likeyou know what was that like the thissort of process of trying toi don't know get paid for something thatyouclearly saw as medically necessary butwasn't yeahyeah i mean it was it was stressful forme this one was just stressful becauseyou go to healthcare.gov you try tofigure out what plan to get andit's like hieroglyphics you know it'sit'salmost impossible to understandyou know what co-pays and deductiblesandall thesecrazyhealth insurance terms what they meanwhat impact they have on you what iscovered what's not covered what's innetwork what's out of networkand it was justseriously complex i'm a fairlyintelligent human being and if i can'tfigure it out you know i just can'timagine what a pretty significant chunkof the population thinks when they go tothis this healthcare.gov to figure itout but i chose one best up to myknowledge it was the the best one icould have chosenand then you kind of put your healthcare in the hands of a health insurancecompany right like they decide what topay and what not to payand so we had one ear nose and throatthat we could go to that was in networkwe went to that ear nose and throatdoctor who told usthat she needed tubes in her earsbecause she was gonna have long-termhearing loss if she didn'tthat ear nose and throat doc actuallydelayed his vacation by a day to do itthe only hospital in town we could do itwas at you know dell children's hospitalhere in austin that was the only one innetwork from our understandingand so i was like okay we're doing allthe things that we need to do right toget this done rightandthen to have you know the insurancecompany come back and say oh wellyou know it was medically unnecessaryand so you all have to pay for it i wasjust likebewildered i was like what what you knowand i've been i've been super fortunatewriting an 8 000 check it you know ithurts right but it's not the end of theworld and and you know i saw some statthe other day that was like 60 or 70 ofpeople don't have a thousand dollars intheir checking account like what do youwhat do you do when you have an eightthousand dollar bill that you're on notexpecting like that is areally significant financial burden forsomebody with less than a thousanddollars in their their bank accountyou know and i think back to what i wastalking about earlier just the impactpiece of this is250 000 families who had healthinsurance went bankrupt last yearbecause of a medical event like we havewe have people going bankrupt that havehealth insurance i mean the whole pointof insurance is if you have asignificant event it doesn't put you ina financial distress and that's just nothappening with with health insurance andso it's one of the drivers of you knowwhy i put my company together is youknow man it's it breaks my heart thatall these people are are going bankruptbecause this this system is takingadvantage of them from my perspectivewell so let's talk about that a littlebit because why is the system set up theway it is whereyou can go bankrupt despite havinghealth insurance what's the deal italmost seems completely pointless thento have insurance if you're gonna gobankrupt anyway and yeahlike what's the deal how is that allowedto happenit wasn't the promise of insurance sothatyou don't have to go bankrupt yeah yeahi mean that's the promise and actuallyyou know as i've done more research onhealthcare.gov plans according to thekaiser family foundation one in sixmedical claims are rejected byhealthcare.gov plans so you have a onein six shot of your medical claimgetting rejectedit's like one in five if you live intexas it's one in three if you live intennessee right soyou know the insurance companies saythey're there to for you and they'rethere to pay your bills but in fact theyreject a pretty significant percentageof these these healthcare bills and andpeople are going into financial stressas a result of that sothat's the challenge here right and itand i think it stems from a couple ofthings and most of themthis this won't shock you to hear me sayit but it stems from governmentregulation you know the government's outthere saying we really need to protectthe consumers but in fact theseprotections havei don't know if they're intended orunintended consequences that actuallysignificantly raise our our health carecostsso i'll give you one you know littleexampleobamacare you know about 10 years old ithink now had this provision that saidhealth insurance plans can onlyuse 15of the premium for profit oradministrative costs okay soif you have a thousand dollar premiumthe max they can profit is 150 bucksso you know if you're outside looking inyou're like okay that makes total sensewe don't want you know health insurancecompanies to fleece us right by making abunch of money off of us but in factwhat happens is if they're not afor-profit organizationyou know think through this 150 bucks ona thousand dollars how do i make moremoney how do i grow revenuemy premium has to go up right that's theonly way to make more money on theschoon over family is for my premium togo up so at a thousand dollars you make150 at 1100you make 165right so you have this incentivefor health insurance companiesto raise premiums not reduce premiums soin fact these health insurance companieshave an incentive to see prices rise asopposed to prices falland and so though and that's the primarybuyer of healthcarethe primary seller of healthcare ishospital systems of course they wantprices to go up so you have the buyerand the seller of healthcare bothwanting the price to rise what happensthe price goes upand it does you know it doesn't take uhyou know a doctorate in economics tounderstand that right and so there arethese just series of perverse incentiveswithin our system that just incentivizefor you know the prices to go to go upyou know and and the middle class arethe ones that are they're feeling mostof thisyou know the the folks like me who canpay the eight thousand dollars or youknow this it sucks but it's not the endthe world the middle class you can't paythe eight thousand dollars the onesgoing bankrupt and going into financialdistress as a result of thiswell soi'm trying to figure out like what it isthat's causing them to reject the claimsbecause i get the incentive part toincrease the premiums but why are theyrejecting one out of six claims or oneout of five or one out of three ifyou're in texas or tennessee i meanthat would be i guess a way for them tomake money but is it that with eachpolicy you can make at most 15 andthey're trying to maximize that or yeahare they not making enough on other oneswhat's going on they're trying tomaximize to that 85 percent right and soif if you're if yourbit claims start going into that 90range then they've got to cut it back tothat 85 percent range because now you'recutting into my profitright so it's it's this game of it'scalled the medical loss ratio it's it'sthis game around keepingmedical claims at 85 percentand they put yeah and so if it goes overthat then they kind of take a reallyclose look and say okay how do i get itback to 85to maximize their their profit onon all of their claims so it's not ait's not a a unit by unit 85 it is anaggregate they have to have 85 percentof that premium being spent on medicalclaims so if it goes to 90 they'llthey're you know gonna their incentivethen to cut back on the amount of claimsthat they haveand so you know again you know perverseincentives it's it's it's crazinessso so let me see if i understand thiscorrectly so theyyou know up to 85of your premium being usedthey're fine with like they'rethey're not gonnatake a too close a look but past thatit's starting to cut into their profitso they're incentivized to go andtry to reject it for some reason andthey usually do yes is that what'shappening that's what is happeningthat's what is happening that is whatthe data is saying isthey they are cutting back on onexpenses and it's it's typically throughclaims rejection right so you could goback and just say hey let's negotiatethe rates downright with the hospitals and they andthey do do some of that like to be fairto them they they do do a little bit ofit but you know but by the majority ofthe the claims kind of management isdone by by rejection you know or youknow the other thing that they'll do isis so they don't have to reject it isthey'll make doctors getpre-authorizationsand then reject the authorizations so ithink one plan i forget exactly whichone it was is any outpatient procedurehas to be pre-approved by the healthplanand so it's truly the health plan is isdirecting your your health care rightand all they have to do is say no youknow on that pre-authorization when yourdoctor asks for it so it's not reallybetween you and your doctor it's it'sbetween you know you and your healthplan and your health plan and yourdoctor you know what we're trying to dois take the health plan out of themiddle of that so it can be between youand your doctorwhich i think is you know is better fora variety of reasonswell let's stick with the premium herebecauselike just doing the mathif you're paying a thousand dollars and80and they're really only paying out 850why are you doing taking the insuranceat all like because then you you canjustpay you know if you if it was juststraight up paying for yourself thenand you're gonna get screwed over thisway anyway then you might as well justpay the thousand out of pocket orhowever much you needthen they don't take their 15andyou don't have to worry about any ofthat stuff and you're you're you know ifyou get a big bill fine but you you alsosave money on the months whereyou're notable topay for it okay i mean when you're notpaying for it amen well especiallyespecially if you don't have enoughmoney in the bank to pay your deductibleright like you're deductible for thoseout there who need to unders you don'tunderstand how that works is you knowtypically your deductible forhealthcare.gov plan for a family issomewhere between i think it's six andten thousand dollars and so if you havea health event like you know my daughterhad her ear tubes or your you know sonbreaks his arm or whatever you know thatbroken arm is gonna be six grand andyou're gonna be if you have a sixthousand dollar deductible you areresponsible for that six thousanddollarsso if you do not have six thousanddollars in assets that you can liquidatequickly to pay that you're in you knowpretty deep deep financial issues rightand so i tell people it's like look ifif you can't cover your deductible youdon't actually have health insurance imean it's pretty uselessand then for the rest of us who do havethat amount of money then you have tosay okay why am i paying all this moneyinto these health insurance plans whenthey may or may not pay my bill andthat's where i i decided i'm not justyou know speaking here this this isaction on my my part my family like isaid has been uninsured for two and ahalf years and we've savedmore than ten thousand dollars a year bygoing uninsured and i feel moreconfident than ever that you know if ihave a big health care expense i canviably you know pay for it so i kind ofjoke that you know the two biggestenhancements to freedom that i've doneover the last two years isone go uninsured and two by bitcoin soyou know we've got we've got uh twopretty screwed up industry being ourmonetary system and our healthcaresystem i think beingvery well solved by by individualstaking it in their own responsibilityand doing it on their own so you knowthat's kind of the reason why we wentuninsured exactly what you're saying ohthis is kind of crazy to me i didn'trealize that it was this bad butbasicallyif i'm hearing you correctlywhat the insurance companies are doingis they're paying the minimum outthey're still making a profit andthey're really not going to pay out foralmostanything that's going to cut into theirprofitso as a result most people just arepaying more for their health care so theinsurance companies can make moneyrather than likeactually get insurance or some you knowcatastrophic event that they they canget covered on it's almost like it's thesystem set upso that the insurance companies can rentseek off of everybody else yeah and inreality what you know and i think it'slooktheir their intent is a profitmaximizing intent right which i'm a freemarket guy which you know i i'm like heyyou knowmaximize profit to all you can andhopefully competition comes in and youknowpush push press margin pressure on yourmargins and prices ultimately will willgo downgovernment intervention is what's doingthis because there's nobody else thatcan compete with with these healthinsurance plansand the health insurance plans islimiting profit alreadyand soyou know there is all the free marketbasics are taken out of the health caresystem and that's ultimately why our ourhealth care prices are you know twice asmuch as the nextthe next country per capita and theoutcomes aren't that good soyou know it's it's ultimately thegovernment here i wouldn't say it's youknow the insurance plans i think theintent is not you know malicious it isjust the government is is putting theseregulations in place that limit the theinvisible hand ultimately is what'sgoing oni it sounds like they created a class ofrent seekers and health insurancecompanies and gave them a nice carve outso thatwe have to pay them almost yeah thatjust seemswell that's very typical of governmentyeah it just it just sounds so horribleyeah it really is and you know look twoof the aetna and united healthcare arethe sixth and seventh largest companieson the planet in revenueand so you knowthey they have they have profited nicelyoff of of what the government has done ithinkit's i mean it's something crazy likeunited healthcare is upi think it's something like 400 percentor 500 or something like that from whenobamacare was enacted and so their stockprice and so these things are benefitingthese these health plans and look youknow these health plans and pharma are ithink one in two it may be flipped maybepharma's one and health and healthinsurance is two in terms of lobbyingdollars right and so they are spendinglots and lots of moneyensuring that these governmental moatsthat have been set up are preservedand that's a problemi mean i know that aarp has thereputation of being sort of liketheyou know the soldiers for united healthor something like that and you know theydo all of the lobbying on their behalfalmost and i know pfizer obviouslythey'reyou knowadvertising all overyou know cnn i think they they take uplike 75 of the ad dollars for cnn whichis absolutely insane and they're they'realso lobbying like crazy it almost seemslike they want the system to beperpetuated like they're protectingtheir monopoly yeah for sure for sureand look you're advertising free stuffto people who need it right like youknow that's that's the problem is if yousee an advertisement forpfizer whatever drug and you have thecondition you're gonna go to your doctorand you're gonna say give me that drugit doesn't matter if that drug isa thousand dollars or a hundred dollarsor two dollars or a hundred thousanddollars like you're you're notultimately going to pay for it beyondyour deductible and so you have verylittle incentive to really care you knowwhat thewhat the uh the price of the drug is soit just does all kinds of screwy thingsto your supply demand curvesokay so having set up all of thescrewed-up-ness of the current systemtell me about what you're doing and whyyour family is able to not be on healthinsurance for the last two years andlike what a better system looks like iguessyeah i mean i think i took a look at alot of the other ways people are payingfor their health care and trying to toput together a bundle of services thatallow people to operate outside ofyour traditional health insurance and soyou know i looked at hsas i looked atyou know some of these people arecrowdfunding some of their healthcarebills you know especially some of thereally the really big onesand so i looked at some of these thingsand i said can we put these all togetherin in a package that allows people to dothis so you know ultimately what we'vedone at crowd health isyou are if you're between the ages of 6and 54you'll put 175 bucks a month into anaccountand that account is owned by you so it'syour own bank account it's yours youknow we have no access to itbut that money will be used to helppeople in the community to pay for theirhealth care expenses so if you know theschoon overs havea broken arm you know ava breaks theirarm and at six thousand dollars theschoonovers will pay the first 500 bucksof it out of my own personal accountand then i'm going to go to the rest ofthe community and i'm going to say heycommunity the schoonovers you know havea healthcare need would you all pitch inyou know i guess would 55 of you pitchin 100 bucks to help them with the restof that bill and so it's you can say yesyou can say no it's up to you it'stotally voluntary we truly crowdfundthis but it has been very effective inpaying for the schoon overs bills soultimately i'm committed to paying thefirst 500. the community is helping meout with the rest there's no healthinsurance company in between and if youhave money in that bank account andyou're ready to leave crowd health youtake the money with you so it'sliterally your money you know you don'tstick it into a health insurance planand never see it again it doesn't gointo the health insurance black holeit's it's yours it's in your account yousee itand we find that's a pretty effectiveway of paying for some of these largerbills and you're in for 500 bucks soit's not like you know you go to the er500 bucks if you break an arm 500 bucksif youyou know have a baby 500 bucks and sothat gives people some security aroundyou know what what is this going to costme you know it and it won't put you intofinancial distressso yeah yeah go ahead yeah i mean it'scool because you'reessentially cutting out this giantrent-seeking middleman called thesehealth insurance companies who areincentivized essentially tocut as many of the benefits that you'reor like basicallyprotecting their bottom line and makingsure that they have thislike you'reinstead directly paying for these thingsbut doing it in a way so thatyou knowyou don't have the spikiness of uh youknow health events or whatever you youhave more steadyyou know outflow of money while you knowor less variance i guess it's kind oflike pulled mining almost yeah i meanthat's i think that's totally right muchless variance and so you know instead ofmy family taking on all 6 000 of thatpretty high spikebut paying nothing for the next threemonths it is hey you know you know yourfamily our family of fourmodel is 695 bucks for a family of fouryou know you pay 6.95 a month andthat flattens everything out for you andyou know if you have money at the leftover at the end then it's yours sothat's you know a great you knowincentive for people in the in all thepeople in the community to be you knowcognizant of how much they're spendingwhich is is not the case in the healthinsurance market you know the otherthing for us is we takewe're a subscription fee model so wejust take25 bucks a month as our feeso we have every incentive to increasethe number of members the more memberswe have the easier it is to pay thebills the more money we make theincentives are aligned thereyou can also think about the healthevents we're going to work our asses offto get that health event paid forbecause if it's not paid forthat person goes on facebook andinstagram and tells everybody how crowdhealth doesn't pay for their bills so weactually have the reverse incentive ofhealth insurance plans we're going towork our tails off to get that healthevent paid as opposed to the healthinsurance plan is you know incentivizednot to pay the bill because you knowwe what we just talked about and so ourincentives are much more aligned withthe community than health insuranceplansand it reminds me of like the differencebetween term and whole life insurancewhere likethe insurance companies you know thehealth insurance almost like they theyoperate under like a term and lifeinsurance kind of thing where you paymoney in and if you don't die within thespecific period that they insure you forthen you get nothing whereas whole lifeinsurance it's uh you know you have anaccount that accumulates and then theyyou know it gets paid out no matter whenyou die that's right it's kind of likethat with this wherethere's an account that you have thataccumulates and gets drawn down orwhatever butyou know that that money is yoursinstead of you know belonging to somethird party that's incentivized to keepas much of aspossible yeah and we like i said wedon't even touch that money we have noaccess to itif you give the the bankthe thumbs up that you'll transfer youknow 100 bucks from your account to theschoonovers account it goes directlyfrom your account to the schoonoversaccount we don't we don't get in betweenand that helps us you know for a varietyof reasons i mean the big challenge heregiven what we just all talked aboutright the government intervention isregulatory and so if we don't touch themoney we don't pool the money we don'tyou know the approval of those healthevents are yours you can pay for themyou don't have to pay for them it'svoluntary and so it really is truly acommunity of people who've saidyou know in an affirmative way like i amwilling to help others in the case thatthey have a big a big health care eventand there's some some beauty about thatand i think when it'syou know i was we can to kind of talkabout the bitcoin angle here at somepoint but you know one of the things ithink is kind of a beautiful thing aboutthe bitcoin community is it it is acommunity you know and it is and it is agroup of people who who wantself-sovereignty but within that youknow i think we are all drawn back tocommunity even though i was uh being abitcoin 22 in in miami and doing yourthank god for bitcoin conferencebeforehand it's just like the power ofthat community is a pretty incrediblething and we've been doing thiscommunity healthcare thing for hundredsif not thousands of years if somebody ishurt somebody needs help we as acommunity will gather around them andhelp you know that's not socialismthat's justgood kindness to your to your fellowneighbors rightand so i think we're taking that andsaying hey can we do that in health careand kind of you know it's almost back tothe future it's like can we do it likewe've always done it now we just addsome some cool you know financialtechnology on top of it and thenultimately can we add bitcoin to it andi think you've got something that'spretty specialwell so let's go back to some of theincentives what's the incentive for meto pay you said it's voluntary for me topay out a claimlike howdo i as a user of this service likefigure out whether or not like the claimis legitimate and you know like theremight be stuff like i want to remove mytattoo is that is that reallymedically necessary right likeuh like what what's the process thereand what motivates people toother than basic kindness and sense ofcommunity and stuff like thatwhat's to motivate them financially togive to the other people that are youknow seeking sure you know to be coveredyeah so there's a couple things here oneis everywell first we do filter out bills thatdo notare aren't in line with our memberguidelines so you know you can't haveyou can't get a boob job like you can'tremove your tattoo you can't get youknow things that are cosmetic in thatway so we have a very clear outline ofthings that we will not submit to thecommunity for funding just to keeppeople from submitting stupid stuffand then second we score all of thosebills right if they do pass that filterwe score them it's red yellow green andit's basically like hey did this personshop you know at all like you know wegot some pretty awesome stories aroundpeople whoyou know we had this couple in inwisconsinneeded a heart procedure it was eightysix thousand dollars at their localhospitalyou know we found another hospital thatwould do it for forty four thousanddollars we found a third hospital thatthey'd have to fly to that would do itfor 22 000and so you know they allowed us to toshop around for the best price and againit's adding market forces to to thehealth care and so they ultimatelydecided to go for the one that was 22000 so we put them first class ticketstotheir their location we gave them thebest hotel and in that that city we paidthem 2 500 for their time and we stillsaved 50 000 on that bill so you know wehelp people navigate that and so we'llscore that bill like hey this is a greenbill we thinkthis is a good one you should pay for ityou know a rented one would be like i'vegot the flu and i want the mayo clinicand you knowit cost me 10 000 to tell me that i hadthe flu like don't be a dummy rightand so you'll see that when you when wepresent it to you the second thingyou'll see is what we call the the theyou know a reputation score soyou know if i give ifi i'm asked ten times to give you knowover the course of a year or whateverand i sayno to nine of the tenthen people will see that i'm a scroogeright like i'm not a very good member ofthe community and so when i have ahealth care bill they'll see that andthey'll be like hey andy like you're notgiven to the community so why should thegive community give to youright and so it eliminates thefreeloader you know concept andit this reciprocity engine is whatreally kind of fuels thatthat you know desire to help right soyou know we've crowdfundedout several hundred bills at this pointand i think it was a 98 of the peoplesaid yes when we've askedand so it has done a really nice job ofgetting people to be generousand so those are the kind of the twofundamental things that drive this it'sone you know are you a good health careconsumer and two are you a good memberof the community and you'll see thosetwo components and that has been prettyeffective in in giving people a prettygood indication of whether or not theyshould fund this billwell that that's really interestingbecause you do eliminate for likehypochondriacs that are going into theer every five days because they thinkthey have the latest disease orsomething like that you and you alsogive an incentive to try to find thebest deal right like use actual marketforces what do you say to the peoplethat are like why are you playing gameswith my health right like it's like uhyou knowthey maybe they still associate you knowhigh price with high quality orsomething like that yeah it's like umokay wellthis doctor you know i where am i gonnaget surgery the one that's charging 80000 or 20 000 yeah i mean maybe theyfeel safer with the 80 000 like whatwhat do you do with something like thatyeah i mean it's it's interesting rightbecauseit is the inverse of what you'd thinkin just society in general right youwant to go to the nicest hotel you'regoing to pay the most in healthcare it'sit's almost the opposite of that sowe've got a guy in town here in austinwhojust does knee replacements he does ithink is something silly like five orsix knee replacements a day or somethingi mean it's it's back to back-to-backknee replacements that's all he doesso you know would you expect him to bebetter or worse than the averageorthopedic surgeon at knee replacementswho you know the average orthopedicsurgeon does shoulders and wrists andknees and ankles and pretty much everyjoint you can think of well you'd thinkhe'd be better right than the averagebecause if you have a complication he'sseen this thing a hundred times he'sspecialized in it he's really good at itand sotherefore he's also way less expensiveright because he's interesting he doesthem over and over and over and over andover again you know think of a a jobshop you know a medal making factorythat every different piece isyou know you paid for every piece it's apiece meal type of thing as opposed toan assembly line which everyone is theexact same right the assembly line canmake them for way cheaper than the thepiecemeal you know kind of consultingtype of company that you see out thereright and so that's the same ashealthcare is most of the time thehigher quality doctors are lower pricedand so the example i just gave you thisguy in oklahoma is like the leadingcardiologist in this procedure that weasked him to doand he was 25of what the local hospitalwho had done i think one or two of theseprocedures in the last year so who wouldyou rather go to you know the 86 the 86000 guy who's done done it twice in thelast year right or the 22 000 guy who'sdone it 100 times in the last year rightlike you'd want to go to the guy whoand and we have this data right and sowe can tell you when you say hey i wantto get myacl repaired i can tell you the doctorsin town that have the most complicationsfrom acl repairs right so would you wantto go to the guy who's got twocomplications per 100 or do you want togo to the guy who has 15 complicationsyou know per 100you'd want to go to the two right and sowe can actually lead you to that rightdoctor and that doctor is going to bemore times than not less expensive thanthe one who has 15 complications per 100so let's use that data toactually be better consumers of healthcare and the health plans just don't dothat right so and by the way wenegotiate for you so we don't ask you tonegotiate with your doctoryou know it's something we know thatyou're not comfortable with and so youknow we're doing one right now it's anacl replacement we're negotiatingdirectly with the doctor and we're gonnasave probably six or seven thousanddollars on that acl tear because we'renegotiating with the doctor and findinga really good you know hospital to do itat and all that kind of stuff so wedon't ask you to do that we take thatburden on ourselvesit's a it's a part of our strengthsyeah it reminds me of like how athletesall go to like dr james andrews inalabama or something like thatlike somehow he's become like the expertat like sports knee cartilage stuff orsomething like that and he doesabsolutely everybody's and you know thatthat sort of specializationseems like it could beit could make the market a lot moreefficient and a lot better because yeahthey can charge less because this iswhat they do all day and they obviouslyhave a lot more capacity to do thatbecause if that's the only thing thatthey're doing that and you know it workswell the other big component here is youknow if if i came to you and i said heyjimmy i'll pay you you know in cashright now or even better i'll pay you inbitcoin right now ori'll pay you in three months and i'm notgonna tell you exactly what i'm gonnapay youand by the way you're gonna have tonegotiate with me over the next threemonths to get paid you know what wouldyou choose you choose the bitcoin todayright and so with our customers the thevalue that we bring is that we're payingthe the doctor on the day of the surgeryor or at the point of care is how wecall it you know with the healthinsurance plans those those those docsdon't get paid for60 or 90 days they often have to kind ofrenegotiate with the health plan they'renot exactly sure how much they're goingto get paid because the way that thesecontracts are written areclunky and so it's like they're willingto give us a really significant discountif they're if they can get paid on theday of of the surgery or procedure andso we're saving 30 to 50you know just by paying you know cash onthe day of the of the procedure and thedoctors love it they're like this isamazing like i would do this all daylong can you bring me more patience i'llgive you big discounts so this is notthis is this is truly a win-win betweenthe patient and the doctor this is notlike to lower health care we have totake you know a chunk out of somebody'shide no no it's it's getting rid of thehealth insurance plan and making thethe the care being back between thedoctor and the patient about a thirdparty interveningi think what you're saying is that notonlyare the health insurance companies whenseeking off of the actual patients butthey are off the doctors as well andthey're very happy about getting rid ofthisvery frictionladen point whichwhere they get screwed to 30 of thedoctor's time is dealing with healthinsurance plansand they're like man if you can give methat 30 back and i don't have to talk tosome administrator at a health planwho's never seen my patient and thinksthat they know everything about mypatient and what my patient should orshould not receive you know the carethey should receive they're like i wouldwe would love that right so you knowdoctors are at like an all-time burnoutrate partially because of the pandemicpartially because of you know healthinsurance and a bunch of other thingsbut i mean i think this could be anational crisis where some of these docsare like screw this i'm just going to goyou know work in private equity orsomething and help these these bigfinancial firms buy health carecompanies i'm going to get paid way moreand i don't have to deal with the the bsof of health insurance and regulationand all this kind of other stuffwell so let's go back to that financialcomponent because uh you know if you arein control of your health care accountessentially and you you basically have apool of money set aside for thishealthcare thing that you could takewith you whenever you wantyou knowthis seems like a very good place forbitcoin right like you instead of savingin dollars you save in bitcoin in thisaccount[Music]and that way it continues to grow andyou can afford to be a little moregenerouspossibly you know pay out the25 a month service for all the workyou're doing negotiating and figuringsetting up the system and all that likethat that seems like a win for everybodyyeah i think so andi'm thanks thanks to you for the ideayou know i i uh we sat down at lunch imean i don't knowa year ago nine months ago somethinglike that and and i was as i was tellingyou about what i'm doing you said wellyou know why don't you hold this stuffin bitcoin like what that'd be that'd beawesome instead of holding it in a bighealth insurance plan you know pool ofdepreciating assetsyou know what if you held it in bitcoinand sowe are actively building that serviceright now and so you know the way itwould work is you would put fiatinto an account it would be converted75 of it would be converted to tobitcoin we're we're working with abitcoin onlycompany right now you know you wouldknow the name i want to withhold thatuntil i we get this thing finalized butwe we want you to have self-custody ofthat 75with 25sitting in cash because when i ask youto help with a health event i you knowyou don't want to sell your bitcoin soyou have some cash there to pay it sosome some liquidityand then you get the upside of that thatbitcoin so if what are we at today 39 orsomething like that if it goes from 39to 400 000 that upside is yours and soit's almost like a forced savings planthat has the added benefit ofof helping you with your your healthcare um and so that's the way that we'rewe're structuring it currently andeverything else is going to work thesame so we've got all the otherinfrastructure ready to go we're justlooking we found a company andintegrating with them now that's goingto help us with kind of the managementof the the the keys and and of thebitcoin side of this so we think it's apretty innovative way of of doing thisyou know the other part of this that issuper cool i think isyou will be fundingbills of only bitcoiners so we're goingto have a bitcoin crowd as we're callingit um so you'll all be in the samecommunity andyou know the great part about that isyou know as i was walking around bitcoin22 in miami a couple weeks ago um youknow they're younger they're healthiergenerally than the population they haveyou know a higher sense of personalresponsibility which means you know ithink there's a less likelihood of themyou know trying to scam the system andso you know i think it's a really coolcrowd to be a a part of and that's whatwe're currently building soonce we get to a thousand people who areinterested we're we're we'll be off tothe races we've gotprobably all 350 or 400 so far and we'veonly been marketing it for about twoweeks so you know if any of yourlisteners are interested in being a partof that community um we'd love for youto consider ityeah where can they find that likewhat's the url like where can they goi'm sure a bunch of people listening arelike oh oh i i am so on down on thislike i i'm so down for this becausemany of us are you knowlike not working at a traditionalcompany and you know like going tohealthcarecare.gov is a nightmare andif if the numbers really do line up theway you say they do then it seems like ano-brainer especially if you can keepyourhealthcarecosts or the healthcare premiums thatyou're putting in to this black hole ofuh health insurance instead if you canput it into uh essentially what's asavings accounti mean that that seems like that's ahuge win like you're you're convertingsomething to a from a cost to a savingsvehicle yeah for sure i mean uh we'vegot a little landing page set up calledcrowdhealthbtc.comum it it's a one-pager that tells youwhat we're doing um at the bottom ofthat page it gives you the opportunityto give us your email address and howmany people in your family would beinterestedand then once we hit a thousand peopleinterested then we're going to send outanother email and said we're ready toroll so we just need to get to thatthousand because it's just notfinancially viable under a thousand imean you and i wouldn't want to get intoa community and you know if i come downwith cancer you know uh it would betough so we we need a thousand people toto get on board with this and um i'mhoping you know with podcasts like thisand in other ways we can get that inshort order somy guess is that we'll be you know readyto roll mid-summer and you know just interms of the integrations being done andare a thousand people being being readyto go soyou know please go and sign up if you'reinterested in something like this we'dlove your support and um you know so fari will tell you that with ourour current group of folks um theaverage age is 34.the umthe body mass index is uh four to fivepoints lower than the national averageof the amount of money that people havecontributed to their accounts over thelast year we've used 21 of that thatmoney which means that they have 79percent leftum you know and and so that's why youknowwe think this is a working really reallyeffectively so would love anybody who'slistening to uh to join uswell so do you have to bein the u.s to participate or can you dothis internationally or what what arethe restrictions for people that thatare interested yeah so um you have tohave a u.s address that's inc thatincludes puerto rico um i know that wehave some bitcoin folks in puerto ricoso that does include puerto rico umso you have to be in u.s we're lookingat what the regulatory requirements arefor some of the other countries to beable to to to do thisfunny enough the closest comparison towhat we're doingis in in kenya of all things they've gotcommunities of people who do you knowsimilar things and actually met somebodyat bitcoin22 that that is involved inthat project in in some ways that waskind of cool um so we're looking atother countries in which we think thiswill will be helpful but uh right nowwe're we're focused on the united statesandhopefully you know beyond that in thenext you know year or two soso the economics are very interestingyou said something like you you've used21of the money that's gone in solike you know for people that areputting in say like a hundred dollars amonth out of the 1200 they they stillhave 79 of it in their account is thatwhat you're saying that is correctokay and if they kept it in bitcoin itmight you know like depending on thetime horizon and stuff like that thatthat that could easily cover all of itand still have some left yeah in dollartimes yeah i mean i ilook i mean people roll my roll theireyes when i tell them that but i i thinkthis model if if bitcoin does what wethink bitcoin is going to do you knowover the nextfive to ten years or even shorter timeperiod i mean i i think there are peoplethat will never have to pay for healthcare again you know using this model imean i truly i truly believe thatyeahthe numbers work out right like that'sthe numbers are the numbers like if it's21 over a year then it's likewait a second is is that how much thehealth insurance companies are takingit's it's making me mad more thananything else yeah well i mean and lookand and so i'm not saying that it'salways going to be that if we have youknow a big a big cancer case or you knowsomething like that it you know we'llwe'll ask some people to to dig into ita little bit more butyou know thus far we've we've been ableto you know really massively reduce costlike i saidthat last example i gave you that heartprocedure you know the health plan wouldhave paid 86 000and we paid in essence you know allcosts and everything else included 30right i mean that is happening onthe majority of the procedures of peoplecoming to us this this acl terror thatwe have here in austin the health planwas going to pay you know would pay 20.we'll pay probably 12.and so you know it's justthere is that much inefficiency in inthe market currently thatis is you know in our our 21 is theproduct of thatjust we're able to significantly reducethese costs and by the way you'regetting into the group of early adoptersand something that's i think is cool andinnovative and they do too and and thatthey're self-selecting so we just have ahealthy group of people right and that'snot because we're putting a bunch ofrestrictions on it's it's all becausethey're self-selecting early adopterstend to beyou know younger andmore healthy than folks that are kind oflater stage adopters of new technologysoum we do have a really young crewwell i that that sounds super excitingand i i'm surea lot of people listening to this youknow they've been red pilled on a lot ofthings including finance hopefully theyare now onhealth care and this is a niceactionable step that you can take whichisyou know kind of unusual in a lot of alot of this red pilling it'shey there's an alternative here and itit kind of makes sense the moreyou know you think about the economicsof it because you know you're sayingunited healthcare at the you know umi guess uh all the pharma companies yeahthey have to make their money fromsomewhere and they're they're largelymaking it by rent seeking orget becoming the middlemen that don'tadd any value and if you eliminate thatyou can reduce the cost just sosignificantly all over the place and i ithink that's what you're showing so i'mi'm so glad that you brought all of thisupso any concluding thoughts about healthcare or any like sort ofi don't know screeds or rants that youwant to go on about how the currentsystem works because i imagine you youyou've thought about this quite a bitand you know you you have certain uhperspectives on how why it's set up theway it has yeah you know i i umi'll just tell you a lot of ourcustomers are coming from two places oneis they have previously been or they'rethey are uninsured right so they theyare in a place of saying hey you knowif i can if i can save andget a little bit more confidence that mybig health event is going to get paidfor in the case that that happens theycome over to usand then the other one is healthcare.govfolks who you know have gotten intohealthcare.govhave seen the error of their ways andyou know have come over to us as welland so you know if there are folks outthere listening that are in one of thosetwo campsyou know i would love for you all toconsider us i mean healthcare.govultimately is an additional expeditionof the government into your healthcareright like this is they are they areexpandingwith an ultimate goal of of medicare forall which i think is going to be a totalyou know disasterand so you knowif you're on healthcare.gov you are inin some way supporting that initiativeand so i'm just you know this issomebody talking who was onhealthcare.gov and kind of saw that andwas like you know what i'm going to dosomething different and soyou know love for those people toconsider an altar whether it's us or anyof the other alternatives out there butyou know you know please kind ofreconsider that so that's my only kindof rant takeaway you know anduh and i'll echo michael saylor andbitcoin22 is don't sell your bitcoin soi'm thankful to you jimmy for uh fororange peeling me you know a a year agoand i you know fortunately got in in thelow 30s so i'm i'm feeling still prettygood about all this and you know i'msuper excited about just the bitcoincommunity and and now being officially apart of it soa lot of this is is thanks to youwell hey like i think what you're doingis fantastic and if you can fix thishealthcare thingwhich i i think everyone knows iscompletely and utterly broken in theunited stateswe would be enormously grateful forbeing able
