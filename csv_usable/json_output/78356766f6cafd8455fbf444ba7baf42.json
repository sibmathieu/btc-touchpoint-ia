all Eric's fault all of themwere Eric's fault I put all the Blair onhim yeah we all [ __ ] we all [ __ ] it upat one point or another you knowyeah exactlyum well how you been we were justtalking about not uh nasricafomoso uh absolutely how is everyone it'sbeen a while it's been too long I thinkthe last one wasthe fall over six months ago I think itwas yeah it wasyeah it was sometime in the fall I thinkmaybe October a lot of shit's gone onsince then was that pre FTX or post ftx3did that one free by the way you knowwhat's funny that feels like [ __ ]ancient history now like at the time Iremember it being all consuming allconsuming to the point where we're likeI was learning intimate details of thesex lives of the founders and all of uswere on Twitter right and then it justdisappearedlike you just you didn't hear about itanymore you know and then there wereobviously several more collapses thathappened after the fact and we're goingthrough Credit Suisse right now whichlooks like it's going to getnationalized and I was listening to youknow robbers let's say to your spaceyesterday of Bellagio who I think uh weall like this is what somebody asked meabout Bellagio in his million dollarprediction I said I believe in I believeeverything that Bellagio said everythingexcept for the timeline I I don't knowthat I believe that timeline I wouldlike to maybe believe that timeline butI just can't get there you know but doeshe I don't think he thinks Bitcoin isgoing to be worth a million dollars orthe US dollar is going to value thatmuch in the next three months I thinkhe's more doing this as a I mean asidefrom any of his personal motivations Ithink he's doing it to bring attentionto this issue more than him you knowbecause if he thought that he'd just buyit now with all of his available Capitalyou know it doesn't make any sense wellI mean he's literally done that too Ithink it's Apollothe printing is comingyeah well I'm like it's a bit like uhit's Max Kaiser is setting a hundreddollars on fire times ten thousand youknow like he he's trying to show likethis money is actually worthless like Ihave I have billions of these so much sothat I will set one million of them onfire to make an explicit statement thatI can't set one million of theseBitcoins on fireum like the the play out of all this isso poetic and what makes me what's themost beautiful is that like this wholecycle got set off as a domino effect byguys leveraging on the hype cycle thatis now happeningyeah I mean like the the fact that thatwhole art goes all the way through ispretty incredible you know and uh do youmean like they were anticipating what'shappening now but just earlier and theygot blown up as a result is that whatyou mean yeah and literally because oftheir anticipation of it and theleverage in it they then blew it up thatthen caused for the very crisis thatthey've been waiting for so it's justlike and this is this is justcontinually how [ __ ] comes up in thisspace that's so beautiful is that likeit's literally like a Greek tragedyplaying itself out with every singleaction having a deeper purpose like lookat it look at the the board of peoplethat are involved with SBA or no withSPF but with Sultan yeah too many toomany starting with that like it'sliterally the entire cast of charactersfrom 2008 like reset inside of this it'spretty funnyto go back to the uh just tying it tothe FTX thingI remember when that Scandal was goingon there was this little diagram showingwhat FTX was doing or they're basicallyprinting new token using it ascollateral to borrow and it was justthis circular logic thing right whereit's self-contained [ __ ] Financialillusionand I remember thinking to myself at thetime that that's exactly what the thefed and the treasury doit's like treasury Issues new [ __ ] coinBond fed issues no [ __ ] going dollar tobuy it rinse and repeat and I love howuh apology called it called this newthis next way of a banking crisissomething like Uncle Sam bankman freedbecause it's the same thing it's thesame principle mechanically just in adifferent wrapper a different veneer anduh and I agree completely with withhoddle like the it all makes sense thisis the same thesis that bitcoiners havebeen advocating for for a long time hejust has an extremely aggressivetimetable for it and I feel a lot ofdissonance because in one sense it'slike all right I hope the guy's rightthat puts all the bitcoiners on top ofthe world in a very serious waybut the world that we would be on top ofif the if the dollar collapsed in 90days like probably not a pretty one soI still I guess I lean more towards uh alot the longer this takes the betteryou don't want it to take too longobviously butum I think the the longer the transitionthe smoother the transitionI'm I'm with you entirely and by the waythat Uncle Sam bankman freed line was so[ __ ] fire I was pissed off I didn'tthink of it I was like God damn that'sgood you know what I mean uh Eric toEric to your point about this all beinglike a Greek tragedy and it's likeenthralling and enmeshing andentertaining and beautiful and poeticthat's all true Until you realize you'rea character in it and then you go oh[ __ ] [ __ ] this is this might turn outbad it's either gonna be really bad orreally good you know what I mean so yeahI'm I'm with Rob though I don't want itto take a super long time I I sorry Idon't want it to be very short andunravel very quickly I want it to takeas long as possible I want to get asmany people in the Lifeboat as possibleand I I have I ran through the exercisein my head thinking throughhyperinflation yesterday when I washearing about this Bellagio stuff I saidto myself who am I going to be in thatmoment and I determined that I am goingto be one of the people that stands bythe Lifeboat that's who I'm going to beand if it means I have to go down withthe ship I will get as many people offthe Titanic humanly possible you knowwhat I mean and I feel like that's forme anyway that's the answer I came upcame up with yeah well I think in someregions all of us have already made thatchoice because if not we'd just be likeAnonymous Nims like you know living ourbest life somewhere we're we're kind ofalready wrapped up in this in one wayyou know one way or the other and uh youknow I II agreewell I Rob what was your impressionabout uh like inter just back tobalaji's motivations for a moment likedo you think that's an actualuh you know bet that he's making andplanning to win or again you just thinkthis is just a Paul Revere thing yeahhe's trying to bring attention to itum I mean I think it's a Paul Reverething but also there's going to be Idon't think he's going to be takingmuch of a beating on this right I'm surebiology is very early to bitcoin soprobably the spread that we've had inthe last week more than pays for thatbet for him right oh yeah um not to saythat that justifies it like it's it'sstill he's still doing something even ifyou're doing the Paul Revere move you'retaking some risks right or you're you'reburning some Capital let's say to kindof send a signalumyou know I don't think it's anythingthat's gonna hurt him economically buthe's definitelyburning some Capital to make a publicitystunt not and I'm not saying that in anegative way necessarily like it's kindof a it's a good thing right I havepeople I had 50I had 50 people reach out to me about itprobably like through different channelssay like did you hear about this do youknow this guy and like a few people Iwould say of those 50-ish messages I gotlike five people were like very seriouslike oh I need to pay attention toBitcoin nowso I mean there's something to thatright we can do all we want in theBitcoin Echo chamber but you can't getthat kind of signal to propagate withoutpulling a publicity stuff like that sothere's some value in it umwell that that's kind of that's as faras I see the personal motivations Idon't know if there's anything elsebeneath that I mean maybe I'm missingsomething but I think that I mean it'sit's beneficial from the perspective ofhoddle just mention you know like youit's all it's a Greek tragedy Until yourealize you're a character in it and Ithink people are beginning to realizeand this is obviously a big part ofbalaji's point is that you can becomemore of a spectator because we're allwrapped up in all this in some way shapeor form but you can insulate yourself tosome degree and probably to a largedegree from what's Happening if you youknow if you step into the Bitcoin realmif you adopt Bitcoin so yes I mean ifwhat really unfolds or if like thiswhole house of cards really collapses ina you know in a very Rapid Way then yeaheveryone's everyone's lives are going tobe disrupted in some way but this is theway that you you know you maximallyinsulate yourself from it and then yougo down the you know the rabbit hole ofbeing Sovereign in other areas of yourlife but obviously this is number oneright get your Monopoly money andconvert that into Bitcoin and that's theway that you can at least sit back alittle bit and be likeyou can watch it as a with a little bitmore entertainment value sorry to saybut you know what I'm saying like youcan be a spectator of it rather thanjust being totally a victim of itright soyeah it's a great point the thing thatconcerns me though is you know when youstudy these hyperinflations when themarkets collapse that destroyseverything right like we saw we got alittle glimmer of it with covet right ohSupply chains are disrupted I can't gettoilet paper or this that and the otherit's like well take that times athousand that's a hyperinflation yeah soeven if you're sitting on a fat stack ofrapidly appreciating Bitcoin your lifeis still going to be disrupted yeahtotally it won't be destitute you'llhave something to trade presumably Imean sure if this all goes to hell inthe next few months I mean is Bitcoindecoupling or is this just a head fakeand we don't [ __ ] know if if thestock market's tank another 30 40 do youreally think bitcoin's not going to gowith it I mean that's the big questionright now I always I message this tobiology last night too I was like haveyou seen I sent him the chart of thegold price during the the Weimarhyperinflation which you guys haveprobably seen like it's all over theworld right it's not like gold just isup and to the right it's up hundreds ofpercent one month down 80 the next monthkind of thing I would expect Bitcoin todo something similarum but there isn't and he makes it hemakes a great point though that beingthis the being that we're in the digitalage like that throws a whole notherweird dynamic into the situation howquickly information and ideas move so Ithat either makes it way faster or waymore volatile or maybe bothI'm really curious about the reflexivenature of Bitcoin in this because likeyou know we've seen plenty ofhyperinflation before but we haven'tseen hyperinflation with a readilyavailableLifeboat to gather into and so I'mreally curious if the reflexive dynamicbecause like the as much as I I have tobe like balja I'm with you that timelinedoesn't work the one thing I can pointout is that he was the dude that calledcovet totally and even with covet itseemed like that timeline didn't makesense and like that well not thattimeline he freaked out a little bit youknow so he he called some of the changesthat would happen as a result but he wasa bit of a hysteric as far as I remembersure and I think he's doing the the thesame thing here as a bit of a again thePaul Ravine but uh I I just have towonder if that reflexive nature can geta feedback loop that's going toaccelerate much quicker than any of us Ithink just because of the dynamic natureof the internet you know the fact thatSilicon Valley Bank lost 40 billiondollars in one day like that that issuch an absurd amount of money somebodydid the math and it was something liketwo million dollars per second a daywhich is is that's such an absurd amountcomparatively to any other bank run thathas ever happened in all of humanhistoryyou know and the fact that they dealtwith that and didn't collapse totally interms of not being able to to haveliquid functions continue is I think apretty powerful statement so I'm curiousto see how it all plays outI think just a double double click onsomething that Eric just said theconcept of reflexivity for anybody inthe audience who like doesn't understandthat fully because it's a very importantconcept to understand is basically canbest be summarized as not only do uhmines move markets but also markets moveminds and there's this constantinterplay between the two and I thinklike the bank run thing that's happeningnow is definitely a reflexive phenomenonbecause here's the here's the secret ifanybody wants to know there's no moneyin any of the banks none of them so whathappens if the world figures that out atonce suddenly you have a bank runpandemic you have contagion that we'venever seen before you can't shut downall the social media you know what Imean like the the people that are smartsophisticated money like the guys likePeter Thiel were calling Founders andtelling them there's going to be a bankrun on svb days before it happenedtelling them to pull their money andthen that precipitated the bank run andthat can happen at every bank and thenit can Domino from One bank to the nextto the next to the next and then the FEDwould would come in the the USgovernment is not going to just allowthe banking sector to collapse so theywould backstop everything and when theybackstopped everything they would haveto print more money than you've everseen in your entire life to do it waymore than what we saw in covet I mean itwould be and two orders of magnitudeBeyond covet it would be a hundredtrillion to bail out the banking systemlike it would be something insane so Imean there's a real risk of that andpeople don't understand exponentials wethink linearly like human evolution didnot set us up to think exponentiallythis is why things that are exponentiallike viruses they catch us off guardevery [ __ ] time and then decimate usyou know what I mean well this this iswhy cbdcs are so important to thembecause like this is literally how theycan print out a hundred trillion dollarsgive it to people and have it not have adirect effect because they go no no thisis something new we're reissuing atotally new system this is all backstopnow it's accountable directly to the theFederal Reserve and again with thepoeticness of everything the fact thatcbdcs could only be invented afterBitcoin by takinga corrupted version of the time chainwhich is a [ __ ] coin called theblockchain and then utilizing thatexpensive highly modifiable database inorder to create a central bank digitalcurrency is I mean it's a bit of achef's kiss thing like mwah like Satoshiin creating Bitcoin you also had theoriginal sin that had to be possiblethrough the corruption of this form of adatabasebeautiful I always go back to that quotethat I'm all those paraphrase are likethe greatest shortcoming of the humanrace is our inability to understand theexponential functionand title's point like we are not youalways have to takethat always that quote always makes youjust sit back in humility for a minuteit's like no matter what you think youknow what mental model you've got goingon even when you've run the spreadsheetlooked at the exponential decay functionof Bitcoinand what you would expect that to do toits price or adoption like you stillhave to sit back and take all that witha grain of salt and realize you're justan ape playing in the dirt that's notreally wired to understand theimplications of of exponents andexponents and power laws they dominateuh natural phenomena right so we're kindof like living through one of those andthe reflexivity thing I think it's justa feedback loop right I mean feedbackloops are everywhere in nature it's howbiology responds and relates to itsenvironment but what's weird about itwith Bitcoin is that you know if thegold price goes upwell gold production goes up right thenew Supply it's the market trying tothat that's now being incentivized to besold on the market but with Bitcoinprice goes up and no new BitcoinproductionBitcoin production never changes rightit's it's 10 minute blocks whatever thealgorithm says for that that havingEpoch is is what theum coinbase subsidy is going to beand so all of the Bitcoin price changesI think what we call it like the perfectinelasticity of Supply that no matterhow much bitcoin's price changes all ofthatall of the changes in demand getexpressed through the price notexpressed through new Supply issuancebecause Bitcoin Supply issuance cannotchangeand so I think that could be reallyinteresting to see play out right likenot only do we have faster reflexivitybecause we're in the digital age butit's also a reflexivity on thisabsolutely immutable uh perfectly fixedsupplied assetand you can't you know it's kind of likea release valve for the market it's ifthe gold price goes way up we'll let abunch of new gold hits the market andthat sort of brings things to anequilibrium more quickly but that's justnot possible with Bitcoin so thisflywheel effect could bemuch longer lasting potentially and andI'm excited to seeI mean that's I guess you're kind ofkind of like restating the thesis forhyper bitcoinization on that point butit'll be exciting to see what happens inthe marketplace withoutdoes anyone know in that Weimar chartthat was referenced has anyone heard anexplanation for what caused such extremevolatility in such a you know how manyyears that was was that likeit was two years that was two years twoyears so like what's the explanation forhow such was like so you're in Weimarshit's hitting the fan hyperinflationhappening everywherewhat constitutes the change in demandfor something like gold presumably asafe haven during a period like thatwhere people like oh [ __ ] like run togold and then months later dump it andthen run to it again push it even higherand then once later dump itthere was just like a lot of weirdbalance of payments things I rememberit's been a long time since I've readabout it but I remember that likethere were all kinds of crazy ass dealsthe German government was doing likethey like they would barter lumber forlike coal and they would like so theybecause the thing is that everybodydidn't believe in the mark and so Ithink a lot of it was sort of the chainreaction of various uh like nationstates rejecting the mark as a form ofpayment demanding only gold or than themputting something else in in addition tolike this is all the reflex you knoweffed up thing that's going on andeverybody also knew that the Mark wasfailing so they were piling into stocksand gold and everything and like thatthis is just like the giant crazy effedup mess that happens when you start[ __ ] with you know the most basiccommodity of money is that like nothingcan price itself in a meaningful way sothe only thing that you have to dopricing is Extreme volatility[Music]the chart I'm looking at at least is1914 to 1923. okay I I was specificallyjust looking at theyeah this this one that goes from thebottom of at the end of 20 all the wayup to 23. yeah yeahI also think you know one one way tocome to a conclusion about what may havehappened during that time period isthink through what you would do ifBitcoin actually did hit a milliondollars in the next 90 days you woulddefinitely make some moves you would belike I'm probably gonna buy some realestate probably gonna get a bug outlocate you know I'm gonna do some stuffand there would be these waves ofdumping and then re-buying and dumpingand rebuying people would be trying totrade into different things and therewould be a you know reflexive phenomenonbetween the holders of you know uhprecious real estate Etc uh and thenpeople that wanted Bitcoin and that'sthat's probably likely what was going onin Weimar as well yeah I mean theBitcoin chart today it almost looks likethat chart that Rob you just put inthere I mean you look at bitcoin's14-year history and that's what it'sbeen doing you know run up crash run upcrash but it's just the the price keepsgoing up you know higher every time andcrashing a little bit lower and thatseems to be what that chart is you knowso as so many people have remarked on ornoticed lately like Bitcoin seems to bethe only true signal out there in theworld today it's 24 hour you can'tcorrupt it it's just pureit's a pure expression of what ishappening in the market with nomanipulation and no Distortion and so Ithink it's increasingly becoming andwill continue to become like alike a forward signal sort of thing likean early signal as to what is going tohappen in other marketsI mean yeah I I'm just so fascinated atlike how the [ __ ] did we get into ourworld where things are so corruptedmanipulated contorted and upside downthat like Bitcoin is the only realmarket price signal that doesn't haveinstitutional manipulation going like itI'm always just taken aback by how[ __ ] insane it is that we live inthis day and age where like everythingis so thoroughly corrupted that like Iliterally have to trust magic internetmoney as the only thing that's not goingto [ __ ] lie and steal from me likeit's just it's just so bananas I just Iimagine this is that's my great greatgrandfather about it and just being likeyeah yeah man just just commit suicidelike it's time time to go on but don'tdon't do itpoints about how important the way upthe way the global Reserve currency isstructured that is super important thatis sacrosanct there is not a thing inthis world that money doesn't touchmoney touch is everything that's aroundme it touches me it touches you ittouches all of us every single thing inthe entire world so when the money iscorrupted when the money is broken guesswhat so is the [ __ ] world you knowwhat I mean it always comes back to thatpointwell it's amazing how like it it seemsto actually be like a fundamentallinguistic function of that like if youare lying about your base value Assetlike you were going to lie abouteverything yeahum we've beenwe worked on this film series I was likegoing into Carl Young and anyways longshort we started to like see theseparallels between kind of jungianthinking this is uh Mike kill who was onthe show and and mises and Austrianeconomics right they sort of came up atthe same timethey they're contradictory schools tothe mainstream narrativeum and they've both been kind of shunnedby by Academia you know like Academiawent towards post-modernism and awayfrom the Union School in the same wayyou know universities went towardsKeynesian economics and away fromAustrian economicsand one of the things we we try tocrystallize that parallel in this phrasewe said economicsis public psychology and psychology isprivate economicsand so obviously economics being publicpsychology you've got a bunch of Mindswired together with a price signal rightso like one big hive mind you knowallocating serious resources inaccordance with the preferences ofconsumers Etc the psychology one's alittle bit more mysterious but the way Iinterpret that isum you know even an animal is makinglike the leopard laying on the grass orin the tree wherever he's at he'srunning an expected value calculationbefore he does anything right it's notnot to say he's explicitly doing mathbut he's deciding how hungry am I howfast is the gazelle is it injured youknow what's my probability of success sothere's this this economic componenteven to like an end of animal psychologyand so I think that when you say moneytouches everythinglike it's notit's inside and out right likeinternally we're running the softwarecalled money externally we're using itto run the economic system run thepricing system which is one of the mostcommunication most importantcommunication systems in the worldand soI we've we all understand this asbitcoiners I think we all struggle tolike describe it withgreat scientific Clarity but it is thatit's the notion that's captured in ifyou you know break the money break theworld fix the money fix the worldthe fact that we have this economicether that we're all swimming inyou can think of it maybe like a like ablood disease for the socioeconomicsuper organism that we're all a part ofand umyou know we're throwing different wordsat this thing but basically it's moneythat connects us all together rightthe laptop that I'm usinghad inputs from tens of thousands orhundreds of thousands of people thatI'll never meet or know yet I'mcommunicating with them as a consumer ofa MacBook Proso when we corrupt that orwhat do we yeah corrupt I guess it's theonly real word for it we corrupt thatcommunication mediumof course it destroys everything we dolike everything we think all theproducts we produce all the institutionswe createand um I feel like that idea that I'mtrying to get towards is like the bigidea all the bitcoiners want to gush outonto the rest of the world it's likelook guys it's so [ __ ] obviousum but difficult to talk aboutso why it's the Fiat system is sooffensive to so many of us because likeif whether you came into Bitcoin firstor whether you justyou know revered ideals or ethics orvalues like honesty and integrity andhumility and all that kind of stufffirstif that if those are things that you'veyou've valued and you've tried tointegrate into your life and yourperspective and all and embodied invarious ways then when you see this thisFiat system that you're forced to let'ssay interact with at least to somedegree that I think that's why it's sooffensive because as you say Rob I meanthere's an intuitive understanding thatbasically the market is justConsciousness externalized in variousrespects and we're seeing a corruptedConsciousness and we've all put in thework to clarify our Consciousness toconstitute it in a manner that we deemto be most appropriate more most propermost integrated with the the the mostreal things the most truthful thingslet's say and when we see themanifestation of basically the oppositeof that or at least a highly distortedcorrupted version of that out in themarket souh yeah we're so offended by it which isalso why those of us who felt that wayonce the penny dropped for Bitcoin itwas so exciting because we realized thiswas kind of the extension of thatproperly integratedconscious framework let's say out intothe world in the inter-subjective spaceand that's like a mind-blowing thing andthat that's what makes you think thatlike you you can correct so many if youcan correct those problems withinyourselfnow there's a mechanism to correct themin the inter-subjective world by thistool and uh yeah I mean what what couldbe more exciting than that and to yourpoint about you know this kind of beinglike uh you know blood disease or acancer you know Fiat being a blooddisease or a cancer I mean I thinkthat's also why the metaphors work workso well because you know like it's thesick patient where all they're doing istreating symptoms all they're doing isputting more bandages all they're doingis giving more drugs making the pain gogo away all that kind of stuff and whatyou get is a zombie is a vegetable is asomeone who's you know basically just onlife support and that bleeds intoeverything even literal medicine thatwe've seen over the last two years thatgets propagated out in the world whereasthe reverse the actual solution is toheal the act the problem is to get thesystems of the body back into harmonyget them strong again get them into aplace where they can sustain themselvesand growso you know I think the metaphors workall the way up and all the way downbecause it's such a fundamentalDynamic that's at play herewell and this idea of like it being amedical treatment I really like becausewe can see the Advent of Fiat being totreat a disease that you know startedwith essentially JP Morgan needing tobail out the United States governmentand Then followed by a number ofsuccessive crisis crises where like weneeded to have Fiat money in order toscientifically and militarily develop insuch a waybut through that treatment likeessentially we gave ourselves a hugeamount of chemotherapy in order to tryto get through the Great Depression andWorld War one and World War II and bythe end of World War II we found we hadactually killed you know the the bodythat was the state through Fiat money wegot all these crazy technologies thatwere developed but now we were so fardown this path of that not only had thechemotherapy killed our victim and thatwe were keeping them artificially alivethrough a number of medical proceduresbut now carrying that forward thetreatments uh essentially it's likecontinuing to re-up on your heroinaddiction to try to get high and it's uhit's now become so damaging anddetrimental that you know I think if wetalked to somebody in the 1930s aboutthe need for Fiat money and what it wasdoing there there would be moreagreements in hitting and high whereastoday it's just radically no like it'sclearly lying it's clearly not helpfulthere's no need for a state of emergencyto try to save this system whereas atleast in the 1930s we'd go look like wehave to print out money to support theManhattan Project so we can beat theNazis because this is a really largecrisis but then at the end of that wewere like oh [ __ ] we've like destroyedthe entire financing system how are wegoing to address this in a meaningfulway uh and I just think that thathistory is importantto bring this back to Bellagio for asecond you know Bellagio has this veryold framework from like the 2015 era andI don't know how many of you guys werehere then Eric you were for sure uh youknow basically he was saying that youknow uh it's voice versus exit and thatvoice is like you know engaging in thepolitical process and that exit isliterally leaving the system into a newsystem right now the problem with thisframework and I think where Balaji gotit wrong is there's nowhere to exit towe're all trapped we're all trapped andso Bitcoin is actually not exit Bitcoinis actually voice it's the reverse andBitcoin is like Eric described it'schemotherapy for the system it's atransfusion for the system it goesthrough and cleans up the cancer that'sin the system that's what bitcoin'sactually doing every dollar that bouncesaround the world creates a distortionwherever it goes Bitcoins follow thosedollars and clean the distortionswell this has also been my other pointis that uh like everybody you know likebitcoin's apolitical because nobody cancontrol or manipulate or change it andindeed that's what actually makes it themost political thing is because there isno exit anymore there isn't going to bea citadel there isn't going to beBitcoin Nation it's going to be us inour own personal direct politicalstruggles against whatever our ownsystems are whether they're nationstates 20s townsbut it's really about our own insistencesayingFiat money doesn't work it has corruptedeverything it has destroyed our culturesour communities and our families andunless we take the responsibility ofourselves to say no longer will we allowfor this control and power to be givento governments who not only don't have aright to it but have so severely abuseditthat we need to change the Concourse ofhow we understand wealth without usdirectly approaching that question thatwe're just going to keep going throughthe cycles again and again and so I Ithink that's actually something that'sgoing to present itself quite stronglyhere in the next year is the truepolitical aspect of what Bitcoin isI was in Manhattan with a friendrecently and we were talking aboutcitadels and I said look around this isit you know America is the city thoughwell that was exactly you know Balaji Ithink in either in that tweet or in hispresentation you know as part of this uhmillion dollar Bitcoin thing I think healso was like get out of the states nowand I'm thinking like where would yourather be if if shit's gonna go down Imean there's notisn't perfect butthere's places in it that are that arebetter than anywhere else I can identifyin the world unless you're going to golike deep into Patagonia and justcompletely be you know uh off-grid underthe radar all that kind of stuffwell we had a hard hard disagreementabout that because he was like yeah youshould think about getting out and I'mlike no man I've been thinking aboutthis for a long time and like there's areason I'm in the Deep Red Bible BeltChristian South and it's like that isthe place where peopleyou say Taxation and stuff and peoplelike yeah no [ __ ]like and I've got 30 guns at home sayingI've got a big truck and you know likepeople just naturally are disinclined tobuying into that [ __ ] sothat idea of a non-compliant culture Ithink is really valuable but when we saythe states I mean the states obviouslyis a huge placeSan Francisco what are they doing in SanFrancisco I think they're about to payreparations or something like that aswell in a headline yeah I mean like thedifference between San Francisco andTennessee is like is as much of adifference as you can find in the worldalmostby the way you know what's weird rightafter they announced that I found out Iactually have African-American ancestrylike so weird it just the the email hitright after yeahyeah I guess at ancestry.com is on firethese daysis is that is that an actual thing andeven if it were it's it's very like it'snot gonna do that it's it's not going togo through but the fact that they'resitting around debating these basicallyinsane ideasit's crazy it's like sitting I mean dudewe're at the end of an Empire let's faceit how long I go on and like people onTV are talking about like what otherpeople like should people chop off theirdicks should they not Chop off theirdicks should we let the people thatchopped off their dicks compete in womenswimming and I'm like what the [ __ ] ishappening you know what I meanit doesn't make any sense and somehowit's like crept up onto us and it'sbecome a normal part of everyday lifethat we all sit around and talk aboutinane [ __ ] all day long uh and it'sit's a form of nihilism you know but youknow this this is what I was thinkingabout back to the conversation about themonetary system is if and it's just likea simple premise if you don't do yourbest to align with truth or if you don'teven accept the premise that truthexiststhen all you have left over to contendwith is lies deceit delusion all thatkind of stuff so two examples one theone you just gave huddle right like wewere talking about health before and nowlike what does Health mean today wellyou can have someone that's 350 poundsand only eats McDonald's and you knowsomeone will be up there saying that'shealthy you can be healthy that way andthen the the the financial corollarywhich happened recently is you know Idon't know how how broadly it's beenapplied yet but all these Banks rightwith whatever amount of bonds on thebalance sheet and they're way underwaterand then you know with a stroke of a penor policy change the treasury just goesoh no they're not underwater anymore youcan borrow against them at whatever youbought them for like par value rightbecause that's how that's how they'reperforming thisyou know bailout or whatever you want tocall it they're just saying like ohthose bonds that you're 60 percentunderwater on now you're not you'retotally not you can just you can boreout borrow against them like you justbought them at the same price and soit's like if if you're not going tocontend with truth all you have is thatthose lies and you know that's how youget the distortions that's how you getthe the incongruence with with truth andall the different perversions that thatcreates because you either accept truthalign with it to the best of yourability or you lie you delude you erectyou know false structures and I thinkyou know by virtue of well probably formany reasons you know who knows if theFiat system is a cause or an effect ofsome broader cause of that you knowmentality permeating throughcivilization but that's you know that'swhat you get and that's where we seem tobe right now buthey go for it I'm just gonna say Bitcoinis obviously the the remedy to all thatbut we all know that already so you goEricwell so so fiata it's fundamentallyreplacing the truth with anauthoritarian decree it is saying thesethings are fundamentally equal to oneanother and because I am a sovereign youmust eliminate truth and like that isliterally what Fiat money is as they saythis is worth something I have theviolent authority to be able to forcethat upon you and you must accept it andwhen you have that being the Baseline ofthe entire operation of your society andto be clear this isn't just Fiat moneyit is all authoritarian decrees so it'san entire [ __ ] up tax structure thatwe deal with all the regulatory garbageand [ __ ] the complete relegation oflogic itself to be subservient to theseauthoritarian decrees this has [ __ ] upthe world more than anything else and Iam of the opinion it is literally causefor the inability for people to thinkand when I say think I am explicitlyreferring to the ability to apply logicto whatever event is occurringand most people can't do that you knowand that's what the pandemic was allabout it's an authority told mesomething that must be true I will plugthat in place of what my own eyes tellme and to this very day I still seepeople walking around outside with a[ __ ] mask on suffocating themselvesand I want to tear my hair out and Iwant like and I I just want to have areal dialogue with them being like likeis this helping you are are you safer amI safer is the world safer from thisperspective and and because they can'tthink they fundamentally can't get thereand they want to fight you to be likewell you're not listening to theauthorities so you're the bad one andit's like holy [ __ ] you guyshere's where things get Ultracomplicated too Eric because not likethinking is extremely difficult so youmay be able to come to the conclusionthat what you are being told is a lieand then you may reject that right butif you come to the opposite conclusionthat the opposite of the LIE is thetruth that may not also be the caseeither I was thinking about people whohad died during covet like you can thinkabout this on both sides if you were ayou know 65 year old uh obese person whois a conservative and you said I'm notgoing to take that goddamn vaccinebecause the Liberals made it and Goddamn it I'm not doing that and then youended up dead that was your fault andyou had a really hard time thinkingthrough it you were in two separate riskdemos you probably should have taken thevaccine right meanwhile if you were likea young liberal male who was 25 andjacked and fit and then you took sixdifferent boosters and you got amyocardial infarction guess what andthen you end up dying that one's yourfault too and both of these people haderrors in their thinking and thishappens with the Fiat system so yeahit's true that the Fiat system is a lieand and that the people that areperpetuating the Fiat system the theAmerican Elites uh are intent on lyingand gaslighting you all that is true butthe rejection of that system is you knowyou meet a bunch of people who are into[ __ ] coins and they go hey bro you heardabout web 3d5 monkeys and you go oh yeahthat must be obviously fiat's not thething and then you have to come to therational Middle Ground of like 20 000[ __ ] coins are [ __ ] all of the Fiatcurrencies are [ __ ] Bitcoin is theonly thing that's real in the entireworld and that is such a bizarrenon-intuitive conclusion to come to thatlike the collective brain power on thisZoom right now is like 400 IQ and ittook all of us [ __ ] five plus 20 plusCollective years you know five years foryou me to come to this conclusion that'show goddamn difficult it is right soit's not going to be easy for people anda lot of people are going to get harmedin the process unfortunately so that'swhy we've got to save as many as we canthis goes way backstick coining is Fiat as well and to melike this is one of the reasons why Iuse the term crypto sovereignty is thatlikeusing logic to come to the conclusionthat Bitcoin is literally the only thingthat isn't Fiat because it's the onlything that has proof of work baked intoit in such a way that it literallyproves to you through the substance thatit is that it has done the fundamentalwork in order to conclude itself to bepart of the truth that is nature whereas[ __ ] coins there's always something[ __ ] fictionalized about it and so II just find it really interesting andironic that like the literalcryptography that is to be used to provethe work has been done has beencorrupted and extricated in such a waythat now the [ __ ] word itself can'teven refer back to itself in ameaningful way [ __ ] ludicrousyby the way real quick I just realizedwhen I said the collective brain powerwas 400 IQ that makes us all [ __ ] soI'm gonna say like he must be 640 IQ 600IQ as well average roll effortsumso just to like I mean because sometimeswords we're always saying Bitcoin istruth and freedom likeit is sad like these words have beendestroyed basically from the currentFiat Paradigm right you say these wordsand people are like oh this guy isI don't knowum arrogant or like if you say you'retrying to speak the truth or live intruth it sounds like either apost-modernist weird thing likeeveryone's living in their own truth oryou're some kind of have some kind ofMessiah complex right like oh you'vefigured out the truth everyone everyoneelse is speaking a lieum which is one of the reasons I like Ithink Jordan Peterson's chapter right hesayswhat's the rule don't tell the truth orat least don't lie I think is that thetitle of that chapter yeah yeah and soone of the things I think about here isif you just consider a lie as amisrepresentation right it's not anaccurate message about what it'sintended about what it's intended torepresentthat's what printing money is right it'syour when you create new money out ofnothing you're representing to the worldthat there's there are more goods andcapital available than there really areright you're uh tier demisra wrote agood piece on this I think he called theprinting of money something like thecreation of illusory Goods like it justcreates this image of goods and capitalavailable in the world as a nominalexpansion in the money supply thatdoesn't actually existso of course this like propagatesthrough a distorted price signalwhich is like destroying people'seconomic rationality right this is whatcontributes to misallocation of capitalover borrowing mispricing of risk theboom and bus business cycle all of thesethingsbecause we're propagating a false signalthrough the printing of money and you'reyou're quite literally in that situationbecause a price is an exchange ratiobetween two goodsyou're destroying economic rationalityright sothere's it's not surprising to me thatwhen you destroy this Collectivepsychological rationality that we calleconomic rationality that you'recreating feedback into individualrationality individual psychology thatthat illusory the creation of illusoryGoods to the expansion of money isactually [ __ ] people up right it'smaking us dumb and or evil I think justby participating in a motivationalsystem that is Fiatand soI have a question I guess sort of aboutthis to Eric I thinkum there's this quote that politicalpower emanates from the barrel of a gunI think it was Mao or mal said thatclearly that's not the political powerof Bitcoin though because there's nobarrel of a gun back in Bitcoin so whatwas Mao wrong about that or where whatis the source of bitcoin's politicalpowerit it's actually the inversion of thatbarrel of guy like it it negates thebarrel of the gun because now you couldyou can kill somebody but you can't gettheir Bitcoin and that that'sfundamentally different in addition tolike we're like bitcoin's extremelyrudimentary right now you know like itis we literally have the units and wecan pass them around but like we don'thave strong sophisticated dead man Keyscontracts or any of these other moreesoteric ideas and to me like as thisplays out more it will offer a counterto that thesis because also uh Maloriginally said that it's funny that youbrought this up because I looked up thequote like two days ago and noworiginally presented it in the 1928 uhcommon term that they had for China andthen this was emphasized throughout hisphilosophy later on and and so like theythey talk about that quote and about howthe Communist Party always needs to ownthe guns and it needs to push that ontothe whole of society so that likethey're the purveyors they're the onlypurveyors of legitimate violence and andso to me what Bitcoin does is itdelegitimizes all violence through itsdirect form in the world and that VIlike the relationship between violenceand economics is now fundamentallybroken in a way that has never beenaccomplished in all of human history andto me like that's the political thingthat inverts everything that this makesa totally new form of what like what Iwould say is that this reopens the poliswhich is the the fundamental politicalform that ancient Greeks and Romans hadaccess to and that was the that was thelife that was available outside of thehome life to be created by people and tome since the end of World War One thepolis has been completely shut down andforbidden from anyone to access becauseof the forms of statism that we've hadand now that we have Bitcoin there'sthis new form of the political that'srising up that isn't about voting thatisn't about nation states that isn'tabout these forms and organizations thatwe've classically called political so tome like that's that's really what cryptosovereignty is about is that it fulfillsthe idea of cutting off the king's headin a very new and novel way that we hadnever seen beforethrough the ability to hide and keep asecret in the digital sphere in a waythat was never available to all ofhumanity before and will be available toall of humanity moving forward so thisis why I think like essentially we're atwhat I think is the apexal moment of notonly politics technology but essentiallylike this is the transition of humanityfrom being a type zero to a type 1civilization and what that means for usas conscious beings as people with Soulsas human beings that want to create abetter Community together individualsthat want to return to truth like it'sit's very Cali yugic in terms of like uscoming to fulfill all of the destiny ofman so if things begins if you look ifyou look back through historyessentially anybody that ignored therules and then chose violence that's awin that's a win and you get power fordoing that right now that we we haveBitcoin if you ignore the rules and youchoose violence lose that's a lose-loseyou know what I mean and so it I totallyagree with everything Eric said likeit's a that's why it's such a big dealso I have a question I I talked to a guyum that's involved with the libertarianparty here in the United States and Ididn't know anything about this historyI don't know if you guys did butapparently they had a takeover recentlywhere the libertarian party had yeah themises caucus they basically reclaimedthe libertarian partyas I understand it um to be moreconsistent with the traditional valuesof libertarianism whereas over the pastcouple of decadesthe libertarian party had drifted intolike a pseudo you knowleft-wing thing I'm not exactly surethe point is they werethey are interested in integrating moreclosely with the Bitcoin community andactuallytrying tomake more of these grassroot efforts oflike getting people into local officethat are bitcoiners and instead oftrying to just like run a Libertariancandidate for president that you know isgoing to lose because it's either goingto be red or blue and you're gonna havethis other guy get one percent they'relike throwing that whole strategy out ofthe window and really trying to focus onthe Grassroots long-term gameso what I just wanted to hear your guysthoughts on like what is it because Ihate [ __ ] hate politics like I don'tthink there's anything I hate more butwell now that I think about it thatwe're we are thesewe're stepping into our roles in historyright it's we're not just Spectators ofHistory we're now participantsincreasingly we're participants asBitcoin does its thingis it incumbent upon us to take thatyou know nascent influence or power orwhatever we have and try to actually dosomething Grassroots in the U.S if theUS is the Citadel as we're sayingearlierI think like just a piece of practicaladvice if you're part of the libertarianpartyum Rebrand to the Bitcoin party andrepent for all the stupidity over thelast few years and if you think I'm ayoung cocky douchebag yeah I am and wewe subsumed and superseded your entireideology we're the only practical formof libertarianism in the whole [ __ ]world if you can't see that you're toostupid to do anything go [ __ ] yourselfbut also get a problem I'll talk to youin the background okay I'll let you knowyeah I I mean I like the thing that ledme to bitcoin and why I'm still herelike I'm an anarchist through andthrough like [ __ ] the state from top tobottom I absolutely hate this idea of anorganizational form that involveswhining and getting people that Ifrankly think are worthless on board toyour cause simply because they can Marka tallyum I'm very very interested inGrassroots Grassroots movements in termsof getting Bitcoin in the hands ofpeople and uh last time I was on uhMarty's show I had a long dialogue withhim about the only thing I'm interestedin contemporary politics inaccomplishing is passing Article 5legislation to 35 different states inorder to amend the Constitution of theUnited States directly outside andBeyond the purview of both the presidentof the United States or Congressionalapproval and this is a theoretic waythat states can directly ratify theConstitution by circumventing thefederal government that is the onlything I'm interested in is passingArticle 5 legislation that explicitlyputs in the United States Constitutionas an amendment that Bitcoin is thefundamental form of money that theUnited States government will useoutside of that I have zero interestbecauseto me politics is the most nihilisticform of politics that exists because itsays that you as a lone individual areabsolutely worthless and can do nothingwhatsoever to change or modify thesystem and I reject that Holy soI'm somewhat torn on on that issue Imean I I think the libertarian party isis pretty pathetic as well and like froma practical perspective if thatlike it's because so like ideology andphilosophy doesn't seem to have thatrigid of guard rails anymore so why notrun so I'll put it this way why not runin the Republican party and just belibertarian yeah there's a lot of thatthese days I mean like DeSantis is kindof that way and ramaswamy is kind ofthat way like I mean who cares you knownobody cares what you call yourself allthe people only care like the ideas ofyour spouse so everyone knows that likethe third party is never going to get inso why not justyou know play ball in the in one of thetwo and then enact whatever [ __ ]policies you want if you if you get inyou know that seems to be what everyonedoes anyways but I'm somewhat torn onEric's point is likelike I get it like you know the state iscorrupt and irredeemable and you knowdriven by violence and all that kind ofstuffand illegitimate whatever in many waysbut it's still the case that it erects atype of order for the world that weexist Within and it's still the casethat that order has gradations ofquality let's say and so let's bringlet's bring it down to more of like amunicipal or local levelI see Eric smiling but just just thepoint being that is it better and I knowyou're you're giving tacit approval ifyou take this approach and all that jazzso this is a question I don't I don'treally know where I stand on this but isit not better if you have someone whoyou would broadly construe to be moreprincipled more ethical more competentand all that kind of stuff in a positionwithin that system of order thenwhatever the alternative might be andI'm open to hearing your thoughts onlike what the alternative to peoplecoordinating together to establish acertain form of order might beI mean I can answer first but my myanswer is pretty much insane soumyou know but so Carl Schmidt he talksabout something called the cachion whichis a classic idea of that whichwithholds that that which holds backtotal uh like disorder and lawlessnessand that which makes sure that theAntichrist can't present himself to theworld because that then initiates theapocalypse I think the state in its formtoday is the cation and once that thepower of the state is generally removedor the way that I see it it's going tobe superseded by technology that thencreates the opening for the apocalypseto present itself and for the finalstruggle for Humanity to redeem itselfpresents itself which is only offeredthey can fully engage in theirsubjective decision in order to createsomething different so like I prettymuch want to destroy everything to getthe the table totally clean so that thenpeople can make a choice for themselvesabout what they want to do going forwardand so like I essentially that thisphilosophy is deeply accelerationist ofthat like I not only want to destroy thestate but I want to accelerate things tosuch an extent that we arrive at theapocalypse itself so that we can movethrough it and I think that's all comingto fruition which is some of my crazy[ __ ] what's on the other side of theApocalypseuh a kind of peace that we neverimagined humans could even haverevelation of knowledge by the way rightnot end of the world yeah or re orre-revealing or something it's not youknow fire and brimstone like like peopleoften imagine it to be but so Eric putsome meat on that yeah I I think thatthe the possibility of a hyper bitcoin'sworld where everybody truly understandsand rocks what this means and isintegrated into society I think thatthat produces a kind of globalized worldpeace in a way that we have never seenbefore and that we could never evenimagine before becauseany new materials where access to allsorts of new stuff oh sorry of course my[ __ ] shitty internet essentially fora sec yeahyeah exactlyum essentially this opens Humanity up todevelopments that weren't possible whenwar and violence has always been aneconomic incentive that's available thatis off the table now so like when youhave a war going on in a place likeUkraine right now that would absolutelydecimate both sides horrifically becauseof the amount of economic uhI I don't know the right word but likeessentially because they have to take onso much of that economic load themselvesand they can't just do it throughtaxation and Fiatum and I mean and again I get this is acrazy idea no I know but I want to fleshit out a bit because you know maybe it'slegit but I'm assuming you're notproposing that you know some Utopia lieson the other side of the Apocalypsebecause I don't think you're that naiveto suggest something like that so inthis theoretical place or timewhat are the problems that you thinkwould still plagueindividuals or society and how wouldthey be resolved or managedwell human stupidity is Limitless likeall other things and I I think in allhonesty most stuff looks relativelysimilar I think what ends up happeningis that the state has to negotiate withpeople much much more than it everexpected I think that they will actuallyhave to have total fiscal responsibilityin a way that they've never had before Ithink that this will create a new formof civics where people are engaged in avery different way I think thatessentially the entire governmentalstructure inverts itself to wherecommunities become the most powerfulpolitical entities followed by countiesfollowed by States and Then followed bya federal governmentum you know people are gonna do dumb[ __ ] they're gonna lose Keys they'regoing to leverage uh but I think thebiggest one is is that no longer isthere going to be an ability for thereto beviolent Fiat decrees that can have powerover people I think for the most partmost things need to be openly and uh inGoodwill negotiated in a way thatcurrently people just force thingsthrough so a little opaque there but I Ican see that for sure but going back tothis like pure no government premiselike presumably in that place and timeand people will still want to coordinateand people will will still be an elementof trust in the system there'll likelystill be an element of delegating someform of your authority to other peoplein some capacity so I get your pointthat like the state won't be able toenforce it in the way that it currentlydoes but is not that a form of politicsyou know just people getting together tocoordinate in in me in ways that don'tnaturally happen economically andbecause you say like some people arestupid some people are old some peopleare withdrawn whatever there will be adelegation to others family memberstrusted friends institutions whatever toperhaps make decisions for them be aproxy vote in some kind I mean maybe[ __ ] homeowners association orsomething you just say hey I don't givea [ __ ] enough like you you vote for mebro yeah you think that's associatedyeah and I think that's the way it'll gois that instead of us almost having thisuh vertical structure of a singulargovernment it's going to be thisgigantic explosion of there beinghundreds if not thousands of variousrelationships that all sort of Interlinktogether in various ways and this isreally what anarchosyndicalism is isthat essentially people organize ontheir own Accords according to whateverthe organizational needs are whetherthat's uh a water Collective a garbageCollective and and I want to be clearthe organizational getting through tothis place this is insanely messy andit's only through how messy and crazy itall is that people are going to startchoosing the Alternatives so like thethe downslope on this is gonna it goesreal deep sure all right one lastquestion then I'll I'll stop but um inthis placewhere do you think power mostconcentrates right because in this hyperBitcoin ice world power gets disperseddramatically and so you know all thethings that we typically talk about thethe benefits of distribution of powerand authority and that kind of stuff butas far as you've thought about you knowthis potential future where is it thatpower either you know could potentiallyconcentrate and how to what degree wouldthat be deleterious to the circumstanceI think the way it concentrates and andI don't think it would I I think thereare negotiations but essentially like Ithink this returns man to a place ofhonor and dignity and being your wordand that like uh what a man says andessentially his quote proof of work thatis going to be the place that peoplegather power and so that when somebodysays something and follows through withthat when a man proves himself to be aman of his word that people are going toconjugate behind those individuals andthat we're going to see something thatlooks much moreum and this is like a really scary wordso for some peopleclose fascismum and likefascismfascism in the classical sense of theworda Roman dictator who chooses to take acome Accords of the laws for himself youknow what we what what Hitler Mussoliniand uh Franco represented was a reallymalformed uh cult version of thepersonality of that whereas if you lookat the classic Roman fascist who comesfrom the word fashi because they werethe ones that controlled the the axesthat were used to be able to implementlaw they become the individual thatelectrifies it in an accident and Ithink one of the problems is that welive in a world where I can be apolitician do a bunch of super corruptup [ __ ] and people are likethat that political system it's socorrupt no like I'm the piece of [ __ ]like chop my head off and make me anexample to the rest of the people sothat when people go and do [ __ ] upstuff like this there's a great examplefor it and again like I think that's oneof the other class things is us movingaway from capital punishmentparticularly for political crimes Ithink has been a huge detriment tosociety you know like it I would reallylove if when people violated the law ina political way that like you know wedrew and quarter them and we made itclear that like you will be violentlypunished for the ways that you abuse ourpolitical systemto that well I was just concentrationthinking through what you asked and Iwasit seems to me like so maybe one of thefundamental contributions of Bitcoin isthat this notion of power we have todaywhich is a very another one of thosewords right it's just loaded is it arewe talking about political power are wetalking about physical power are wetalking about legal powerEtc Bitcoin sort of simplifies the wholething it's just like it's purchasingpower right who has the purchasing powerkind of decides where they go what rulesets they live by who they interact withEtcso maybe that's one thing is likeBitcoin just sort of simplifies thiswhole notion of political power down tojustmaybe not just purchasing power butmostly purchasing power at least makepurchasing power the most important formofpower as a determinant of socialorganization I think because violence isnotit's not profitable or it's lessprofitable as a result it's the orangerule he who has the Bitcoin makes therules the orange rule exactly beautifuland so if in that world I'm just kind oflikeThinking Out Loud here wouldn't power orat least purchasing power would thenconcentrateinto the hands of the elders and theinnovators basicallynow the elders I'm thinking if we're inthis new world where there's a lot ofinnovation presumably we're extendingthe human lifespan more right we'realreadythere's a lot of efforts toward this endI'm not a transhumanist I don't believein living forever but I do think humanscan keep expanding the human lifespanum so obviously those people that live along time would have a the longest uhperiod through which to accumulate andpreserve purchasing power so they wouldhave a lot of the power in the worldbut then also the innovators right thepeople that are actually deliveringthese productivity enhancing solutionsto the human racewould win a lot of purchasing power inthis kind of entrepreneur-led societysoI I mean I'mthinking I guess out loud that thatpower would accumulate in the hands ofthose two cohorts which seems like agood thing right you've got old wiserich peoplekind of uh living by example for youngerpeople to follow and then you havepeople that are delivering usefulTechnologiesum as also serving as an example foryoung people to follow and I guess wehave some semblance of that today andkind of capitalistic pseudo-capitalisticU.S compared touh societies of yesteryear but rightlike we have the Elon Musk and people ofthe world that are more entrepreneursthey've accumulated power through theirentrepreneurial effortsum but we still have a lot of status tooright like the richest guy in the worldis Putin I thinksoBitcoin just moves us further along thatcurve to where the people that reallyhave the power in the world arethe old and the whys or the or the theInnovative I supposewould be my hypothesisI think the place I always come to whenI when I think about this kind of stuffis that umthe nuclear warheads never go away andthe person that is in control of them isthe state because they can basicallyjust say I'll nuke you I'll nuke me onnuke everybody give me taxes [ __ ] youright that's a problem another problemis Bitcoin can't prevent a sovereignfrom issuing a currencythere's just no way to prevent that andas we've seen over time humans love todo that it's uh you know it's alwaysexpedient gets you out of short-termproblems and the people that put asystem like that in place they don'thave to deal with the consequences everbecause they die right and then theyleave their you know children andgrandchildren to deal with theconsequences so I think we're movinginto a place where the state is going tobe supplanted by the network right I I'min alignment with Bellagio about thatum but I don't think the state's goingto go away entirely or dissolve I thinkit'll be like the Catholic Church youknow like the Catholic church wassupplanted by the nation-state thenation state is supplanted by theBitcoin Networkum but the Catholic church is still hereit's still a force in the world it's notwhat it once was but it had grown to youknow a cancerous scale where it washarming people and I think the modernand you know version of the nation statehas also grown to a cancerous scalewhere it's mainly doing harm to peopleand so once things get like that youknow you basically have a new systemthat emerges and it knocks the oldsystem uh back in its place but it neverfully goes away there's always vestigesof itI I would just say two things one is uhI do think that Bitcoin will actuallydeal with the nuclear warhead issue byas States go totally broke and theystruggle desperately to find money theywill have to they will have to convertthey'll have to convert their nuclearwarheads into becoming nuclear reactorswhich I was reading a pretty significantamount of nuclear warhead material canbe used to create a nuclear reactor so Ithink they'll go in that direction and Iagree that the state won't go away Ithink Federal governments are going todwindle precipitously in power and Ithink that we're going to get uha renewal of sort of the American dreamVisa these states like I think statesare going to assert themselves againstthe federal government in the comingcrisis I think the federal government isgoing to lose and I think that in thatstates are going to become quite Dynamicand Innovative and in addition to thatwe're going to get places like Texasthat are just going to straight up makeBitcoin into a currency for their stateyou know and I think that that's goingto have a very positive General affectthe nuclear warheads thing this isalways one that that I was like man [ __ ]how does that problem get solved butright I think the incentive to mineBitcoin is actually a pretty decent liketheory about how that problem getssolved like people are going to be likelet's convert this [ __ ] and you knowwith with the Advent of small nuclearreactors and stuff like let's convertthis this material to my Bitcoin that'swhere our primary incentive is and youknow does the stockpile get dwindleddown as a result of those incentives isit just another instance of theincentives that are emerging around thisradical form of inter-subjective Truthis able to dissolve the manifestationsof intersubjective distortion and powerand lies and delusion and all the stuffwe've been talking aboutjust carrying an inventory of nuclearwarheads that's a huge expense just tomaintain that inventory but if theredoes I didn't know that this is firstI've heard of this but if there's a waythen to instead convert that inventorywhich is costing you money into moneythat seems like a path some people wouldfollow go aheadoh no I was just gonna say I so I agreewith Eric too in the in the sense thatyou know back to bitcoin being like ayou know a cleaning infection of thecurrent system or like chemotherapy forthe current system I think Bitcoin youknow uh restarts the engine that isAmerica and if we go back to our earlyAmerican history all the way back to1776 America is an experiment indecentralization always has been alwaysshould be and somewhere along the last300 years we lost thatum and you know it would be amazing ifBitcoin could help us get back to thatand I do think you saw like a little bitof that during the pandemic wheredifferent states were saying no we'renot going to comply with that and youknow Texas is now enshrining the rightto use uh digital currency in into theirconstitution or not their constitutionbut you know they're they're uh puttingit into law and so I do think it's goingto be really interesting if you have uhStates pushing back against the federalgovernment and it depends on which stateyou're in right if California wants tosecede you'd be like sit down [ __ ]you're not going anywhere if Texas wantsto succeed you'd be like Texas let'stalk about this man don't do anythingcrazy bro okay well Texas is also thethe only state that explicitly has it intheir constitution that they have aright just a session and that that wasnever fully brought up as a predicationthat happened in the Civil War and theanswer is not all worship went wrong wasthe Civil War and just how the Civil Warplayed out on a number of levels becausewith the legal ramifications and alsothat was the first time that the UnitedStates explicitly issued a fiat currencyfor the purpose of Waryeah absolutelycan you go on a bit more on that Ericwas that 1813 what was wasn't theresomething that happened in 18 years thatprecipitated that that was the collapseof the the First Bank of the UnitedStates with it which Andrew Jackson Ithink it was 1914 maybeum but heno I'm sorry Andrew Jackson came laterwith the collapse of the Second Bank ofthe United States the First Bank in theUnited States was a problem and thatcollapsed in 1812 and they renewed it in1814 I think under Monroe who then uh itcame up for Renewal under Jackson herefused to do it and then moving forwardwe had the wild bat the Wildcat bankingera that lasted all the way until 1862where essentially the union wasstruggling in their Conquest against theConfederacy and this is when Lincolnmade the decision that they were goingto issue greenbacks which is where theterm comes from and greenbacks were aFiat con they were they were a Fiatmoney that was explicitly issued toraise money for the Civil War so thatthey could fight them because the CivilWar is super interesting becauseessentially like the union just like[ __ ] up repeatedly over and over andthen I had like Generals in power wholike totally sucked ass at what they didyou have a chance to look at GeneralMcClellan he's like he's mcclellan'slike the the biggest [ __ ] whoeverexisted to ever command an army likethere's a great quote where wheremcclellan's like looking at a riverbeing like Oh like we like can't crossthis this is too bad and custardliterally rides his horse out into themiddle of the river he goes McClellanit's this deep we can totally go over ithe's likeoh it's right hereLincoln kept sending McClellan ladderslike would you fight you goddamn [ __ ]and he's just like not today I was Iwoke up feeling weird man and it's TheVibes are off dude I can't you know yeahGrant's just like let's get [ __ ]drunk and do this yeah exactly they werereplaced him with an alcoholic for thatvery reasonto Grant though he didn't drink when hewas fighting he just drank afterwards todeal with his PTSD so I don't want tomake it sound like he was a bad Soldierhe was just [ __ ] up as a human fromwhat he did John John may not know thisin uh as a Canadian but you know in theSouth people still refer some peoplestill refer to the Civil War as the warof Northern aggression because the Southseceded basically and we're like we'reour own goddamn Nation we're gonna dowhatever the hell we please and thenorth was like the hell you are and thatcaused the Civil War and so you know ifif we do start to see the states pushback very strongly against the federalgovernment it's very likely there willbe another uh Civil War although I don'tI don't know how a civil war looks inthe digital age I think that's a reallyinteresting questionum I had an episode I had a series ofDominic frisbee about this he wrote thatbook daylight robbery which is aboutlike the history of Taxation it's asuper interesting bookthere's one episode with civil war inthe title but he describes how it was awar fought over taxation like basicallythe South wasI hope I have the numbers right we wereone-third of the population but we'repaying four-fifths of the taxessomething like that like we were payinga disproportionate share of the tax basefor the the collective Union the Northand South together and so the South waslike you know tried to secede peacefullyand finally just said [ __ ] you likewe're out and essentially it was Lincolngoing to war to reclaim the tax baseum which is which is such a weirdepisode to go through with Dominicbecause I'm reflecting on all of myindoctrination in public school aboutthe Civil War as he's telling me thisand it's like no we were told it wasthis moral Crusade against slaveryit's like no it had [ __ ] absolutelynothing to do with that it was just abusiness deal basically rightyou're saying wasn't it well as I saidat some point in the war like if I couldend this war without freeing the slavesI would do so there's some point likethat attributed to Lincoln I believeI've heard that yeah well it's reallyinteresting because like this is one ofthe reasons that becauseso like Lincoln essentially committedtreason in the way that he started theCivil War and the reason why he neededto be so forceful with passing the 14thamendment was because that thenessentially recused him from thattreason because now he could point andsay look it's an amendment they wereviolating the Constitution I as thepresident had a right to assert theConstitution over the southern statesfor this reason but that's only when hecame to the realization as a lawyer thatlike he had fundamentally committed atree then and if he ended the Civil Warwithout that there he could be put ontrial for treason as well you know andso not to say that slavery wasn't acomponent of it because like that'sdefinitely one of the reasons whyNortherners were more aggressive towardsasserting that but like that you know inthe same way that like uh like thepandemic and all the responses wereabout like saving her health yeah thatwas like 38th on the list but it wasabout like all this [ __ ] money onnumbers 1 through 38 that was the realreason why so it's it's kind of like Ifeel real good now that we can be likewe loved all the black people and we'dliberated them but let's never have anydialogue in public school at all aboutall the [ __ ] white Irish slaves thatwere in the United Statesit's it's like how Putin's Putin'sjustification for invading Ukraine islike we're deoxifying Ukraine it's likeyeah sure sure the [ __ ] you are that hasnothing to do with why you're over thereyeah but it's also on the other sideit's like Putin's only invading Ukrainebecause he's evil that's why and that'swhy you should be again are you an evilperson no you're good aren't you so youshould be against it I mean theeverything is so uh watered down orobfuscated or like black ostensibly orframed to be black and white when it youknow almost nothing is I mean why wouldwe ever even suspect that we would knowthe motivations of most things thathappen in the world think about whenanything you've ever done in terms oflike a business project or a workproject whatever like you you talk itout not that you're intentionally beingsecret but you talk it out in the BoardRoom with your partners whatever andthen you go and execute in the world andit's not like everyone knows all of yourmotivations and it's just it's so absurdto think that we well I mean again thisis the the part of the critique thatwe've been living against the currentworld as it is is that everything is sodumbed down so simplified and one justis so trusting from about listening tothose authority figures you know one ofthe things just on the the Civil WarFront that I found fascinating I watchedthat Ken Burns uh documentary like 10part series whatever really great reallysuper good yeah well I mean it's onAmerican history or something it'sreally just it's just called it's justcalled the Civil War by Ken Burns verygood oh now I've seen him on umCNN and stuff lately and you know he'sgetting on with some uh perspectiveslet's say that I'm not I don't fullyagree with but the work itself I thoughtwas phenomenal and one of the thingsthat struck me there because I I didn'treally know much about the Civil Warprior to that film but you know thesedays you know the turn down uh Robert ELee statues like all over the [ __ ]place right because oh racist bad guywhatever I was just struck by how badasshe was like he it's he he was anincredible leader and like a very youknow ethical and and he didn't enter thewar because he like wantedum you know wanted on the side ofslavery let's say he was from Virginiaand his primary loyalty was to Virginiaand he was like well Virginia is part ofthe South and you know so I'm going toprotect my my homeland I'm gonna protectwhere I'm from and my people and myfamily and stuff so okay I guess I'm onthis side of things and I and he wasjust he was such an honorable characterand to see him now like the theinversion of that presumably if I'm ifmy assessment is correct wherebyeveryone's just you know treating him asa Hitler type character and erasing himfrom historyum it's just ridiculous and it alsospeaks to this thing that we do when wecharacter assassinate people isif anyone has any flaw that's currentlyin the crosshairs of a culture or acountry or whatevernowadays you want to just eradicate themyou want to get rid of them instead ofsaying like one recognizing nobody's[ __ ] perfect nobody so start fromthat premise and what follows from thatis okay some people are gonna everyone'sgonna have good characteristicsadmirable characteristics ones that youmight want to mimic in some way or oryou know adopt and ones that you want toignore dismiss what have you and shouldwe not assess things in that way andthen look at how they were able toembody the good characteristics thatthey did and learn from those you don'thave to adopt all the the bad ones youcan recognize them even and and analyzewhy you know how come they didn'testablish a better balance but we havethis you know this culture where it'slike if something finds itself in thecrosshairs of the existing narrativeyou're banished immediately and againthe last two years of covert there's abillion examples ofof how that's that's taken place and I Ilook forward to a period in educationand all that kind of stuff where we canbe more Discerning with how we analyzethe characters of History not justglorify the military leaders and notjust dismiss like the the baddies and wejust we look at character traits and andactions they took and we really try tounderstand and analyze them so that wecan better adopt or embody them in ourown lives and recognize when we're notrecognize when we're veering too muchinto the to the realm of those behaviorsthat we would be critical of you knowand and just be more conscious of it allgenerally but uh yeah Robert E Lee was ayou know kind of made me crystallizethat point in my mind when I watchedthat documentary because he seemed likea pretty badass dude I mean on on yourpoint about rejecting you know likeheretical characters like that that'ssomething that's like led me in myresearch that's been really powerfulbecause like but like Schmidt I thinkshould have straight up been hung it inthe Nuremberg trials and like hit andHeidegger was obviously a shitty personand the hilarious thing is about theirphilosophies getting integrated intoNazism there's no philosophies haveabsolutely nothing to do with nothing ofthem they were both just [ __ ]opportunists and that was the right timeand they were both burned horrificallyby their [ __ ] opportunism you knowSchmidt like Goring literally went afterSchmidt and made sure that he couldn'thave any more advancements in hiscareers and same thing with Heidegger hewent and presented his philosophy asbeing part of Nazism when it wasanything but and later they both had totry to recuse themselves from it theycouldn't do it and because of the waythat they had quote sullied themselvesthey created the opening forpost-modernism and philosophy which isjust led us off into a [ __ ] insaneDirection which I want to be clear likethere is some value to it but most ofit's [ __ ] gobbley gluke that that Idon't find valuable at all and it's justit's really offensive to me that youknow in the same reason like I've I'veread Lenin I've read Mao I've readHitler they all uh Hitler actuallydoesn't have anything interesting to sayit's like a pretty rudimentary and dumb[ __ ] philosophy but both Lennon andMao have reallyvaluable things to say from theperspective of what a sociopath who'spursuing power wants you know and likelike it's really interesting forphilosophies he's pretty much like yo ifyou want to be a communist like getcomfortable with killing people likeyou're gonna have to kill a lot ofpeople and if you're not interested inthat don't read this book it's not foryouyou know and it's really incredible tosee that thatpeople don't understand how dangerousthat that ideology is because theyreject reading any of it as opposed topulling out the Salient points that canallow for them to critique it in such away that that make it a valuablecritique so yeahI I dug into the effectivedoes it seemed like there was a crisisof confidence happening in in the EAmovement right like oh man we let thisguy in our inner ranks and he was a badguy blah blah blah you dig a LittleDeeper one layer below the surface theonly problem they have with Sam is thathe got caught literally none of themhave a problem with any of his behaviorthe thinkers over there in EA they don'thave a single problem with it they likethis kind of behavior you know what Imean by the mean stuff right yeah I meanthat's that's what characterizes so muchof this if if you believe stronglyenough in the ends that they're validvirtuousrighteous whatever then so many peoplejustify any means to achieve those endsI mean again that's on display [ __ ]everywhere in our world todayby the way the correct thing to do do iswhat Nietzsche did which was just sitout Nazism just go go to the country andpretend like it's not happeningI was just reminded I brought this quoteup yesterday on this thing thatum and you just quote that everythingthe state has is stolen everything itsays is a lieI mean that just captures it sonicely my estimation like all of thesewe were talking about the Civil War likewhat we learn or what I learned about itin school in public school in thesouthern us was there's this moralit was a moral camouflage in retrospectright it's like oh we were this thenorth was crusading against the South toredeem these enslaved people it was amoral Crusade butwhen you start looking at all of thosenarratives with the benefit of uh Iguess the elucidation that occurs goingon the Bitcoin Rabbit Hole you start tosee that it's all just these differentmoral camouflages that are being put onto justify the lies and the theft of thestateandum that's kind of a bitter pill toswallow but I get and maybe this iswhereI haven't read post-modernismI've read a little bit of uh lacan Ithink is his name which I'm not surehe's considered a post-modernist or notand I've read some nichebut it it does seem to me like thelowest common denominator motivation forpeople is like wealth property powerright where at the end of the day we'rewe're animals trying to accumulateterritoryand umyeah I just think that sort of that isclarifying I don't want to say thatyou know again Jordan Peterson gets offon this I was saying that thepostmodernist view of the world is thatall of our social institutions ourpremise on Power and he thinks that'swrong right there's this other higherpursuit of human cooperation the logosEtcand I agree with that but I think thatagain it's maybe the confusion is rootedin that word power when when I invokethat word I see it asthere's a political sense to the wordand there's a physical sense to the wordand the physical sense is well we'removingmore watts per unit time or Watts rightenergy per unit timewhereas the political sense is more likeAuthority who gets to tell who what todoand soagain having not read a lot of thepost-modernists it does seem that thatis approximately correct to me that ifyou consider power and it's in anon-ambivalent way both the physics andthe political sense of that does seem tobe the primary motivation of humanbeings we're either trying to get morewealthy satisfy our wants get moreproperty or or perhaps trying toestablish ourselves at a higher peckingorder in the hierarchy which issomething more like political powerum that that's clarifying right it cutsthrough a lot of the ideological[ __ ] and you don't need to buy ityou don't need to subscribe to oneideology versus the other if you justlook at us as a bunch ofanimals playing imaginary with oneanother trying to gain more territoryso well that's the that's the transitionas you know like we Aristotle said youknow man is the animal with politics orman is that the animal with language andso it's pretty clear to me that likewe'rewe're in this transitory phase wherewe're we're leaving that animality ofourselves and trying to become somethingelse but we're still in between and sowe're still dealing with all thisviolence all this inability to bridgethe gap between what we say and do andthatit is in the pursuit of these things andthese questions that it literally startsto transform us you know like I think Ithink before we came into Bitcoin therewere all these questions but it's onlythrough the ruminating and chewing on itthat like it's brought us deeper anddeeper and through bringing us deeperit's starting to affect and change us aswell because when we reflect on allthese things we start to realize thatlike they're they're not these thiledoff things that don't have anyconnections to each other that they'reactually real and that part of theseforms of power is truly knowledge itselfand understanding how that knowledgegives us power directly and how we usethe knowledgethat is power to directly influence theworld itself and that's something that'spretty different from the classicalworld is that even if you had thatknowledge there were still fundamentallimitations around all the differentthings that one could do with it whereasnow we have a lot more potentiality Iwonder so uh this episode that I didwith Jeff Booth in Jackson Hole come outthis week I think Monday or Tuesday it'sprobably one of the my favorite thatI've ever recordedand he went into the dangers ofexclusionary language I don't thinkthat's exactly how he termed it but youknow he's always talking about the USversus them Paradigm it's very easy toslip into that right like we're doing itright now rightoh people in the market is good thestate is bad it's like well really thestate is comprised of people and so isthe market and it's not that black orwhite even though our language may makeit seem that way so I wonder if we areI wonder how much of that reality I meanI think his this General argument isthat you're kind of energizing thatreality when you speak about it in thoseterms yeah so when you say like ohthere's good guys bad guys or whateverthe US versus them dichotomy is you'reactuallyyou're actually creating you're givingyou're breathing life into it just byspeaking about it that way whereas thereality is no we're all interactingthere's a continuumuh between us you know although the theindividual isreal in a sense right we have a physicalbounded reality we're also influenced bywho we're around we're a product of ourenvironment et cetera et ceteraso I again I get trapped in this likefeedback loop or you're not sure if isit because we're talking about it it'smaking it so or because it is so is theway we're talking about it or is it bothum I I have a slightly but if we'regonna transcend sorry just the point ofthat is like no all good rough questionlike do we need to get past exclusionarylanguage towards something that's moreanother loaded word love based rightmore encompassingum because it does seem to be a littlebit self-defeating when we're constantlytrying to label one group bad one groupgoodum the the dichotomy is unresolvedthat's what I'm trying to sayumthat sounds like a gay space communismto me and I reject it okayso no I I was slightly different uh RobI was gonna say I was a slightlydifferent perspective on that I thinksometimes you hear this they term likethey they're doing things they're doingthis they're doing that and I I actuallythink people are kind of afraid to speakout at the moment which is why they'rebroadening it to just they because Ithink that things are so asymmetric andso corrupt currently that if you were toname someone powerful and they'respecific wrongdoings I think it'sactually dangerous for your life in manycases so I think it's sort of a it's adiffusion there where people just speakabout it broadly but I do take yourpoint that it is it's kind of otheringand probably it is you know exclusionaryI agree with that except that thediffusion is perhaps also a product ofthe reality because if I have to drawthe line between US versus them it'slike the people paying the taxesand the people so the taxpayers and thenthe tax consumers the people living offof the taxes paid now that line isShifting all the time right like I don'tknow how many taxes did you pay lastyear maybe you took a loss this year andyou're consuming like it's all over theplacesoI agree with what you're saying exceptwell the caveat that maybe it isactually complicated and that's whywe're speaking in diffuse languagebecause it's who who are the taxconsumers in the world right now I haveno [ __ ] idea I mean I have a generalidea if you're a politician inWashington DC you're probably not doinganything productiveso you're probably a tax consumerif you're a you know Blue Collar plumberworking for a living you're probably ataxpayer because you're producingsomething of value and you're not inpolitical office but obviously thegradations between that are significantsoI I gotta say I'm uh I'm excited for youto read I think it's chapter seven in mybook Rob called The Sovereign subject incrypto power because it it essentiallydeals with this schmittian idea of whothe identity of the enemy is and anytimethat like the state has someone that Ican label as enemy it can utilize thestate of emergency to put them outsideof the law to then be able toessentiallyadjudicate on its own Accords how itwants to do with that Enemy of the Stateand that and like that essentially isthe production of genocide and what wehave seen continually throughout the20th century is make an enemy label themuse that to put them outside of the lawdestroy them and so now with Bitcoin andspecifically with you know what I callcrypto sovereignty is the ability toliterally abscond from that abilitythrough shielding your identity from thestate and the amount of wealth that youmay have from them and there's all theseother tertiary tactics that are going tocome along with it and the ability toutilize cryptography to do that and themain function that this has is to be ablindinglike the essentially it's the first moveto be blinding towards identity becausethe problem is is that if we can everlabel people as enemies that we cansteal from there's always thepotentiality that we can become thatpersonand so in the essay I point out thatlikethe Jew by their very nature andexistence created a state of emergencyfor the Nazibecause that was an other that theycould not allow to exist because the waythat it challenged the framework of whatNazism was and so I think that that'sreally really important because any timethat you have a sovereign power that canlabel individuals and call them good badenemy whatever that then creates apredication for there to be a secondaryclass of law that they can apply topeople and so to me that's literallywhat the entire tax structure looks likeis saying these people are subjects theybelong to this particular nation stateand they can do whatever the [ __ ] theywant to them and I think that we'reessentially challenging that and makingit so that that will no longer existinto the future and frankly that likeposterity will look back and be likelike it's [ __ ] crazy did you knowlike if the United States owned you inthe 20th century you just had to paythem whatever they commanded or elsethey threw you in jail Wildyeah I amI agree with the sentiment that Robshared and Jeff has mentioned it to me anumber of times andI mean I think we all in the chaos ofthe news cycle we get caught up inthe framing that it imposes on us and wealso get caught up in the framing thatwe impose on itbut I on a more fundamental level like II first of all I agree but I also just Isee all of the manifestations ofdifferent behaviors and personalitiesand stuff outside myself as justpotential ways I could be seeing andlike seeing things and acting you knowlike of course it's potential ways thatI could you know ideas that I could beembodying to the same degree that thosepeople are and therefore acting inaccord with that and soyou know what you know perhaps myrhetoric sometimes uh betrays this but Idon't really see it in that likedichotomous way like I don't see reallyanyone as irredeemable or nor do Iascribelike absolute power to anyone or anyinstitution because at the end like younobody can give that up but yourself ina sense I mean even if you're this isthe umuh who was the guy in the the Nazi campswho wrote the book uh Victor Frankelright this is kind of his point it'slike you can be in the jail cell andpeople still not be able to take yourfreedom from you like your freedom toresolve your ownyou to find your own inner peace in asense to accept your circumstances andfind Freedom within that whatever thematerialreality of your circumstance may be andum you know so one I I agree that likethis is all just and perhaps Icharacterize it in more concrete ways sothat I can play out those narratives inmy mind to see what I think about themto seehow I should construct my perspectivewithin them and I guess sometimes indialogue you know that gets externalizedand it can seem that it's enough versusthem sort of dynamic but I I don'treally uhsee it that wayumso yeah I mean I I agree with thesentiment and uhyeah well I mean like how how beautifulit is that like literally Bitcoin in itsexistence like it can't do on US versusthem like it literally right isincapable of having that happen and tome like that's one of the most importantthings is it it blinds that identityfunction so now we have to recognize andrespect the other who we can neveractually know as being a being thatdeserves an is entitled to all of thesame affects and rules of law that applyto me as wellyou know it's like umall of our systems Eric like up to thispoint have had just like have had torely on humans and they've had to belike let's just get the best humans inthere well let's have one human who'sthe best no let's have uh 500 humansthat are the best uh you know what Imean and let's have a full democracy anentire Society full of humans makingdecisions no because humans have biasBitcoin doesn't even know humans existhas no idea you know what I mean andthat's why there's no human bias in thesystem that's why the system worksthat's why the system is a perfectmachine right and so it's it's very likeI I I talk to people who still don'tunderstand this and they think that I'mlying to them and they think thatthere's coded human bias and that I'myou know we're just um obfuscating likethe amount of human biases in the systemwell don't the devs control no theydon't and it's hard to get people tothink like a computer network would saybasicallythe the last thing you know what I wasgonna put on the end of of that wasumeven though like that's my I feel likethat's my more fundamental orientationin the in the last year I guess perhapsI've I guess I've been more I tried tobe more conscious about to what degree Iwas feeding into that thing that Robdescribed and you know so let's justtake an easy example like someone says something stupid on Twitter andyou slide in to [ __ ] own it in someway you know dunk on them whatever itmight be and it's just like what is thatserving is that serving anything at allis that a is that a worthy use of mytime is that uh an adversary that's evenum you know like is that a worthyadversary for me what like what good isthat doing whatsoever uh versus you knowif you focus onthe things that are actually actuallygenerative or productive towards whatyou deem to be most important you knowso one of those things might just beBeauty right like instead of beingdivisive or inflammatory or you know uhcombativewhy not like what if you just took allthat time and energy that you would dothose things on and just just every timetried to focus on something beautifuland propagate that to the extent thatyou you know propagate anything out intothe The Ether social media or whateverand so you know I think that's justthat's a more conscious strategy orapproach that's born out of therecognition that that is true like themore that you other people the more thatyou divide the more that you separatethings in US versus them the more youare you know even if in other areasyou're you're helping in some way youare perpetuating this sort of thisdichotomy rather than operating on theassumption that no eat like eachindividual can transcend the behaviorsthat are not serving them and notserving others and they can start toturn that around and they can do thingsthat are more in line with truth andthey can engage in more beautiful thingsand they can you know they can Orientthemselves toward the good better let'ssay and everyone has that capacity andshould we not do that for ourselves andbe a force that allows or thatthat inspires or assists others in doingthe same and it would that not generatethe out a better outcome anyways is thatnot the outcome whatever outcome thatleads to is it would that not be betterthan a victory over our supposedyou know ideological adversaries let'ssayI I had a friend I want to pose aquestion to your question which is I hada friend uhpose this really interesting thoughtexperiment to me and he told me that doyou know that the amount of people inthe population who have above 125 IQsand the amount of peoplewho are financially free and are thesame and I was like that's interestingand he was he was talking to mebasically like you it may be the fat itmay be a function of intelligence thatyou simply can't have personalresponsibility without a sufficient IQand so maybe there's some leveling upthat Humanity needs to go through wherelike we get everybody you know becauseIQ changes over time collectively and somaybe it's like there's a leveling inhumanity where we need to go up a coupleorders of magnitude uh so that we canget everybody to a place where they canactually be the type of person that Johnwas was talking about because I don'tknow if I don't know if people are likecapable of it currentlyI think they're capable of an aspect ofit right they might they might not beable to like you knowbe thetheir fullest expression of all thosethings but you know can they not startwalking in that direction can they nottilt more that way and I mean this iskind of one of the promises of you knowhyper bitcoinized world right in thatthethe price signal and the culturalsignals that we'll be propagating atthat time will be more conducive tonudging people in a direction towardmore what I think we'd all agree arelikebetter values and principles you know sothat much of which won't even beconscious as the reverse of that is notconscious to a lot of people today theso-called Fiat culture all those signalsthat are getting sent to them and thebehaviors that are being inculcated as aresult of the culture I mean that's notconscious right people just say hey I'mwho I am and I decide who I am it's likedo you I mean a portion you do you youcan decide on consciously on certainbehaviors but the motivations for thosebehaviors and the beliefs on whichthey're predicated a lot of that isinculcated by the culture by your by theincentives that are presented to you inthat culture so when they changethose things are going to change as welland yeah again like they may not bethey might have the IQ to really take itby the reins and like Drive hard in thatparticular direction but they they'recapable of responding toa better set of values and principleslet's say broadly speaking and so youknow there's an element of hope to bederived from thatI mean to me it's not about the thefunction of IQ as much as it's thefunction of the true core belief intruth itself as having a substantialexistence and to me like that's what'sso beautiful about Bitcoin versus Fiatworld is itelectrically charges people in such away that they have to acknowledge thatthe truth is a real and meaningful thingin this world and through that that likejump starts thinking again where theycan go oh wait a minute like Fiat worldis this gigantic lie and that's whyeverything's so [ __ ] up and that if Ireapproach the world in a way where Iunderstand that there is a capital Ttruth in that I can meet other peoplewith the fusion of Horizons and seeingthat like I can actually changesomething in the world in a meaningfulway and then this turns on itself in ina really beautiful way that they go wellokay if truth is so valuable in theeconomic sphere where Bitcoin with afixed Supply is becoming this valuablejust by its naturewhat does that truth do elsewhere in theworld what does it do to me what is itwhat does it do to my family what doesit do to societyand I think that that's a that's areally really important core functionthat sort of electrifies and jump startsthis ability to to frankly change in ameaningful way and not just sink intothe you know uhmoat or the swamp of FiatI go back to that quote uh at thebeginning of the big short that says thetruth is like poetry and most people[ __ ] hate poetry you know it's likemost people most people are not out hereseeking the truth you knowso true uh well I feel like maybe I'mtrying I'muh John if you want to say something atthat point I think I've got a tangentmaybe okay well I'll just comment onething Ithe truth in so far as it's like youknow the capital T truth is kind of likehoity-toity privileged thing to beaspiring to because you you know themundane aspects of Life are sufficientlytaken care of that you have that youknow opportunity or privilege like yes Ithinkmaybe that kind of Truth people uh don'tlike looking atbut I think truth construed as simplythe information that allows you tobecome United with what you mostfundamentally valueI think that's just howConsciousness almost works and soeveryone in that context call it apragmatic truth but I think it's apragmatic truth because it's sofundamentally truepeople everyone wants truth in thatregard they want the information themeans to move closer toward the thingsthat they value most now obviously youknow perhaps a lot of people don't don'tsee it or construe it in that way but Ithink that's a a manner in which thatwould maybe contradict how to what yousaid becauseI think that that is the type of truththat everyone seeks now maybe the aim wecould discuss whether it's a legitimateaim and whether that aim is in accordwith a broader capital T truth but justa function of Truth generally thatpeople there's a magnetism of it becauseit's I think almost tautologically ordefinitionally it's it's what yourequire to move toward what is mostvaluable or even Unite with what is mostvaluablepeople don't want to visitorsright I I I think there's this veryhuman thing of wanting to avoid painwhich is why most people uh tend toreject the truth because the truth isoften painful and so you basically say Iif I accept this in this hurts and Idon't want to feel that so what I'mgoing to do is I'm going to tell myselfit's not happening and then you go intodenial and you know how many people dowe know that use denial as a copingmechanism it's it's almost everybody youknow and and so you know I like while II think that everybody here is a Seekereverybody's very intelligent like youguys are we're all very aligned on truthI mean truth is like that's the NorthStar for me that's that's the modusoperandi in my entire life I just don'tthink that uh Bitcoin is going toprovide that sort of seeking to everyoneI wish it would it'd be great if it didI hope to be wrong I just don't say itbut is it one of those cases back tothat point about the cultural signalsand the price signal that in a hyperworldeven if you don't have that you knowstrong impetus or motivation to be oneof those hardcore true Seekers It'sorienting You toward it regardlesssubconsciously in in that that's justthe direction that the signals arepointing you kind ofdo you know what I'm do you know what Imean I I think I think it it go aheadI was just gonna say I think it I thinkit helps execute the misalignment thatFiat explicitly createsum and I yesI think what zoneimportant about what it does is that itit marries the truth and value back intoeach other in a way that currently isn'tpossible in Fiat and so it it does makethe incentive alignment towards truthbetter because now in a hyperbitcoinized world I look atsay doing an olive Orchard which olivestake like 12 years to get the term andthen 15 years to start producing andthen you know it can produce for liketwo thousand years after that well likeif I if I have like a long-termperspective that like I want this to bean olive Orchard that exists for 300years there's no financing mechanismthat aligns with that in any meaningfulway whatsoeverhowever you know if we're now in aBitcoin standard there becomes thepossibility of derivatives and thingsthat look like that whereas in Fiatworld like we it's literally impossibleto have a timeline perspective onanything Financial that is past 30 yearsand I'm constantly amazed at that likeliterally the only financial instrumentsthat we have that extend out into thefuture are these strange time periodswhether it's 20 years 10 years 15 yearsfive years well what if you want onethat's seven years two months and 22hours for whatever [ __ ] reason youhave you know like there there's allthis space and ability to be able tofinancialize things in a different waythat once we're away from Fiat it allowsfor a much more congruent perspective soI I digress on that moment justessentially like I I think theelimination of Fiat through thepresentation of Truth having real valuebecause it's a solid thing thatcontinually exists forever and it is notSuperfluous or fleeting or subject to astate of emergencythat's the thing that has real value andthat's the thing when we speak to itsomebody 200 years from now can nodtheir head and be like yeah I'm inalignment with that their truth is mytruth too even though I have all thisother insane technology and I live in aspaceship and yeahI can agree to that for sure I want toask another question about truth but Ifeel like it's a bit of a can of worm soRob if you've got uh something you youwant to go let's stay on truth because Ihave a just a uh something else okaylet's stay on truth though I would justI can throw something in on Truth realquickumwhen we say something is an illusion ora deceptionuh I forget where I heard this but thatimplies the existence of truth right youcan't say something as deceiving orillusory without implying the existenceof something that is true right becausehow could you distinguish an illusion iftruth did not exist so for all of thistalk about truth and we're always likewell is it capital T truth like thenature of Ultimate Reality we're talkingabout or is it pragmatic truth trueenough to be useful and we always kindof get lost in the the gradations maybebetween the twoI think what people really want maybethis is what you were pretty much sayingJohn is that people just don't want tobe deceived right they don't want to bedeceived by others they won't they don'twant to be deceived by themselves rightif I think eating [ __ ] pepperonipizza is going to get me jacked well mygoal is to get Jack eating pepperonipizza is not a good means to that end ifI think that is then I'm self-deceivingI would want to know that presumably soI could actually get jacked rightwhatever the thing is so it's more likecleansing or I don't know gettinganything that makes the errors persistout of the system or getting a systemthat error corrects more effectively Idon't know that we ever get somethingthat generates truth but at leastdiscovers these pragmatic truths whichis to just saywe're clearing errors out and that's Ithink that's what we're talking about inthe marketplace right the free market iseffectively clearing these errorsthere's a bunch of people that wantstuff there's a limited supply of stuffhow do we reconcile the twowell we've kind ofstumble forward but um the quicker wecan clear those errors the more quicklywe can Rectify it so I just I was justmaybe trying to present an alternativeway to look at it istrying to not be deceived or not liveversus trying to always wrestle with ascapital teachers or a pragmatic truthyeah well let's yeah I mean let's lookat that in in the context of what hodlsaid so let's take someone whowe're probably all examples of this atsome point in our lifewho didn't want to analyze something youknow wanted to ignore the truth rejectit hide something in the fog you knowwhatever language you want to useso you is there is that a is that aninstance of wanting deception you knowis that an instance of wanting you knowignorance is bliss is that an instanceof not wanting the informationthat would align you withtruth becauseyou don't want to face it for somereason I mean it seems like there aremany instances of that it might even bekind of epidemic in in culture todayum well we were talking earlier aboutfiat currency being kind of likeanalgesic right that it's right butthere's an economic catastrophe we canjust print money and pretend likethere's more goods and capital thanthere really are it creates a short-termstimulative effect that's aself-deception or you know some there'sa relief to it there's also a relief towhen you take a pain pill right like youhave a disease that's causing theunderlying pain and you just throw theBand-Aid on ituh that's sort of a deception too rightyou're not resolving the root you'rejust kind of hacking at the leaves so Iguess there is a utility sometimes Ithink this is an interesting microcosmmaybe of like lowercase and capital Ttruth because in a sense likeyou're valuing your Blissful ignorancemore than whatever truth you think ishidden down in the basement of your soulor in the fog or wherever it might beand so whatever is allowing you toachieve that Blissful ignorancethat'struthful information for you becauseit's the information that allows you toalign or achieve or move toward or Unitewith what you value mostand I think so that's maybe lower casethat's the more pragmatic perhaps Ithink there's a k you know capital Tmight beiswhat resultsfrom when you apply that mechanics let'ssaytwo different things two different endstwo different values and soI mean and this gets into the religiousdomain perhaps because I think there's anotion likewhen you hold which which informationwhen you hold to be most truemost integrates you with what mostfundamentally isum and and I think you judge that by theresults of it you know by their fruitsyou will know them you know like you youwhen you applywhen you're objective when the thing youvalue most is blissful ignorance and youapply that and you treat the informationas true in that regard well what is theresult I'd say you know again we mightget stuck in the weeds here but broadlya less integrated person a lessstrong person someone who's degradingthemselves on multiple levelswhereas if youif you Orient yourself to another goalanother end another value whatever itmight be because once you get up at thetop of that area it's hard to confineand put borders around and nail downbut if youOrient yourself in a different directionif you treat as true certain informationthat coheres you with something else andit actually makes you more integrated itmakes you more strong it makes you morecapable of bearing the burden of life itallows you toachieve your ends better see moreclearly all that kind of stuff is thatnot a reflection or a commentary or anindication that that thing to which youare trying to be congruent or coherewith is more fundamentally true thanthe Blissful ignorance or whatever elseyou may be aspiring to that's not thatis thatexactly clearly I mean this is all veryconfusing but I got I got lost I'm notgonna lie I got lost all right so I'mgonna try to swing at it though sothere's this utility toI don't know if deception is deceptionmay be too strong of a word there's autility to representing something rightto using a symbol symbols are veryinteresting right you'reyou're using a symbol to representsomething we know that the symbol is notthe thingbut the symbol gives us some uhexpedient way to deal with it right likeeven the words we're using like thewords are never the thing but we cantrade the words around really fast andthat lets us kind of get a handle onthese realities that we couldn't processif we weren't using language forinstance sowhat am I trying to say the utility of adeception or a representation let's sayseems to be expedienceand so there's that old quote that a liecan run around the world while the truthis still putting on its shoesright it's it's fast it's it's it'sum it's like a fast thing so butdeceptionso it's good across space maybe youcould say rightbut deception does not stand the test oftimebecause obviously you know what thethree things that cannot remain longhidden the Sun the moon the truthand if we're talking about like capitalT truthwhich is the nature Ultimate Realitysomething like the laws of physics rightthe laws of physics are immune to timeright it's the opposite of a deceptionthat's expedient and usefulit's something that's Timeless soit's almost like I think we there's thiselement ofsymbolism or falsehood or deceptionbuilt into human rationality itself likewhere you always try to use the map andterritory analogy that we're usinglanguageto try and discreetly map thisinfinitely complex fluid World Continuumthat we all inhabit right the the map isnever the territory by definition butit's very useful to us obviously rightwe can all get on the same map and wecan connect our minds through languageprices rationality Etc and we can solvemuch larger more complex problems thatbenefitum the human Enterpriseby getting consensus on these littlemicro deceptions called words or symbolsor whatever may be soI'm kind of flailing about as well butthere there is it's notagain it's not like an US versus dumbthing it's like oh we need all truth allthe time it's like no we actually doneed to have these little Illusions likemoney and the nation state and your nameand your business like these are alluseful fictions useful illusionsum well I think I think the problem withlike the the money map analogy is thatlike the the real problem comes when oneinsists that the map is the territoryyou know that's right it reminds me youknow like the problem is that there's ayou know a story about you know there'sa boat it's going along it sees thatthere's another boat coming along atradios that goes oh hey this is the U.SCoast Guard we're in command here you'rein our lives like you need to move andthey're like yeah not happening you guysneed to move out of the way who's likeone more time like I'm telling you wherethe U.S Coast Guard we come in this youneed to move your vessel out of our wayand the response is yeah we're alighthouse this is your moveyou know and like that's reallyimportant because when we see the map asbeing the territory itself we will makethose insistence to say no this iscapital T truth when perhaps it's just alower T truth and when we replace thelower T Truth where a capital T1 nowwe're in total error and I can't helpbut think about Hannah our density andsystems upon what evil is is theinability to be able to truly thinkabout what's happening and so forsomebody like Eichmann the lower T truthwas I'm just doing my job I'm justfollowing orders this is the right thingfor me to do as a good upstanding Germancitizen this is my truth well when welook at that truth in the largerholistic way it turns out that it's acataclysmic error and I can't help butthink that this is the exact same errorthat is the difference between proof ofwork versus proof of stake you'restarting with proof of stake from theauthoritarian decree that something istrue and you're moving forward fromthere and so for Eichmann it was truethat he was being good citizen he wasobeying the laws and he was doingnaturally what he had to do with thatlower T truth but he literally didn'thave the cognition to consider what thecapital T truth is and whether or notshipping people off to the [ __ ] deathcamps was a wise thing to do as a humanso this is you're you're hitting thesame like sorry I'll just finish thisthe mistaking the map for territory likeyou just said Ericthat isyou're misapprehending the nature ofknowledge itself right knowledge isalways necessarily provisionalcontextualit's going to mean different things indifferent circumstances it changes overtime it can never fully capture realitywhen you start thinking it canthat is that's totalitarianism rightyou've totalized knowledge the otherdefinition of evil evil is knowledgewhich believes itself to be completeso once you think that the map is allinclusive there's nothing else to learnyou don't treat people the same wayanymore right for us to have meaningfuldialogueI have to assumethat there are things you know that Idon't know so I can like be listeningand attentive and receptive to what youhave to say if I if I'm a totalitarianand I think I know everything you havenothing to offer me right I can't learnfrom you because I know everythingso there's this goes back to I think itwas maybe Socrates there's two types ofpeople in the world right there are thefools that think they are wise and thereare the wise who know that they arefoolsso it's like gaining this appreciationfor the finitude of knowledge that thatepistemic reality human rationalitythought all of this is limited againstthe backdrop of a limitless reality withwhich we're trying to contendthe the fundamental respect that has tobe brought into the equation when we'reconversing and I know that I do not havecomplete knowledge I now must respectthe other person that I'm interactingwith because otherwise this is arelationship of totalsyou have no need to respect me becauseyou're complete in knowledge on your ownso there's no need to respect the otherindividual because you're complete inknowledge of yourself so I just thinkthat's an important interesting factI think this is an error that uh thatbitcoiners that you know I I'm guilt tothis I think many of us have made thismistake of thinking we hadthis this knowledge that was completeand you know that you had uncovered avery important truthum and then because you had uncoveredthat truth or because you knew thattruth you could wield it sort of as aweapon against other people and that'snot the appropriate way to think orbehave and I think uh being the you knowthe Wise Fool is is a much better uh isa much better outcome and I think overtime I've moved from being so it was youknow like very overzealous about this inthe beginning to being like yeah it'sprobably a lot I don't a lot I don'tknow you know just and uh trying to bemoreummore circumspect about my my own my ownunderstanding of what's Happening herenow at the same time though it does pissus off as bitcoiners because I know alot more about Bitcoin than you do a[ __ ] lot more so you need to shut the[ __ ] up when you're talking to me don'ttell me your [ __ ] opinions uh I'm aperson with experience I don't I don'tbow to you you bow to me [ __ ] offthere's the uh there's the old hoddle weloveum but you know I mean this is thelitmus test of a of a sincerePursuit or orientation of Truth is thattype of humility because and that's whyit's so obvious when you encounterpeople that that don't espouse that orthat are overly arrogant or hubristic orwhatever you can tell that they'reserving something other than the truththeir own ego their own interests theirown gain whatever it may be but itthere's a requisite humility if you'regenuinely orienting Yourself by apursuit of the truth and just one othercomment for me and I'll hand it over toyou Rob but Eric that that was what Iwas kind of trying to explain in my rantlike you mentioned this Eichmann guy inin Nazi Germanyhim treatingyou know a type of information as truthin service of a particular end I use theword degrading or disintegrating versusintegrative because I think those areyou know good ways to look at orientingoneself and that was obviously a verydisintegrating uh you know let's sayideal or objective and therefore thetreating of the information he cameacross as true in service of thatobjective and it was very disintegratingand ultimately with the hindsight withthe benefit of hindsight we look at thatand say well obviously right obviouslythat's bad behavior and so my point waswhat is the information that when wetreat as true leads to a moreintegrating more harmonious if you likeindividual cells a stronger moreintegrated individual self and communityof of interacting people and I mean Ithink this is why the question of likewhat is true has been the centralquestion of humanity for as long as wehave records for I mean this is thereligious the theological the PhyllisEnterprise and for good reason becausepeople recognize that that what you mostOrient yourself towards what yourhighest goal is will determine how youtreat the information that you comeacross and it will have extremelyconsequential it will be extremelyconsequential how you treat thatinformation I.E will you shove someoneinto uh an oven and incinerate themalive or will you operate with yourselfand the people you engage with in amanner that is conducive to mutualrespect flourishing strengtheningproductivity you know whatever we mightconstrue there those there's nothingmore consequential to that and I thinkthat's why this this question has beenso Central and and the last part of thatis justI think this is also the theum delusion or Illusion uh you refer torob you know it's almost like we comeout of the womb right we're just a blobof nothingness like that's the firstseparation from our mother and then weadd on all these things name interestblah blah blah that serve to separate usmake us unique from everyone else andit's almost like the Journey of life islike going into thatyou know uh multifarious identity spacebut then piecing together ultimately thethings the understanding so theinformation you need to recognize youryour fundamental Unity with everyone sogoing from Unity to multiplicity back toUnity and I think that could be that'sone of the functions of Distortion falseinformation delusion isbecause I think thatis contending with that properly is thejourney toward discovering and embodyingvirtue and what is virtue other than aword we use toPoint toward that highest place and thethe aspects of it that we can bring downinto our life and and display in ouraction and I think you know that that ispart of thethe function of the potential fordelusion and evil more broadly is makingyoumaking you develop recognize and embodyand stand up for that ver you know thosevirtues and it is in doing that thatmakes you integrated with what is in thehighest place or what is mostfundamentally is that that's kind ofmore clarification on the point I wastrying to make earlierbut yeah I like to contend with it youhave to contend with it you have to bewilling to ask those questions it's whenthose questions come you go whoa whoa no[ __ ] that that this is umto me like that that's the criticalissue that allows for somebody to stayin lower teeth lower T truth notthinking comprehensively about the worldin a lower ways there is anunwillingness to sit and meditate withthe questions themselves I just wantedto point that outyeah no I think that's an excellentexcellent point go aheadoh no I was just gonna say a lot ofthese people are low-team I agreewell I mean being high tea is a resultof being properly integrated with thetruth of the world you know that's justwhen you're integrated with propernutrition when you're integrated withnature properly integrated with goodrelationships High T is the outcomethat's just that's a [ __ ] example ofwhat I was talking about that's whatresults are oriented and integratedproperlythat's so goodyeahso there's no final answers right that'sI mean right that's kind ofparadoxically the final answer is thereare no final answers I think everythingis also in Paradox ultimately rightthat's kind of the spice there's nobrick wall at the end of any Pursuit theactual Cosmos our inner domains I meanit's just right everything's cyclicaland that's wellthe beautiful thing about Bitcoin thebeautiful thing about Bitcoin is itallows us to all come up with our ownquestion our own answers for thatquestion what is true and then it givesus enough money so that we can colonizeDistant Worlds you know and there willbe a planet of people that all believelike Eric Cason and there will be aplanetwho eat egg who eat egg shells on top oftheir breakfast like John vallasreal whole planet of these people and soit's this ends like do this ends likeDune for all of us that's my theoryanywaywhich is great right that's thethat's a definite definite successmetric for the human race that we'vemore of me as the comedian Louis CK saysso the man's premise on like more of meyou knowum did heoh did Louis CK ever get it or is hestill just poking the bear I thinkthat's a parody I think he's getting aguy on Twitter yeahno it's apparent oh sorry guysI was really excited one of my favoritecomedian followed me but it's not himspeaking of Twitter happenings I neededto give uh John and Rob you guys get alot of kudos for uh orange pillingJordan Peterson because I just saw himlike a week ago being like Bitcoin fixesthis take heed peasants I was like Goddamn they orange built this guyyeah I don't know where he is we're yeahstill trying okay I want to say allrightI have so much to say now all rightso John your point like on virtue[Music]I think because even isn't the wordVirtue is not derived from a word fortruth virtus something like thatyeah so it's like this struggle to tryand embody what is most useful right soto embody these pragmatic truthshonesty discipline you know Valorwhatever the most usefula pattern of action to the to theI guess collectively determined Societyat that time that tends to be virtueso they're tools right they're just likeall these other [ __ ] tools that weusenow I want to what I really wanted totalk about there was tying this all theway back to Cason's pointthat I think I'm just now starting toreally see the light on and I'll try andsay what I'm seeing here so you madethis point Eric thatwhen we blind the identity assigningfunction of the state right that thestate is no longer able to decreethis is your social security number thisis what you do this is who you arethat Were Somehow maybe preventing thecapacitywe're preventing ourselves from reducingone another to a labelmaybe as a way to put this and when youreduce someone to a label like we'retalking about the deception being anexpedient it's very easy to just writesomeone off like oh it's a [ __ ]bleeding heart liberal or oh that's aredneck conservative right you reducesomeone to a label you totally discounttheir sovereignty right theirindividuality goes to zero once you putthem in that bucketand so again it's an expedient it'suseful maybe if you're just going todeal with someone in passingbut the trade-off to that experience isyou're giving up a more intimateknowledge of their individuality rightjust by virtue of using that label somaybe bywhich is to say you're discounting theirindividual sovereignty so by reducingthe ability of the state to assign theselabels or identitiesmaybe we're actually reducing the amountwe discount sovereignty in one anotherand soyou know when youto view individuals as individualsactually look at someone and be likethis individual is unknowable to me Ican never just like anything else youlook at in the world you can never fullycapture it in language you can't surelycan't capture an individual languagethat through that linguistic change ifthat is a linguistic change that wedevelop more of an appreciation for theactual sovereignty and unknowability ofthe individuallike that as it seems to be a majorcognitive changeand I want to give an example a weirdexample because soit's like all rightI'm gonna take a left turn herewe're talking about how we talk aboutone another how we think about oneanother how we relate to one anotheruh there's a you know there's theexpedient path I can just put you in ato a label or I could be your bestfriend and really spend a whole lifetimegetting to know you and yet never fullyknow you kind of thing and there'ssomewhere in betweenthat seems to be kind of reflecting ourinner the inner struggle between ourAngel and our animal right where I don'twant to see a thing on Twitter and reactto it and call someone a piece of [ __ ]or whatever I want to try and like bemore like Jeff Booth Bruce Lee like letthat negative energy pass through me putout positive energyI had this that's like a personalanecdote I saw a bit what's his name bitboy crypto the other day it was like ohyeah someone was passed around a videoof his and he's just I mean this guy'slike Fiat really wanted to call that guya piece of [ __ ] he's real like oh he'sFiat and Corona dude like he'she's like I think he was accusing CoreyClipson of wanting to put his hands downthe pants of like Gary's like somethingthat doesn't make any [ __ ] sense atall like it's just so just preying onstupid [ __ ] people I again here I amusing that horrible exclusionarylanguage but clearly like tilted towardsidiots like No One's Gonna believe whatthis guy is saying unless you're justdumband I wanted to write I actually typed atweet out and I was like there's goingto be a huge grease fire in hell whenthis pig finally ends up thereand I wanted to send it so badbut I just couldn't I don't know theinner my inner Jeff Booth Angel was likeno why like what is this going to dothis serves no purpose you're gonna calla spade a spade but it accomplishesnothing like transcend you know deletethe Tweet move on and so I ended updeleting it but I just wanted to likegive a personal anecdote of thiswrestling like there's always thisthere's a there's a big tendency ormotivation to want to just label someoneand then once they're labeled you just[ __ ] you can denigrate them into theground you know yeah but but you'resacrificing the truth of who they arewhich is I don't know that guy who knowsmaybe he'll do something great one day Ihave no idea but uh well the other theother an element of that is always likewhen when someone veers off course let'ssay and let's say you know just for thesake of argumentthere's no ambiguity in that assessmentthey are veering off course I mean Ithink theyou know the higher self let's say wouldrecognize that the appropriateresponse is compassion right becausethey're cutting themselves off from thetruth and all of the goodness thatSprings forth from it let's say uh andso you know those peoplethey may be more deserving or moreuh in need of your compassion andguidance should you care to giveanything at all now I you know obviously99.9 times out of 10 it's just going tobe apathy and like I'm gonna let him bein his own world and all those otherpeople be in that world and I'm going tofocus on other things but you know thatseems like it would be the appropriateperspective to have on something likethat let me ask you thiswhy did you want to write that otherthan like you know the impulse tobecause you think he's harming peopleand you want to maybe needle and pointedout but like what like you recognize andthat's why you deleted it butwhat are you contributing to what areyou gaining and what are youcontributing to by set by actuallycommunicating that to the world it wasdefinitely an Impulse but I think if Iand I didn't know this consciously atthe time but when I'm looking at it nowin retrospect this is two days agoprobably I think I was triggered by himsaying that about Corey it's almost likeyou're rising to defend a friend you'relike [ __ ] you dude like what are youlike my friend wants to put his hands onthe pants of a regulator like what thatdoesn't even make like you're such a fatpiece of [ __ ] you're gonna burn in hellforever like I just wantedlike I was triggered I guess andumI yeah I know but he's perfectI I will say as somebody who um has lettheir ID run wild on Twitterfor for years at a time it's so freeingGod doesn't feel good it feels so goodyeah and it's only later when you go ahyeah there's some blowback here probablyshouldn't have said all that [ __ ]but yeah but what's what's worse the theblowback externally or the blowbackinternally when you realize that perhapsyou've acteduh Less in line with what you deem to bemost virtuous in the future sometimeuh for me it's more external becauseit's definitely I'm always just goof I'mjust goofing around and then some peopletake it wrong or whatever you know whatI mean it's like I kind of enjoy I enjoydialing up the chaosbut a lot of people can't live thereit's a very you know what I mean it'slike you get balanced off quick when youlose 11. incidentally is the why isthere is the reason why you were thefirst uh person I reached out to when Istarted the podcast yeah just I'd be onTwitter be like man I love the way thisguy gets down you know I want to havehim on for the inaugural uh episode butyou know what you said you said umwe had it booked and then like a fewdays before before you you wrote me likeyo yo I gotta reschedule I'm gonna behungover that day so so that's why uhsessions ended up being the firstthat doesn't sound like me at all uhyou know what was what was interestingfor me and here was the value in it wasbeing that character on Twitter was veryfreeing it allowed me to uh I over theyears you know I had this issue like Ihad a real problem like free Bitcoinwhere there was an invisible rule bookand for some reason I knew all of itsrules and everybody I knew knew all ofits rules and I lived in strictadherence to all of its rules and thenone day I realized why do I live my lifeaccording to an invisible book I'venever seen or heard it's just it'sculture it's Dogma it pervades my lifeeverybody around me reinforces that Ihave to be this specific way and I[ __ ] hate it I hate every bit of itand having Bitcoin and having that likefeeling of the first time I made aBitcoin transaction I've said thisbefore but I felt scared I felt nervousand then when the transaction sent likeit was supposed to suddenly thatnervousness I felt empowered ittransformed me in that moment thatsounds cringe or whatever I don't carethat really happened to me and from thatmoment on I set forth on a differentpath in my life truly and I created thischaracter to burn down all of the Deadwood that was around me I started sayingyou know what instead of this invisiblerule book exists and I'm going to followall of its rules like a [ __ ] I startedsaying [ __ ] this book and [ __ ] you and[ __ ] everybody else all right I'm gonnasay whatever I think and feel and I'mgonna let the chips fall where they mayand I spoke a lot of Truth to a lot ofpeople and it was beautiful you knowwhat I mean and then I realized there'sthere's an abundance of Truth thing thatcan happen too where you've gone too faryou've overdosed on the truth and justlike there are white lies there are alsoblack truths you know what I mean and soyou don't need to tell everybody everytruth every time every minute of the daywhen you think it you know I mean so Ibacked off a little I moderated a littlebitbut you know that that is a a prettygood example becauseyou know we I don't think we're sayinghere like never express Because unlessyou're going to be a monk in a templelike not saying anything foreveryou're gonna you're gonna engage you'regonna Express out in the world andthat's gonna be in relation to thingsyou see and if you want to be true toyourself like sometimes you're going tosay things that other people a bit orthat rub people the wrong way orwhatever and like again if you want tobe the monk sure and maybe that is howeveryone should be out now who the [ __ ]knows but presuming we're not all goingto be like that one of the things that'sfascinating with you isI mean at least from my perspectiveobviously some people took it the wrongway but you know uh I would say I alwayscould tell where it was coming from likeand people would hit me up I think I'mnot sure if I ever shared it with youbut you know people would say like howcan you have this guy on your your showand stuff like that he's this that andthe other thing and I'd write them backthey're like you're not you don't get ityou know you're you're not seeing what'sreally going on here you're like and sobut because of that most people like youknow came to appreciate it right andmost people you know you're a lovablecharacter let's put it that way butbecause despite the you know the actualwords you were using and throwing outthere in The Ether they could tell whatwas animating it behind it it wasn'tmalevolence it wasn't aggression itwasn't evil it wasn't meanness it wasjust you know broadly speaking it was itwas an expression of Liberation that youjust described from the strictures thatyou formally subjected yourself to let'ssay and so absolutely that that so it'sit's not all bad right that is much ofthat is good and look at look at thegood yeah it's one produced in the livesof of others the people that youaffected the shamed in the stack andmore sads you know all that kind ofstuff but also how it's enriched yourlife you know all the friends you'vemade as a result of being that type ofperson and communicating that way lookat all the relationships you've builtlook at all the experiences you've hadas a result of that and backback to the point just last last thingback to the point earlier it's like howdo you judge the the legitimacy of theinformation that you both intake andexpress outwardly it's got to be in theoutcome right I mean how else could wejudge it and that seemingly is a prettygood outcome that you've establishedfrom acting in the way you havewell I appreciate all the compliments uhobviously they make me a mildlyuncomfortable but it's uh you know it'sit's it's like um it's like Peterson'sthing of like speak the truth and seewhere it takes you my life is a milliontimes different than it was before Istarted being more outright with what Iwas actually thinking in my head thoughbefore that I was just walking aroundthinking these thoughts and then keepingthem to myself and then once I startedjust saying it me and Eric were talkingabout this when we were in that backyardin L.A uh I drive by the way I wassupposed to do a documentary and I Iwent to the documentary crew and I waslike um I'm bringing some people with meand they were like okay and I was likeno yeah you have to put Eric Cason oncamera and so if I force I force Eric tobe in the documentary and then I cameback into the room I was drinking winein the backyard with some girls I cameback into the room the documentary crewwas in love they went from being mildlyannoyed I'd showed up with Eric to beinglike bro you said it all man I [ __ ]love you dudeso that's that's always the case that'salways the case and that's and that'sbecause Eric's Eric speaks his [ __ ]truth too I mean everybody up here doesbut like people have really responded toEric recently because like the things hesays and the rants he goes on and likeEric has given it to you as Eric sees itand it's fully authentic and just it'syou can't help but like love a personwho's just telling especially when youcan tell that person has a good heartand soul and they're telling you howthey see things you know what I meanit's always interesting everybody elseis just wandering around like recitingshibboleths about like oh yeah hey[ __ ] diversity is our strength likeJesus Christ kill me you know what Imean 100 percentwell I I appreciate those Outlets thatthat was a really cool interview becauselike as we got into it like I was aboutto go north philosophical stuff and Iwas like hang on like you don't happento be familiar with Giorgio and againare you and like the the dude produceslike yeah actually I'm like really wellread in Georgia and again we like studydid stuff before we did direct actionstuff back in the 80s so so yeah I Iknow 100 we're talking about I was likeoh okay cool so we just we just Doveimmediately down and I was like yeah sobitcoin's about the state of exceptionSovereign Theory because it allows forthe inability to create an exception tothe law that labels us and allows for usthen become other people that could bedestroyed and have our wealth Rob fromus so it's like a really great thingum but yeah it was a great it was agreat interview I've been wanting toCircle back to what Rob was saying aboutthis idea of respecting people'ssovereignty and thatuh like this comes back to Emmanuellebanon's thesis that he asserts intotality and infinity is that by usrespecting the other truly as anindividual who we can have no power overwe open up a space of infinitepotentiality that that other person hasto be able to be who they're supposed tobe you know so when we label bit boycrypto as being a fat sloppy piece of[ __ ] that will never amount to anythinginto the world while that probably isabsolutely true there is the possibilityof him redeeming himself and him beinglike you guys like I I realized thatlike me selling advertisements to [ __ ]coins and dumping on all this retail isa horrible thing to do and I'm I'm sorryand I I don't want to be that in theworld like they there becomes apotentiality to open that by usaccepting and allowing for him to havethe sovereignty that he has other thanunilaterally saying Hey [ __ ] this guyhe's a fat sloppy piece of [ __ ] that'sgoing to try to sell you [ __ ] coins andrip you off so don't trust them orlisten to them and if you see them onthe road throw rocks outumyou know whereas like beingcompassionate and open allows for thepotentiality of him to see his ownmistakes and to correct them accordingto however he can which is much more ina line with capital T truth because wedon't know the potentiality that anotherperson has to unlock and open themselvesand maybe there becomes a quintessentialevent of the truth being electrifiedinside of him of him going whoacrypto stuff is no good and I haveBitcoin and these bitcoiners haveactually been trying to help me here andunderstand this message but you know inthe lower example of Rob by us you knowsaying these mean things to him maybe hedoesn't get that and he closes down toit because we haven't respected hissovereignty in the same way that wewould like our own to be respected so Ijust think that that's a reallyinteresting and important point aboutthe value of allowing other people theirsovereignty it's not about just feelinggood it's about the the realquintessential truth of the potentialityof a totality that that other person candeliverthat that's valueless you know [ __ ] bitboy crypto he could he could make a curefor AIDS I don't know maybe he'll youknow who knows what he can do butwe gotta afford that model thinks it'shilarious he could cure AIDSyou couldn't but I agree I think it's Ithink it's a it's a uniquerole to be the jester in the right waywith the rightattitude with the right heart with theright intention behind it which isperhaps why it's such a rare role butwhy it's so highly regardedum and everyone else you know shouldperhapshave the orientation that Eric justdescribed I mean again I think it's themore true one anyways it is true thatanyone can be redeemed it is true thatanyone can change their behavior it istrue the people go can go from doingquote unquote so-called you know badbehaviors to good ones that all all ofthat is true and is it not the best useof our attention should we choose to usto devote it to such people or things totry to treat it as though we expect itto go in that direction rather than uhrather thanum solidifying the behavior that they'vedone and and hardening those people intheir place as in and Us Versus Themsort of dynamic soyou know I I agree but I I think thisthis is why the jester is an eternalcharacter and why these differentarchetypes let's say the king and thephilosopher and the poet and the jesterI mean these are always going to be withus for that reason because takentogether perhaps that helps us steer theship in a more or lessbetter Direction you know the ark bendstoward truth or Justice or peace orIntegrity or whatever however we want toconstrue it this is why the um the Deepplatforming of Alex Jones from every bigTech platform all in unison was soconcerning to me because uh that is thedeath of the jester right Alex Jones isnot a serious person nobody's ever takenhim seriously I mean he's he says funnyridiculous people take them seriouslywell they they started taking him moreseriously after he was de-platformedright because it's a Streisand effectThing Once you shut somebody up thenthey go wait a second why'd they shuthim up what was he saying what was hesaying that he what did he get right youknow and uh you know then we saw a waveof censorship come after that andanybody who plays that role now like uhAndrew they just did it to Andrew Tateright anybody who's playing the role ofthe jester they're letting their ID runwild on the internet they're gonna gettaken down because we are in tyrannicaltimesin any way shape or form but the factthat he's being held without charge inRomania is concerning you know and to melike this is what it always comes backto is about the actual function and ruleof law itself which I don't think existsanymore but the fact that you know hedid a lot of shitty things and as ashitty person but like I want himaccountable to law as opposed to justbeing unilaterally held by the quotegood people because he's a bad personlike that doesn't work for meI was just gonna say that the when yousee the censorship coming down on thejester archetype that is a verytroubling Canary in the coal mine rightbecausethe Jester's telling those truths thatothers are scared to speak or maybe eventhey're like subtle truths right that umoften the punch line to a joke is likeyou're just telling you're sayingsomething everyone already knows to betrue they just never thought about andthat certain framing perhapsand so when power tries to come down onthat right or when Authority tries tosquash that that subtle truth-tellinguh that's very dangerous right thisum Peterson talks about this a lot likeonce the king comes down on the adjusterlike you should be concerned for thatSociety because basically the king isnot toleratingthe truth the truth telling that wascoming from the jester so you could alsosay it's an indication of the fragilityof the king's domain because he seeseven the slightest slight you know theslightest incline like poke as being athreat to his orders totalitarian yeahyeahyeah what I think is so interesting inour field is that like the the Anon isthe jester who like we can't get rid ofin any way and I find it so interestingthat that Peterson has gone on thesediatribes against the nons for a whilebecause toto me like the the Anon is one of likethe quintessential figures that like Iactually think in the end like theanonymous who fundamentallywe lost Ericammo oh they're his best rants keepgetting cut I know yeah don't don't liveout in the middle of the woods whereit's super windy and stormy that that'swell actually thinking about wheresociety's going maybe you guys shouldjust be comfortable with uh you're notcomfortable with a 15 second cutoff Ericmaybe I'll maybe I'll Q maybe I'll cueyou up to finish the rant here but Ithink one of the things with uh Petersonand the reason why he hates Anan is Iactually think that Peterson has beenthe victim of Bot farms and so I thinkthat there are there are specialinterests that have been going afterPeterson and when you're the peopledon't understand what it is to be alarge account I'm sure Rob understandsit better than anybody's largest countup here but like it's a totallydifferent experience to log in whenyou're a large account I mean you arejust being pummeled with [ __ ] and it'sjust flying at you it's you can't justcasually read through what other peopleare doing like people are trying to dragyou into [ __ ] like people are trying toyou know uh do psychological warfare onyou I mean it's brutal man and so forPeterson he's been a victim of that atscale and I think that's why he hatesannounced it's a very stupid opinion ofhis that he holds and he needs to getrid of it you know yeah yeah it is andhe engages a lot man like he's justgonna sayingcomments yeah like 10 followers thatsaid something against one of his viewsand he'll lash out at them likeaggressively it's like right yeah rulenumber you know internet engagement 101leave the trolls B you know focus on thethe I don't know making a betterargument or all the stuff we were sayingearlier about you know positivedirection of things right in all honestyI I find Peterson to be quite anemotionally sensitive man like in apositive way and I think he also haslike cptsd from like dealing with the[ __ ] from the internet from hisgeneralized stardom so like I haveempathy for what his perspective is onis on it I just wish that he could allowfor himself a little bit of emotionaldistancing to think about it a littlebit more and offer a weighted critiqueas opposed to General lashing out buthe's one of his greatest strengths thathe's so sensitive to feedback and evenwith like in the personal interactionsI've had with him it's he's the guy thathe is on stage so to speak is the guywho is in person like he's actuallylistening to you he's actually thinkingabout what you're saying he's actuallyrespondingand so maybe he maybe that strengththough applied to I don't know five orsix million Twitter followers whateverhe's got going on and all that chaoticall the things totaled us labeled comingat you maybe a sensitivepredisposition is not the idealumwhateverum not skill set but what is it it's hisnature I guessand maybe we're just seeing that rightit's kind of a personal blemish gettingburnt offout in the public eye I think it's alsonone of us can appreciate and maybe thisis a fault of his to to bite off so muchbut none of us can appreciate just howmanylike scenes or like places where he'scommenting and involved on thingswhether it be political economic socialpsychological blah blah blah all the waydown the line and you know to be at allcapable of doing that in any domain youhave to spend a lot of time readingkeeping up on who's saying what on theBlock on so much stuff and so I think hespread himself extremely thin and giventhat I think he does a tremendous job ofyou know focusing in on what is ofutmost importance in each of thoseRealms but you can you got to have somesympathy for someone who bites off somuch and who attempts to I mean you knowmaybe there's an ego aspect of it tooand maybe that's somewhat condemnablebut um you gotta sympathize with the guywho's I think he's trying to do goodhe's just trying to do it in so manydifferent domains and doing so much workthat you're gonna swing and Miss inplaces because you're just you're justoverwhelmed by the magnitude yeah theamount of at-bats he's taking rightwe're gonna see a lot of swing in a messand this is kind of likeumportal saying earlier about the blacktruths you know the creative process isfraught with risk basically so if you'regoing to be the jester you're going totell some black truths you're going totell some bad jokes you're going to pisssome people offso you I mean there has to be sometolerance I guess for that too thatPeterson is trying to do a lot of stuffso we got to give him a little leewaybut yeah the opinion on and ons is worthshut yeah I totally agree but luckily Imean this maybe bringing it full circlebefore we shut it down but you knowwe're talking about de-platforming andall that kind of stuff and with each dayit seems likefreedom is gaining new ground you knowlike something like nostrils pops upagain who knows when these things pop upyou know how what the legs are like andhow persistent it'll be this one seemslike it's got a lot of legsum but it's amazing I mean imagine aCommunications and information landscapenow and increasingly into the futurewhere you know you don't have toassociate you certainly your so-calledreal identity with those things but evenyou know better you can just you cantake your identity platform to platformanywhere you go you can't really be theplatform because you can just pop up onanother platform without any real lossand then you know you sprinkle in thefinancial incentive that's being builtinto these platforms and you know socialmedia Communications payments is allbecoming censorship resistant and andnot only that I mean that's veryexciting for you know the de-platformingthat we alluded to earlier that's beenyou know really egregious over the lasttwo years notwithstanding elon's recenttakeover of Twitter but um it's evenmore exciting because when whenplatforms or companies or apps can'tring fence their users in the way thatthey traditionally have when there's notthat moat think aboutthe competition that that Fosters forthese apps to offer a better experienceto the people who use them because I'msure I'll just I'm on Damas and I'll gowherever else if it's way better and Ihave really nothing to lose by doingthat and so it's just I think it's goingto be this insanely rapid iteration oftools that we can use and what are thosetools going to be most oriented towardswell they're going to be towards the theproblems that we most feel which isbeing the platform being censored notbeing able to say what we truly believenot being able to communicate ortransact with who we want to all thosethings and so now I think this just hasopened up a massive can of worms is thewrong thing because that's kind of anegative but like it's really going toaccelerate the options that we have forbeing more free in in many domains ofour life you know and then you sprinklein a little AI on top of that who the[ __ ] knows what happens because thatshit's getting really crazy toobut uh so I'm uh I'm wildly bullish ongnoster I've been spending a lot of timeon uh on Noster and uh the interactionsI'm having there the engagement that'sthere I mean it's a real thing Nasserhas a network effect it's so and that'salways been the problem with like themastodons and trying to Port BitcoinBitcoin Twitter somewhere else I alsothink like there's this thing thatBitcoin the energy in Bitcoin moves itwas on bitcoin talk then it was onReddit then it was on Twitter then itwas on social audio and and now it's onuh now it's on Noster and so it's likebitcoinners are always very Tech forwardand they're always moving forward to thenew thing and the fact that we now haveuncensorable comms in addition touncensorable money well guess what we'rereally [ __ ] expensive to tyrannizereally expensive and that's and that'sthe best thing that you can be isextremely expensive to [ __ ] withtotally that's that's the name of thegame you do that long enough and theones that want to [ __ ] with you atrophybecause they just can't the returnsaren't there they can't they can't keepit uprightI mean I think theoh go ahead I was just gonna ask Rob ifshe's on Nostra I've got I've got to geton it no I haven't done it yet but I amShadow banned on Twitter and Twittersupport doesn't respond so I think thatis my sign I need to get an officer yeahyou got to do it yeah I've had a ton offun on master I I begged for a sandwichon there last week it wasI I like made some side hand commentabout how you could like make money andget like a sandwich from no star I don'tknow if it was like you just really wanta sandwich don't you Eric and I was likeyeah you guys caught me like here's themoney like go have your sandwich now butI mean just like this I know this is asuper rudimentary thing but that's youknow everything's rudimentary in theearly stages but just two weekends ago Iwas watching the fights having a beerand I just tweeted on not or posted onNoster like who's at a bar and wants abeeryou know and someone people respond withyou know a photo of the bar they're inor the receipt I zap them the cost ofthe beer and I just bought someone abeer in [ __ ] India New York a bottleof wine for for somebody just sitting inmy home and you know so it's kind oflike random acts of kindness generositywhatever that they're way more powerfulthan people probably think on firstglance but it's super I did oneI did one last last night or the nightbefore I was sitting around gettingdrunk and I was like uh hundred thousandhundred thousand SATs to the firstperson that can name the best RollingStones album and uh for the first personwho said the correct answer which isExile on Main Street and if you don'tbelieve it's Exxon Main Street get[ __ ] uh that person I sent them 100000 sets you know yeah and it and itscales up because if you do that whileyou're drinking you're a lot looser withyourself I have found another anotherthing that's another thing that'sinteresting about Noster uh in specificis that if you want better engagementyou want to have a better conversationwith your audience it has a totallydifferent it has a it has sat specificincentive mechanisms built right inright so like when I see comments thatare good commentsum I send the person SATs so I'm likethat's a dope comment man I [ __ ]really appreciate that you did that zapand also there's a lot of talk aboutjust getting rid of the like buttonentirely and so on NASA we're going tomove to just zaps which is sending SATsto people via the lightning Network foranybody who doesn't know and then uhrepost so you're either putting upsomething on every on every post you'reeither putting up money saying I likethis post here is money or you're sayingI like this post I'm going to boost itusing my reputation it's costly becauseI'm boosting this with my reputationright and so I think that's just a muchbecause likes are just nothing it's justthis weird thing simulator this would beon a specific client right like Damasfor example because you know people yeahwhatever the [ __ ] they wantbikes andexactly they can do whatever they wantbut this has been a topic ofconversation and I think a lot of peopleagree not just on Thomas but on otherclients as wellum it's a really interesting idea andthe interesting thing about Noster isNoster is not a Bitcoin thing it's not aBitcoin app right it's just somethingthat's been it's an uncensorable Freedomtechnology that's been built bybitcoiners and that is [ __ ] excitingbecause it's actually not a Bitcointhing it's a Bitcoin adjacent thing andif you believe in the Bitcoin story youbelieve that everything is going to be aBitcoin adjacent thing right and this isone of the first big ones yeahthose are the uncensorability of it cansomeone just explain that to me how it'snot related to bitcoin yet it'suncensorable it's just a product yesshort for note what what does it standfor notes and notes notes and otherstuff transmittedyeah yeah now it's another stufftransmitted by relay exactlyum so uh yeah basically Rob it's justyou run a relay and there are all theseindependent relay operators some of therelays are paid relays and by the way ifyou want to get set up I'll just youknow me and you can do a private calland I'll set you up with all the [ __ ]you need to know um but basically likeyou just you know you subscribe to someof these private relays paying in SATsuh the relay operators are kind of likehow to think of it they're like musicthis is a BitTorrent thing you couldthink of it no this is the torrentingjust because of the way that the nodessimilar but this is a bright this is abrand new thing it's a brand newprotocol and that's why it's so excitingand I've had Listen by the way I'm notas technically proficient as some of thepeople I talk to about this but Rodolfogave me a whole speech about it what abig deal it is and I believed himbecause I've I can see it I can't fullyarticulate it but basically he wastelling me that what Fiat Joff hascreated with Noster is equivalent towhat Satoshi created with Bitcoin in theway that he took a bunch of other thingsuh like uh private public keycryptography and combine them with thisdumb protocol relay and all this otherstuff and basically Noster is not justsocial media but it's the ability tore-architect a lot of things and peopleare now building marketplaces on Nosterpeople are trying to do GitHub on Nosterthere are all these bounties for Nosterdevelopment the speed and Rapiditeration of NASA development is onanother level this has been taking up alot of my time and attention recentlybecause I have this heuristic thatwhatever the Nerds are doing on nightsand weekends is the thing that's the bigdeal in five or ten years and this thisis soaked up all of the best andbrightest Minds the guys in Bitcoin WhoI Really respect now they're all on thisand man it's really exciting I waswatching some of the conference stuffand just the speed and pace ofinnovation and the ability to like youcan run your own Noster node on umbralif you're running an umbral node theyhooked up a private relay so you can runyour own private relay to back up all ofyour posts on Noster so now you have apermanent record of all of the stuffthat you've ever put out on the internetand you can't be banned or censored it'sit's all there right and if you want torun your own relay and push it to othersa public relay uh you'll be able to dothat as well it's a little bit moretechnical at the moment but it'll geteasier over timeyeah I mean what's being developed hereis so exciting because like it literallyhas the potentiality to pretty muchreplace most things in the web mostparticularly social media but likeacross the board and what to me the mostimportant part is is that now we getdata Purity in a very very important waybecause there's not all this micropushing and [ __ ] with us on the backend to try to sell us a bunch of garbageand furthermore we're going to be ableto adapt our own algorithms in such away to promote some people to promoteother you know certain topics and so nowwe're really owning our data but alsothe algorithms in a very powerful waythat allows for us to reclaim you knowbecause like the the internet issomething that our generation with otherpeople on the planet today collectivelycreated together and very few of us getdirect benefits of that and so if thenext iteration of the internet we allget to own that directly it's going tohave huge and massive ramificationsacross the board for how people canconduct their life connect with peoplesocialize create economics and with itbeing having this backing of bothBitcoin and decentralized nature but itmakes the political apparatus that'simbued into the internet right nowessentially flaccid and incapable ofdoing the same kind of [ __ ] it's beendoingnot Noster is the only web 3 thingthat's actually interesting at allperiod Point Blank everything else is abunch of [ __ ] and you know it'sinteresting because China censored it[ __ ] immediately the Chinese got onthere and then we started running relaysand the CCP was like shut it down shutit down and we were all like Let It Gobaby let it go you know so it's excitingit was funny it was all this Chinese andthen it would be like Fiat jaff bunch ofChinese yeahwhy is my whole feed Chinese porn all ofa sudden I have no idea the Chinesecensored it though so that means it'snot uncensorablethey just took it out of the app storethat's all you can have a desktop youknow app client whatever easilyum the thing my last comment on it isjustI don't think I mean it's kind of againin line with this like exponentialgrowth sort of thing that we can'treally um predict them but just a simpleintegration of a financial incentive andnot just any Financial incentive butlike the Bitcoin Financial incentive indigital content that you can easily uhpublish and propagate now I think it'sgoing to have such dramatic andbeneficial effects like it's so earlyright so it's just kind of fun withSmalls apps but like there will be anincentive to propagatequality content video photo writtencontent because you know right now inlike Twitterbut I still think it's generally peopleprefer things that are uplifting thatare beautiful that are you know that aregood broadly and I just think all thatstuff will be far more incentivized andso you could put out a tweet or youcould put out a video and I mean peopleare doing this now and they're gettingmillions of SATs uh zaped to themimagine when I mean how many people arereally on Noster with a Bitcoin walletlike in the thousands maybe I mean 10over 10 000 who knows but imagine whenit's tens of millions and hundreds ofmillions like if you put out somethingthat's really quality that people likeand everyone zaps you 10 cents you justmade like a [ __ ] load of money you knowso and so I think that incentive isgoing to draw people in and it's alsogoing to radically upgrade the qualityof what's being published and propagatedand great right more quality this is theexact thesis we've always talked aboutand this is a Bitcoin World elevatingthe quality of discourse of productivityof everything that gets that gets builtI was just going to say it's sailor'sorange check thesis just not inside ofTwitteryeah exactly yeah exactly it's adecentralized it's a decentralizedversion of that I kind of feel badbecause I know I I feel like elon'sheart was in the right place with thewhole 44 billion dollar takeover ofTwitter like there's way less censorshipnow and man I wish that had happened youknow two two years earlier uh but it iswhat it is and and you know Noster seemspretty confident that that type ofarchitecture and the benefits that areto be derived from it is the future andTwitter is going to be increasingly seenasyou know a dumpster fire basically youknow even if isn't it isn't it beautifulthat like he paid 44 billion and Nosterwas created by a couple of guys workingin their spare time for free like ofcourse how could it kind of always theway it is right you know and wasn't itaround the same time like he boughtTwitter and the Nasser came onlinebasically yeah well it was it was likeearlier but it became popular becauseJack became popular around the same timeI think Jack gave Fiat Jeff what like 10Bitcoin or eight Bitcoin or somethinglike that as a as a grant of some kindbut it's always this is this is thedigital version of the proverbial garagestartup right like IBM and apple rightlike IBM's yeah two guys in a garagemake apple and we know the rest of thestory Twitter is the behemothyou know a guy couple people build thisnew protocol you know on their own timefor basically nothing other than theirtime and it ends up supplanting you knowthe the big income which again is toobad because elon's probably a better uhOverlord than you know your typical IBMor you know gigantic corporate whateverbutumby the way there's there's this there'sthis feeling on Noster here's one here'sone thing that I've been really lovingabout it and I'm sure it'll change andshift every time but like right now onthe social media version of Noster thatwe're using you know I usually use thedomus client but there's a bunch ofclients you can use uh many of them arevery goodum people are very cool people are verychill ever pretty much everybody's abitcoiner very good A lot of the peoplewe like the Vibes are The Vibes arecrazy awesome and there's just like thisemphasis on like all right these arewhere the people who are motivated whocare who are conscientious this is wherethey're hanging out and uh I don't knowman it's just it's really cool to see itmakes me feel like the early days ofBitcoin in a way and uh it's exciting sowhy all right guysI'm stokedthat's three hours so I um we can shutit down but I will say this before hegoes my last last time I don't know whythree hoursI don't know why let's do three morelet's do three more now let's do it wellin line with that I mean I don't knowwhy I feel it this way especially uhconsidering how [ __ ] hard it was toget this one put together but maybemaybe it's the times we're in I don'tknow but I I'd like to do this moreoften so don't answer now but if I'dlike to bump this up to like maybe a oneonce a month sort of thing and we canjust kind of Riff on on what's going ontechnically and everything else so havea think and we can we can chat offlineabout uhwho among you are down well it's A GreatNotion but you know it takes us threemonths to get a one month thingscheduled so yeah yeah well exactly wego for the one month and we'll hit itevery three I mean that's kind of theall right you know you know what weshould if we're gonna do them once amonth we should do like uh the lastSunday of every month at X time and thenjust kind of try to stick to that Idon't know right it's gonna stop theschedule have it for him in the scheduleand not if I'm just starting a church alittle bit yes yes well this is like thepost-church social oh I gotta get highfor these more often[Laughter]all right well any last comments fromanyone before we shut you down you knowbefore we shut it down you know be dopeuh I went to Peter McCormick did a thingwith jinset live in New York and I wentto it at Pub Key we should do one ofthese [ __ ] live and we'll all justyou know hang out with the corners PubKey guy invited me to come do a bunch ofshows up there so that yeah it's funnyyou mentioned that I've been umfor like the lasttwo three months and again I know Idon't know why particularly dawn on mebut um let's talk offline I got I gotsome thoughts yeah let's go this summeryeahor Miami City's great this summer wellmy is everybody going to be in Miami I'mnot going to be here I'm TBD butdoubtful at the moment yeah oh I knowoh dude you recently hoddle but it'sbeen like it's been like yeah we'll justdo it that's cool we can get togetheryou know some other way some other placeuh accommodating territory Eric I'msorryI'm telling you guys Pub Key is pubky's[ __ ] awesome because it's it'sexactly the vibe you're looking for it'sjust a shitty Dive Bar in New Yorkthat's full of bitcoiners like nothingcould be better you know what I mean notto show it too hard but big to New Yorkit's in New York though it's a littleyeah that's a little bit that's a greatplace to visit though New York City inthe summer great to visit great to leaveyeah yeah all right well look I'll uhI'll send you some thoughts offline andwe'll continue the conversation gentsalways a pleasure uh gentlemen we'lltalk again soon hopefullymuch love my friendsbye everybody peacelet's do it there we go afterI don't know six seven eight attemptswe're back was it that many I'm sorryI'm sorry I [ __ ] up I [ __ ] up withsomething like thatlifetime's a charmthey were all Eric's fault all of themwere Eric's fault I put all the Blair onhim yeah we all [ __ ] we all [ __ ] it upat one point or another you knowyeah exactlyum well how you been we were justtalking about not uh nasricafomoso uh absolutely how is everyone it'sbeen a while it's been too long I thinkthe last one wasthe fall over six months ago I think itwas yeah it wasyeah it was sometime in the fall I thinkmaybe October a lot of shit's gone onsince then was that pre FTX or post ftx3did that one free by the way you knowwhat's funny that feels like [ __ ]ancient history now like at the time Iremember it being all consuming allconsuming to the point where we're likeI was learning intimate details of thesex lives of the founders and all of uswere on Twitter right and then it justdisappearedlike you just you didn't hear about itanymore you know and then there wereobviously several more collapses thathappened after the fact and we're goingthrough Credit Suisse right now whichlooks like it's going to getnationalized and I was listening to youknow robbers let's say to your spaceyesterday of Bellagio who I think uh weall like this is what somebody asked meabout Bellagio in his million dollarprediction I said I believe in I believeeverything that Bellagio said everythingexcept for the timeline I I don't knowthat I believe that timeline I wouldlike to maybe believe that timeline butI just can't get there you know but doeshe I don't think he thinks Bitcoin isgoing to be worth a million dollars orthe US dollar is going to value thatmuch in the next three months I thinkhe's more doing this as a I mean asidefrom any of his personal motivations Ithink he's doing it to bring attentionto this issue more than him you knowbecause if he thought that he'd just buyit now with all of his available Capitalyou know it doesn't make any sense wellI mean he's literally done that too Ithink it's Apollothe printing is comingyeah well I'm like it's a bit like uhit's Max Kaiser is setting a hundreddollars on fire times ten thousand youknow like he he's trying to show likethis money is actually worthless like Ihave I have billions of these so much sothat I will set one million of them onfire to make an explicit statement thatI can't set one million of theseBitcoins on fireum like the the play out of all this isso poetic and what makes me what's themost beautiful is that like this wholecycle got set off as a domino effect byguys leveraging on the hype cycle thatis now happeningyeah I mean like the the fact that thatwhole art goes all the way through ispretty incredible you know and uh do youmean like they were anticipating what'shappening now but just earlier and theygot blown up as a result is that whatyou mean yeah and literally because oftheir anticipation of it and theleverage in it they then blew it up thatthen caused for the very crisis thatthey've been waiting for so it's justlike and this is this is justcontinually how [ __ ] comes up in thisspace that's so beautiful is that likeit's literally like a Greek tragedyplaying itself out with every singleaction having a deeper purpose like lookat it look at the the board of peoplethat are involved with SBA or no withSPF but with Sultan yeah too many toomany starting with that like it'sliterally the entire cast of charactersfrom 2008 like reset inside of this it'spretty funnyto go back to the uh just tying it tothe FTX thingI remember when that Scandal was goingon there was this little diagram showingwhat FTX was doing or they're basicallyprinting new token using it ascollateral to borrow and it was justthis circular logic thing right whereit's self-contained [ __ ] Financialillusionand I remember thinking to myself at thetime that that's exactly what the thefed and the treasury doit's like treasury Issues new [ __ ] coinBond fed issues no [ __ ] going dollar tobuy it rinse and repeat and I love howuh apology called it called this newthis next way of a banking crisissomething like Uncle Sam bankman freedbecause it's the same thing it's thesame principle mechanically just in adifferent wrapper a different veneer anduh and I agree completely with withhoddle like the it all makes sense thisis the same thesis that bitcoiners havebeen advocating for for a long time hejust has an extremely aggressivetimetable for it and I feel a lot ofdissonance because in one sense it'slike all right I hope the guy's rightthat puts all the bitcoiners on top ofthe world in a very serious waybut the world that we would be on top ofif the if the dollar collapsed in 90days like probably not a pretty one soI still I guess I lean more towards uh alot the longer this takes the betteryou don't want it to take too longobviously butum I think the the longer the transitionthe smoother the transitionI'm I'm with you entirely and by the waythat Uncle Sam bankman freed line was so[ __ ] fire I was pissed off I didn'tthink of it I was like God damn that'sgood you know what I mean uh Eric toEric to your point about this all beinglike a Greek tragedy and it's likeenthralling and enmeshing andentertaining and beautiful and poeticthat's all true Until you realize you'rea character in it and then you go oh[ __ ] [ __ ] this is this might turn outbad it's either gonna be really bad orreally good you know what I mean so yeahI'm I'm with Rob though I don't want itto take a super long time I I sorry Idon't want it to be very short andunravel very quickly I want it to takeas long as possible I want to get asmany people in the Lifeboat as possibleand I I have I ran through the exercisein my head thinking throughhyperinflation yesterday when I washearing about this Bellagio stuff I saidto myself who am I going to be in thatmoment and I determined that I am goingto be one of the people that stands bythe Lifeboat that's who I'm going to beand if it means I have to go down withthe ship I will get as many people offthe Titanic humanly possible you knowwhat I mean and I feel like that's forme anyway that's the answer I came upcame up with yeah well I think in someregions all of us have already made thatchoice because if not we'd just be likeAnonymous Nims like you know living ourbest life somewhere we're we're kind ofalready wrapped up in this in one wayyou know one way or the other and uh youknow I II agreewell I Rob what was your impressionabout uh like inter just back tobalaji's motivations for a moment likedo you think that's an actualuh you know bet that he's making andplanning to win or again you just thinkthis is just a Paul Revere thing yeahhe's trying to bring attention to itum I mean I think it's a Paul Reverething but also there's going to be Idon't think he's going to be takingmuch of a beating on this right I'm surebiology is very early to bitcoin soprobably the spread that we've had inthe last week more than pays for thatbet for him right oh yeah um not to saythat that justifies it like it's it'sstill he's still doing something even ifyou're doing the Paul Revere move you'retaking some risks right or you're you'reburning some Capital let's say to kindof send a signalumyou know I don't think it's anythingthat's gonna hurt him economically buthe's definitelyburning some Capital to make a publicitystunt not and I'm not saying that in anegative way necessarily like it's kindof a it's a good thing right I havepeople I had 50I had 50 people reach out to me about itprobably like through different channelssay like did you hear about this do youknow this guy and like a few people Iwould say of those 50-ish messages I gotlike five people were like very seriouslike oh I need to pay attention toBitcoin nowso I mean there's something to thatright we can do all we want in theBitcoin Echo chamber but you can't getthat kind of signal to propagate withoutpulling a publicity stuff like that sothere's some value in it umwell that that's kind of that's as faras I see the personal motivations Idon't know if there's anything elsebeneath that I mean maybe I'm missingsomething but I think that I mean it'sit's beneficial from the perspective ofhoddle just mention you know like youit's all it's a Greek tragedy Until yourealize you're a character in it and Ithink people are beginning to realizeand this is obviously a big part ofbalaji's point is that you can becomemore of a spectator because we're allwrapped up in all this in some way shapeor form but you can insulate yourself tosome degree and probably to a largedegree from what's Happening if you youknow if you step into the Bitcoin realmif you adopt Bitcoin so yes I mean ifwhat really unfolds or if like thiswhole house of cards really collapses ina you know in a very Rapid Way then yeaheveryone's everyone's lives are going tobe disrupted in some way but this is theway that you you know you maximallyinsulate yourself from it and then yougo down the you know the rabbit hole ofbeing Sovereign in other areas of yourlife but obviously this is number oneright get your Monopoly money andconvert that into Bitcoin and that's theway that you can at least sit back alittle bit and be likeyou can watch it as a with a little bitmore entertainment value sorry to saybut you know what I'm saying like youcan be a spectator of it rather thanjust being totally a victim of itright soyeah it's a great point the thing thatconcerns me though is you know when youstudy these hyperinflations when themarkets collapse that destroyseverything right like we saw we got alittle glimmer of it with covet right ohSupply chains are disrupted I can't gettoilet paper or this that and the otherit's like well take that times athousand that's a hyperinflation yeah soeven if you're sitting on a fat stack ofrapidly appreciating Bitcoin your lifeis still going to be disrupted yeahtotally it won't be destitute you'llhave something to trade presumably Imean sure if this all goes to hell inthe next few months I mean is Bitcoindecoupling or is this just a head fakeand we don't [ __ ] know if if thestock market's tank another 30 40 do youreally think bitcoin's not going to gowith it I mean that's the big questionright now I always I message this tobiology last night too I was like haveyou seen I sent him the chart of thegold price during the the Weimarhyperinflation which you guys haveprobably seen like it's all over theworld right it's not like gold just isup and to the right it's up hundreds ofpercent one month down 80 the next monthkind of thing I would expect Bitcoin todo something similarum but there isn't and he makes it hemakes a great point though that beingthis the being that we're in the digitalage like that throws a whole notherweird dynamic into the situation howquickly information and ideas move so Ithat either makes it way faster or waymore volatile or maybe bothI'm really curious about the reflexivenature of Bitcoin in this because likeyou know we've seen plenty ofhyperinflation before but we haven'tseen hyperinflation with a readilyavailableLifeboat to gather into and so I'mreally curious if the reflexive dynamicbecause like the as much as I I have tobe like balja I'm with you that timelinedoesn't work the one thing I can pointout is that he was the dude that calledcovet totally and even with covet itseemed like that timeline didn't makesense and like that well not thattimeline he freaked out a little bit youknow so he he called some of the changesthat would happen as a result but he wasa bit of a hysteric as far as I remembersure and I think he's doing the the thesame thing here as a bit of a again thePaul Ravine but uh I I just have towonder if that reflexive nature can geta feedback loop that's going toaccelerate much quicker than any of us Ithink just because of the dynamic natureof the internet you know the fact thatSilicon Valley Bank lost 40 billiondollars in one day like that that issuch an absurd amount of money somebodydid the math and it was something liketwo million dollars per second a daywhich is is that's such an absurd amountcomparatively to any other bank run thathas ever happened in all of humanhistoryyou know and the fact that they dealtwith that and didn't collapse totally interms of not being able to to haveliquid functions continue is I think apretty powerful statement so I'm curiousto see how it all plays outI think just a double double click onsomething that Eric just said theconcept of reflexivity for anybody inthe audience who like doesn't understandthat fully because it's a very importantconcept to understand is basically canbest be summarized as not only do uhmines move markets but also markets moveminds and there's this constantinterplay between the two and I thinklike the bank run thing that's happeningnow is definitely a reflexive phenomenonbecause here's the here's the secret ifanybody wants to know there's no moneyin any of the banks none of them so whathappens if the world figures that out atonce suddenly you have a bank runpandemic you have contagion that we'venever seen before you can't shut downall the social media you know what Imean like the the people that are smartsophisticated money like the guys likePeter Thiel were calling Founders andtelling them there's going to be a bankrun on svb days before it happenedtelling them to pull their money andthen that precipitated the bank run andthat can happen at every bank and thenit can Domino from One bank to the nextto the next to the next and then the FEDwould would come in the the USgovernment is not going to just allowthe banking sector to collapse so theywould backstop everything and when theybackstopped everything they would haveto print more money than you've everseen in your entire life to do it waymore than what we saw in covet I mean itwould be and two orders of magnitudeBeyond covet it would be a hundredtrillion to bail out the banking systemlike it would be something insane so Imean there's a real risk of that andpeople don't understand exponentials wethink linearly like human evolution didnot set us up to think exponentiallythis is why things that are exponentiallike viruses they catch us off guardevery [ __ ] time and then decimate usyou know what I mean well this this iswhy cbdcs are so important to thembecause like this is literally how theycan print out a hundred trillion dollarsgive it to people and have it not have adirect effect because they go no no thisis something new we're reissuing atotally new system this is all backstopnow it's accountable directly to the theFederal Reserve and again with thepoeticness of everything the fact thatcbdcs could only be invented afterBitcoin by takinga corrupted version of the time chainwhich is a [ __ ] coin called theblockchain and then utilizing thatexpensive highly modifiable database inorder to create a central bank digitalcurrency is I mean it's a bit of achef's kiss thing like mwah like Satoshiin creating Bitcoin you also had theoriginal sin that had to be possiblethrough the corruption of this form of adatabasebeautiful I always go back to that quotethat I'm all those paraphrase are likethe greatest shortcoming of the humanrace is our inability to understand theexponential functionand title's point like we are not youalways have to takethat always that quote always makes youjust sit back in humility for a minuteit's like no matter what you think youknow what mental model you've got goingon even when you've run the spreadsheetlooked at the exponential decay functionof Bitcoinand what you would expect that to do toits price or adoption like you stillhave to sit back and take all that witha grain of salt and realize you're justan ape playing in the dirt that's notreally wired to understand theimplications of of exponents andexponents and power laws they dominateuh natural phenomena right so we're kindof like living through one of those andthe reflexivity thing I think it's justa feedback loop right I mean feedbackloops are everywhere in nature it's howbiology responds and relates to itsenvironment but what's weird about itwith Bitcoin is that you know if thegold price goes upwell gold production goes up right thenew Supply it's the market trying tothat that's now being incentivized to besold on the market but with Bitcoinprice goes up and no new BitcoinproductionBitcoin production never changes rightit's it's 10 minute blocks whatever thealgorithm says for that that havingEpoch is is what theum coinbase subsidy is going to beand so all of the Bitcoin price changesI think what we call it like the perfectinelasticity of Supply that no matterhow much bitcoin's price changes all ofthatall of the changes in demand getexpressed through the price notexpressed through new Supply issuancebecause Bitcoin Supply issuance cannotchangeand so I think that could be reallyinteresting to see play out right likenot only do we have faster reflexivitybecause we're in the digital age butit's also a reflexivity on thisabsolutely immutable uh perfectly fixedsupplied assetand you can't you know it's kind of likea release valve for the market it's ifthe gold price goes way up we'll let abunch of new gold hits the market andthat sort of brings things to anequilibrium more quickly but that's justnot possible with Bitcoin so thisflywheel effect could bemuch longer lasting potentially and andI'm excited to seeI mean that's I guess you're kind ofkind of like restating the thesis forhyper bitcoinization on that point butit'll be exciting to see what happens inthe marketplace withoutdoes anyone know in that Weimar chartthat was referenced has anyone heard anexplanation for what caused such extremevolatility in such a you know how manyyears that was was that likeit was two years that was two years twoyears so like what's the explanation forhow such was like so you're in Weimarshit's hitting the fan hyperinflationhappening everywherewhat constitutes the change in demandfor something like gold presumably asafe haven during a period like thatwhere people like oh [ __ ] like run togold and then months later dump it andthen run to it again push it even higherand then once later dump itthere was just like a lot of weirdbalance of payments things I rememberit's been a long time since I've readabout it but I remember that likethere were all kinds of crazy ass dealsthe German government was doing likethey like they would barter lumber forlike coal and they would like so theybecause the thing is that everybodydidn't believe in the mark and so Ithink a lot of it was sort of the chainreaction of various uh like nationstates rejecting the mark as a form ofpayment demanding only gold or than themputting something else in in addition tolike this is all the reflex you knoweffed up thing that's going on andeverybody also knew that the Mark wasfailing so they were piling into stocksand gold and everything and like thatthis is just like the giant crazy effedup mess that happens when you start[ __ ] with you know the most basiccommodity of money is that like nothingcan price itself in a meaningful way sothe only thing that you have to dopricing is Extreme volatility[Music]the chart I'm looking at at least is1914 to 1923. okay I I was specificallyjust looking at theyeah this this one that goes from thebottom of at the end of 20 all the wayup to 23. yeah yeahI also think you know one one way tocome to a conclusion about what may havehappened during that time period isthink through what you would do ifBitcoin actually did hit a milliondollars in the next 90 days you woulddefinitely make some moves you would belike I'm probably gonna buy some realestate probably gonna get a bug outlocate you know I'm gonna do some stuffand there would be these waves ofdumping and then re-buying and dumpingand rebuying people would be trying totrade into different things and therewould be a you know reflexive phenomenonbetween the holders of you know uhprecious real estate Etc uh and thenpeople that wanted Bitcoin and that'sthat's probably likely what was going onin Weimar as well yeah I mean theBitcoin chart today it almost looks likethat chart that Rob you just put inthere I mean you look at bitcoin's14-year history and that's what it'sbeen doing you know run up crash run upcrash but it's just the the price keepsgoing up you know higher every time andcrashing a little bit lower and thatseems to be what that chart is you knowso as so many people have remarked on ornoticed lately like Bitcoin seems to bethe only true signal out there in theworld today it's 24 hour you can'tcorrupt it it's just pureit's a pure expression of what ishappening in the market with nomanipulation and no Distortion and so Ithink it's increasingly becoming andwill continue to become like alike a forward signal sort of thing likean early signal as to what is going tohappen in other marketsI mean yeah I I'm just so fascinated atlike how the [ __ ] did we get into ourworld where things are so corruptedmanipulated contorted and upside downthat like Bitcoin is the only realmarket price signal that doesn't haveinstitutional manipulation going like itI'm always just taken aback by how[ __ ] insane it is that we live inthis day and age where like everythingis so thoroughly corrupted that like Iliterally have to trust magic internetmoney as the only thing that's not goingto [ __ ] lie and steal from me likeit's just it's just so bananas I just Iimagine this is that's my great greatgrandfather about it and just being likeyeah yeah man just just commit suicidelike it's time time to go on but don'tdon't do itpoints about how important the way upthe way the global Reserve currency isstructured that is super important thatis sacrosanct there is not a thing inthis world that money doesn't touchmoney touch is everything that's aroundme it touches me it touches you ittouches all of us every single thing inthe entire world so when the money iscorrupted when the money is broken guesswhat so is the [ __ ] world you knowwhat I mean it always comes back to thatpointwell it's amazing how like it it seemsto actually be like a fundamentallinguistic function of that like if youare lying about your base value Assetlike you were going to lie abouteverything yeahum we've beenwe worked on this film series I was likegoing into Carl Young and anyways longshort we started to like see theseparallels between kind of jungianthinking this is uh Mike kill who was onthe show and and mises and Austrianeconomics right they sort of came up atthe same timethey they're contradictory schools tothe mainstream narrativeum and they've both been kind of shunnedby by Academia you know like Academiawent towards post-modernism and awayfrom the Union School in the same wayyou know universities went towardsKeynesian economics and away fromAustrian economicsand one of the things we we try tocrystallize that parallel in this phrasewe said economicsis public psychology and psychology isprivate economicsand so obviously economics being publicpsychology you've got a bunch of Mindswired together with a price signal rightso like one big hive mind you knowallocating serious resources inaccordance with the preferences ofconsumers Etc the psychology one's alittle bit more mysterious but the way Iinterpret that isum you know even an animal is makinglike the leopard laying on the grass orin the tree wherever he's at he'srunning an expected value calculationbefore he does anything right it's notnot to say he's explicitly doing mathbut he's deciding how hungry am I howfast is the gazelle is it injured youknow what's my probability of success sothere's this this economic componenteven to like an end of animal psychologyand so I think that when you say moneytouches everythinglike it's notit's inside and out right likeinternally we're running the softwarecalled money externally we're using itto run the economic system run thepricing system which is one of the mostcommunication most importantcommunication systems in the worldand soI we've we all understand this asbitcoiners I think we all struggle tolike describe it withgreat scientific Clarity but it is thatit's the notion that's captured in ifyou you know break the money break theworld fix the money fix the worldthe fact that we have this economicether that we're all swimming inyou can think of it maybe like a like ablood disease for the socioeconomicsuper organism that we're all a part ofand umyou know we're throwing different wordsat this thing but basically it's moneythat connects us all together rightthe laptop that I'm usinghad inputs from tens of thousands orhundreds of thousands of people thatI'll never meet or know yet I'mcommunicating with them as a consumer ofa MacBook Proso when we corrupt that orwhat do we yeah corrupt I guess it's theonly real word for it we corrupt thatcommunication mediumof course it destroys everything we dolike everything we think all theproducts we produce all the institutionswe createand um I feel like that idea that I'mtrying to get towards is like the bigidea all the bitcoiners want to gush outonto the rest of the world it's likelook guys it's so [ __ ] obviousum but difficult to talk aboutso why it's the Fiat system is sooffensive to so many of us because likeif whether you came into Bitcoin firstor whether you justyou know revered ideals or ethics orvalues like honesty and integrity andhumility and all that kind of stufffirstif that if those are things that you'veyou've valued and you've tried tointegrate into your life and yourperspective and all and embodied invarious ways then when you see this thisFiat system that you're forced to let'ssay interact with at least to somedegree that I think that's why it's sooffensive because as you say Rob I meanthere's an intuitive understanding thatbasically the market is justConsciousness externalized in variousrespects and we're seeing a corruptedConsciousness and we've all put in thework to clarify our Consciousness toconstitute it in a manner that we deemto be most appropriate more most propermost integrated with the the the mostreal things the most truthful thingslet's say and when we see themanifestation of basically the oppositeof that or at least a highly distortedcorrupted version of that out in themarket souh yeah we're so offended by it which isalso why those of us who felt that wayonce the penny dropped for Bitcoin itwas so exciting because we realized thiswas kind of the extension of thatproperly integratedconscious framework let's say out intothe world in the inter-subjective spaceand that's like a mind-blowing thing andthat that's what makes you think thatlike you you can correct so many if youcan correct those problems withinyourselfnow there's a mechanism to correct themin the inter-subjective world by thistool and uh yeah I mean what what couldbe more exciting than that and to yourpoint about you know this kind of beinglike uh you know blood disease or acancer you know Fiat being a blooddisease or a cancer I mean I thinkthat's also why the metaphors work workso well because you know like it's thesick patient where all they're doing istreating symptoms all they're doing isputting more bandages all they're doingis giving more drugs making the pain gogo away all that kind of stuff and whatyou get is a zombie is a vegetable is asomeone who's you know basically just onlife support and that bleeds intoeverything even literal medicine thatwe've seen over the last two years thatgets propagated out in the world whereasthe reverse the actual solution is toheal the act the problem is to get thesystems of the body back into harmonyget them strong again get them into aplace where they can sustain themselvesand growso you know I think the metaphors workall the way up and all the way downbecause it's such a fundamentalDynamic that's at play herewell and this idea of like it being amedical treatment I really like becausewe can see the Advent of Fiat being totreat a disease that you know startedwith essentially JP Morgan needing tobail out the United States governmentand Then followed by a number ofsuccessive crisis crises where like weneeded to have Fiat money in order toscientifically and militarily develop insuch a waybut through that treatment likeessentially we gave ourselves a hugeamount of chemotherapy in order to tryto get through the Great Depression andWorld War one and World War II and bythe end of World War II we found we hadactually killed you know the the bodythat was the state through Fiat money wegot all these crazy technologies thatwere developed but now we were so fardown this path of that not only had thechemotherapy killed our victim and thatwe were keeping them artificially alivethrough a number of medical proceduresbut now carrying that forward thetreatments uh essentially it's likecontinuing to re-up on your heroinaddiction to try to get high and it's uhit's now become so damaging anddetrimental that you know I think if wetalked to somebody in the 1930s aboutthe need for Fiat money and what it wasdoing there there would be moreagreements in hitting and high whereastoday it's just radically no like it'sclearly lying it's clearly not helpfulthere's no need for a state of emergencyto try to save this system whereas atleast in the 1930s we'd go look like wehave to print out money to support theManhattan Project so we can beat theNazis because this is a really largecrisis but then at the end of that wewere like oh [ __ ] we've like destroyedthe entire financing system how are wegoing to address this in a meaningfulway uh and I just think that thathistory is importantto bring this back to Bellagio for asecond you know Bellagio has this veryold framework from like the 2015 era andI don't know how many of you guys werehere then Eric you were for sure uh youknow basically he was saying that youknow uh it's voice versus exit and thatvoice is like you know engaging in thepolitical process and that exit isliterally leaving the system into a newsystem right now the problem with thisframework and I think where Balaji gotit wrong is there's nowhere to exit towe're all trapped we're all trapped andso Bitcoin is actually not exit Bitcoinis actually voice it's the reverse andBitcoin is like Eric described it'schemotherapy for the system it's atransfusion for the system it goesthrough and cleans up the cancer that'sin the system that's what bitcoin'sactually doing every dollar that bouncesaround the world creates a distortionwherever it goes Bitcoins follow thosedollars and clean the distortionswell this has also been my other pointis that uh like everybody you know likebitcoin's apolitical because nobody cancontrol or manipulate or change it andindeed that's what actually makes it themost political thing is because there isno exit anymore there isn't going to bea citadel there isn't going to beBitcoin Nation it's going to be us inour own personal direct politicalstruggles against whatever our ownsystems are whether they're nationstates 20s townsbut it's really about our own insistencesayingFiat money doesn't work it has corruptedeverything it has destroyed our culturesour communities and our families andunless we take the responsibility ofourselves to say no longer will we allowfor this control and power to be givento governments who not only don't have aright to it but have so severely abuseditthat we need to change the Concourse ofhow we understand wealth without usdirectly approaching that question thatwe're just going to keep going throughthe cycles again and again and so I Ithink that's actually something that'sgoing to present itself quite stronglyhere in the next year is the truepolitical aspect of what Bitcoin isI was in Manhattan with a friendrecently and we were talking aboutcitadels and I said look around this isit you know America is the city thoughwell that was exactly you know Balaji Ithink in either in that tweet or in hispresentation you know as part of this uhmillion dollar Bitcoin thing I think healso was like get out of the states nowand I'm thinking like where would yourather be if if shit's gonna go down Imean there's notisn't perfect butthere's places in it that are that arebetter than anywhere else I can identifyin the world unless you're going to golike deep into Patagonia and justcompletely be you know uh off-grid underthe radar all that kind of stuffwell we had a hard hard disagreementabout that because he was like yeah youshould think about getting out and I'mlike no man I've been thinking aboutthis for a long time and like there's areason I'm in the Deep Red Bible BeltChristian South and it's like that isthe place where peopleyou say Taxation and stuff and peoplelike yeah no [ __ ]like and I've got 30 guns at home sayingI've got a big truck and you know likepeople just naturally are disinclined tobuying into that [ __ ] sothat idea of a non-compliant culture Ithink is really valuable but when we saythe states I mean the states obviouslyis a huge placeSan Francisco what are they doing in SanFrancisco I think they're about to payreparations or something like that aswell in a headline yeah I mean like thedifference between San Francisco andTennessee is like is as much of adifference as you can find in the worldalmostby the way you know what's weird rightafter they announced that I found out Iactually have African-American ancestrylike so weird it just the the email hitright after yeahyeah I guess at ancestry.com is on firethese daysis is that is that an actual thing andeven if it were it's it's very like it'snot gonna do that it's it's not going togo through but the fact that they'resitting around debating these basicallyinsane ideasit's crazy it's like sitting I mean dudewe're at the end of an Empire let's faceit how long I go on and like people onTV are talking about like what otherpeople like should people chop off theirdicks should they not Chop off theirdicks should we let the people thatchopped off their dicks compete in womenswimming and I'm like what the [ __ ] ishappening you know what I meanit doesn't make any sense and somehowit's like crept up onto us and it'sbecome a normal part of everyday lifethat we all sit around and talk aboutinane [ __ ] all day long uh and it'sit's a form of nihilism you know but youknow this this is what I was thinkingabout back to the conversation about themonetary system is if and it's just likea simple premise if you don't do yourbest to align with truth or if you don'teven accept the premise that truthexiststhen all you have left over to contendwith is lies deceit delusion all thatkind of stuff so two examples one theone you just gave huddle right like wewere talking about health before and nowlike what does Health mean today wellyou can have someone that's 350 poundsand only eats McDonald's and you knowsomeone will be up there saying that'shealthy you can be healthy that way andthen the the the financial corollarywhich happened recently is you know Idon't know how how broadly it's beenapplied yet but all these Banks rightwith whatever amount of bonds on thebalance sheet and they're way underwaterand then you know with a stroke of a penor policy change the treasury just goesoh no they're not underwater anymore youcan borrow against them at whatever youbought them for like par value rightbecause that's how that's how they'reperforming thisyou know bailout or whatever you want tocall it they're just saying like ohthose bonds that you're 60 percentunderwater on now you're not you'retotally not you can just you can boreout borrow against them like you justbought them at the same price and soit's like if if you're not going tocontend with truth all you have is thatthose lies and you know that's how youget the distortions that's how you getthe the incongruence with with truth andall the different perversions that thatcreates because you either accept truthalign with it to the best of yourability or you lie you delude you erectyou know false structures and I thinkyou know by virtue of well probably formany reasons you know who knows if theFiat system is a cause or an effect ofsome broader cause of that you knowmentality permeating throughcivilization but that's you know that'swhat you get and that's where we seem tobe right now buthey go for it I'm just gonna say Bitcoinis obviously the the remedy to all thatbut we all know that already so you goEricwell so so fiata it's fundamentallyreplacing the truth with anauthoritarian decree it is saying thesethings are fundamentally equal to oneanother and because I am a sovereign youmust eliminate truth and like that isliterally what Fiat money is as they saythis is worth something I have theviolent authority to be able to forcethat upon you and you must accept it andwhen you have that being the Baseline ofthe entire operation of your society andto be clear this isn't just Fiat moneyit is all authoritarian decrees so it'san entire [ __ ] up tax structure thatwe deal with all the regulatory garbageand [ __ ] the complete relegation oflogic itself to be subservient to theseauthoritarian decrees this has [ __ ] upthe world more than anything else and Iam of the opinion it is literally causefor the inability for people to thinkand when I say think I am explicitlyreferring to the ability to apply logicto whatever event is occurringand most people can't do that you knowand that's what the pandemic was allabout it's an authority told mesomething that must be true I will plugthat in place of what my own eyes tellme and to this very day I still seepeople walking around outside with a[ __ ] mask on suffocating themselvesand I want to tear my hair out and Iwant like and I I just want to have areal dialogue with them being like likeis this helping you are are you safer amI safer is the world safer from thisperspective and and because they can'tthink they fundamentally can't get thereand they want to fight you to be likewell you're not listening to theauthorities so you're the bad one andit's like holy [ __ ] you guyshere's where things get Ultracomplicated too Eric because not likethinking is extremely difficult so youmay be able to come to the conclusionthat what you are being told is a lieand then you may reject that right butif you come to the opposite conclusionthat the opposite of the LIE is thetruth that may not also be the caseeither I was thinking about people whohad died during covet like you can thinkabout this on both sides if you were ayou know 65 year old uh obese person whois a conservative and you said I'm notgoing to take that goddamn vaccinebecause the Liberals made it and Goddamn it I'm not doing that and then youended up dead that was your fault andyou had a really hard time thinkingthrough it you were in two separate riskdemos you probably should have taken thevaccine right meanwhile if you were likea young liberal male who was 25 andjacked and fit and then you took sixdifferent boosters and you got amyocardial infarction guess what andthen you end up dying that one's yourfault too and both of these people haderrors in their thinking and thishappens with the Fiat system so yeahit's true that the Fiat system is a lieand and that the people that areperpetuating the Fiat system the theAmerican Elites uh are intent on lyingand gaslighting you all that is true butthe rejection of that system is you knowyou meet a bunch of people who are into[ __ ] coins and they go hey bro you heardabout web 3d5 monkeys and you go oh yeahthat must be obviously fiat's not thething and then you have to come to therational Middle Ground of like 20 000[ __ ] coins are [ __ ] all of the Fiatcurrencies are [ __ ] Bitcoin is theonly thing that's real in the entireworld and that is such a bizarrenon-intuitive conclusion to come to thatlike the collective brain power on thisZoom right now is like 400 IQ and ittook all of us [ __ ] five plus 20 plusCollective years you know five years foryou me to come to this conclusion that'show goddamn difficult it is right soit's not going to be easy for people anda lot of people are going to get harmedin the process unfortunately so that'swhy we've got to save as many as we canthis goes way backstick coining is Fiat as well and to melike this is one of the reasons why Iuse the term crypto sovereignty is thatlikeusing logic to come to the conclusionthat Bitcoin is literally the only thingthat isn't Fiat because it's the onlything that has proof of work baked intoit in such a way that it literallyproves to you through the substance thatit is that it has done the fundamentalwork in order to conclude itself to bepart of the truth that is nature whereas[ __ ] coins there's always something[ __ ] fictionalized about it and so II just find it really interesting andironic that like the literalcryptography that is to be used to provethe work has been done has beencorrupted and extricated in such a waythat now the [ __ ] word itself can'teven refer back to itself in ameaningful way [ __ ] ludicrousyby the way real quick I just realizedwhen I said the collective brain powerwas 400 IQ that makes us all [ __ ] soI'm gonna say like he must be 640 IQ 600IQ as well average roll effortsumso just to like I mean because sometimeswords we're always saying Bitcoin istruth and freedom likeit is sad like these words have beendestroyed basically from the currentFiat Paradigm right you say these wordsand people are like oh this guy isI don't knowum arrogant or like if you say you'retrying to speak the truth or live intruth it sounds like either apost-modernist weird thing likeeveryone's living in their own truth oryou're some kind of have some kind ofMessiah complex right like oh you'vefigured out the truth everyone everyoneelse is speaking a lieum which is one of the reasons I like Ithink Jordan Peterson's chapter right hesayswhat's the rule don't tell the truth orat least don't lie I think is that thetitle of that chapter yeah yeah and soone of the things I think about here isif you just consider a lie as amisrepresentation right it's not anaccurate message about what it'sintended about what it's intended torepresentthat's what printing money is right it'syour when you create new money out ofnothing you're representing to the worldthat there's there are more goods andcapital available than there really areright you're uh tier demisra wrote agood piece on this I think he called theprinting of money something like thecreation of illusory Goods like it justcreates this image of goods and capitalavailable in the world as a nominalexpansion in the money supply thatdoesn't actually existso of course this like propagatesthrough a distorted price signalwhich is like destroying people'seconomic rationality right this is whatcontributes to misallocation of capitalover borrowing mispricing of risk theboom and bus business cycle all of thesethingsbecause we're propagating a false signalthrough the printing of money and you'reyou're quite literally in that situationbecause a price is an exchange ratiobetween two goodsyou're destroying economic rationalityright sothere's it's not surprising to me thatwhen you destroy this Collectivepsychological rationality that we calleconomic rationality that you'recreating feedback into individualrationality individual psychology thatthat illusory the creation of illusoryGoods to the expansion of money isactually [ __ ] people up right it'smaking us dumb and or evil I think justby participating in a motivationalsystem that is Fiatand soI have a question I guess sort of aboutthis to Eric I thinkum there's this quote that politicalpower emanates from the barrel of a gunI think it was Mao or mal said thatclearly that's not the political powerof Bitcoin though because there's nobarrel of a gun back in Bitcoin so whatwas Mao wrong about that or where whatis the source of bitcoin's politicalpowerit it's actually the inversion of thatbarrel of guy like it it negates thebarrel of the gun because now you couldyou can kill somebody but you can't gettheir Bitcoin and that that'sfundamentally different in addition tolike we're like bitcoin's extremelyrudimentary right now you know like itis we literally have the units and wecan pass them around but like we don'thave strong sophisticated dead man Keyscontracts or any of these other moreesoteric ideas and to me like as thisplays out more it will offer a counterto that thesis because also uh Maloriginally said that it's funny that youbrought this up because I looked up thequote like two days ago and noworiginally presented it in the 1928 uhcommon term that they had for China andthen this was emphasized throughout hisphilosophy later on and and so like theythey talk about that quote and about howthe Communist Party always needs to ownthe guns and it needs to push that ontothe whole of society so that likethey're the purveyors they're the onlypurveyors of legitimate violence and andso to me what Bitcoin does is itdelegitimizes all violence through itsdirect form in the world and that VIlike the relationship between violenceand economics is now fundamentallybroken in a way that has never beenaccomplished in all of human history andto me like that's the political thingthat inverts everything that this makesa totally new form of what like what Iwould say is that this reopens the poliswhich is the the fundamental politicalform that ancient Greeks and Romans hadaccess to and that was the that was thelife that was available outside of thehome life to be created by people and tome since the end of World War One thepolis has been completely shut down andforbidden from anyone to access becauseof the forms of statism that we've hadand now that we have Bitcoin there'sthis new form of the political that'srising up that isn't about voting thatisn't about nation states that isn'tabout these forms and organizations thatwe've classically called political so tome like that's that's really what cryptosovereignty is about is that it fulfillsthe idea of cutting off the king's headin a very new and novel way that we hadnever seen beforethrough the ability to hide and keep asecret in the digital sphere in a waythat was never available to all ofhumanity before and will be available toall of humanity moving forward so thisis why I think like essentially we're atwhat I think is the apexal moment of notonly politics technology but essentiallylike this is the transition of humanityfrom being a type zero to a type 1civilization and what that means for usas conscious beings as people with Soulsas human beings that want to create abetter Community together individualsthat want to return to truth like it'sit's very Cali yugic in terms of like uscoming to fulfill all of the destiny ofman so if things begins if you look ifyou look back through historyessentially anybody that ignored therules and then chose violence that's awin that's a win and you get power fordoing that right now that we we haveBitcoin if you ignore the rules and youchoose violence lose that's a lose-loseyou know what I mean and so it I totallyagree with everything Eric said likeit's a that's why it's such a big dealso I have a question I I talked to a guyum that's involved with the libertarianparty here in the United States and Ididn't know anything about this historyI don't know if you guys did butapparently they had a takeover recentlywhere the libertarian party had yeah themises caucus they basically reclaimedthe libertarian partyas I understand it um to be moreconsistent with the traditional valuesof libertarianism whereas over the pastcouple of decadesthe libertarian party had drifted intolike a pseudo you knowleft-wing thing I'm not exactly surethe point is they werethey are interested in integrating moreclosely with the Bitcoin community andactuallytrying tomake more of these grassroot efforts oflike getting people into local officethat are bitcoiners and instead oftrying to just like run a Libertariancandidate for president that you know isgoing to lose because it's either goingto be red or blue and you're gonna havethis other guy get one percent they'relike throwing that whole strategy out ofthe window and really trying to focus onthe Grassroots long-term gameso what I just wanted to hear your guysthoughts on like what is it because Ihate [ __ ] hate politics like I don'tthink there's anything I hate more butwell now that I think about it thatwe're we are thesewe're stepping into our roles in historyright it's we're not just Spectators ofHistory we're now participantsincreasingly we're participants asBitcoin does its thingis it incumbent upon us to take thatyou know nascent influence or power orwhatever we have and try to actually dosomething Grassroots in the U.S if theUS is the Citadel as we're sayingearlierI think like just a piece of practicaladvice if you're part of the libertarianpartyum Rebrand to the Bitcoin party andrepent for all the stupidity over thelast few years and if you think I'm ayoung cocky douchebag yeah I am and wewe subsumed and superseded your entireideology we're the only practical formof libertarianism in the whole [ __ ]world if you can't see that you're toostupid to do anything go [ __ ] yourselfbut also get a problem I'll talk to youin the background okay I'll let you knowyeah I I mean I like the thing that ledme to bitcoin and why I'm still herelike I'm an anarchist through andthrough like [ __ ] the state from top tobottom I absolutely hate this idea of anorganizational form that involveswhining and getting people that Ifrankly think are worthless on board toyour cause simply because they can Marka tallyum I'm very very interested inGrassroots Grassroots movements in termsof getting Bitcoin in the hands ofpeople and uh last time I was on uhMarty's show I had a long dialogue withhim about the only thing I'm interestedin contemporary politics inaccomplishing is passing Article 5legislation to 35 different states inorder to amend the Constitution of theUnited States directly outside andBeyond the purview of both the presidentof the United States or Congressionalapproval and this is a theoretic waythat states can directly ratify theConstitution by circumventing thefederal government that is the onlything I'm interested in is passingArticle 5 legislation that explicitlyputs in the United States Constitutionas an amendment that Bitcoin is thefundamental form of money that theUnited States government will useoutside of that I have zero interestbecauseto me politics is the most nihilisticform of politics that exists because itsays that you as a lone individual areabsolutely worthless and can do nothingwhatsoever to change or modify thesystem and I reject that Holy soI'm somewhat torn on on that issue Imean I I think the libertarian party isis pretty pathetic as well and like froma practical perspective if thatlike it's because so like ideology andphilosophy doesn't seem to have thatrigid of guard rails anymore so why notrun so I'll put it this way why not runin the Republican party and just belibertarian yeah there's a lot of thatthese days I mean like DeSantis is kindof that way and ramaswamy is kind ofthat way like I mean who cares you knownobody cares what you call yourself allthe people only care like the ideas ofyour spouse so everyone knows that likethe third party is never going to get inso why not justyou know play ball in the in one of thetwo and then enact whatever [ __ ]policies you want if you if you get inyou know that seems to be what everyonedoes anyways but I'm somewhat torn onEric's point is likelike I get it like you know the state iscorrupt and irredeemable and you knowdriven by violence and all that kind ofstuffand illegitimate whatever in many waysbut it's still the case that it erects atype of order for the world that weexist Within and it's still the casethat that order has gradations ofquality let's say and so let's bringlet's bring it down to more of like amunicipal or local levelI see Eric smiling but just just thepoint being that is it better and I knowyou're you're giving tacit approval ifyou take this approach and all that jazzso this is a question I don't I don'treally know where I stand on this but isit not better if you have someone whoyou would broadly construe to be moreprincipled more ethical more competentand all that kind of stuff in a positionwithin that system of order thenwhatever the alternative might be andI'm open to hearing your thoughts onlike what the alternative to peoplecoordinating together to establish acertain form of order might beI mean I can answer first but my myanswer is pretty much insane soumyou know but so Carl Schmidt he talksabout something called the cachion whichis a classic idea of that whichwithholds that that which holds backtotal uh like disorder and lawlessnessand that which makes sure that theAntichrist can't present himself to theworld because that then initiates theapocalypse I think the state in its formtoday is the cation and once that thepower of the state is generally removedor the way that I see it it's going tobe superseded by technology that thencreates the opening for the apocalypseto present itself and for the finalstruggle for Humanity to redeem itselfpresents itself which is only offeredthey can fully engage in theirsubjective decision in order to createsomething different so like I prettymuch want to destroy everything to getthe the table totally clean so that thenpeople can make a choice for themselvesabout what they want to do going forwardand so like I essentially that thisphilosophy is deeply accelerationist ofthat like I not only want to destroy thestate but I want to accelerate things tosuch an extent that we arrive at theapocalypse itself so that we can movethrough it and I think that's all comingto fruition which is some of my crazy[ __ ] what's on the other side of theApocalypseuh a kind of peace that we neverimagined humans could even haverevelation of knowledge by the way rightnot end of the world yeah or re orre-revealing or something it's not youknow fire and brimstone like like peopleoften imagine it to be but so Eric putsome meat on that yeah I I think thatthe the possibility of a hyper bitcoin'sworld where everybody truly understandsand rocks what this means and isintegrated into society I think thatthat produces a kind of globalized worldpeace in a way that we have never seenbefore and that we could never evenimagine before becauseany new materials where access to allsorts of new stuff oh sorry of course my[ __ ] shitty internet essentially fora sec yeahyeah exactlyum essentially this opens Humanity up todevelopments that weren't possible whenwar and violence has always been aneconomic incentive that's available thatis off the table now so like when youhave a war going on in a place likeUkraine right now that would absolutelydecimate both sides horrifically becauseof the amount of economic uhI I don't know the right word but likeessentially because they have to take onso much of that economic load themselvesand they can't just do it throughtaxation and Fiatum and I mean and again I get this is acrazy idea no I know but I want to fleshit out a bit because you know maybe it'slegit but I'm assuming you're notproposing that you know some Utopia lieson the other side of the Apocalypsebecause I don't think you're that naiveto suggest something like that so inthis theoretical place or timewhat are the problems that you thinkwould still plagueindividuals or society and how wouldthey be resolved or managedwell human stupidity is Limitless likeall other things and I I think in allhonesty most stuff looks relativelysimilar I think what ends up happeningis that the state has to negotiate withpeople much much more than it everexpected I think that they will actuallyhave to have total fiscal responsibilityin a way that they've never had before Ithink that this will create a new formof civics where people are engaged in avery different way I think thatessentially the entire governmentalstructure inverts itself to wherecommunities become the most powerfulpolitical entities followed by countiesfollowed by States and Then followed bya federal governmentum you know people are gonna do dumb[ __ ] they're gonna lose Keys they'regoing to leverage uh but I think thebiggest one is is that no longer isthere going to be an ability for thereto beviolent Fiat decrees that can have powerover people I think for the most partmost things need to be openly and uh inGoodwill negotiated in a way thatcurrently people just force thingsthrough so a little opaque there but I Ican see that for sure but going back tothis like pure no government premiselike presumably in that place and timeand people will still want to coordinateand people will will still be an elementof trust in the system there'll likelystill be an element of delegating someform of your authority to other peoplein some capacity so I get your pointthat like the state won't be able toenforce it in the way that it currentlydoes but is not that a form of politicsyou know just people getting together tocoordinate in in me in ways that don'tnaturally happen economically andbecause you say like some people arestupid some people are old some peopleare withdrawn whatever there will be adelegation to others family memberstrusted friends institutions whatever toperhaps make decisions for them be aproxy vote in some kind I mean maybe[ __ ] homeowners association orsomething you just say hey I don't givea [ __ ] enough like you you vote for mebro yeah you think that's associatedyeah and I think that's the way it'll gois that instead of us almost having thisuh vertical structure of a singulargovernment it's going to be thisgigantic explosion of there beinghundreds if not thousands of variousrelationships that all sort of Interlinktogether in various ways and this isreally what anarchosyndicalism is isthat essentially people organize ontheir own Accords according to whateverthe organizational needs are whetherthat's uh a water Collective a garbageCollective and and I want to be clearthe organizational getting through tothis place this is insanely messy andit's only through how messy and crazy itall is that people are going to startchoosing the Alternatives so like thethe downslope on this is gonna it goesreal deep sure all right one lastquestion then I'll I'll stop but um inthis placewhere do you think power mostconcentrates right because in this hyperBitcoin ice world power gets disperseddramatically and so you know all thethings that we typically talk about thethe benefits of distribution of powerand authority and that kind of stuff butas far as you've thought about you knowthis potential future where is it thatpower either you know could potentiallyconcentrate and how to what degree wouldthat be deleterious to the circumstanceI think the way it concentrates and andI don't think it would I I think thereare negotiations but essentially like Ithink this returns man to a place ofhonor and dignity and being your wordand that like uh what a man says andessentially his quote proof of work thatis going to be the place that peoplegather power and so that when somebodysays something and follows through withthat when a man proves himself to be aman of his word that people are going toconjugate behind those individuals andthat we're going to see something thatlooks much moreum and this is like a really scary wordso for some peopleclose fascismum and likefascismfascism in the classical sense of theworda Roman dictator who chooses to take acome Accords of the laws for himself youknow what we what what Hitler Mussoliniand uh Franco represented was a reallymalformed uh cult version of thepersonality of that whereas if you lookat the classic Roman fascist who comesfrom the word fashi because they werethe ones that controlled the the axesthat were used to be able to implementlaw they become the individual thatelectrifies it in an accident and Ithink one of the problems is that welive in a world where I can be apolitician do a bunch of super corruptup [ __ ] and people are likethat that political system it's socorrupt no like I'm the piece of [ __ ]like chop my head off and make me anexample to the rest of the people sothat when people go and do [ __ ] upstuff like this there's a great examplefor it and again like I think that's oneof the other class things is us movingaway from capital punishmentparticularly for political crimes Ithink has been a huge detriment tosociety you know like it I would reallylove if when people violated the law ina political way that like you know wedrew and quarter them and we made itclear that like you will be violentlypunished for the ways that you abuse ourpolitical systemto that well I was just concentrationthinking through what you asked and Iwasit seems to me like so maybe one of thefundamental contributions of Bitcoin isthat this notion of power we have todaywhich is a very another one of thosewords right it's just loaded is it arewe talking about political power are wetalking about physical power are wetalking about legal powerEtc Bitcoin sort of simplifies the wholething it's just like it's purchasingpower right who has the purchasing powerkind of decides where they go what rulesets they live by who they interact withEtcso maybe that's one thing is likeBitcoin just sort of simplifies thiswhole notion of political power down tojustmaybe not just purchasing power butmostly purchasing power at least makepurchasing power the most important formofpower as a determinant of socialorganization I think because violence isnotit's not profitable or it's lessprofitable as a result it's the orangerule he who has the Bitcoin makes therules the orange rule exactly beautifuland so if in that world I'm just kind oflikeThinking Out Loud here wouldn't power orat least purchasing power would thenconcentrateinto the hands of the elders and theinnovators basicallynow the elders I'm thinking if we're inthis new world where there's a lot ofinnovation presumably we're extendingthe human lifespan more right we'realreadythere's a lot of efforts toward this endI'm not a transhumanist I don't believein living forever but I do think humanscan keep expanding the human lifespanum so obviously those people that live along time would have a the longest uhperiod through which to accumulate andpreserve purchasing power so they wouldhave a lot of the power in the worldbut then also the innovators right thepeople that are actually deliveringthese productivity enhancing solutionsto the human racewould win a lot of purchasing power inthis kind of entrepreneur-led societysoI I mean I'mthinking I guess out loud that thatpower would accumulate in the hands ofthose two cohorts which seems like agood thing right you've got old wiserich peoplekind of uh living by example for youngerpeople to follow and then you havepeople that are delivering usefulTechnologiesum as also serving as an example foryoung people to follow and I guess wehave some semblance of that today andkind of capitalistic pseudo-capitalisticU.S compared touh societies of yesteryear but rightlike we have the Elon Musk and people ofthe world that are more entrepreneursthey've accumulated power through theirentrepreneurial effortsum but we still have a lot of status tooright like the richest guy in the worldis Putin I thinksoBitcoin just moves us further along thatcurve to where the people that reallyhave the power in the world arethe old and the whys or the or the theInnovative I supposewould be my hypothesisI think the place I always come to whenI when I think about this kind of stuffis that umthe nuclear warheads never go away andthe person that is in control of them isthe state because they can basicallyjust say I'll nuke you I'll nuke me onnuke everybody give me taxes [ __ ] youright that's a problem another problemis Bitcoin can't prevent a sovereignfrom issuing a currencythere's just no way to prevent that andas we've seen over time humans love todo that it's uh you know it's alwaysexpedient gets you out of short-termproblems and the people that put asystem like that in place they don'thave to deal with the consequences everbecause they die right and then theyleave their you know children andgrandchildren to deal with theconsequences so I think we're movinginto a place where the state is going tobe supplanted by the network right I I'min alignment with Bellagio about thatum but I don't think the state's goingto go away entirely or dissolve I thinkit'll be like the Catholic Church youknow like the Catholic church wassupplanted by the nation-state thenation state is supplanted by theBitcoin Networkum but the Catholic church is still hereit's still a force in the world it's notwhat it once was but it had grown to youknow a cancerous scale where it washarming people and I think the modernand you know version of the nation statehas also grown to a cancerous scalewhere it's mainly doing harm to peopleand so once things get like that youknow you basically have a new systemthat emerges and it knocks the oldsystem uh back in its place but it neverfully goes away there's always vestigesof itI I would just say two things one is uhI do think that Bitcoin will actuallydeal with the nuclear warhead issue byas States go totally broke and theystruggle desperately to find money theywill have to they will have to convertthey'll have to convert their nuclearwarheads into becoming nuclear reactorswhich I was reading a pretty significantamount of nuclear warhead material canbe used to create a nuclear reactor so Ithink they'll go in that direction and Iagree that the state won't go away Ithink Federal governments are going todwindle precipitously in power and Ithink that we're going to get uha renewal of sort of the American dreamVisa these states like I think statesare going to assert themselves againstthe federal government in the comingcrisis I think the federal government isgoing to lose and I think that in thatstates are going to become quite Dynamicand Innovative and in addition to thatwe're going to get places like Texasthat are just going to straight up makeBitcoin into a currency for their stateyou know and I think that that's goingto have a very positive General affectthe nuclear warheads thing this isalways one that that I was like man [ __ ]how does that problem get solved butright I think the incentive to mineBitcoin is actually a pretty decent liketheory about how that problem getssolved like people are going to be likelet's convert this [ __ ] and you knowwith with the Advent of small nuclearreactors and stuff like let's convertthis this material to my Bitcoin that'swhere our primary incentive is and youknow does the stockpile get dwindleddown as a result of those incentives isit just another instance of theincentives that are emerging around thisradical form of inter-subjective Truthis able to dissolve the manifestationsof intersubjective distortion and powerand lies and delusion and all the stuffwe've been talking aboutjust carrying an inventory of nuclearwarheads that's a huge expense just tomaintain that inventory but if theredoes I didn't know that this is firstI've heard of this but if there's a waythen to instead convert that inventorywhich is costing you money into moneythat seems like a path some people wouldfollow go aheadoh no I was just gonna say I so I agreewith Eric too in the in the sense thatyou know back to bitcoin being like ayou know a cleaning infection of thecurrent system or like chemotherapy forthe current system I think Bitcoin youknow uh restarts the engine that isAmerica and if we go back to our earlyAmerican history all the way back to1776 America is an experiment indecentralization always has been alwaysshould be and somewhere along the last300 years we lost thatum and you know it would be amazing ifBitcoin could help us get back to thatand I do think you saw like a little bitof that during the pandemic wheredifferent states were saying no we'renot going to comply with that and youknow Texas is now enshrining the rightto use uh digital currency in into theirconstitution or not their constitutionbut you know they're they're uh puttingit into law and so I do think it's goingto be really interesting if you have uhStates pushing back against the federalgovernment and it depends on which stateyou're in right if California wants tosecede you'd be like sit down [ __ ]you're not going anywhere if Texas wantsto succeed you'd be like Texas let'stalk about this man don't do anythingcrazy bro okay well Texas is also thethe only state that explicitly has it intheir constitution that they have aright just a session and that that wasnever fully brought up as a predicationthat happened in the Civil War and theanswer is not all worship went wrong wasthe Civil War and just how the Civil Warplayed out on a number of levels becausewith the legal ramifications and alsothat was the first time that the UnitedStates explicitly issued a fiat currencyfor the purpose of Waryeah absolutelycan you go on a bit more on that Ericwas that 1813 what was wasn't theresomething that happened in 18 years thatprecipitated that that was the collapseof the the First Bank of the UnitedStates with it which Andrew Jackson Ithink it was 1914 maybeum but heno I'm sorry Andrew Jackson came laterwith the collapse of the Second Bank ofthe United States the First Bank in theUnited States was a problem and thatcollapsed in 1812 and they renewed it in1814 I think under Monroe who then uh itcame up for Renewal under Jackson herefused to do it and then moving forwardwe had the wild bat the Wildcat bankingera that lasted all the way until 1862where essentially the union wasstruggling in their Conquest against theConfederacy and this is when Lincolnmade the decision that they were goingto issue greenbacks which is where theterm comes from and greenbacks were aFiat con they were they were a Fiatmoney that was explicitly issued toraise money for the Civil War so thatthey could fight them because the CivilWar is super interesting becauseessentially like the union just like[ __ ] up repeatedly over and over andthen I had like Generals in power wholike totally sucked ass at what they didyou have a chance to look at GeneralMcClellan he's like he's mcclellan'slike the the biggest [ __ ] whoeverexisted to ever command an army likethere's a great quote where wheremcclellan's like looking at a riverbeing like Oh like we like can't crossthis this is too bad and custardliterally rides his horse out into themiddle of the river he goes McClellanit's this deep we can totally go over ithe's likeoh it's right hereLincoln kept sending McClellan ladderslike would you fight you goddamn [ __ ]and he's just like not today I was Iwoke up feeling weird man and it's TheVibes are off dude I can't you know yeahGrant's just like let's get [ __ ]drunk and do this yeah exactly they werereplaced him with an alcoholic for thatvery reasonto Grant though he didn't drink when hewas fighting he just drank afterwards todeal with his PTSD so I don't want tomake it sound like he was a bad Soldierhe was just [ __ ] up as a human fromwhat he did John John may not know thisin uh as a Canadian but you know in theSouth people still refer some peoplestill refer to the Civil War as the warof Northern aggression because the Southseceded basically and we're like we'reour own goddamn Nation we're gonna dowhatever the hell we please and thenorth was like the hell you are and thatcaused the Civil War and so you know ifif we do start to see the states pushback very strongly against the federalgovernment it's very likely there willbe another uh Civil War although I don'tI don't know how a civil war looks inthe digital age I think that's a reallyinteresting questionum I had an episode I had a series ofDominic frisbee about this he wrote thatbook daylight robbery which is aboutlike the history of Taxation it's asuper interesting bookthere's one episode with civil war inthe title but he describes how it was awar fought over taxation like basicallythe South wasI hope I have the numbers right we wereone-third of the population but we'repaying four-fifths of the taxessomething like that like we were payinga disproportionate share of the tax basefor the the collective Union the Northand South together and so the South waslike you know tried to secede peacefullyand finally just said [ __ ] you likewe're out and essentially it was Lincolngoing to war to reclaim the tax baseum which is which is such a weirdepisode to go through with Dominicbecause I'm reflecting on all of myindoctrination in public school aboutthe Civil War as he's telling me thisand it's like no we were told it wasthis moral Crusade against slaveryit's like no it had [ __ ] absolutelynothing to do with that it was just abusiness deal basically rightyou're saying wasn't it well as I saidat some point in the war like if I couldend this war without freeing the slavesI would do so there's some point likethat attributed to Lincoln I believeI've heard that yeah well it's reallyinteresting because like this is one ofthe reasons that becauseso like Lincoln essentially committedtreason in the way that he started theCivil War and the reason why he neededto be so forceful with passing the 14thamendment was because that thenessentially recused him from thattreason because now he could point andsay look it's an amendment they wereviolating the Constitution I as thepresident had a right to assert theConstitution over the southern statesfor this reason but that's only when hecame to the realization as a lawyer thatlike he had fundamentally committed atree then and if he ended the Civil Warwithout that there he could be put ontrial for treason as well you know andso not to say that slavery wasn't acomponent of it because like that'sdefinitely one of the reasons whyNortherners were more aggressive towardsasserting that but like that you know inthe same way that like uh like thepandemic and all the responses wereabout like saving her health yeah thatwas like 38th on the list but it wasabout like all this [ __ ] money onnumbers 1 through 38 that was the realreason why so it's it's kind of like Ifeel real good now that we can be likewe loved all the black people and we'dliberated them but let's never have anydialogue in public school at all aboutall the [ __ ] white Irish slaves thatwere in the United Statesit's it's like how Putin's Putin'sjustification for invading Ukraine islike we're deoxifying Ukraine it's likeyeah sure sure the [ __ ] you are that hasnothing to do with why you're over thereyeah but it's also on the other sideit's like Putin's only invading Ukrainebecause he's evil that's why and that'swhy you should be again are you an evilperson no you're good aren't you so youshould be against it I mean theeverything is so uh watered down orobfuscated or like black ostensibly orframed to be black and white when it youknow almost nothing is I mean why wouldwe ever even suspect that we would knowthe motivations of most things thathappen in the world think about whenanything you've ever done in terms oflike a business project or a workproject whatever like you you talk itout not that you're intentionally beingsecret but you talk it out in the BoardRoom with your partners whatever andthen you go and execute in the world andit's not like everyone knows all of yourmotivations and it's just it's so absurdto think that we well I mean again thisis the the part of the critique thatwe've been living against the currentworld as it is is that everything is sodumbed down so simplified and one justis so trusting from about listening tothose authority figures you know one ofthe things just on the the Civil WarFront that I found fascinating I watchedthat Ken Burns uh documentary like 10part series whatever really great reallysuper good yeah well I mean it's onAmerican history or something it'sreally just it's just called it's justcalled the Civil War by Ken Burns verygood oh now I've seen him on umCNN and stuff lately and you know he'sgetting on with some uh perspectiveslet's say that I'm not I don't fullyagree with but the work itself I thoughtwas phenomenal and one of the thingsthat struck me there because I I didn'treally know much about the Civil Warprior to that film but you know thesedays you know the turn down uh Robert ELee statues like all over the [ __ ]place right because oh racist bad guywhatever I was just struck by how badasshe was like he it's he he was anincredible leader and like a very youknow ethical and and he didn't enter thewar because he like wantedum you know wanted on the side ofslavery let's say he was from Virginiaand his primary loyalty was to Virginiaand he was like well Virginia is part ofthe South and you know so I'm going toprotect my my homeland I'm gonna protectwhere I'm from and my people and myfamily and stuff so okay I guess I'm onthis side of things and I and he wasjust he was such an honorable characterand to see him now like the theinversion of that presumably if I'm ifmy assessment is correct wherebyeveryone's just you know treating him asa Hitler type character and erasing himfrom historyum it's just ridiculous and it alsospeaks to this thing that we do when wecharacter assassinate people isif anyone has any flaw that's currentlyin the crosshairs of a culture or acountry or whatevernowadays you want to just eradicate themyou want to get rid of them instead ofsaying like one recognizing nobody's[ __ ] perfect nobody so start fromthat premise and what follows from thatis okay some people are gonna everyone'sgonna have good characteristicsadmirable characteristics ones that youmight want to mimic in some way or oryou know adopt and ones that you want toignore dismiss what have you and shouldwe not assess things in that way andthen look at how they were able toembody the good characteristics thatthey did and learn from those you don'thave to adopt all the the bad ones youcan recognize them even and and analyzewhy you know how come they didn'testablish a better balance but we havethis you know this culture where it'slike if something finds itself in thecrosshairs of the existing narrativeyou're banished immediately and againthe last two years of covert there's abillion examples ofof how that's that's taken place and I Ilook forward to a period in educationand all that kind of stuff where we canbe more Discerning with how we analyzethe characters of History not justglorify the military leaders and notjust dismiss like the the baddies and wejust we look at character traits and andactions they took and we really try tounderstand and analyze them so that wecan better adopt or embody them in ourown lives and recognize when we're notrecognize when we're veering too muchinto the to the realm of those behaviorsthat we would be critical of you knowand and just be more conscious of it allgenerally but uh yeah Robert E Lee was ayou know kind of made me crystallizethat point in my mind when I watchedthat documentary because he seemed likea pretty badass dude I mean on on yourpoint about rejecting you know likeheretical characters like that that'ssomething that's like led me in myresearch that's been really powerfulbecause like but like Schmidt I thinkshould have straight up been hung it inthe Nuremberg trials and like hit andHeidegger was obviously a shitty personand the hilarious thing is about theirphilosophies getting integrated intoNazism there's no philosophies haveabsolutely nothing to do with nothing ofthem they were both just [ __ ]opportunists and that was the right timeand they were both burned horrificallyby their [ __ ] opportunism you knowSchmidt like Goring literally went afterSchmidt and made sure that he couldn'thave any more advancements in hiscareers and same thing with Heidegger hewent and presented his philosophy asbeing part of Nazism when it wasanything but and later they both had totry to recuse themselves from it theycouldn't do it and because of the waythat they had quote sullied themselvesthey created the opening forpost-modernism and philosophy which isjust led us off into a [ __ ] insaneDirection which I want to be clear likethere is some value to it but most ofit's [ __ ] gobbley gluke that that Idon't find valuable at all and it's justit's really offensive to me that youknow in the same reason like I've I'veread Lenin I've read Mao I've readHitler they all uh Hitler actuallydoesn't have anything interesting to sayit's like a pretty rudimentary and dumb[ __ ] philosophy but both Lennon andMao have reallyvaluable things to say from theperspective of what a sociopath who'spursuing power wants you know and likelike it's really interesting forphilosophies he's pretty much like yo ifyou want to be a communist like getcomfortable with killing people likeyou're gonna have to kill a lot ofpeople and if you're not interested inthat don't read this book it's not foryouyou know and it's really incredible tosee that thatpeople don't understand how dangerousthat that ideology is because theyreject reading any of it as opposed topulling out the Salient points that canallow for them to critique it in such away that that make it a valuablecritique so yeahI I dug into the effectivedoes it seemed like there was a crisisof confidence happening in in the EAmovement right like oh man we let thisguy in our inner ranks and he was a badguy blah blah blah you dig a LittleDeeper one layer below the surface theonly problem they have with Sam is thathe got caught literally none of themhave a problem with any of his behaviorthe thinkers over there in EA they don'thave a single problem with it they likethis kind of behavior you know what Imean by the mean stuff right yeah I meanthat's that's what characterizes so muchof this if if you believe stronglyenough in the ends that they're validvirtuousrighteous whatever then so many peoplejustify any means to achieve those endsI mean again that's on display [ __ ]everywhere in our world todayby the way the correct thing to do do iswhat Nietzsche did which was just sitout Nazism just go go to the country andpretend like it's not happeningI was just reminded I brought this quoteup yesterday on this thing thatum and you just quote that everythingthe state has is stolen everything itsays is a lieI mean that just captures it sonicely my estimation like all of thesewe were talking about the Civil War likewhat we learn or what I learned about itin school in public school in thesouthern us was there's this moralit was a moral camouflage in retrospectright it's like oh we were this thenorth was crusading against the South toredeem these enslaved people it was amoral Crusade butwhen you start looking at all of thosenarratives with the benefit of uh Iguess the elucidation that occurs goingon the Bitcoin Rabbit Hole you start tosee that it's all just these differentmoral camouflages that are being put onto justify the lies and the theft of thestateandum that's kind of a bitter pill toswallow but I get and maybe this iswhereI haven't read post-modernismI've read a little bit of uh lacan Ithink is his name which I'm not surehe's considered a post-modernist or notand I've read some nichebut it it does seem to me like thelowest common denominator motivation forpeople is like wealth property powerright where at the end of the day we'rewe're animals trying to accumulateterritoryand umyeah I just think that sort of that isclarifying I don't want to say thatyou know again Jordan Peterson gets offon this I was saying that thepostmodernist view of the world is thatall of our social institutions ourpremise on Power and he thinks that'swrong right there's this other higherpursuit of human cooperation the logosEtcand I agree with that but I think thatagain it's maybe the confusion is rootedin that word power when when I invokethat word I see it asthere's a political sense to the wordand there's a physical sense to the wordand the physical sense is well we'removingmore watts per unit time or Watts rightenergy per unit timewhereas the political sense is more likeAuthority who gets to tell who what todoand soagain having not read a lot of thepost-modernists it does seem that thatis approximately correct to me that ifyou consider power and it's in anon-ambivalent way both the physics andthe political sense of that does seem tobe the primary motivation of humanbeings we're either trying to get morewealthy satisfy our wants get moreproperty or or perhaps trying toestablish ourselves at a higher peckingorder in the hierarchy which issomething more like political powerum that that's clarifying right it cutsthrough a lot of the ideological[ __ ] and you don't need to buy ityou don't need to subscribe to oneideology versus the other if you justlook at us as a bunch ofanimals playing imaginary with oneanother trying to gain more territoryso well that's the that's the transitionas you know like we Aristotle said youknow man is the animal with politics orman is that the animal with language andso it's pretty clear to me that likewe'rewe're in this transitory phase wherewe're we're leaving that animality ofourselves and trying to become somethingelse but we're still in between and sowe're still dealing with all thisviolence all this inability to bridgethe gap between what we say and do andthatit is in the pursuit of these things andthese questions that it literally startsto transform us you know like I think Ithink before we came into Bitcoin therewere all these questions but it's onlythrough the ruminating and chewing on itthat like it's brought us deeper anddeeper and through bringing us deeperit's starting to affect and change us aswell because when we reflect on allthese things we start to realize thatlike they're they're not these thiledoff things that don't have anyconnections to each other that they'reactually real and that part of theseforms of power is truly knowledge itselfand understanding how that knowledgegives us power directly and how we usethe knowledgethat is power to directly influence theworld itself and that's something that'spretty different from the classicalworld is that even if you had thatknowledge there were still fundamentallimitations around all the differentthings that one could do with it whereasnow we have a lot more potentiality Iwonder so uh this episode that I didwith Jeff Booth in Jackson Hole come outthis week I think Monday or Tuesday it'sprobably one of the my favorite thatI've ever recordedand he went into the dangers ofexclusionary language I don't thinkthat's exactly how he termed it but youknow he's always talking about the USversus them Paradigm it's very easy toslip into that right like we're doing itright now rightoh people in the market is good thestate is bad it's like well really thestate is comprised of people and so isthe market and it's not that black orwhite even though our language may makeit seem that way so I wonder if we areI wonder how much of that reality I meanI think his this General argument isthat you're kind of energizing thatreality when you speak about it in thoseterms yeah so when you say like ohthere's good guys bad guys or whateverthe US versus them dichotomy is you'reactuallyyou're actually creating you're givingyou're breathing life into it just byspeaking about it that way whereas thereality is no we're all interactingthere's a continuumuh between us you know although the theindividual isreal in a sense right we have a physicalbounded reality we're also influenced bywho we're around we're a product of ourenvironment et cetera et ceteraso I again I get trapped in this likefeedback loop or you're not sure if isit because we're talking about it it'smaking it so or because it is so is theway we're talking about it or is it bothum I I have a slightly but if we'regonna transcend sorry just the point ofthat is like no all good rough questionlike do we need to get past exclusionarylanguage towards something that's moreanother loaded word love based rightmore encompassingum because it does seem to be a littlebit self-defeating when we're constantlytrying to label one group bad one groupgoodum the the dichotomy is unresolvedthat's what I'm trying to sayumthat sounds like a gay space communismto me and I reject it okayso no I I was slightly different uh RobI was gonna say I was a slightlydifferent perspective on that I thinksometimes you hear this they term likethey they're doing things they're doingthis they're doing that and I I actuallythink people are kind of afraid to speakout at the moment which is why they'rebroadening it to just they because Ithink that things are so asymmetric andso corrupt currently that if you were toname someone powerful and they'respecific wrongdoings I think it'sactually dangerous for your life in manycases so I think it's sort of a it's adiffusion there where people just speakabout it broadly but I do take yourpoint that it is it's kind of otheringand probably it is you know exclusionaryI agree with that except that thediffusion is perhaps also a product ofthe reality because if I have to drawthe line between US versus them it'slike the people paying the taxesand the people so the taxpayers and thenthe tax consumers the people living offof the taxes paid now that line isShifting all the time right like I don'tknow how many taxes did you pay lastyear maybe you took a loss this year andyou're consuming like it's all over theplacesoI agree with what you're saying exceptwell the caveat that maybe it isactually complicated and that's whywe're speaking in diffuse languagebecause it's who who are the taxconsumers in the world right now I haveno [ __ ] idea I mean I have a generalidea if you're a politician inWashington DC you're probably not doinganything productiveso you're probably a tax consumerif you're a you know Blue Collar plumberworking for a living you're probably ataxpayer because you're producingsomething of value and you're not inpolitical office but obviously thegradations between that are significantsoI I gotta say I'm uh I'm excited for youto read I think it's chapter seven in mybook Rob called The Sovereign subject incrypto power because it it essentiallydeals with this schmittian idea of whothe identity of the enemy is and anytimethat like the state has someone that Ican label as enemy it can utilize thestate of emergency to put them outsideof the law to then be able toessentiallyadjudicate on its own Accords how itwants to do with that Enemy of the Stateand that and like that essentially isthe production of genocide and what wehave seen continually throughout the20th century is make an enemy label themuse that to put them outside of the lawdestroy them and so now with Bitcoin andspecifically with you know what I callcrypto sovereignty is the ability toliterally abscond from that abilitythrough shielding your identity from thestate and the amount of wealth that youmay have from them and there's all theseother tertiary tactics that are going tocome along with it and the ability toutilize cryptography to do that and themain function that this has is to be ablindinglike the essentially it's the first moveto be blinding towards identity becausethe problem is is that if we can everlabel people as enemies that we cansteal from there's always thepotentiality that we can become thatpersonand so in the essay I point out thatlikethe Jew by their very nature andexistence created a state of emergencyfor the Nazibecause that was an other that theycould not allow to exist because the waythat it challenged the framework of whatNazism was and so I think that that'sreally really important because any timethat you have a sovereign power that canlabel individuals and call them good badenemy whatever that then creates apredication for there to be a secondaryclass of law that they can apply topeople and so to me that's literallywhat the entire tax structure looks likeis saying these people are subjects theybelong to this particular nation stateand they can do whatever the [ __ ] theywant to them and I think that we'reessentially challenging that and makingit so that that will no longer existinto the future and frankly that likeposterity will look back and be likelike it's [ __ ] crazy did you knowlike if the United States owned you inthe 20th century you just had to paythem whatever they commanded or elsethey threw you in jail Wildyeah I amI agree with the sentiment that Robshared and Jeff has mentioned it to me anumber of times andI mean I think we all in the chaos ofthe news cycle we get caught up inthe framing that it imposes on us and wealso get caught up in the framing thatwe impose on itbut I on a more fundamental level like II first of all I agree but I also just Isee all of the manifestations ofdifferent behaviors and personalitiesand stuff outside myself as justpotential ways I could be seeing andlike seeing things and acting you knowlike of course it's potential ways thatI could you know ideas that I could beembodying to the same degree that thosepeople are and therefore acting inaccord with that and soyou know what you know perhaps myrhetoric sometimes uh betrays this but Idon't really see it in that likedichotomous way like I don't see reallyanyone as irredeemable or nor do Iascribelike absolute power to anyone or anyinstitution because at the end like younobody can give that up but yourself ina sense I mean even if you're this isthe umuh who was the guy in the the Nazi campswho wrote the book uh Victor Frankelright this is kind of his point it'slike you can be in the jail cell andpeople still not be able to take yourfreedom from you like your freedom toresolve your ownyou to find your own inner peace in asense to accept your circumstances andfind Freedom within that whatever thematerialreality of your circumstance may be andum you know so one I I agree that likethis is all just and perhaps Icharacterize it in more concrete ways sothat I can play out those narratives inmy mind to see what I think about themto seehow I should construct my perspectivewithin them and I guess sometimes indialogue you know that gets externalizedand it can seem that it's enough versusthem sort of dynamic but I I don'treally uhsee it that wayumso yeah I mean I I agree with thesentiment and uhyeah well I mean like how how beautifulit is that like literally Bitcoin in itsexistence like it can't do on US versusthem like it literally right isincapable of having that happen and tome like that's one of the most importantthings is it it blinds that identityfunction so now we have to recognize andrespect the other who we can neveractually know as being a being thatdeserves an is entitled to all of thesame affects and rules of law that applyto me as wellyou know it's like umall of our systems Eric like up to thispoint have had just like have had torely on humans and they've had to belike let's just get the best humans inthere well let's have one human who'sthe best no let's have uh 500 humansthat are the best uh you know what Imean and let's have a full democracy anentire Society full of humans makingdecisions no because humans have biasBitcoin doesn't even know humans existhas no idea you know what I mean andthat's why there's no human bias in thesystem that's why the system worksthat's why the system is a perfectmachine right and so it's it's very likeI I I talk to people who still don'tunderstand this and they think that I'mlying to them and they think thatthere's coded human bias and that I'myou know we're just um obfuscating likethe amount of human biases in the systemwell don't the devs control no theydon't and it's hard to get people tothink like a computer network would saybasicallythe the last thing you know what I wasgonna put on the end of of that wasumeven though like that's my I feel likethat's my more fundamental orientationin the in the last year I guess perhapsI've I guess I've been more I tried tobe more conscious about to what degree Iwas feeding into that thing that Robdescribed and you know so let's justtake an easy example like someone says something stupid on Twitter andyou slide in to [ __ ] own it in someway you know dunk on them whatever itmight be and it's just like what is thatserving is that serving anything at allis that a is that a worthy use of mytime is that uh an adversary that's evenum you know like is that a worthyadversary for me what like what good isthat doing whatsoever uh versus you knowif you focus onthe things that are actually actuallygenerative or productive towards whatyou deem to be most important you knowso one of those things might just beBeauty right like instead of beingdivisive or inflammatory or you know uhcombativewhy not like what if you just took allthat time and energy that you would dothose things on and just just every timetried to focus on something beautifuland propagate that to the extent thatyou you know propagate anything out intothe The Ether social media or whateverand so you know I think that's justthat's a more conscious strategy orapproach that's born out of therecognition that that is true like themore that you other people the more thatyou divide the more that you separatethings in US versus them the more youare you know even if in other areasyou're you're helping in some way youare perpetuating this sort of thisdichotomy rather than operating on theassumption that no eat like eachindividual can transcend the behaviorsthat are not serving them and notserving others and they can start toturn that around and they can do thingsthat are more in line with truth andthey can engage in more beautiful thingsand they can you know they can Orientthemselves toward the good better let'ssay and everyone has that capacity andshould we not do that for ourselves andbe a force that allows or thatthat inspires or assists others in doingthe same and it would that not generatethe out a better outcome anyways is thatnot the outcome whatever outcome thatleads to is it would that not be betterthan a victory over our supposedyou know ideological adversaries let'ssayI I had a friend I want to pose aquestion to your question which is I hada friend uhpose this really interesting thoughtexperiment to me and he told me that doyou know that the amount of people inthe population who have above 125 IQsand the amount of peoplewho are financially free and are thesame and I was like that's interestingand he was he was talking to mebasically like you it may be the fat itmay be a function of intelligence thatyou simply can't have personalresponsibility without a sufficient IQand so maybe there's some leveling upthat Humanity needs to go through wherelike we get everybody you know becauseIQ changes over time collectively and somaybe it's like there's a leveling inhumanity where we need to go up a coupleorders of magnitude uh so that we canget everybody to a place where they canactually be the type of person that Johnwas was talking about because I don'tknow if I don't know if people are likecapable of it currentlyI think they're capable of an aspect ofit right they might they might not beable to like you knowbe thetheir fullest expression of all thosethings but you know can they not startwalking in that direction can they nottilt more that way and I mean this iskind of one of the promises of you knowhyper bitcoinized world right in thatthethe price signal and the culturalsignals that we'll be propagating atthat time will be more conducive tonudging people in a direction towardmore what I think we'd all agree arelikebetter values and principles you know sothat much of which won't even beconscious as the reverse of that is notconscious to a lot of people today theso-called Fiat culture all those signalsthat are getting sent to them and thebehaviors that are being inculcated as aresult of the culture I mean that's notconscious right people just say hey I'mwho I am and I decide who I am it's likedo you I mean a portion you do you youcan decide on consciously on certainbehaviors but the motivations for thosebehaviors and the beliefs on whichthey're predicated a lot of that isinculcated by the culture by your by theincentives that are presented to you inthat culture so when they changethose things are going to change as welland yeah again like they may not bethey might have the IQ to really take itby the reins and like Drive hard in thatparticular direction but they they'recapable of responding toa better set of values and principleslet's say broadly speaking and so youknow there's an element of hope to bederived from thatI mean to me it's not about the thefunction of IQ as much as it's thefunction of the true core belief intruth itself as having a substantialexistence and to me like that's what'sso beautiful about Bitcoin versus Fiatworld is itelectrically charges people in such away that they have to acknowledge thatthe truth is a real and meaningful thingin this world and through that that likejump starts thinking again where theycan go oh wait a minute like Fiat worldis this gigantic lie and that's whyeverything's so [ __ ] up and that if Ireapproach the world in a way where Iunderstand that there is a capital Ttruth in that I can meet other peoplewith the fusion of Horizons and seeingthat like I can actually changesomething in the world in a meaningfulway and then this turns on itself in ina really beautiful way that they go wellokay if truth is so valuable in theeconomic sphere where Bitcoin with afixed Supply is becoming this valuablejust by its naturewhat does that truth do elsewhere in theworld what does it do to me what is itwhat does it do to my family what doesit do to societyand I think that that's a that's areally really important core functionthat sort of electrifies and jump startsthis ability to to frankly change in ameaningful way and not just sink intothe you know uhmoat or the swamp of FiatI go back to that quote uh at thebeginning of the big short that says thetruth is like poetry and most people[ __ ] hate poetry you know it's likemost people most people are not out hereseeking the truth you knowso true uh well I feel like maybe I'mtrying I'muh John if you want to say something atthat point I think I've got a tangentmaybe okay well I'll just comment onething Ithe truth in so far as it's like youknow the capital T truth is kind of likehoity-toity privileged thing to beaspiring to because you you know themundane aspects of Life are sufficientlytaken care of that you have that youknow opportunity or privilege like yes Ithinkmaybe that kind of Truth people uh don'tlike looking atbut I think truth construed as simplythe information that allows you tobecome United with what you mostfundamentally valueI think that's just howConsciousness almost works and soeveryone in that context call it apragmatic truth but I think it's apragmatic truth because it's sofundamentally truepeople everyone wants truth in thatregard they want the information themeans to move closer toward the thingsthat they value most now obviously youknow perhaps a lot of people don't don'tsee it or construe it in that way but Ithink that's a a manner in which thatwould maybe contradict how to what yousaid becauseI think that that is the type of truththat everyone seeks now maybe the aim wecould discuss whether it's a legitimateaim and whether that aim is in accordwith a broader capital T truth but justa function of Truth generally thatpeople there's a magnetism of it becauseit's I think almost tautologically ordefinitionally it's it's what yourequire to move toward what is mostvaluable or even Unite with what is mostvaluablepeople don't want to visitorsright I I I think there's this veryhuman thing of wanting to avoid painwhich is why most people uh tend toreject the truth because the truth isoften painful and so you basically say Iif I accept this in this hurts and Idon't want to feel that so what I'mgoing to do is I'm going to tell myselfit's not happening and then you go intodenial and you know how many people dowe know that use denial as a copingmechanism it's it's almost everybody youknow and and so you know I like while II think that everybody here is a Seekereverybody's very intelligent like youguys are we're all very aligned on truthI mean truth is like that's the NorthStar for me that's that's the modusoperandi in my entire life I just don'tthink that uh Bitcoin is going toprovide that sort of seeking to everyoneI wish it would it'd be great if it didI hope to be wrong I just don't say itbut is it one of those cases back tothat point about the cultural signalsand the price signal that in a hyperworldeven if you don't have that you knowstrong impetus or motivation to be oneof those hardcore true Seekers It'sorienting You toward it regardlesssubconsciously in in that that's justthe direction that the signals arepointing you kind ofdo you know what I'm do you know what Imean I I think I think it it go aheadI was just gonna say I think it I thinkit helps execute the misalignment thatFiat explicitly createsum and I yesI think what zoneimportant about what it does is that itit marries the truth and value back intoeach other in a way that currently isn'tpossible in Fiat and so it it does makethe incentive alignment towards truthbetter because now in a hyperbitcoinized world I look atsay doing an olive Orchard which olivestake like 12 years to get the term andthen 15 years to start producing andthen you know it can produce for liketwo thousand years after that well likeif I if I have like a long-termperspective that like I want this to bean olive Orchard that exists for 300years there's no financing mechanismthat aligns with that in any meaningfulway whatsoeverhowever you know if we're now in aBitcoin standard there becomes thepossibility of derivatives and thingsthat look like that whereas in Fiatworld like we it's literally impossibleto have a timeline perspective onanything Financial that is past 30 yearsand I'm constantly amazed at that likeliterally the only financial instrumentsthat we have that extend out into thefuture are these strange time periodswhether it's 20 years 10 years 15 yearsfive years well what if you want onethat's seven years two months and 22hours for whatever [ __ ] reason youhave you know like there there's allthis space and ability to be able tofinancialize things in a different waythat once we're away from Fiat it allowsfor a much more congruent perspective soI I digress on that moment justessentially like I I think theelimination of Fiat through thepresentation of Truth having real valuebecause it's a solid thing thatcontinually exists forever and it is notSuperfluous or fleeting or subject to astate of emergencythat's the thing that has real value andthat's the thing when we speak to itsomebody 200 years from now can nodtheir head and be like yeah I'm inalignment with that their truth is mytruth too even though I have all thisother insane technology and I live in aspaceship and yeahI can agree to that for sure I want toask another question about truth but Ifeel like it's a bit of a can of worm soRob if you've got uh something you youwant to go let's stay on truth because Ihave a just a uh something else okaylet's stay on truth though I would justI can throw something in on Truth realquickumwhen we say something is an illusion ora deceptionuh I forget where I heard this but thatimplies the existence of truth right youcan't say something as deceiving orillusory without implying the existenceof something that is true right becausehow could you distinguish an illusion iftruth did not exist so for all of thistalk about truth and we're always likewell is it capital T truth like thenature of Ultimate Reality we're talkingabout or is it pragmatic truth trueenough to be useful and we always kindof get lost in the the gradations maybebetween the twoI think what people really want maybethis is what you were pretty much sayingJohn is that people just don't want tobe deceived right they don't want to bedeceived by others they won't they don'twant to be deceived by themselves rightif I think eating [ __ ] pepperonipizza is going to get me jacked well mygoal is to get Jack eating pepperonipizza is not a good means to that end ifI think that is then I'm self-deceivingI would want to know that presumably soI could actually get jacked rightwhatever the thing is so it's more likecleansing or I don't know gettinganything that makes the errors persistout of the system or getting a systemthat error corrects more effectively Idon't know that we ever get somethingthat generates truth but at leastdiscovers these pragmatic truths whichis to just saywe're clearing errors out and that's Ithink that's what we're talking about inthe marketplace right the free market iseffectively clearing these errorsthere's a bunch of people that wantstuff there's a limited supply of stuffhow do we reconcile the twowell we've kind ofstumble forward but um the quicker wecan clear those errors the more quicklywe can Rectify it so I just I was justmaybe trying to present an alternativeway to look at it istrying to not be deceived or not liveversus trying to always wrestle with ascapital teachers or a pragmatic truthyeah well let's yeah I mean let's lookat that in in the context of what hodlsaid so let's take someone whowe're probably all examples of this atsome point in our lifewho didn't want to analyze something youknow wanted to ignore the truth rejectit hide something in the fog you knowwhatever language you want to useso you is there is that a is that aninstance of wanting deception you knowis that an instance of wanting you knowignorance is bliss is that an instanceof not wanting the informationthat would align you withtruth becauseyou don't want to face it for somereason I mean it seems like there aremany instances of that it might even bekind of epidemic in in culture todayum well we were talking earlier aboutfiat currency being kind of likeanalgesic right that it's right butthere's an economic catastrophe we canjust print money and pretend likethere's more goods and capital thanthere really are it creates a short-termstimulative effect that's aself-deception or you know some there'sa relief to it there's also a relief towhen you take a pain pill right like youhave a disease that's causing theunderlying pain and you just throw theBand-Aid on ituh that's sort of a deception too rightyou're not resolving the root you'rejust kind of hacking at the leaves so Iguess there is a utility sometimes Ithink this is an interesting microcosmmaybe of like lowercase and capital Ttruth because in a sense likeyou're valuing your Blissful ignorancemore than whatever truth you think ishidden down in the basement of your soulor in the fog or wherever it might beand so whatever is allowing you toachieve that Blissful ignorancethat'struthful information for you becauseit's the information that allows you toalign or achieve or move toward or Unitewith what you value mostand I think so that's maybe lower casethat's the more pragmatic perhaps Ithink there's a k you know capital Tmight beiswhat resultsfrom when you apply that mechanics let'ssaytwo different things two different endstwo different values and soI mean and this gets into the religiousdomain perhaps because I think there's anotion likewhen you hold which which informationwhen you hold to be most truemost integrates you with what mostfundamentally isum and and I think you judge that by theresults of it you know by their fruitsyou will know them you know like you youwhen you applywhen you're objective when the thing youvalue most is blissful ignorance and youapply that and you treat the informationas true in that regard well what is theresult I'd say you know again we mightget stuck in the weeds here but broadlya less integrated person a lessstrong person someone who's degradingthemselves on multiple levelswhereas if youif you Orient yourself to another goalanother end another value whatever itmight be because once you get up at thetop of that area it's hard to confineand put borders around and nail downbut if youOrient yourself in a different directionif you treat as true certain informationthat coheres you with something else andit actually makes you more integrated itmakes you more strong it makes you morecapable of bearing the burden of life itallows you toachieve your ends better see moreclearly all that kind of stuff is thatnot a reflection or a commentary or anindication that that thing to which youare trying to be congruent or coherewith is more fundamentally true thanthe Blissful ignorance or whatever elseyou may be aspiring to that's not thatis thatexactly clearly I mean this is all veryconfusing but I got I got lost I'm notgonna lie I got lost all right so I'mgonna try to swing at it though sothere's this utility toI don't know if deception is deceptionmay be too strong of a word there's autility to representing something rightto using a symbol symbols are veryinteresting right you'reyou're using a symbol to representsomething we know that the symbol is notthe thingbut the symbol gives us some uhexpedient way to deal with it right likeeven the words we're using like thewords are never the thing but we cantrade the words around really fast andthat lets us kind of get a handle onthese realities that we couldn't processif we weren't using language forinstance sowhat am I trying to say the utility of adeception or a representation let's sayseems to be expedienceand so there's that old quote that a liecan run around the world while the truthis still putting on its shoesright it's it's fast it's it's it'sum it's like a fast thing so butdeceptionso it's good across space maybe youcould say rightbut deception does not stand the test oftimebecause obviously you know what thethree things that cannot remain longhidden the Sun the moon the truthand if we're talking about like capitalT truthwhich is the nature Ultimate Realitysomething like the laws of physics rightthe laws of physics are immune to timeright it's the opposite of a deceptionthat's expedient and usefulit's something that's Timeless soit's almost like I think we there's thiselement ofsymbolism or falsehood or deceptionbuilt into human rationality itself likewhere you always try to use the map andterritory analogy that we're usinglanguageto try and discreetly map thisinfinitely complex fluid World Continuumthat we all inhabit right the the map isnever the territory by definition butit's very useful to us obviously rightwe can all get on the same map and wecan connect our minds through languageprices rationality Etc and we can solvemuch larger more complex problems thatbenefitum the human Enterpriseby getting consensus on these littlemicro deceptions called words or symbolsor whatever may be soI'm kind of flailing about as well butthere there is it's notagain it's not like an US versus dumbthing it's like oh we need all truth allthe time it's like no we actually doneed to have these little Illusions likemoney and the nation state and your nameand your business like these are alluseful fictions useful illusionsum well I think I think the problem withlike the the money map analogy is thatlike the the real problem comes when oneinsists that the map is the territoryyou know that's right it reminds me youknow like the problem is that there's ayou know a story about you know there'sa boat it's going along it sees thatthere's another boat coming along atradios that goes oh hey this is the U.SCoast Guard we're in command here you'rein our lives like you need to move andthey're like yeah not happening you guysneed to move out of the way who's likeone more time like I'm telling you wherethe U.S Coast Guard we come in this youneed to move your vessel out of our wayand the response is yeah we're alighthouse this is your moveyou know and like that's reallyimportant because when we see the map asbeing the territory itself we will makethose insistence to say no this iscapital T truth when perhaps it's just alower T truth and when we replace thelower T Truth where a capital T1 nowwe're in total error and I can't helpbut think about Hannah our density andsystems upon what evil is is theinability to be able to truly thinkabout what's happening and so forsomebody like Eichmann the lower T truthwas I'm just doing my job I'm justfollowing orders this is the right thingfor me to do as a good upstanding Germancitizen this is my truth well when welook at that truth in the largerholistic way it turns out that it's acataclysmic error and I can't help butthink that this is the exact same errorthat is the difference between proof ofwork versus proof of stake you'restarting with proof of stake from theauthoritarian decree that something istrue and you're moving forward fromthere and so for Eichmann it was truethat he was being good citizen he wasobeying the laws and he was doingnaturally what he had to do with thatlower T truth but he literally didn'thave the cognition to consider what thecapital T truth is and whether or notshipping people off to the [ __ ] deathcamps was a wise thing to do as a humanso this is you're you're hitting thesame like sorry I'll just finish thisthe mistaking the map for territory likeyou just said Ericthat isyou're misapprehending the nature ofknowledge itself right knowledge isalways necessarily provisionalcontextualit's going to mean different things indifferent circumstances it changes overtime it can never fully capture realitywhen you start thinking it canthat is that's totalitarianism rightyou've totalized knowledge the otherdefinition of evil evil is knowledgewhich believes itself to be completeso once you think that the map is allinclusive there's nothing else to learnyou don't treat people the same wayanymore right for us to have meaningfuldialogueI have to assumethat there are things you know that Idon't know so I can like be listeningand attentive and receptive to what youhave to say if I if I'm a totalitarianand I think I know everything you havenothing to offer me right I can't learnfrom you because I know everythingso there's this goes back to I think itwas maybe Socrates there's two types ofpeople in the world right there are thefools that think they are wise and thereare the wise who know that they arefoolsso it's like gaining this appreciationfor the finitude of knowledge that thatepistemic reality human rationalitythought all of this is limited againstthe backdrop of a limitless reality withwhich we're trying to contendthe the fundamental respect that has tobe brought into the equation when we'reconversing and I know that I do not havecomplete knowledge I now must respectthe other person that I'm interactingwith because otherwise this is arelationship of totalsyou have no need to respect me becauseyou're complete in knowledge on your ownso there's no need to respect the otherindividual because you're complete inknowledge of yourself so I just thinkthat's an important interesting factI think this is an error that uh thatbitcoiners that you know I I'm guilt tothis I think many of us have made thismistake of thinking we hadthis this knowledge that was completeand you know that you had uncovered avery important truthum and then because you had uncoveredthat truth or because you knew thattruth you could wield it sort of as aweapon against other people and that'snot the appropriate way to think orbehave and I think uh being the you knowthe Wise Fool is is a much better uh isa much better outcome and I think overtime I've moved from being so it was youknow like very overzealous about this inthe beginning to being like yeah it'sprobably a lot I don't a lot I don'tknow you know just and uh trying to bemoreummore circumspect about my my own my ownunderstanding of what's Happening herenow at the same time though it does pissus off as bitcoiners because I know alot more about Bitcoin than you do a[ __ ] lot more so you need to shut the[ __ ] up when you're talking to me don'ttell me your [ __ ] opinions uh I'm aperson with experience I don't I don'tbow to you you bow to me [ __ ] offthere's the uh there's the old hoddle weloveum but you know I mean this is thelitmus test of a of a sincerePursuit or orientation of Truth is thattype of humility because and that's whyit's so obvious when you encounterpeople that that don't espouse that orthat are overly arrogant or hubristic orwhatever you can tell that they'reserving something other than the truththeir own ego their own interests theirown gain whatever it may be but itthere's a requisite humility if you'regenuinely orienting Yourself by apursuit of the truth and just one othercomment for me and I'll hand it over toyou Rob but Eric that that was what Iwas kind of trying to explain in my rantlike you mentioned this Eichmann guy inin Nazi Germanyhim treatingyou know a type of information as truthin service of a particular end I use theword degrading or disintegrating versusintegrative because I think those areyou know good ways to look at orientingoneself and that was obviously a verydisintegrating uh you know let's sayideal or objective and therefore thetreating of the information he cameacross as true in service of thatobjective and it was very disintegratingand ultimately with the hindsight withthe benefit of hindsight we look at thatand say well obviously right obviouslythat's bad behavior and so my point waswhat is the information that when wetreat as true leads to a moreintegrating more harmonious if you likeindividual cells a stronger moreintegrated individual self and communityof of interacting people and I mean Ithink this is why the question of likewhat is true has been the centralquestion of humanity for as long as wehave records for I mean this is thereligious the theological the PhyllisEnterprise and for good reason becausepeople recognize that that what you mostOrient yourself towards what yourhighest goal is will determine how youtreat the information that you comeacross and it will have extremelyconsequential it will be extremelyconsequential how you treat thatinformation I.E will you shove someoneinto uh an oven and incinerate themalive or will you operate with yourselfand the people you engage with in amanner that is conducive to mutualrespect flourishing strengtheningproductivity you know whatever we mightconstrue there those there's nothingmore consequential to that and I thinkthat's why this this question has beenso Central and and the last part of thatis justI think this is also the theum delusion or Illusion uh you refer torob you know it's almost like we comeout of the womb right we're just a blobof nothingness like that's the firstseparation from our mother and then weadd on all these things name interestblah blah blah that serve to separate usmake us unique from everyone else andit's almost like the Journey of life islike going into thatyou know uh multifarious identity spacebut then piecing together ultimately thethings the understanding so theinformation you need to recognize youryour fundamental Unity with everyone sogoing from Unity to multiplicity back toUnity and I think that could be that'sone of the functions of Distortion falseinformation delusion isbecause I think thatis contending with that properly is thejourney toward discovering and embodyingvirtue and what is virtue other than aword we use toPoint toward that highest place and thethe aspects of it that we can bring downinto our life and and display in ouraction and I think you know that that ispart of thethe function of the potential fordelusion and evil more broadly is makingyoumaking you develop recognize and embodyand stand up for that ver you know thosevirtues and it is in doing that thatmakes you integrated with what is in thehighest place or what is mostfundamentally is that that's kind ofmore clarification on the point I wastrying to make earlierbut yeah I like to contend with it youhave to contend with it you have to bewilling to ask those questions it's whenthose questions come you go whoa whoa no[ __ ] that that this is umto me like that that's the criticalissue that allows for somebody to stayin lower teeth lower T truth notthinking comprehensively about the worldin a lower ways there is anunwillingness to sit and meditate withthe questions themselves I just wantedto point that outyeah no I think that's an excellentexcellent point go aheadoh no I was just gonna say a lot ofthese people are low-team I agreewell I mean being high tea is a resultof being properly integrated with thetruth of the world you know that's justwhen you're integrated with propernutrition when you're integrated withnature properly integrated with goodrelationships High T is the outcomethat's just that's a [ __ ] example ofwhat I was talking about that's whatresults are oriented and integratedproperlythat's so goodyeahso there's no final answers right that'sI mean right that's kind ofparadoxically the final answer is thereare no final answers I think everythingis also in Paradox ultimately rightthat's kind of the spice there's nobrick wall at the end of any Pursuit theactual Cosmos our inner domains I meanit's just right everything's cyclicaland that's wellthe beautiful thing about Bitcoin thebeautiful thing about Bitcoin is itallows us to all come up with our ownquestion our own answers for thatquestion what is true and then it givesus enough money so that we can colonizeDistant Worlds you know and there willbe a planet of people that all believelike Eric Cason and there will be aplanetwho eat egg who eat egg shells on top oftheir breakfast like John vallasreal whole planet of these people and soit's this ends like do this ends likeDune for all of us that's my theoryanywaywhich is great right that's thethat's a definite definite successmetric for the human race that we'vemore of me as the comedian Louis CK saysso the man's premise on like more of meyou knowum did heoh did Louis CK ever get it or is hestill just poking the bear I thinkthat's a parody I think he's getting aguy on Twitter yeahno it's apparent oh sorry guysI was really excited one of my favoritecomedian followed me but it's not himspeaking of Twitter happenings I neededto give uh John and Rob you guys get alot of kudos for uh orange pillingJordan Peterson because I just saw himlike a week ago being like Bitcoin fixesthis take heed peasants I was like Goddamn they orange built this guyyeah I don't know where he is we're yeahstill trying okay I want to say allrightI have so much to say now all rightso John your point like on virtue[Music]I think because even isn't the wordVirtue is not derived from a word fortruth virtus something like thatyeah so it's like this struggle to tryand embody what is most useful right soto embody these pragmatic truthshonesty discipline you know Valorwhatever the most usefula pattern of action to the to theI guess collectively determined Societyat that time that tends to be virtueso they're tools right they're just likeall these other [ __ ] tools that weusenow I want to what I really wanted totalk about there was tying this all theway back to Cason's pointthat I think I'm just now starting toreally see the light on and I'll try andsay what I'm seeing here so you madethis point Eric thatwhen we blind the identity assigningfunction of the state right that thestate is no longer able to decreethis is your social security number thisis what you do this is who you arethat Were Somehow maybe preventing thecapacitywe're preventing ourselves from reducingone another to a labelmaybe as a way to put this and when youreduce someone to a label like we'retalking about the deception being anexpedient it's very easy to just writesomeone off like oh it's a [ __ ]bleeding heart liberal or oh that's aredneck conservative right you reducesomeone to a label you totally discounttheir sovereignty right theirindividuality goes to zero once you putthem in that bucketand so again it's an expedient it'suseful maybe if you're just going todeal with someone in passingbut the trade-off to that experience isyou're giving up a more intimateknowledge of their individuality rightjust by virtue of using that label somaybe bywhich is to say you're discounting theirindividual sovereignty so by reducingthe ability of the state to assign theselabels or identitiesmaybe we're actually reducing the amountwe discount sovereignty in one anotherand soyou know when youto view individuals as individualsactually look at someone and be likethis individual is unknowable to me Ican never just like anything else youlook at in the world you can never fullycapture it in language you can't surelycan't capture an individual languagethat through that linguistic change ifthat is a linguistic change that wedevelop more of an appreciation for theactual sovereignty and unknowability ofthe individuallike that as it seems to be a majorcognitive changeand I want to give an example a weirdexample because soit's like all rightI'm gonna take a left turn herewe're talking about how we talk aboutone another how we think about oneanother how we relate to one anotheruh there's a you know there's theexpedient path I can just put you in ato a label or I could be your bestfriend and really spend a whole lifetimegetting to know you and yet never fullyknow you kind of thing and there'ssomewhere in betweenthat seems to be kind of reflecting ourinner the inner struggle between ourAngel and our animal right where I don'twant to see a thing on Twitter and reactto it and call someone a piece of [ __ ]or whatever I want to try and like bemore like Jeff Booth Bruce Lee like letthat negative energy pass through me putout positive energyI had this that's like a personalanecdote I saw a bit what's his name bitboy crypto the other day it was like ohyeah someone was passed around a videoof his and he's just I mean this guy'slike Fiat really wanted to call that guya piece of [ __ ] he's real like oh he'sFiat and Corona dude like he'she's like I think he was accusing CoreyClipson of wanting to put his hands downthe pants of like Gary's like somethingthat doesn't make any [ __ ] sense atall like it's just so just preying onstupid [ __ ] people I again here I amusing that horrible exclusionarylanguage but clearly like tilted towardsidiots like No One's Gonna believe whatthis guy is saying unless you're justdumband I wanted to write I actually typed atweet out and I was like there's goingto be a huge grease fire in hell whenthis pig finally ends up thereand I wanted to send it so badbut I just couldn't I don't know theinner my inner Jeff Booth Angel was likeno why like what is this going to dothis serves no purpose you're gonna calla spade a spade but it accomplishesnothing like transcend you know deletethe Tweet move on and so I ended updeleting it but I just wanted to likegive a personal anecdote of thiswrestling like there's always thisthere's a there's a big tendency ormotivation to want to just label someoneand then once they're labeled you just[ __ ] you can denigrate them into theground you know yeah but but you'resacrificing the truth of who they arewhich is I don't know that guy who knowsmaybe he'll do something great one day Ihave no idea but uh well the other theother an element of that is always likewhen when someone veers off course let'ssay and let's say you know just for thesake of argumentthere's no ambiguity in that assessmentthey are veering off course I mean Ithink theyou know the higher self let's say wouldrecognize that the appropriateresponse is compassion right becausethey're cutting themselves off from thetruth and all of the goodness thatSprings forth from it let's say uh andso you know those peoplethey may be more deserving or moreuh in need of your compassion andguidance should you care to giveanything at all now I you know obviously99.9 times out of 10 it's just going tobe apathy and like I'm gonna let him bein his own world and all those otherpeople be in that world and I'm going tofocus on other things but you know thatseems like it would be the appropriateperspective to have on something likethat let me ask you thiswhy did you want to write that otherthan like you know the impulse tobecause you think he's harming peopleand you want to maybe needle and pointedout but like what like you recognize andthat's why you deleted it butwhat are you contributing to what areyou gaining and what are youcontributing to by set by actuallycommunicating that to the world it wasdefinitely an Impulse but I think if Iand I didn't know this consciously atthe time but when I'm looking at it nowin retrospect this is two days agoprobably I think I was triggered by himsaying that about Corey it's almost likeyou're rising to defend a friend you'relike [ __ ] you dude like what are youlike my friend wants to put his hands onthe pants of a regulator like what thatdoesn't even make like you're such a fatpiece of [ __ ] you're gonna burn in hellforever like I just wantedlike I was triggered I guess andumI yeah I know but he's perfectI I will say as somebody who um has lettheir ID run wild on Twitterfor for years at a time it's so freeingGod doesn't feel good it feels so goodyeah and it's only later when you go ahyeah there's some blowback here probablyshouldn't have said all that [ __ ]but yeah but what's what's worse the theblowback externally or the blowbackinternally when you realize that perhapsyou've acteduh Less in line with what you deem to bemost virtuous in the future sometimeuh for me it's more external becauseit's definitely I'm always just goof I'mjust goofing around and then some peopletake it wrong or whatever you know whatI mean it's like I kind of enjoy I enjoydialing up the chaosbut a lot of people can't live thereit's a very you know what I mean it'slike you get balanced off quick when youlose 11. incidentally is the why isthere is the reason why you were thefirst uh person I reached out to when Istarted the podcast yeah just I'd be onTwitter be like man I love the way thisguy gets down you know I want to havehim on for the inaugural uh episode butyou know what you said you said umwe had it booked and then like a fewdays before before you you wrote me likeyo yo I gotta reschedule I'm gonna behungover that day so so that's why uhsessions ended up being the firstthat doesn't sound like me at all uhyou know what was what was interestingfor me and here was the value in it wasbeing that character on Twitter was veryfreeing it allowed me to uh I over theyears you know I had this issue like Ihad a real problem like free Bitcoinwhere there was an invisible rule bookand for some reason I knew all of itsrules and everybody I knew knew all ofits rules and I lived in strictadherence to all of its rules and thenone day I realized why do I live my lifeaccording to an invisible book I'venever seen or heard it's just it'sculture it's Dogma it pervades my lifeeverybody around me reinforces that Ihave to be this specific way and I[ __ ] hate it I hate every bit of itand having Bitcoin and having that likefeeling of the first time I made aBitcoin transaction I've said thisbefore but I felt scared I felt nervousand then when the transaction sent likeit was supposed to suddenly thatnervousness I felt empowered ittransformed me in that moment thatsounds cringe or whatever I don't carethat really happened to me and from thatmoment on I set forth on a differentpath in my life truly and I created thischaracter to burn down all of the Deadwood that was around me I started sayingyou know what instead of this invisiblerule book exists and I'm going to followall of its rules like a [ __ ] I startedsaying [ __ ] this book and [ __ ] you and[ __ ] everybody else all right I'm gonnasay whatever I think and feel and I'mgonna let the chips fall where they mayand I spoke a lot of Truth to a lot ofpeople and it was beautiful you knowwhat I mean and then I realized there'sthere's an abundance of Truth thing thatcan happen too where you've gone too faryou've overdosed on the truth and justlike there are white lies there are alsoblack truths you know what I mean and soyou don't need to tell everybody everytruth every time every minute of the daywhen you think it you know I mean so Ibacked off a little I moderated a littlebitbut you know that that is a a prettygood example becauseyou know we I don't think we're sayinghere like never express Because unlessyou're going to be a monk in a templelike not saying anything foreveryou're gonna you're gonna engage you'regonna Express out in the world andthat's gonna be in relation to thingsyou see and if you want to be true toyourself like sometimes you're going tosay things that other people a bit orthat rub people the wrong way orwhatever and like again if you want tobe the monk sure and maybe that is howeveryone should be out now who the [ __ ]knows but presuming we're not all goingto be like that one of the things that'sfascinating with you isI mean at least from my perspectiveobviously some people took it the wrongway but you know uh I would say I alwayscould tell where it was coming from likeand people would hit me up I think I'mnot sure if I ever shared it with youbut you know people would say like howcan you have this guy on your your showand stuff like that he's this that andthe other thing and I'd write them backthey're like you're not you don't get ityou know you're you're not seeing what'sreally going on here you're like and sobut because of that most people like youknow came to appreciate it right andmost people you know you're a lovablecharacter let's put it that way butbecause despite the you know the actualwords you were using and throwing outthere in The Ether they could tell whatwas animating it behind it it wasn'tmalevolence it wasn't aggression itwasn't evil it wasn't meanness it wasjust you know broadly speaking it was itwas an expression of Liberation that youjust described from the strictures thatyou formally subjected yourself to let'ssay and so absolutely that that so it'sit's not all bad right that is much ofthat is good and look at look at thegood yeah it's one produced in the livesof of others the people that youaffected the shamed in the stack andmore sads you know all that kind ofstuff but also how it's enriched yourlife you know all the friends you'vemade as a result of being that type ofperson and communicating that way lookat all the relationships you've builtlook at all the experiences you've hadas a result of that and backback to the point just last last thingback to the point earlier it's like howdo you judge the the legitimacy of theinformation that you both intake andexpress outwardly it's got to be in theoutcome right I mean how else could wejudge it and that seemingly is a prettygood outcome that you've establishedfrom acting in the way you havewell I appreciate all the compliments uhobviously they make me a mildlyuncomfortable but it's uh you know it'sit's it's like um it's like Peterson'sthing of like speak the truth and seewhere it takes you my life is a milliontimes different than it was before Istarted being more outright with what Iwas actually thinking in my head thoughbefore that I was just walking aroundthinking these thoughts and then keepingthem to myself and then once I startedjust saying it me and Eric were talkingabout this when we were in that backyardin L.A uh I drive by the way I wassupposed to do a documentary and I Iwent to the documentary crew and I waslike um I'm bringing some people with meand they were like okay and I was likeno yeah you have to put Eric Cason oncamera and so if I force I force Eric tobe in the documentary and then I cameback into the room I was drinking winein the backyard with some girls I cameback into the room the documentary crewwas in love they went from being mildlyannoyed I'd showed up with Eric to beinglike bro you said it all man I [ __ ]love you dudeso that's that's always the case that'salways the case and that's and that'sbecause Eric's Eric speaks his [ __ ]truth too I mean everybody up here doesbut like people have really responded toEric recently because like the things hesays and the rants he goes on and likeEric has given it to you as Eric sees itand it's fully authentic and just it'syou can't help but like love a personwho's just telling especially when youcan tell that person has a good heartand soul and they're telling you howthey see things you know what I meanit's always interesting everybody elseis just wandering around like recitingshibboleths about like oh yeah hey[ __ ] diversity is our strength likeJesus Christ kill me you know what Imean 100 percentwell I I appreciate those Outlets thatthat was a really cool interview becauselike as we got into it like I was aboutto go north philosophical stuff and Iwas like hang on like you don't happento be familiar with Giorgio and againare you and like the the dude produceslike yeah actually I'm like really wellread in Georgia and again we like studydid stuff before we did direct actionstuff back in the 80s so so yeah I Iknow 100 we're talking about I was likeoh okay cool so we just we just Doveimmediately down and I was like yeah sobitcoin's about the state of exceptionSovereign Theory because it allows forthe inability to create an exception tothe law that labels us and allows for usthen become other people that could bedestroyed and have our wealth Rob fromus so it's like a really great thingum but yeah it was a great it was agreat interview I've been wanting toCircle back to what Rob was saying aboutthis idea of respecting people'ssovereignty and thatuh like this comes back to Emmanuellebanon's thesis that he asserts intotality and infinity is that by usrespecting the other truly as anindividual who we can have no power overwe open up a space of infinitepotentiality that that other person hasto be able to be who they're supposed tobe you know so when we label bit boycrypto as being a fat sloppy piece of[ __ ] that will never amount to anythinginto the world while that probably isabsolutely true there is the possibilityof him redeeming himself and him beinglike you guys like I I realized thatlike me selling advertisements to [ __ ]coins and dumping on all this retail isa horrible thing to do and I'm I'm sorryand I I don't want to be that in theworld like they there becomes apotentiality to open that by usaccepting and allowing for him to havethe sovereignty that he has other thanunilaterally saying Hey [ __ ] this guyhe's a fat sloppy piece of [ __ ] that'sgoing to try to sell you [ __ ] coins andrip you off so don't trust them orlisten to them and if you see them onthe road throw rocks outumyou know whereas like beingcompassionate and open allows for thepotentiality of him to see his ownmistakes and to correct them accordingto however he can which is much more ina line with capital T truth because wedon't know the potentiality that anotherperson has to unlock and open themselvesand maybe there becomes a quintessentialevent of the truth being electrifiedinside of him of him going whoacrypto stuff is no good and I haveBitcoin and these bitcoiners haveactually been trying to help me here andunderstand this message but you know inthe lower example of Rob by us you knowsaying these mean things to him maybe hedoesn't get that and he closes down toit because we haven't respected hissovereignty in the same way that wewould like our own to be respected so Ijust think that that's a reallyinteresting and important point aboutthe value of allowing other people theirsovereignty it's not about just feelinggood it's about the the realquintessential truth of the potentialityof a totality that that other person candeliverthat that's valueless you know [ __ ] bitboy crypto he could he could make a curefor AIDS I don't know maybe he'll youknow who knows what he can do butwe gotta afford that model thinks it'shilarious he could cure AIDSyou couldn't but I agree I think it's Ithink it's a it's a uniquerole to be the jester in the right waywith the rightattitude with the right heart with theright intention behind it which isperhaps why it's such a rare role butwhy it's so highly regardedum and everyone else you know shouldperhapshave the orientation that Eric justdescribed I mean again I think it's themore true one anyways it is true thatanyone can be redeemed it is true thatanyone can change their behavior it istrue the people go can go from doingquote unquote so-called you know badbehaviors to good ones that all all ofthat is true and is it not the best useof our attention should we choose to usto devote it to such people or things totry to treat it as though we expect itto go in that direction rather than uhrather thanum solidifying the behavior that they'vedone and and hardening those people intheir place as in and Us Versus Themsort of dynamic soyou know I I agree but I I think thisthis is why the jester is an eternalcharacter and why these differentarchetypes let's say the king and thephilosopher and the poet and the jesterI mean these are always going to be withus for that reason because takentogether perhaps that helps us steer theship in a more or lessbetter Direction you know the ark bendstoward truth or Justice or peace orIntegrity or whatever however we want toconstrue it this is why the um the Deepplatforming of Alex Jones from every bigTech platform all in unison was soconcerning to me because uh that is thedeath of the jester right Alex Jones isnot a serious person nobody's ever takenhim seriously I mean he's he says funnyridiculous people take them seriouslywell they they started taking him moreseriously after he was de-platformedright because it's a Streisand effectThing Once you shut somebody up thenthey go wait a second why'd they shuthim up what was he saying what was hesaying that he what did he get right youknow and uh you know then we saw a waveof censorship come after that andanybody who plays that role now like uhAndrew they just did it to Andrew Tateright anybody who's playing the role ofthe jester they're letting their ID runwild on the internet they're gonna gettaken down because we are in tyrannicaltimesin any way shape or form but the factthat he's being held without charge inRomania is concerning you know and to melike this is what it always comes backto is about the actual function and ruleof law itself which I don't think existsanymore but the fact that you know hedid a lot of shitty things and as ashitty person but like I want himaccountable to law as opposed to justbeing unilaterally held by the quotegood people because he's a bad personlike that doesn't work for meI was just gonna say that the when yousee the censorship coming down on thejester archetype that is a verytroubling Canary in the coal mine rightbecausethe Jester's telling those truths thatothers are scared to speak or maybe eventhey're like subtle truths right that umoften the punch line to a joke is likeyou're just telling you're sayingsomething everyone already knows to betrue they just never thought about andthat certain framing perhapsand so when power tries to come down onthat right or when Authority tries tosquash that that subtle truth-tellinguh that's very dangerous right thisum Peterson talks about this a lot likeonce the king comes down on the adjusterlike you should be concerned for thatSociety because basically the king isnot toleratingthe truth the truth telling that wascoming from the jester so you could alsosay it's an indication of the fragilityof the king's domain because he seeseven the slightest slight you know theslightest incline like poke as being athreat to his orders totalitarian yeahyeahyeah what I think is so interesting inour field is that like the the Anon isthe jester who like we can't get rid ofin any way and I find it so interestingthat that Peterson has gone on thesediatribes against the nons for a whilebecause toto me like the the Anon is one of likethe quintessential figures that like Iactually think in the end like theanonymous who fundamentallywe lost Ericammo oh they're his best rants keepgetting cut I know yeah don't don't liveout in the middle of the woods whereit's super windy and stormy that that'swell actually thinking about wheresociety's going maybe you guys shouldjust be comfortable with uh you're notcomfortable with a 15 second cutoff Ericmaybe I'll maybe I'll Q maybe I'll cueyou up to finish the rant here but Ithink one of the things with uh Petersonand the reason why he hates Anan is Iactually think that Peterson has beenthe victim of Bot farms and so I thinkthat there are there are specialinterests that have been going afterPeterson and when you're the peopledon't understand what it is to be alarge account I'm sure Rob understandsit better than anybody's largest countup here but like it's a totallydifferent experience to log in whenyou're a large account I mean you arejust being pummeled with [ __ ] and it'sjust flying at you it's you can't justcasually read through what other peopleare doing like people are trying to dragyou into [ __ ] like people are trying toyou know uh do psychological warfare onyou I mean it's brutal man and so forPeterson he's been a victim of that atscale and I think that's why he hatesannounced it's a very stupid opinion ofhis that he holds and he needs to getrid of it you know yeah yeah it is andhe engages a lot man like he's justgonna sayingcomments yeah like 10 followers thatsaid something against one of his viewsand he'll lash out at them likeaggressively it's like right yeah rulenumber you know internet engagement 101leave the trolls B you know focus on thethe I don't know making a betterargument or all the stuff we were sayingearlier about you know positivedirection of things right in all honestyI I find Peterson to be quite anemotionally sensitive man like in apositive way and I think he also haslike cptsd from like dealing with the[ __ ] from the internet from hisgeneralized stardom so like I haveempathy for what his perspective is onis on it I just wish that he could allowfor himself a little bit of emotionaldistancing to think about it a littlebit more and offer a weighted critiqueas opposed to General lashing out buthe's one of his greatest strengths thathe's so sensitive to feedback and evenwith like in the personal interactionsI've had with him it's he's the guy thathe is on stage so to speak is the guywho is in person like he's actuallylistening to you he's actually thinkingabout what you're saying he's actuallyrespondingand so maybe he maybe that strengththough applied to I don't know five orsix million Twitter followers whateverhe's got going on and all that chaoticall the things totaled us labeled comingat you maybe a sensitivepredisposition is not the idealumwhateverum not skill set but what is it it's hisnature I guessand maybe we're just seeing that rightit's kind of a personal blemish gettingburnt offout in the public eye I think it's alsonone of us can appreciate and maybe thisis a fault of his to to bite off so muchbut none of us can appreciate just howmanylike scenes or like places where he'scommenting and involved on thingswhether it be political economic socialpsychological blah blah blah all the waydown the line and you know to be at allcapable of doing that in any domain youhave to spend a lot of time readingkeeping up on who's saying what on theBlock on so much stuff and so I think hespread himself extremely thin and giventhat I think he does a tremendous job ofyou know focusing in on what is ofutmost importance in each of thoseRealms but you can you got to have somesympathy for someone who bites off somuch and who attempts to I mean you knowmaybe there's an ego aspect of it tooand maybe that's somewhat condemnablebut um you gotta sympathize with the guywho's I think he's trying to do goodhe's just trying to do it in so manydifferent domains and doing so much workthat you're gonna swing and Miss inplaces because you're just you're justoverwhelmed by the magnitude yeah theamount of at-bats he's taking rightwe're gonna see a lot of swing in a messand this is kind of likeumportal saying earlier about the blacktruths you know the creative process isfraught with risk basically so if you'regoing to be the jester you're going totell some black truths you're going totell some bad jokes you're going to pisssome people offso you I mean there has to be sometolerance I guess for that too thatPeterson is trying to do a lot of stuffso we got to give him a little leewaybut yeah the opinion on and ons is worthshut yeah I totally agree but luckily Imean this maybe bringing it full circlebefore we shut it down but you knowwe're talking about de-platforming andall that kind of stuff and with each dayit seems likefreedom is gaining new ground you knowlike something like nostrils pops upagain who knows when these things pop upyou know how what the legs are like andhow persistent it'll be this one seemslike it's got a lot of legsum but it's amazing I mean imagine aCommunications and information landscapenow and increasingly into the futurewhere you know you don't have toassociate you certainly your so-calledreal identity with those things but evenyou know better you can just you cantake your identity platform to platformanywhere you go you can't really be theplatform because you can just pop up onanother platform without any real lossand then you know you sprinkle in thefinancial incentive that's being builtinto these platforms and you know socialmedia Communications payments is allbecoming censorship resistant and andnot only that I mean that's veryexciting for you know the de-platformingthat we alluded to earlier that's beenyou know really egregious over the lasttwo years notwithstanding elon's recenttakeover of Twitter but um it's evenmore exciting because when whenplatforms or companies or apps can'tring fence their users in the way thatthey traditionally have when there's notthat moat think aboutthe competition that that Fosters forthese apps to offer a better experienceto the people who use them because I'msure I'll just I'm on Damas and I'll gowherever else if it's way better and Ihave really nothing to lose by doingthat and so it's just I think it's goingto be this insanely rapid iteration oftools that we can use and what are thosetools going to be most oriented towardswell they're going to be towards the theproblems that we most feel which isbeing the platform being censored notbeing able to say what we truly believenot being able to communicate ortransact with who we want to all thosethings and so now I think this just hasopened up a massive can of worms is thewrong thing because that's kind of anegative but like it's really going toaccelerate the options that we have forbeing more free in in many domains ofour life you know and then you sprinklein a little AI on top of that who the[ __ ] knows what happens because thatshit's getting really crazy toobut uh so I'm uh I'm wildly bullish ongnoster I've been spending a lot of timeon uh on Noster and uh the interactionsI'm having there the engagement that'sthere I mean it's a real thing Nasserhas a network effect it's so and that'salways been the problem with like themastodons and trying to Port BitcoinBitcoin Twitter somewhere else I alsothink like there's this thing thatBitcoin the energy in Bitcoin moves itwas on bitcoin talk then it was onReddit then it was on Twitter then itwas on social audio and and now it's onuh now it's on Noster and so it's likebitcoinners are always very Tech forwardand they're always moving forward to thenew thing and the fact that we now haveuncensorable comms in addition touncensorable money well guess what we'rereally [ __ ] expensive to tyrannizereally expensive and that's and that'sthe best thing that you can be isextremely expensive to [ __ ] withtotally that's that's the name of thegame you do that long enough and theones that want to [ __ ] with you atrophybecause they just can't the returnsaren't there they can't they can't keepit uprightI mean I think theoh go ahead I was just gonna ask Rob ifshe's on Nostra I've got I've got to geton it no I haven't done it yet but I amShadow banned on Twitter and Twittersupport doesn't respond so I think thatis my sign I need to get an officer yeahyou got to do it yeah I've had a ton offun on master I I begged for a sandwichon there last week it wasI I like made some side hand commentabout how you could like make money andget like a sandwich from no star I don'tknow if it was like you just really wanta sandwich don't you Eric and I was likeyeah you guys caught me like here's themoney like go have your sandwich now butI mean just like this I know this is asuper rudimentary thing but that's youknow everything's rudimentary in theearly stages but just two weekends ago Iwas watching the fights having a beerand I just tweeted on not or posted onNoster like who's at a bar and wants abeeryou know and someone people respond withyou know a photo of the bar they're inor the receipt I zap them the cost ofthe beer and I just bought someone abeer in [ __ ] India New York a bottleof wine for for somebody just sitting inmy home and you know so it's kind oflike random acts of kindness generositywhatever that they're way more powerfulthan people probably think on firstglance but it's super I did oneI did one last last night or the nightbefore I was sitting around gettingdrunk and I was like uh hundred thousandhundred thousand SATs to the firstperson that can name the best RollingStones album and uh for the first personwho said the correct answer which isExile on Main Street and if you don'tbelieve it's Exxon Main Street get[ __ ] uh that person I sent them 100000 sets you know yeah and it and itscales up because if you do that whileyou're drinking you're a lot looser withyourself I have found another anotherthing that's another thing that'sinteresting about Noster uh in specificis that if you want better engagementyou want to have a better conversationwith your audience it has a totallydifferent it has a it has sat specificincentive mechanisms built right inright so like when I see comments thatare good commentsum I send the person SATs so I'm likethat's a dope comment man I [ __ ]really appreciate that you did that zapand also there's a lot of talk aboutjust getting rid of the like buttonentirely and so on NASA we're going tomove to just zaps which is sending SATsto people via the lightning Network foranybody who doesn't know and then uhrepost so you're either putting upsomething on every on every post you'reeither putting up money saying I likethis post here is money or you're sayingI like this post I'm going to boost itusing my reputation it's costly becauseI'm boosting this with my reputationright and so I think that's just a muchbecause likes are just nothing it's justthis weird thing simulator this would beon a specific client right like Damasfor example because you know people yeahwhatever the [ __ ] they wantbikes andexactly they can do whatever they wantbut this has been a topic ofconversation and I think a lot of peopleagree not just on Thomas but on otherclients as wellum it's a really interesting idea andthe interesting thing about Noster isNoster is not a Bitcoin thing it's not aBitcoin app right it's just somethingthat's been it's an uncensorable Freedomtechnology that's been built bybitcoiners and that is [ __ ] excitingbecause it's actually not a Bitcointhing it's a Bitcoin adjacent thing andif you believe in the Bitcoin story youbelieve that everything is going to be aBitcoin adjacent thing right and this isone of the first big ones yeahthose are the uncensorability of it cansomeone just explain that to me how it'snot related to bitcoin yet it'suncensorable it's just a product yesshort for note what what does it standfor notes and notes notes and otherstuff transmittedyeah yeah now it's another stufftransmitted by relay exactlyum so uh yeah basically Rob it's justyou run a relay and there are all theseindependent relay operators some of therelays are paid relays and by the way ifyou want to get set up I'll just youknow me and you can do a private calland I'll set you up with all the [ __ ]you need to know um but basically likeyou just you know you subscribe to someof these private relays paying in SATsuh the relay operators are kind of likehow to think of it they're like musicthis is a BitTorrent thing you couldthink of it no this is the torrentingjust because of the way that the nodessimilar but this is a bright this is abrand new thing it's a brand newprotocol and that's why it's so excitingand I've had Listen by the way I'm notas technically proficient as some of thepeople I talk to about this but Rodolfogave me a whole speech about it what abig deal it is and I believed himbecause I've I can see it I can't fullyarticulate it but basically he wastelling me that what Fiat Joff hascreated with Noster is equivalent towhat Satoshi created with Bitcoin in theway that he took a bunch of other thingsuh like uh private public keycryptography and combine them with thisdumb protocol relay and all this otherstuff and basically Noster is not justsocial media but it's the ability tore-architect a lot of things and peopleare now building marketplaces on Nosterpeople are trying to do GitHub on Nosterthere are all these bounties for Nosterdevelopment the speed and Rapiditeration of NASA development is onanother level this has been taking up alot of my time and attention recentlybecause I have this heuristic thatwhatever the Nerds are doing on nightsand weekends is the thing that's the bigdeal in five or ten years and this thisis soaked up all of the best andbrightest Minds the guys in Bitcoin WhoI Really respect now they're all on thisand man it's really exciting I waswatching some of the conference stuffand just the speed and pace ofinnovation and the ability to like youcan run your own Noster node on umbralif you're running an umbral node theyhooked up a private relay so you can runyour own private relay to back up all ofyour posts on Noster so now you have apermanent record of all of the stuffthat you've ever put out on the internetand you can't be banned or censored it'sit's all there right and if you want torun your own relay and push it to othersa public relay uh you'll be able to dothat as well it's a little bit moretechnical at the moment but it'll geteasier over timeyeah I mean what's being developed hereis so exciting because like it literallyhas the potentiality to pretty muchreplace most things in the web mostparticularly social media but likeacross the board and what to me the mostimportant part is is that now we getdata Purity in a very very important waybecause there's not all this micropushing and [ __ ] with us on the backend to try to sell us a bunch of garbageand furthermore we're going to be ableto adapt our own algorithms in such away to promote some people to promoteother you know certain topics and so nowwe're really owning our data but alsothe algorithms in a very powerful waythat allows for us to reclaim you knowbecause like the the internet issomething that our generation with otherpeople on the planet today collectivelycreated together and very few of us getdirect benefits of that and so if thenext iteration of the internet we allget to own that directly it's going tohave huge and massive ramificationsacross the board for how people canconduct their life connect with peoplesocialize create economics and with itbeing having this backing of bothBitcoin and decentralized nature but itmakes the political apparatus that'simbued into the internet right nowessentially flaccid and incapable ofdoing the same kind of [ __ ] it's beendoingnot Noster is the only web 3 thingthat's actually interesting at allperiod Point Blank everything else is abunch of [ __ ] and you know it'sinteresting because China censored it[ __ ] immediately the Chinese got onthere and then we started running relaysand the CCP was like shut it down shutit down and we were all like Let It Gobaby let it go you know so it's excitingit was funny it was all this Chinese andthen it would be like Fiat jaff bunch ofChinese yeahwhy is my whole feed Chinese porn all ofa sudden I have no idea the Chinesecensored it though so that means it'snot uncensorablethey just took it out of the app storethat's all you can have a desktop youknow app client whatever easilyum the thing my last comment on it isjustI don't think I mean it's kind of againin line with this like exponentialgrowth sort of thing that we can'treally um predict them but just a simpleintegration of a financial incentive andnot just any Financial incentive butlike the Bitcoin Financial incentive indigital content that you can easily uhpublish and propagate now I think it'sgoing to have such dramatic andbeneficial effects like it's so earlyright so it's just kind of fun withSmalls apps but like there will be anincentive to propagatequality content video photo writtencontent because you know right now inlike Twitterbut I still think it's generally peopleprefer things that are uplifting thatare beautiful that are you know that aregood broadly and I just think all thatstuff will be far more incentivized andso you could put out a tweet or youcould put out a video and I mean peopleare doing this now and they're gettingmillions of SATs uh zaped to themimagine when I mean how many people arereally on Noster with a Bitcoin walletlike in the thousands maybe I mean 10over 10 000 who knows but imagine whenit's tens of millions and hundreds ofmillions like if you put out somethingthat's really quality that people likeand everyone zaps you 10 cents you justmade like a [ __ ] load of money you knowso and so I think that incentive isgoing to draw people in and it's alsogoing to radically upgrade the qualityof what's being published and propagatedand great right more quality this is theexact thesis we've always talked aboutand this is a Bitcoin World elevatingthe quality of discourse of productivityof everything that gets that gets builtI was just going to say it's sailor'sorange check thesis just not inside ofTwitteryeah exactly yeah exactly it's adecentralized it's a decentralizedversion of that I kind of feel badbecause I know I I feel like elon'sheart was in the right place with thewhole 44 billion dollar takeover ofTwitter like there's way less censorshipnow and man I wish that had happened youknow two two years earlier uh but it iswhat it is and and you know Noster seemspretty confident that that type ofarchitecture and the benefits that areto be derived from it is the future andTwitter is going to be increasingly seenasyou know a dumpster fire basically youknow even if isn't it isn't it beautifulthat like he paid 44 billion and Nosterwas created by a couple of guys workingin their spare time for free like ofcourse how could it kind of always theway it is right you know and wasn't itaround the same time like he boughtTwitter and the Nasser came onlinebasically yeah well it was it was likeearlier but it became popular becauseJack became popular around the same timeI think Jack gave Fiat Jeff what like 10Bitcoin or eight Bitcoin or somethinglike that as a as a grant of some kindbut it's always this is this is thedigital version of the proverbial garagestartup right like IBM and apple rightlike IBM's yeah two guys in a garagemake apple and we know the rest of thestory Twitter is the behemothyou know a guy couple people build thisnew protocol you know on their own timefor basically nothing other than theirtime and it ends up supplanting you knowthe the big income which again is toobad because elon's probably a better uhOverlord than you know your typical IBMor you know gigantic corporate whateverbutumby the way there's there's this there'sthis feeling on Noster here's one here'sone thing that I've been really lovingabout it and I'm sure it'll change andshift every time but like right now onthe social media version of Noster thatwe're using you know I usually use thedomus client but there's a bunch ofclients you can use uh many of them arevery goodum people are very cool people are verychill ever pretty much everybody's abitcoiner very good A lot of the peoplewe like the Vibes are The Vibes arecrazy awesome and there's just like thisemphasis on like all right these arewhere the people who are motivated whocare who are conscientious this is wherethey're hanging out and uh I don't knowman it's just it's really cool to see itmakes me feel like the early days ofBitcoin in a way and uh it's exciting sowhy all right guysI'm stokedthat's three hours so I um we can shutit down but I will say this before hegoes my last last time I don't know whythree hoursI don't know why let's do three morelet's do three more now let's do it wellin line with that I mean I don't knowwhy I feel it this way especially uhconsidering how [ __ ] hard it was toget this one put together but maybemaybe it's the times we're in I don'tknow but I I'd like to do this moreoften so don't answer now but if I'dlike to bump this up to like maybe a oneonce a month sort of thing and we canjust kind of Riff on on what's going ontechnically and everything else so havea think and we can we can chat offlineabout uhwho among you are down well it's A GreatNotion but you know it takes us threemonths to get a one month thingscheduled so yeah yeah well exactly wego for the one month and we'll hit itevery three I mean that's kind of theall right you know you know what weshould if we're gonna do them once amonth we should do like uh the lastSunday of every month at X time and thenjust kind of try to stick to that Idon't know right it's gonna stop theschedule have it for him in the scheduleand not if I'm just starting a church alittle bit yes yes well this is like thepost-church social oh I gotta get highfor these more
