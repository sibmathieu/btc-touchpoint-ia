University a longtime member of the Json Advisory Groupwhere he pioneered the development ofAdaptive OpticsProfessor happer is a founding member ofthe CO2 Coalition and he served as theDirector of the Department of Energy'soffice of science from 1991 to 1993.in 2018 he was on the National SecurityCouncil studying the impact of carbondioxide on global warming ProfessorHopper thank you so much for joining usit is a pleasure to have you here todaywell it's a pleasure so you are a highlycredentialed scientist and yet you donot know the predominant view I wouldsay amongst your colleagues in mostuniversities these days wherein theyhappen to believe in the idea thatcarbon dioxide emissions are causingirreversible and destructive damage tothe earth's climate so what is yourposition let's just begin from thebeginning what is your position on whatis the impact of Humanity on the climatewhat do you think is the case wellclimate has always had a big impact onHumanity you know you can read about itin the Bible That's why Joseph went toEgypt you know there was a uh drought inPalestine so the climate is always goingto fluctuate and uh we're only talkingabout fairly small term fluctuationswhen we look at the recent history ofsay the last few thousand yearsbut of course they're much much biggerfluctuations over the ice agesnone of this had anything to do withcarbon dioxideand the increases in carbon dioxide thatwe're seeing now also have almostnothing to do with climate few peoplerealize how small the influence ofcarbon dioxide is onclimate on radiative transfer but if youdouble the concentrations of CO2 carbondioxide you've only reduced radiation tospace by about one percent you knowthat's a very tiny amountand it doesn't take much change intemperature or cloudy noise there aremany other factors to compensate forthatso the idea that increasing carbondioxide is causing a runaway greenhouseeffect or a runaway climate change issimply not true it's never been truecarbon dioxide has always changed in thepast and we're a historically low levelsnow compared to what the Earth has beenthrough previously and compared to thelevels that are best for plants yeah Imean historically looking at theHistorical track record I think it'spretty difficult to argue with peopleabout the CO2 levels of in the pastusually when I make this argument Ithink the vast majority of scientistswill agree that CO2 levels were muchhigher in the past but what is thequality of evidence that we have forthat at the end of the day you knowscience is experimentation so we can'tperform experiments with time machinesas far as I can tell so we can't go backto the world a million years ago and saythis was the this was the concentrationof CO2 back then so what kind ofevidence do we have that suggests thatit is that it was in fact much higher inthe past well there are a number ofproxy ways that you can judge the amountof CO2 in the pastone of the simplest ways is you look atstomata and leaves you know when there'sa lot of CO2 in the atmosphereplants grow leaves with fewer holes inthem you know they use these littleholes the stomata little mouths I guessin Greek or somethingto get Co2 from the air and CO2 diffusesin and plant really doesn't like to haveholes in its leaves because although itlets CO2 in it lets water out and so itdries out the plantso plants have fine-tuned feedbackmechanism and when they sense that theatmosphere has more CO2 they grow leavesthat have fewer stomata in themso if you look at fossil leaves you cancount the number of stomata and thisfossil Leaf you know and from some swampor something where it's been preservedfor a long timeand if you see fewer holes you knowthere was more CO2 and if you see moreholes you know there was less CO2because the plant is straining to getenough CO2 to live and so it needs moreholes to let molecules diffuse into theleaf so that's one it's stomata anotherperhaps the most important one for veryold times before there were leaves orleaves of plants that we fullyunderstand are paleo salts if you lookat fossil soils and you look at thecarbonate in the soil and you look atthe isotope ratios of the carbonatesfrom this you're able to model uh amountof CO2 was in the atmosphere when thesoil was formedbecause some of that carbonate comesfrom atmospheric CO2 that diffuse downinto the soil and that will have oneratio of carbon Quail to carbon 13 whichyou can measure very precisely and someof it comes from the roots themselvesThe Roots perspire they breathe just thesame way you and I do and they releasecarbon dioxide has very very littlecarbon 13 in it you know when plantssynthesize carbohydrates inphotosynthesis say uh discriminateagainst carbon 13.so the work horse and most of thesepaleo estimates of CO2 is the carbon-12to carbon 13 ratiothere are other examples of that that wecould talk about but that but that's theflavor of it that's how it's doneand what about the evidence that thesethings are as old as scientists reallytell us so I mean it's all right we canmeasure the stomata and we can measurethe ratio of different carbons but howdo we know that this is really a leafthat is one million years old or 5million years old or not you know 500 or5000 I mean at the end of the day theyall get old and they can all burn downand they disintegrate what is what isyour assessment of the state of evidenceon that question well if they're not tooold say they're less than a hundredthousand years you can use Carbon 14dating yeah because you know theatmosphere is full of carbon 14 aradioactive form of carbon that's causedby cosmic raysand the plants absorb this and so afresh piece of wood is fairlyRadioactive with carbon 14. but if youhave a piece of wood that's beensheltered from cosmic rays foryou know 10 000 years it will have abouthalf the amount of carbon 14 in itbecause it's decayed awayand if you have a piece of wood that'seven older there'll be less and less sothe amount of carbon 14 is is really thegold standard for the recent past youknow tens of thousands maybe up to ahundred thousand years it doesn't workforever because it all decays away aftera while and there's none left and thenyou're stuckso there are other radio isotopes thatcan be used for older periods and itdepends on the circumstances if it'svery old for example you can look at thedecay of potassium 40 in volcanicclasses and so you can find a leaf oryou can find uh some other remainsthat's surrounded by volcanic ashand then by looking at the ratio ofargon 40 and potassium 40 in the ash youcan judge yeah how old it is becausepotassiumCordy gradually radioactively decays butit has a very very long uh Half-Lifecompared to you know uh carbon 14.and so by picking radioisotopes ofdifferent half-lives you can uh prettywell establish what the ages of of thesediments are that you're trying tostudyI mean the oldest of all are you knowisotopes of uranium you know uranium hasuh uh lifetimes that are of the order ofbillions of years I don't remember theexact number but one of the reasonstoday we have mostly uhuranium-238 you know when you dig upuranium as opposed to you through 235which is the valuable one that's the onethat fashionable that you can use in anuclear power plant is that thethe uranium 235 lifetime is is quite abit shorter than 238 so it's mostlydecayed away from the time it was formedwhen the earth was formed but uhuranium-238 has a much longer lifetimeit also decays but much more slowly andso there's more of it leftin the early Earth uh I think you knowthere were natural nuclear reactorsthere's a famous One in West Africa itperked away with uh and went critical uhseveral billion years ago and itgradually used up most of the u-235 butlong ago when there was more of it it'smuch harder to make a natural reactor totoday because there's not much YouTube35 left in natural uranium orebut most of the dating is is based onradioactive decay yeahand so you're a physicist so you shouldknow this and you know generally whentalking to uh I like to call them carbonhysterics people who are driven intoHysteria by atmospheric concentration ofCO2 they'll generally tell you well thisis just basic physics and you don'tunderstand physics you don't have a PhDin physics so you don't know andcuriously enough when somebody who'sWorld expert at the top of this field inphysics says this these things suddenlyphysics is irrelevant for climate and Iand I've seen you attacked repeatedlybecause you're not a climate scientistyou're just a physicist as they saywhich is curious because you know ifthey're talking to a physicist thenyou're just a physicist if they'retalking to somebody else then they pullup the physics card and say oh wellyou're not a genius physicist so what doyou know about this but as a physicistwhat is your estimation of therelationship between carbon dioxide andtemperature do you think it is driven bycarbon dioxide that carbon side drivesthe temperature do you think it is thetemperature that drives the carbondioxide well certainly in the eye stageCycles it's pretty clear that it'stemperature driving carbon dioxidebecause if you look at the ice coresfrom Antarctica you can you know measurethe carbon dioxide in the air bubblesthat were trapped in the ice and it goesup and down with the ice ages so thereis a lot less carbon dioxide at theglacial Maxima like we had 20000 25 000 years ago then there is todayand that's been happening for a millionyears or so you that's about the maximumthat you could use the ice cores butevery time an interglacial comes uhcarbon dioxide goes up but it thetemperature changes first you know sothe uh the cause is clearly the changein temperature temperature goes upcarbon dioxide goes up in the ice corestemperature goes down and you know a fewcenturies later carbon dioxide goes downso the the it's a cause effectrelationship for sure but it'stemperature causing changes in CO2 atleast for the last million years now thecarbon dioxide going into the air todayis probably mostly from Human emissionsyou know there's no evidence of thiskind of increase in the ice core howeverit it as I said when we began carbondioxide hardly makes a difference toradiation transfer support you know thethe heart of this is how does radiationget in and out of the Earth We're heatedby the Sun and we're cool by thermalradiation going outand the effect of carbon dioxide is onlyon the outgoing thermal radiation it isnot very bigand even if you have no clouds and youknow half of the Earth is covered withclouds Princeton's been covered withclouds for the last three days even ifthere are no clouds where carbon dioxidehas the maximum effect it's only a onepercent effect for doubling carbondioxide that's a really small effect yesand if you put in clouds that means it'sonly half as effective you know becausethere are lots of clouds of CO2 hardlymatters at allso my guess is that you know it would bevery hard for CO2 if you double it tocause more than one degree of one degreeCelsius of warming and it's probablyless than thatbut I I think that there there has beensome warmingover the last couple centuries we've hadpretty good thermometer records I thinkmost of that is from the recovery of thefrom the little ice age you know thelittle Ice Age ended about 1800and it was much colder for severalcenturies during the little ice age andnow we're slowly warming up you can seethat for example from the record ofglacial Retreats the Retreats reallybegan in around 1800 1790 they werealready shrinking and that was longbefore any CO2 was going into the airand so that was clearly some kind of anatural recovery exactly what it wasbeing driven by is still hotly contestednobody's quite suremay have something to do with the sun Imean I would imagine that you know agiant ball of plasma that is many manythousands of times the size of the Earthis going to have a significant effect onthe temperature of the Earth yeah justyou know I'm no physicist I'm no climatescientist but I mean it'll be hard toconvince me otherwise and it seems to mecompletely backwards that people uhbegin with the assumption that this tinylittle Trace gas is as I like to call itthe control knob and and this is reallyI think the powerful image that once youthink about it like why should CO2 be acontrol knob for the Earth's temperatureit really doesn't make sense the the sunmakes a lot more sense and smallvariations in the radiation that we getfrom the Sun are likely to impacttemperature much larger Ium on this question I was extremelyinterested when the corona lockdownshappened two years ago when Aviation wasshut down car driving was shut down alot of Industry she was shut down wesignificantly reduced our CO2 emissionsfor a few months in 2020. and I thinkwhat I find interesting I found a lot ofthings interesting but I think the firstthing is there was absolutely nocuriosity among most climate scientiststo look at this example of thisexperiment that we've been affordedbecause of the coronavirus lockdownswhere here we are we've reduced CO2emissions by a significant amount I'venot seen attempts to quantify how muchCO2 has been reduced and I've not seenany attempt to try and extrapolate theeffect of that reduction in CO2 to TheClimate I have not seen anybody go andpropose a thesis saying all right I meanI think this this is what would havethis is what an honest scientificinquiry would have looked like I thinkyou know March 2020 the world gets shutdownuh if I were somebody who believed inthe hypothesis that CO2 is the controlknob for the Earth's temperature I'dmake testable predictions and say basedon our understanding of climate I wouldsay that if we reduce our CO2 emissionsby say 50 over the next three monthswe're going to get this much reductionin temperature or that much increase intemperature or rises in sea levels orincreases in the rainfall or droughts orwhatever it is you know make testablepredictions and then see whether thoserelationships held up and yet we sawvery little of that we saw very littletestable hypothesis because that eventhough that was an excellent opportunityto test something like thisso in my mind that would suggest thatthe impact of CO2 Emissions ontemperature humans CO2 Emissions ontemperature is likely inconsequentialand insignificant because if we couldshut downan enormous amount of the world's CO2and I don't have an estimate for howmuch but I would guess it must be atleast 30 percent you know when airplaneswere grounded and cars were locked upthat must cause uh some effect you knowif if this really was the control let mejust say uh sorry I don't think it wasas much as 30 percent I I should havechecked you knowbut my memory is that it was about sixpercent you know I mean I may be wrongabout that that's easy to check but itwas not a very big change was somethingthat that small you know the themeasurements are pretty noisy one of theproblems is you know there's this hugeuh winter summer cycle and when they sayCO2in the air increased by two and a halfpartsper million last uh last year what theydon't tell you is well yes it increasedby 20 parts per million and then itdecreased by 17 and a half or somethinglike that so they're these enormousupbound cycles due to the the summerdrawdown of CO2 you know during thenorthern summer you know everything isgreen and it sucks CO2 out of the air atan enormous rate so CO2 really dropsevery year goes down very fast much muchfaster than this very slow rise thatwe're observing and then you know whenwinter comes and fall then CO2 levelsstart shooting up again becauserespiration continues you know the soilmicrolisms of fungi and stuff are stillemitting CO2 and animalsand so uh it's very with this bigoscillation due to uh life uh it's hardto see the six percent change in humanemissions uh that I I think isapproximately what happened during covidso what I found interesting is first ofall I don't think there was I haven'tseen estimates of how much we reducedour emissions but I did look atestimates of the maunalao ulwaobservatory which looks at uh CO2concentrations in the atmosphere sofirst of all you would have expected tosee an impact on the temperatures of theEarth but I think what was even moresurprising even for me was that I wouldexpect to see an impact on atmosphericconcentrations of CO2 because of thereduction in our emissions and yet youlook at the trend and this is from mylatest book the Fiat standard you lookat the trends here I can see the screenright that I'm sharing yeah yes I see itvery clearly those are the oscillationsummer winter oscillations I mentionedyeah so the summer winter oscillationsare going exactly I mean it'simperceptible if I if I were to hide thex-axis and I told you to show me whereit's 2020 here I don't think you coulduh pick out which one of these is 2020.and if you look at the long-term Trendhere in figure 12 again same thing it'sjust it's increasing and with the annualuh seasonal oscillation taking placeit doesn't look like human emissions areeven driving CO2 concentrations are theywell I I don't know what's driving itbecause if you look at the ice corerecords there's never been anything likethis in the past 2000 years you knowwhere the records are pretty good forexample they're they're pretty welldocumented medieval warm period when thenorth settled Greenland and you knoweven visited North Americaand it was obviously warmer at that timeGreenland was warmer they had Farmsthere they raised things like barleythat won't grow there today but there'sno record in the ice core of any bigincreases of CO2 and it was probably atleast as warm as today back then maybewarmer the other point I would make isif you look at this rate that you seehere if I if I look at it on this slideyes in 2021 it's uh 415 parts permillion and it at 2016 it was uh 405 sothat's 10 parts per million in aboutfive years so 10 divided by 5 was abouttwo parts per million per year right soyou're you have data showing that CO2 isincreasing at two parts per million peryearwell if you do decrease that by aboutsix percent because of covid then itwould be increasing by what is thatabout uh1.9 or 1.8 something like that parts permillion per year so that would be quitehard to see on this graph I see yeah butI guess I I guess the counter argumenthere would be that I mean if the peoplewho Panic about the climate do get theirway we can't really do much more thanwhat covet did like I mean that wasmassively devastating to the livelihoodsof billions of people worldwide andwe're still paying the bill today youknow all this inflation that's happeningall over the world obviously cannot beseparated from all that so this has beenuh you know even to just do six percentreduction in CO2 was a massive massivehumanitarian cost you know we've got allthese diseases that are increasing andbecause you know cancer rates andmalaria and tuberculosis and all thesediseases are a lot of progress was madein fighting those diseases and a lot ofit was reversed over the last couple ofyears because of these lockdowns andthat barely made a dent in the weatherin CO2 concentrations and even in ourCO2 emissions so I think the the casefor you know remaking the world economybecause of taking some precaution aboutthe fact that you know maybe theatmospheric concentration and the uh ofCO2 is going to ruin us all I think isentirely flimsy but I take your pointyeah yeah I can I completely agree withyou that the policies that are beingurged on Humanity bythe uh climate Fanatics are suicidal youknow I mean it's really a suicide pactand we shouldn't do it you know it'sjust it's crazy and there is noscientific reason that we should bedoing it I mean if anything the the onething you can say clearly about more CO2is that the Earth is getting greener youknow that's absolutely clear fromsatellite images of the earth that'sclear from agricultural yieldsand so a big part of our current foodsupply is from more CO2 if we had thesame CO2 they had in 1800 we wouldn't beproducing enough wheat and corn to feedthe worldso we should be very grateful for theincreases in CO2 and more increases willbring even more benefits from bettergrowth of crops better growth of forestsyou know more abundancy lifeyeah you are part of the CO2 Coalitionand I was I I have a PhD from ColumbiaUniversity in sustainable developmentand during the time when I was doingthat PhD I was a card carrying member ofclimate hysteria Squad and for me youknow 302 at that time was just this evilthat was going to suffocate us and Iremember the first time that I cameacross your websiteand I thought to myself wow I mean itwas outrageous it was insane like thosepeople are talking about the poison thatis destroying our Earth as if it is agood thing it's it's absolutely jarringand shocking initially when you come toit but then I remembered you know myschool studies of photosynthesis andyeah CO2 is plant food it's it's one ofthe least controversial scientificstatements you could make it's a that'swhat plants eat and so now that's youknow until today they put CO2 ingreenhouses in order to make plants growfaster that's right that's right and youknow there are several reasons that CO2benefits plants some of them are kind ofsubtle that you wouldn't at first expectso the green of the earth which is veryclear from satellitesis most pronounced in arid region so yousee desert edges shrinking you seeWestern U.S getting greener you know thedeserty parts of India getting greenerand that's because with more CO2 plantsare more resistant to Drought we talkedabout stomata early earlier in the showand I pointed out that if you put moreCO2 in the air plants grow leaves withfewer holes in them and they thereforethey lose less water you know right forevery CO2 molecule that diffuses into aleaf and is turned into sugar withphotosynthesis you lose 100 watermolecules anything that allows the plantto cut water losses is a big dealyou know today a typical plant requiresabout 100 grams of water to make a gramof sugar that's because of these lossesin the leaves you shouldn't need thatmuch you should meet much less than thatif it were Starkey event the whole thingit's reallyamazing that people it's I I keep sayingit it's very much like belief in witchesyou know because it doesn't compute youknow there's no scientific basis todemonization of CO2yeah it's absolutely mind-blowing for meI think maybe the Smoking Gun you knowbecauseuh because like when you're trying todiscuss these issues you you're notconfronted with a coherent theory thatsays this is what happens and here's theevidence because if you could make acoherent scientific theory you'd be ableto make coherent predictions from it soyou'd be able to say all right here'swhat's going on this is how much CO2we're putting out and if things continuethis is what we're going to see nextyear and in five years and in 10 yearsand in 20 years and of course they don'tmake these predictions they make allthese models and the models have allthese scenarios that basically controlcontain every possible temperaturerecord imaginable and thereforeessentially they're unfalsifiable so youalways have this ever shifting set ofarguments that oh it's going to causethe oceans to acidifying that's going tokill all the fish or it's going to causethe sea levels to rise it's going tocause more flooding but also moredroughts but also more rain but alsoless rain but more snow more extremesmore hurricanes less hurricanes or fewerhurricanes I should say but I think forme the like the The Smoking Gun is theone that you mentioned which is therewere farms in Greenland there were Farmsabove the Arctic tree line today so nowit's very clear there's a point I'm notsure at which lateral line it issomewhere around the Arctic there's aline above which trees don't grow it'sjust too cold trees don't grow but ifyou dig there and people have dog therethey have found repaints of trees theyhave the found remains of farms so onceupon a time these places hadplants growing in them so Earth was warmenough to support plants growing at thatpoint which suggests significantlyhigher temperatures than what we havetoday I think arguably more than justone degree Celsius warmer right wouldn'tyou agreeoh yes if you go back to the eocene youknow there were forests growing aroundthe Arctic Circle you can still seeremains of them on Ellesmere Islandin fact the dominant tree was The DawnRedwood and there are areas in EllsburyIsland where there are entire forests ofsort of quasi-fossilized dawn redwoodsthat you can still make a campfire outof them and it's kind of mind-blowing tothink that you would be sitting thereburning up wood that was produced 80million years ago but people do that youknow you're cold enough I guess but uhyou know that that of course isextremely interesting you knowscience geophysics you know why is itthat we've stopped studying thesefascinating things and important thingsin order to focus on demonizing co2 anddriving people into poverty and it'sit's the spoiling the landscape withwindmills and solar panels is it's justastonishing that they've gotten awaywith this yeah I'm looking here there'suh elsemere Island fight for us thisisn't none of it in the north of Canadaand of coursethat's Don redwoods that you're lookingat yeah and like of course you know thearticle doesn't want to get uh thepeople the guy who wrote the articledoesn't want to get canceled and so hesays a rare mummified Forest couldn'toffer us could offers us good offers sohe's got his ground we're all messed upso I tend to notice people make grammarmistakes when they're fitting and so arare mummified Forest could offers aglimpse into how our environment hasbeen changed by humans of course becauseit's all our fault you know everythingis our fault but really I mean this isthis is a place where you can't imaginetrees having grown anytime in the lastcouple of hundred years so these arevery very old you know maybe maybe itwas humans who cut them down at somepoint but the idea that they couldn'tsee it this was I mean this was beforeprime age really had taken home this waspre-prime much less for human yeah and Imean even even if we were to even if wewere to you know say all right well allthis carbon dating stuff is suspect andeven if it was humans would burn themdown humans are powerless to stop plantsback from growing back I think andthat's the that's the key thing the ideathat pre-industrialization we wereaffecting the weather up to the pointwhere we could stop plants from growingin the north of CanadaI think is a bridge too far for even themost anti-carbon dioxide uh fanatic touh contemplate well I hope I hope so Inever say never you know it'smind-boggling for me um if if thousandsor millions of years ago we had thosetrees thereand you know Earth survived enough forus to come out of this you know whateverwas going on back then was it did notstop us from being here today being ableto have this conversation and have allof these incredible technologies thatwe've builtseems to me like anything that we can dowith industrialization is going to palein comparison because it's I mean it'sgonna take a lot of even by the mostfanatic exaggerated estimate of theimpact of CO2 on temperature we're gonnaneed to burn a lot of fuel and oil andgas in order to get to the point wherewe can bring forests back to none of itin the north of Canada what did you sayyeah that's true uh nobody really knowswhy it was so much warmer than but itwas certainly not due to CO2 it clearlyhad something to do with differentcirculation patterns in the ocean and inthe atmosphere it's too bad that youcan't get money to study that becausethat's much more important and moreinteresting than this nonsense about CO2which is uh you know it's a trivialthing except for the good things whichare increasing plant productivity but itreally is not having any effect onclimate to speak of and it can't youknow for very basic physics reasons youknow you can I know this better thanmost I I know about radiation transfer alot better than most climate scientistsdoyou knowyeah no I I would I would agree and Ithink you know the other good thingabout carbon dioxide which isn'tmentioned so yes it does green the worldbut of course also it does keep us warmand allow us to survive the winter andallow us to have electricity and then tohave houses that can withstand thestorms and build all these amazingtechnologies that have made our lives somuch better I think of course the thethe the the biggest glaring error hereis this the idea that CO2 only hasdownsides you know it's boiling theoceans it's acidifying the oceans it'sincreasing global temperatures makingthe Earth uninhabitableso you exaggerate the downsides and ontop of that I mean I'm not saying youwhen they exaggerate the downsidesignore the positives of Greening but Ithink most importantly they ignore thepositives on human economic flourishingI mean our life without mass emissionsof CO2 would be a lot poorer and I thinkof course it's it it's always strikingto me that none of the people that arevery very angry about the emissions ofCO2 are willing to live a life thatreduces their CO2 emissions I mean theywant you to do it they want to pass lawsthat ban it they want to pass taxes theywant to be in charge they want to get tocentrally plan they want to get to forceyou to drive an electric car or forceyou to use this and that or the otherthing instead of that you know use allthese unworkable inferior Technologiesinstead of the more reliable things thatwe have but they still want to fly intheir airplanes they still want to usecomputers that are impossible withoutmassive amounts of cold there learningand massive amounts of industrialprocessing and all of that needs to beignored and we want to only focus on themassively exaggerated idea that CO2 isdriving temperature in some kind ofcrisisyeah you're right Dave let me go back toone of the things you mentioned whichwas ocean acidification and uh again thepeople who talk about this haven't got aclue of what acidification is or whatCO2 does in the ocean but yeahapproximately 50 times more CO2 is inthe oceans than in the atmosphere andand we should be grateful for thatbecause it's the CO2 that has turned theoceans frombasically drain cleaner you know oceanis essentially a sodium hydroxidesolution it's extremely alkaline it'sabout the same alkalinity as householdamonga you know pH without CO2 would beabout 11.3 you know which is extremelycaustic the only thing that makes theoceans livable is the enormous amount ofCO2 that's dissolved in them and we youknow life depends on that without theCO2 the oceans would be uninhabitableso there are many good things that CO2does and and yet all we hear is you knowyou know Carbon pollution you know it'sit's absurd it's really absurd I knowand and and and this is yet another oneof these fields of research in which alot of money has been plowed in and alot of you know preconceived notionshave been validated by supposedlyscientific studies and upon closerinspection recently you know it becamepretty clear that a lot of this evidenceis pretty shoddy so these two scientistshave looked into uh this is an articlefrom science.org these two scientistswent and tried to replicate some of theworst results about ocean acidificationand they found that basically this hasbeen massively exaggerated and this is avery interesting article and it's justit's a very common thing that you findin all of these Sciences in in all ofthese things like there's a there's aconclusion that once that they want toarrive at and the conclusion is Crisisthe conclusion is things are bad thingsare going to be really bad and the onlyway for you to atone for your sinsis to basically give me money more moneyto study things and more money tocontrol your life and do it and it's youknow at a certain point you can't ignorethe pattern that you see with all ofthose things but did you agree I agreeyeah it's really uh disappointing thatthe educated people actually seem to beyeah in more shape uh with respect tothese superstitions and the ordinarypeople you know my taxi driver and mybarber I have a lot more sense aboutclimate and climate change than myacademic colleagues you know andespecially people who work outside youknow farmers and folks like that youknow they live with the client the realclimate not something on a computerscreen and they know perfectly well thatevery year is different and uh summerwarmer summer colder some you get morerain some you get less to the uh normalperson that that is second nature but tothethe Highly Educated Elite you know who'sgone to prep schools and to the best ivyleague institutions and has never wrotea you know hold a row of cornit's just beyond them they can't graspyeah yeahand and there's this tendency andtemptation to need to find a smartjustification for anything you know I'vegot a degree from this University thatmeans I can explain everything so ohit's rained a lot this year but let metell you why it rained a lot this yearwell no it's always going to you know wealways measure rain and we're gonna getan average and we're gonna get someyears in which it's below average someyears and which is above average so I'mjust going to be massive outliers on theone side uh other years is going to bemassive Outlaws on the other sidein in any natural phenomena you're goingto get this kind of variation and somephenomena you're going to get extremevariations at some certain points thistemptation that we need to find ajustification for itis behind a lot of this but I don'tthink it's the only thing that's reallydriving all of this so I'm curious nowlike I think I'm very curious about yourexperience and your impression about whyis this group thing so dominant inmodern Academia why is it that so manyprofessors who really should know bettercontinue to do this I mean this issomething I've speculated about and I'vewritten about extensively and I analyzeit from the economic perspective but I'mcurious to hear your thoughts well Idon't think it's a new phenomenon Ithink academics have always played bygroup think I recently looked up thewitch hysteria in Germany and it startedin the uh1400s just before the ProtestantRevolution Reformation I guess I shouldsay you know the uh entire faculty oftheology at cologne signed this uhthis preface to the malius malikaram youknow the Hammer of the witches sayingthat the witches are really the anexistential threat to civilization youknow just like climate today and and itwas unanimous every single one of thesepeople and they complained that therewere all these silly people out therewho wondered whether there really weresuch things as witches you know and evenhad the nerve to preach from the pulpitthat you shouldn't be uh hanging witchesyou know that this was not a good thingthey denied the science of witches thescience of witches yeah it was a scienceyeah they they had journals they had youknow important papers and you know whenwhen we had the witch trials in Salem inin Massachusetts 1690 that was a lotlater than you know the Germans so weshould have learned something in thosecenturies but we didn't and every one ofthe judges had a Harvard degree everyone of them and you know Cotton Matherwas busy selling a book you know on howto detect and hang witches you knowduring the trial he made a lot of moneywow so this is not new you knowAcademia has blood on its hands and italways has yeah and I mean it's reallythe biggest example of not learning fromhistory to imagine that we've learnedall of these lessons from history andthat somehow we are all so verydifferent from our ancestors who arearound doing all this stuff over 100years ago I mean at the end of the dayall of the people that are alive todaycame from all the people that were aliveback then so genetically we're not verydifferent you know the people who werehanging witchesuh they made children who today areamong us and so we're not much betterthan them I'm sure you know we'veinvented a lot of technology I think I'ma big fan of technological Improvementand I think you know particularlyhydrocarbon fuels have absolutelytransformed our lives right and allowedus to live in a way that most of ourancestors can't imagine you know the thenumber of things that we take forgranted like being able to stay warm inthe winter is is astounding but that hasnot changed us you know we've hundredsof years of invention and Innovation andcapitalism allowed us to develop thistechnology and popularize it and makebillions of people worldwide comfortablysurvive the winter but that hasn'tchanged our inner wiring we're still thesame group of people that would hangwitches and that would go crazy over allkinds of hysterias we're not better thanthat and you don't need to posit somekind of giant evil conspiracy to get tothe point of well why do all of thosepeople believe that and this is this isanother one of the things when you'retrying to argue with people who believethe Earth is ending you know the chickenlittles of climate there's like many ofthem don't even understand the sciencedon't even want to understand thescience they don't care about it andthey'll just tell you so how do youexplain that all of those people arewrong well I don't have to ask them youknow the idea that just because the mobis going along chanting something thenyou know they can't all be wrong youknow 100 out of 100 mob members agreethat witches need to be hung so where isyour uh what is your counter argumenthow do you explain all of them beingwrong and the answer is I don't I can'tI don't have to it's not up to me toexplain why they're wrong it's up tothem to explain why they're out there ina mob calling for lynching thetechnologies that make our life possibleno you're right size and it's it is kindof discouraging you would hope that withbetter educationthat we wouldn't have this kind ofproblem you know but actually as we'vediscussed education seems to make itworse actually it doesn't make it betterso I think the key word is bettereducation I'm not sure education isgetting betteryeah well maybe uh I don't know what youdo about it Iyou know going back to Salem many of thecommon people in Salem were Against TheWitch Trials you know when they werehanging a particularly popular preacheryou know they uh threatened to actuallyLynch the hangman instead of the thealleged wish but you know for example hesaid let him say the Lord's Prayer youknow if he can say the Lord's Prayerwhich it can't do that and and of coursethis poor guy said the Lord's Prayerperfectly and thenCotton Mather the guy selling the bookon how to hang witches rode up on hisWhite Horse and you know waved his swordto threaten the crowd and said hang himhang him it's the devil speaking so theyhung him all rightbut but it would be it was driven fromthe top it was driven by the educatedpeople and it was the common people whohad the good sense and the humanity toobject well I did not know about theHarvard role in the Salem Witch TrialsI'm uhI mean I'm I'm the biggest anti-fan ofHarvard there is I think there is nomore damning indictment of somebody thansaying that they're associated withHarvard generally it is the worst Marketof quality and I think you know theirtrack record with economics theeconomists that come out of Harvard arethe absolute worst the nutritioniststhat come out of Harvard I think are theabsolute worst and I think uh you couldmake the same case for many manyscientists and so now I can add Salemwhich trials to the long list ofdistinctions that this incredibleinstitution has missed out upon theworldwell there are Exceptions there are manyvery uhwonderful people who've come out ofHarvard but a lot of bad ones too andthat's true of every Universe certainlytrue of my University here at Princetonwhat good people came out of Harvard canyou name oneI can'tumI think in the hard Sciences uh forexample people I even knew you know I Ireally admired you know the physicistpound you know who embedded magneticresonance or you know uh so I think thefurther you get away from policy themore Academia has to be proud of youknow I'm a littleunnerved about that given what happenedduring the covid you know episode butbut in generalthe scientists at Harvard have been verygood and they've had some spectacularastronomers for example at Harvard Lymanyou know for whom you know Lyman Alpharadiation is named uhso they they can be proud of their theirscience so what is your assessment ofScience in general in the modernUniversity because here let me tell youuh how I come at this I was doing my PhDin sustainable development which was Imean we studied climate and we studiedNatural Sciences but primarily thecourse was in economics and so my areaof focus was economics and during mytime there I became pretty disillusionedwith the way that economics taught and Icame to the conclusion that a lot of itis not very good it's just really thenlater onum I looked at nutrition critically andI came to the conclusion that what theytell us about food is horrible and it'sprimarily driven by industrial producersand by inflationary monetary policywhich is where the economics comes inand that you know as inflation goes upprices of food go up and the way tofight inflation is for government totell people hey you don't need to eatmeat and all the nutritious things thatmake you strong and healthy here trysome of this cheap Industrial instancethat it's actually good for you so Ithink a lot of nutrition science isdriven by the propaganda but the needfor propaganda to tell people to eatIndustrial Waste you know with climateI've come to also be very skeptical of alot of the climate scientists becauseagain this chicken littleism and thenwith covid I've come to completelydistrust the field of epidemiology whichI believe is also another form ofpseudoscience because you know thesepeople come up with graphs and numbersand think that diseases comepre-programmed as if we're playing agame of SimCity and so you know youyou're gonna have to kill this manypeople for the disease to go through thesociety and that's not how it workshealth is an individual thing if asociety is all healthy people you knowcovid would have very little successkilling many of them if everybody'smetabolically unhealthy covet is goingto kill a lot these kind of things areignored in epidemiology where they liketo look at an aggregate from a macroperspective and that you find it inmacroeconomics you find it inepidemiology you find it in nutritionand you find it in many of thesesciences and climate and I think whatdrives it is the need for policy it'sit's driven from a policy Maker'sperspective and I think this is just away to corrupt scientific inquiry whenyou come at it from the question of whatshould the policy maker do because theanswer almost always is the policy makershouldn't be doing anything andtherefore if you need to find somethingfor them to do you're going to try andtorture the data and torture thetheories until you can come up withsomething well I think yeah you'reabsolutely right you know there's a niceuh story about that where someyou know sat trap in ancient Persia diedand he went to heaven and uhZeus said well what did you do when youwere on Earth and uh the SAT trap saidwell actually Iyou know I I really didn't like workingvery much I had this nice cushy job andI had my assistant you know sign all thepapers and take care of all the businesswell what did you do well I ate and Islept and I really didn't do anythingand Zeus said great you know come intoheaven and you know Mercury said whatare you talking about father Zeus nowhow could you do thatand Zeus says just think of the damagehe could have done with all that powerif he isn't seriousso uh you know people can talk a lot ofharm if they're trying to you know do ajob but when there's no work really todo so they make work and it actuallycauses more harm than good I agreebut what is what is your assessment ofthe hard Sciences do you think that theyare getting into the same kind ofproblems I I'm no physicist I don'tclaim expertise in physics but maybe I'mprejudiced I think so far physics isdoing okay you know they're addressingfascinating problems you knowto my mind the most exciting one is thethe missing matter what is it that holdsthe galaxies together Dark Energy DarkMatter so there are wonderful problemsout there and and the best and thebrightest are working on problems likethat fortunately they don't have verymuch to do with policy so you knowpolicy makers could hardly care you knowwhat dark matter isand so I think the further scientificdisciplines are from uh potential policythe healthier they will be and puremathematics for example is pretty farfrom any policy and so I would say the Iwould say the the most basic parts ofthe of science arestill okay but those that overlap withpolicy are in deep trouble becausethey're uhthey've been sort of hijacked by peoplewith agendas you know they're really notinterested in scientific truth they'reinterested in getting agenda support youknow with so-called science and soscience gets invented to support thisor that you know sometimes maybe it'sworth supporting but many times it's notit's just you know wasting people's timeand money freedom yeahyeah well what are your thoughts then onthe ipcc that's about as policy basedscience as it gets what do you think ofthis as an organization and what do youthink of their reports well I think someof the science especially in the earlyipcc reports was very good you know ifyou read the scientific sections it'shonest and it quite modest about planesof accuracy and uh reliability they uhwere quite clear that many things werevery uncertain in fact the first two orthree reports said there's no evidenceactually that humans have anything to dowith the climatebut then after uh a few years it washijacked by the same you know policyzealots and then the quality began to godown I think every year they come outwith a new reward and every year itbrings less credit to the scientificparts of ipcc but it certainly startedout well there were some good stuff inthe early reportsthe scientific Parts again I stressedI'm not talking about the policy yeahand so currently I meando you think their conclusions arejustified by the data in terms ofand and of course here it's verydifficult because the the reportscomprise many many many studies and Ithink you know the more people dig inthe more they realize that as you gofrom laboratory to press release thesensationalism goes up and the rigorgoes down rightwell ipcc has a problem you know they atleast their leadership thinks that theyhave to maintain this crisis atmosphereyou know that the world is coming to anendI think a number of the percentparticipants you know scientificparticipants are honest enough to sortof know that that's not true but they'reafraid that they'll lose their jobs ifthey speak up the problem is that youknow it's really not warming nearly fastenough yeah yeah I'm sure you know thatthat you know maybe it's warming at atenth of a degree per decade but that'sa third or or so of what has beenpredicted you know so the models areclearly uh just completely off they'rerunning much much too hotand nobody knows how much of the warmingthat we're observing is due to CO2 as wediscussed earlier probably some goodfraction of it is just natural recoveryfrom the little Ice Age which is stillgoing on you know that doesn't happenimmediatelyso I I think they know they're introuble and I think you know the thesmarter ones are hoping that they willretire and be uh indemnified against ityou know prosecution for fraud you knowbefore it becomes obvious that it wasthat it was a scam and [ __ ] they couldkeep juggling this for just another youknow 10 years that they'll be safelyretiredyeah but I mean I I think they're now atthe point where they need to startworrying about the fact that theirhysteria might end up costing themelectricity and the warmth this winter Imean we're at a world we're in a worldnow where Europe is really staring downthe barrel of a gun that is the nextwinter sure of course you know thegeopolitics of the situation and thedestruction of the Nord stream pipelineare obviously a huge part of it but theyare not the cause of Europe's problemthe cause of Europe's problem is theReliance on Russian gas and Reliance onNordstrom which was driven by Decades ofreally CO2 hysteria it was driven by theidea that we are going to move away fromreliable on 24-hour energy sourcesto use these unreliable sources thathave been consuming mind-boggling sumsof money I mean it's truly astoundingGermany alone has spent about 500billion dollarson wind farmswhich is just astonishing in terms ofsubsidies just the subsidies thatthey've paid for this is about 500billion dollars which is enough to buildroughlyum gas capacity for Germany twice overlike if it was 500 billion dollars youcould you know you could get 80 millionpeople in Germany and you could givethem all gas plants that give them gasout of twice uh you know you or youcould do it once and then with the restof the money buy the gas or excavate thegas I mean if you think about it and I Idon't support government Centralplanning I don't think this would be agood idea but I mean the government thatcan blow 500 billion dollars on windfarms could have blown it on gas fieldsand gas plants and then today nothinghappening with Russia and Ukraine wouldaffect German consumers you know they'dhave their own gas Fields they'd havetheir own gas pipes they'd have theirown gas plants and they'd have thecleanest source of fossil fuel out thereand they'd have 24-hour electricity andthey'd be warm in the winter and insteadthey're facing an absolute Calamity andI think it's it's gotten to the pointnowwhere people need to really I think wakeup because up until a few years ago youknow I'd been I I'd grown skepticalabout this since I finished my PhD and Ibut I just was not very interested in itbecause I thought you know who cares abunch of people like Al Gore are goingto get rich off of this t-boon Pickensis going to make money from his biofuelsand windmill stuff a bunch of uh smartentrepreneurs are going to capitalize onthis make a lot of money from subsidiesand all right who cares you know a lotof people are making a lot of money fromall kinds of different things but onlyin the last two years or so did itbecome clear to me that it's not justthat they're paying these people somemoney it's that they're dismantling thereliable infrastructure that is thebasics basic building block of ourcivilization they're basically takingthe solid foundation on which all of ourcivilization rests everything that we'vebuilt over the last 500 500 years all ofthe Technologies of the last 500 yearshave come from burning coal oil and gasand if you vilify these because of someinsane hysterical fear of these gaseswe're not we can't keep all of theseextremely Advanced products that arebuilt on top of it you know we can'thave laptops and um smartphones if wedon't have massive coal gas and oilplants there's just no way around it andthis is the dangerous thing about itthis is why I think we you know this iswhy I've been emboldened to speak aboutthis even though I get a lot of abuseabout it and I get a lot of oh stay inyour lane and what do you understand andum but I don't care you know I've I usedto live in Lebanon and I saw a grid failin Lebanon I I saw the grid get worseand worse and worse until it got to thepoint where it became unlivable and Ileft Lebanon because of thatand at this point uh it's the reason I'mobsessed with this topic is a veryselfish perspective I'd like my childrento find a place in this world where theycan grow up where they can have 24-hourelectricity and not have to spend everyday of their life worrying aboutelectricity because I've lived that andI know just how absolutely destructiveit is for your productivity for yourhappiness for your security to have towake up every morning and think aboutwhere your electricity is going to comefrom and what time is it going to comeand how to structure your life aroundthat electricity that way of livingversus the way of living where you justalways know that any switch you flick isgoing to give you what you asked of itis just an enormous difference and ifanybody listening who doesn't appreciatethis difference I hope you never have toexperience it unless of course you'recalling for the dismantling ofhydrocarbon infrastructure in which caseI hope you do because maybe that'll bethe wake-up call that you need well youknow you're very touching on animportantPoint here which is that these uh crazythings often have to have a crisis toend something a little bit similarhappened with say the uh eugenicmovement which was very popular in thelate 1800s early 1900s and Great Britainand in the United States other parts ofthe world at least in the United Statesyou knowgets found a whole generation ofeugenics experts they were all fraudsyou know it was all nonsense but theyhad journals they had scientificmeetings every little town had aEugenics club and women would go thereevery Thursday and ring their handsabout the the ruination of the good oldAnglo-Saxon race you know and how allthese dumb you know foreigners werecoming in low IQ Eastern Europeans orChinese and Japanese and it was justcomplete fraud complete fraud buteverybody bought into it AlexanderGraham Bell was a supporter of thepresidents of Harvard and Princeton andStanford supported Eugenics and althoughit was and there were many people likeyou back then who said look this isnonsense you know not none of thealleged science is true you you can seeit's obviously wrongbut it it didn't make any difference soit was not cured by uh sweet reason itwas cured by the Nazis taking it overand then taking it to the extremeand so after that horrendous experienceEugenics finally had to uh own up to thefact that it was mostly nonsenseand uh but it's a terrible way to end auhto in a sort of a fanatic movement inhumanity that it it has to end in acrisis like that but this may benecessary for the climate nonsense thatsome country or maybe Western Europemaybe California maybe Australia willhave to do everything the Fanaticsdemand and then the world will have towitness what happens it's looking likeit's going to be Germany again it'slooking like it's going to be the famedefficiency of the Germans that's goingto take these insane ideas to theirlogical conclusion yeahum they have pursued insane theindustrialization with the sameefficiency with which they have pursuedtheir industrialization I mean Germanefficiencies world renowned anddismantling their efficient productiveinfrastructure you know they've gone tothe point of dismounting nuclear weaponsas well sorry nuclear uh plants as welland now I mean they have 500 billionhalf a trillion dollars worth ofwindmills which are basically silent andproducing nothing for many many parts ofthe year and they don't just dismantlethese uh reliable plants they Dynamitethem they blow them up so you you can'tgo back and use them againyeah and I think I mean I I hope itdoesn't get become a humanitarian crisisbut it certainly looks like it itcertainly looks like it's going to be avery very ugly winter and I mean I don'tknow uh yeah I mean obviously a lot ofpeople die every winter from the coldthis is just always the reality umthousands of people or I think it's Ithink it's about four million peopleevery year who die from the cold it'sjust always the case cold is no joke andso Germany's cold of course is alsoextremely strong so this winter if it isa harsh winternice it it could be absolutely horrificand I I wonder if that's going to be thekind of wake-up call because I I can seea shift in uh in people's Consciousnesson this and there was a time in whichyou know you couldn't get invited todinner parties if you said uh youthought wind energy was silly now it'sbecoming more and more common that a lotof people are sayingyou know would have been nice if weweren't so reliant on the wind blowingin order to have electricity now that wewant to stand up to Russian invasion orso on so people are beginning to realizeyeahthe sun doesn't shine 24 7 and the winddoesn't blow 24 7 and that renders allthese solar panels and windmillsessentially Superfluous because you needto build reliable capacity that matchesdemand 24 7 and can meet the peak demandwhich can happen you know you could getPeak demand at a time when solar andwind are contributing zero so you needto build a capacity with reliable energysources and that means that everythingthat you're spending on unreliableenergy sources is just an extra costit's not saving anything uh one argumentI thought was the redeeming argument forthe institution is that well at leastwhen the wind is blowing and the sun isshining you're reducing the amount offuel that your nuclear or coal or gasplants are consuming but it turns outthat that is probably not true becausethe management of these plantsapparently and what is becoming obviousnow for engineers in places like Britainand Germany and Australia is that if youjust ran a gas plant independentlywithout having to hook it into all thesepre-industrial Technologies is of sunand wind then you can manage the loadand you can manage the operation of theplant much more efficientlythan if you try and do it while you knowbasically being at the mercy of the Godsof the weather or so the sun is blowingall right let's turn down the Gasturbines or sorry the sun is shiningturn down the Gas turbines the wind isblowing turn down the cast iron oh thewind stopped let's turn up the gas likethat kind of inefficiency in managingthese enormous reliable power plantsmakes it much more expensive to managethem and also reduces the lifeexpectancy soumit's arguably not even saving you onfuel it's just all extra costs anddegradation of our industrial capacityand our ability to providea 24-hour grid which is something thatthe majority of the industrialized worldhad basically conquered by what the 60sthat's true one of the reasons that forexample a a hybrid car gets good fuelefficiency is because they run thegasoline engine at the maximumefficiency and and charge the batteryand so they don't have startup and stopinefficiencies that when you're rampingup an engine or ramping down an engineengines run fast at a certain powerlevel and if you're constantly uhturning them on and off the efficiencygoes way down so you may be right thatit there's actually no savings and I Idon't know the numbers but but they'recertainly not as much savings as youwould thinkvery much so yeah and I agree you'vealso done work on the ozone layer andthe 1987 Montreal protocol on preventingozone depletion what are your thoughtson that well that was sort of the uhwhy not we started the practice sessionyou know for the climate hysteria wasthe ozone hysteria and that's when AlGore got his start and uhand they always plan to go after carbondioxide next they they admitted that atthat time I was the director of energyresearch at Department of energy andwe were funding a lot of that work and II knew that you know what was being saidin the Press was not what ourresearchers were finding for examplethe big worry about ozone was that itwere uh removed from the upperatmosphere there would be moreultravioletbe reaching the surface it would causemore skin cancer and the problem withthat argument was that measurementsdidn't show any decrease in UVB you knowover most of the United States and anyincrease I should say in fact mostplaces it showed decreases and forwhatever the reason and the second wasthere was no correlation you could findbetween malignant skin cancer you knowmelanomas andUVB you know you would get melanova's onthe soles of your feet you know where itwas never exposed to ultraviolet so Iwas certainly in favor of uhuh doing something that would preventdamage but I I didn't see the evidenceat the timeand so I was I I would make thesecomments that where is the scientificevidence for all of this hysteria you'retalking about I don't see it you knowand I'm funding the work so I knowso of course that that really irritatedAl Gore and so when he won the electionhe couldn't wait to fire me and I wasgrateful to be fired I was able to goback to Princeton and do some honestresearch again[Laughter]uh yeah it's a generally a thanklesstask to be working yeah well you knowthe ozone hole is still there aroundAntarctica it probably had almostnothing to do with freonyou know who nobody quite knows how itworks even to this dayyeah I think that we just as we weresaying earlier I think the more educatedyou are the harder it is to just havethe humility to say yeah well I I wedon't understand everything in thisenormous enormous planet on which welive yeah people really want to have theidea that our planet is like our homebut it isn't you know we built the homefrom scratch before this home was builtit was just an empty plot of land andthen somebody turned it into a home andevery single thing in that home was putthere by somebody who's a human beinglike us so it's possible for us tounderstand it well the Earth is not likethat there it was there before we wereborn likely before all of our ancestorswere born and maybe we just don't haveuh clear instructions Manual of how tohandle those thingsmaybe we just can't control itwell we could we can control many thingsyou know and we've done that's what'sbrought modern civilization we'velearned how to make heat engines youknow to provide the electricity that youmentioned and we've learned how to givegood health care you know so that youknow half the population doesn't diebefore the age of three and uhso you know knowledge really is powerbut pseudo knowledge is just theopposite and soso that's the problem is that you know Ithink there's this uh this uh AlexanderPope had this nice verse you know alittle learning is a dangerous thing youknow and it really is a dangerous thingyou know you you learn things thataren't true and it's hard to dissuadeyou once you think you've learned thatyeah especially when it becomes anidentity as it is for many many peopleyeah tomato has a question for you shewants to ask you what do you think arethe biggest kinds of pollution thatbother you what are the real pollutionproblems out there if we say if theozone and CO2 are not such calamitiesare there actual pollution problems thatyou lose sleep over well certainly youknow if you go to Los Angeles you knowthe pollution is a lot better than itused to be but just the pollution fromdriving automobiles used to put lots ofoxides of nitrogen in the air and youknow volatile hydrocarbons in the airand so you could hardly see from one endof the the street to the other that'smuch better than it used to be becauseof catalytic converters and bettercontrol of emissions sothat's the kind of pollution that weshould be attackingcold plants are similar you know calledwhen I was a kid I was a kid in Scotlandand we ran Scotland all coal at thattime and it was really filthy you knowyou go to school in the morning and bythe time you came home you were justblack the collar of your shirt was blackyou know from all the soot and the coaland people would you know get lungproblems from breathing the Smoky airthat's all gone now so that's realpollution so there we've done awonderful job getting rid of realpollution they don't have peace to fogsin London anymore but that used to bevery commonso we we should focus on real pollutionand uh get rid of that and uh not wastemoney on things that aren't pollutantsat all in fact which are good for forthe world yeah and I think you know thethe the controversial thing here is thatthe way that people got rid of coal wasnot to dismantle coal plants and go backto using windmills and sunshine the waythey did that was after after they usedcoal and got a lot more productive theycould afford to move to natural gas andnuclear plants and that's the realenergy transition that the world shouldhave been focusing on in the last 50years this is what I think markets wouldhave achieved in the last 50 years thepoorest places in the world I mean youmay not like coal and of course yeah Iagree with you it is a serious issue butrealistically the realistic alternativeto Coal for most people is not some StarTrek Immaculate existence where nothinggets burned but everything moves aroundmagically the realistic alternative tocall is poverty and the way out of coalis you know get rich with coal and thenyou can buy natural gas and nuclearplants which are much cleaner you couldmake quite good coal plants today thathave almost no pollutants I mean Ivisited not long ago aUltra super critical plant cold plantand TexarkanaArkansasit's the most modern plant in the U.Sand we haven't built any fence but itwas a September day and it was beautifulandblue sky and as we were driving towardthe plant you know I thought oh theplant must be shut down because therewas nothing coming out of the stack youcouldn't see anything not even steam itwas dry so there was no condensationfrom the uh Stacks or from the coolingtowers yeah but when we got there it wasrunning full blast it was subverting youknow U.S coal from Wyoming and theyshowed us the pollution controls andthey start by getting rid of the oxidesof nitrogen you know because when youburn coal properly it's very very hightemperature so you fuse oxygen andnitrogen and some of that comes out sothey bleed in a little bit of anhydrousammonia to clean out the oxides ofnitrogen convert it all to N2 yes justordinary nitrogen and then they cleanout any residual sulfur with a lime bathand then they have big bag houses wherethey clean out the very last particlesof fly ash so by the time it comes outthe top of the stack you can't seeanything all that's in it is water vaporand CO2 you can't get rid of those butthey are both good for the world youknow they're both completely naturalthey we breed both of them out everybreath that we take you know peopledon't seem to realize that we're basedon carbon you know everyone have raisedout about two pounds of CO2 a day that'sa lot of CO2 you know multiplied byeight billion people you know so itreally worries me when you demonizesomething that comes from people doesthat mean you have to get rid of peopleit's it's a common meme that's becomepopular on the internet you are thecarbon they want to reduce yeah umwell some of them do you know some ofthem are quite honest about it they sayyou know the Earth can handle eightbillion people we have to go down toless than a billion you know and sowhich seven out of eight of us has tocommit suicide or you know it's it's ascary philosophy it absolutely is andwhat's really scary about it is that umyou know if it wasn't for these insanephilosophies we'd argue to be a lotricher and we'd be able to afford a muchbetter quality of life for all eightbillion people I mean I I think of allof the money that has been wasted on allof these renewable energy sources overthe last 50 years in terms of subsidiesand Investments and all the things thathave been mandated for people to takepart imagine if that stuff didn't existat all and then just think about if allof that money was instead spent onmodernizing and improving coal gas andnuclear power plants it's notunreasonable to expect that the entireplanet would today have very cheapreliable 24 7 electricity I think it'sjust it's such a I wouldn't say trivialbut it's such a straightforward problemand it increases people's productivityso much if you just you know build asmall little gas plant and then suddenlyeverybody has got electricity and thentheir productivity goes up enormouslythe ability to survive winter goes upenormously the ability of prematurebabies to make it increases enormouslyall of that really doesn't require a lotof investment coal plants and gas plantsare ridiculously cheap when compared towind and solar and all those things soimagine if we hadn't wasted all thatmoney on that imagine just how muchbetter the quality of life would be soironically people look at theimpoverishment of you know we've hadthese Technologies for more than acentury now we've had power plants foralmost a century maybe andwe have billions of people who don'thave access to one of those things andthen you look at that poverty which isbecause they don't have access to thattechnology and they think ah the Earthcan't fit all of us and then thesolution clearly is we need to get ridof all of us or most of usyeahyeah yeah yeah and you know if they wantto control population theyit's very clear that that's easy to doall you do is make people prosperousand then you know women don't have asmany children and you have to kind ofbribe them to to sustain the populationyou know they don't want to have a bunchof kids you know it's uh it's a lot oftrouble and well all countries you knowUnited States would be losing populationif it weren't for immigration you knowbecause people don'thave enough children to uh sustain thepopulation and that's true of most ofWestern Europe it's true of Russia youknow population growth there's a featureof poverty so if you want rationalpopulations then you want to make peopleprosperous and you can't make themprosperous without letting them havefossil fuels soyeah there's just no way of escapingthat and our next seminar we're hostingAlex Epstein who wrote a book calledfossil future and the moral case forfossil fuels which really verypowerfully makes that case and I thinkhe's he's absolutely correct on it yeahabsolutelynow Nathan has a question for you oncoal plants okay yeah you alreadycovered that so I'm going to change thequestion too are you uh are you I by theway I've read a lot of your work overthe years it's it's really good to crosspaths thank you much thank you Nathanare you aware of any kind ofanalysis regarding distribution whatforty in uh in California withthe idea that they're going to have allelectric carsassuming that somehow is a good ideahow big a wire would it take to feedelectricity into LA to charge those carsthat has to be the distribution problemI never hear anybody talk about it as ifall of these tanker trucks justmagically appeared one daythe energy distribution is a big problemno it is a huge problem and people justrefuse to come to terms with that thatthe California grid today cannotpossibly you know service all electricvehicles in California can't be doneand the cost to bring it upyou know to standard to do that is justenormous just the last summer forexample people were forbidden to chargethe few electric cards they had you knowbecause the grid already was overloadedand uh this is this is with uh just oneor two percent electric cars but theywere already a problem so to make themall electric it's just crazy you knowyou can't do it they will learn you knowby bitter experiences as one of thesecrises that we were talking aboutearlier so in some ways I I'm delightedthat California has done this I wishthey would do more you know the crazierthey are the quicker we'll get to theend of this yeah feed them all the Ropewe
