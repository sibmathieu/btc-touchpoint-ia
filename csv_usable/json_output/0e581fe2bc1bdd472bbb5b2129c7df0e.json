  "text": "hello and welcome to the childrendialogues with myself Mark Vernon andRupert sheldrake hello Rupert hello Markso today I wondered if we might pick upon a theme that we were actually talkingabout in a group just a little before wemeet now which is the notion ofobjectivityum clearly it's a hugeconcern as well as sort of goal in themodern world objectivity is trusted muchmore than subjectivity as if byremoving ourselves from the study ofthings those things might show up intheir truest forms and so and become thebasis for for knowledge and so on so itseems like a good one to tease out um dowe know what we mean even when we'retalking about objectivityyes well this the talk we heard fromRichard gunton about this in Oxford iswas I thought quite stimulating and whathe pointed out rightly is that one ofthe definitions of objectivity isrepeatability it's something that can bejust repeated and one of the thingsabout science is that it's often saidscience is uniquely objective becauseit's repeatableum as opposed to subjective aestheticjudgments or something like thatum however as he pointed out thereplication crisis in scienceum has actually shown us that as amatter of fact most scientific papers intop peer-reviewed journals are actuallynot repeatableum you know this has only becameapparent around 2015. I mean some peoplehad suspected it for years including mebut theum actual quantitative studies wherepeople have actually tried replicatingtop papers in biomedicine in psychologyand social science and chemistry in awhole range of topics have shown it'sactually not replicable so this supposedpillar of scientific objectivity has iscrumbling at the moment and that one ofthe things that Richard pointed out wasthat this means we need to think moreabout what we actually mean byobjectivityI think in the 17th century at thebeginning of modern mechanistic scienceumwhat Galileo and his colleagues thoughtof as objectivity was stripping out whatthey called secondary qualities likecolor taste smellum aesthetic appreciation Etc anddealing only with primary qualitieswhich is mass momentum velocity in otherwords measurable physical features ofobjects which they then taught wereobjective and that that everything elseabout human perceptions experience wassubjectiveum and so they tried to create a sciencebased on those principlesum and actually in the 19th century thiswas taken a lot further as sciencebecame professionalized first in Germanyand later in Englandum then professional scientists beganto pretend that their way of not knowingwas entirely Superior to that ofeveryone else before themum because precisely it was objectiveand that's when they started adoptingthis third person style of writing inGerman it's slightly different they sayman uh you know one has done this but inEnglish it took the form of a test tubewas taken it was carefully observed itis considered that these results showEtc I mean this ridiculousum passive voice construction whichbecame standard in scientific reportsfrom the late 19th century onwardsprobably reached its peak around the1950s and 60sumI was being a backlash against it withinthe Sciencesum and I conducted surveys in secondaryschoolsum over the last 20 years showing thatactually in many secondary schoolsteachers are still forcing students towrite science reports in the passivevoice because they think that's the wayscience is meant to be because it'sobjectiveand this leads to this view of whatsometimes called A View from nowhere youknow as if nature just unfolds in frontof the observing scientists without themactually doing anything and they justreport what's there whereas in fact ofcourse scientific experiments are anactive process done by people who havemotives who are trying to find outanswers to questionsum who've got Grant applications tothink of who need to publish results injournals who might have colleagues whoare Rivals who they want to get ahead ofall sorts of human motives come intoplay but in the typical scientific paperall these are completely removed untilwhat's left is this travesty of what'sactually happening pretensed atobjectivity which has now come aterrible Cropper with thereproducibility or replicability crisisso I think this is an inherent thing inscience there's been this pretense for avery long time and it was actually builtin by galileira and people right fromthe beginning of modern scienceyes I remember at schoolum which was actually after the 1950sum we one of the things which we learnedwas how to write in this passive voiceum it was one of the things you gotmarked onum but whatum Richard Gundam was suggesting wasthat and there's a kind of notion ofobjectivity which might still be usefulum and he was thinking about it in termsof how we represent things and sowhen we want to study something it'squite often useful to focus on what isthe key aspect of this thing that wewant to study and so we make arepresentation of itand indeed you know in the Arts they dothe same as well and artists willproduce a picture or even a musicianwillum focus on the kind of Harmony the kindof soundsum that they seek and so a world ofrepresentations around us can be usefulum andnot just in terms of studying actuallybut in terms of opening the world up tous as it were enables our attention togo in one particular direction and sodevelop what is seen what's perceivedum but what I really liked about thisnotion of objectivity as representationis that it doesn't split the objectivefrom the subjective and that what webring to our attention matters quite asmuch as what we're attending to and soit felt a much richer notion of actuallyas you're suggesting as well there withthis critique of the passive voice iswhat's going on anyway in scienceum that the person doing the science ispart of the science quite as much aswhat's been scrutinizedyesthethe classification of um these objectiverepresentations is quite interesting andone um what he was arguing is that theseare projections and that they'reprojections that are inherentlyreductive were reducing the complexityof something something less complex soone the most basic kind of projection isis numerical or mathematical you knowhow many apples are there in the bowlsort of thing and the all the complexityof the apples the developmental form thedifferences between the apples isreduced to a number fiveum and um and then what's the dimensionof the apples notes of seven centimetersor 7.3 centimeters on average orsomething like thatum that that this projects down itremoves is actually what Galileo isdoing removing all what Galileo arecalled secondary qualitiesum and projecting uh just one particularframework of looking at what's therethen he showed us another way ofrepresenting another projection which iswhere we project down from threedimensions to two where we make drawingsdiagrams or two-dimensionalpatterns or formsum and then if we want to representchange or movement then all thecomplexities have changed are reduceddown to kinematic representationsum which could be in the form of ananimated video for exampleum that these areremoving many of the elements of ourexperience and projecting aren't justsimplified as it were lower dimensionalversionsumand I suppose one advantage of thatwhich he points out is that once you'vegot those then you can they can becritiqued by other people and you canhave a kind of you didn't use the wordinter-subjective but you can have anagreement or you can have criticism soif I say there are five apples in thebowlum and you can't you find there are sixthen we can then count them together andfind one of us is right and the otherswrong and we can correct the informationwe can make it more inclusive in morepeople would agree on on what there isthereso in a sense it focused attentionimplicitly on agreement between peopleum and by reducing down through theseprojections simplifications uh it'seasier to agree if we have to saywhether we like the taste of an Applefor example then we're not going toagree necessarily and I may prefer aWorcester Permian and you may prefer aGolden Delicious and I don't suppose youdo but you mightum and there then that's soa different thing from agreeing thatthere's a unit Apple there and it weighsso much and it so in a way it'ssimplification and obviously for manythings it works because in many waysmechanistic science is very successfulwe've got rockets and jet planes andiPhones and so forthum it's very successful butit has to leave a great deal outand what I liked too was it's it's it'susing reduction in order to you knowserve various purposes but withoutfalling into reductionismum because you know we might look at thesame bowl of applesum I say five you say sixum but my point of view might beobscuring my vision so I only see fivethen six and so therefore I can considermy role in my eraum and so you know open up my perspectmy perspective to seeum the Fuller picture which you see andyou know that's just an example of howthe subjective does play a role even inthe reducing to something that can thenbe shared in a public spaceum and I really like this becauseOwen Barfieldum this philosopher philologist who's soinfluential on me and one of the thingswhich he tracked was whenum the subjective became eclipsed by theobjective and you partly outlined thatwith the history of scienceum in the Renaissance and then in the19th centuryum but Barfield was also I'm veryinterested in howumprior to that that which is subjectivewas actually thought to be crucial tounderstanding the the heart of thingsand because in a way when you as a as ascientist or an artistany kind of contemplative activity whenyou make contact with the world thenature of your contacts who you are andwhat you bring really matters because itmay or may not connect with that whichis the heart of the thing you'restudyingum you know the mere appearance theprimary qualities may not actually tellyou everything you need to know maybeeven not the most important things thatyou need to know about what you'restudying and so earlier writers likeAristotlesuggested thatto knowsomething in its fullest truth you haveto ask yourself you know who am I as anobserver and what am I bringing to mystudy quite as much as just as it wereabstracting yourselfum forpurposes of utilityum not because reductionism is going totell youum the sort of ontological deepest truthabout somethingand so you know who one isum as a scientist as an artist as adiscursant as a philosopherum subjective really matters becausethen you can know whether you're notjust perceiving but maybe resonatingharmonizingum you know really open to all that theworlds might be bringing to youyesthe original meaning of subject wasn'tjust subjective in our modern sense buttheuh the the system as it is in itselfincluding eternal life if it has one andwithin Pan psychismum we we could say that many forms ofself-organizing system have a kind ofinner life inner being as wellum and all of this is reduced by thisobjective method but I suppose onedifference that this new approach isgiving us is that the Galileo and thefounders of mechanistic sciencesecondary qualities were assumed to beinside heads or inside brains and notout there in the world at all theobjective world was considered toconsist ofatoms and particles and things with massand velocity and so forth all thesephysical properties and later electriccharge temperature Etcumand everything else was supposed to beinside human headsum but there's that thatobviously truncated the world it madethe whole world a kind of world oftwo-dimensional three-dimensionalmechanistic interactions with nothingelse going on but obviously there's agreat deal else going on in the world Imean when flowers have scent and perfumeand stuff uh and and they attract beesor other pollinators it it's not justabout what's inside human heads it'sabout the way nature Works flowers wereattracting bees a hundred million yearsbefore humans evolved soum the uh the the role of thesequalitieslike color and scent and so forth is notjust in human brains andum we can still count flowers and we cansay a rose typically has five petals andso forthum but by realizing this is a reductiveprojection yeah it's not claiming thatthe rose is nothing but five petals madeof little bits of matter interactingphysicallyum it's just saying that's one way wecan look at it and it's a convenient wayfor the sake of of scienceI mean that that you're mentionedmentioning there and the inner life ofthings not just our own inner life andthe return of secondary qualities andthat reminds me of things that otherscientists at this Gathering and weresaying and when Richard was presentingthis idea of objectivity which was therole of Aestheticsand howwhen again a scientist but also you knowother people engaging with the worldthey use qualities like Beauty fitum pattern in order to guideum their engagement with with the worldand so that sense of once in a lifemeeting innate qualities these secondaryqualities within the world around oneyou know feels like it's actually reallyimportant for Science and because thingslike Beauty and patternum are real guides towards what'sregarded as a review a revelation ofwhat you're studying I mean one of thescientists at the meeting was eventalking about seeminglyum very abstract things like proteinsfolding in cells but how proteinsfolding in themselves have a kind ofVitality have a kind of lifeum that you get to know as the scientistum it it wasn't personalizing theprotein but there was certainly a senseof a kind of mutual exchange orcommunication that the scientists mustlearn to understand and readum and guides like Beauty as well as thehabits say of a protein molecule it's inour life are really important in scienceit's not just a kind of optional extraactually is the bread and butter thedaily life of the scientistyes I think the um you know the kind offield work that Bruno LaTour didscientists and Labs how they actuallyinteract it was so different from theidealized model of the scientistobjectively and dispassionately trustyou know collecting facts testinghypotheses with no emotional involvementEtcum it could actually be extended to akind of interview study of scientistsabout how they actually think about thecells or the tissues or the organisms orthe subatomic particles they'reinteracting with I suspect some of themwould personalize them and some of themmight feel they're getting to know themon a personal kind of wayum all of this of course is washed outand bleached out in this whole processof writing scientific papers but I'venever actually seen a study of howscientists think of them the systemsthey work on andhow are they you know do they dreamabout them I mean we know from a fewfamous examples like calculate and theBenzene ring that scientists do dreamand dream about problems they'reconfronting in their workbut I think it would be a veryinteresting study if you look at just aninterview study of scientists indifferent fields and to how they feelabout the systems they're working withactually um in a way I'm I'm aware ofone suchum paper that's been written I mean it'sby the cognitive scientist John vivekiand he with colleagues um studied theway that the scientists operating theRover that was sent to Mars how theyrelate to the Rover on Marsand found that their imaginativeengagement with the Rover was quite asimportant as the measurements andcalculations that are necessary as wellyou know so much so that they wouldpretend to be the Rover to work out whatmight be a good move for it to makeum and so that um deep imaginativeinvolvement which John mavaki wouldwould put down to how we need um what hecalls relevance realizationum you know amidst the mass of data thatwill come to one even in a relativelysimple scenario picking out the datathat significance and importanceum is really really hard you get acombination explosion as it's sometimesput even with relatively small amountsof data and so this relevancerealization is really important and atleast the way that we humans do it is byusing our imaginations enteringempathically into that which we'reengaging with and that tells us how wemight make the next move what might besuccessful what might be a failure yeahso he actually you know talked towatched I think and the scientistsengaging with the Mars rover and Ibelieve even sort of saw them crawlingaround on the ground and so onum really and personalizing the Roverand it became a kind of character tothem so you know it was reallyfascinating I I think that has been it'sbeginning to be done partly asum the whole notion of what it takes tohave cognition opens up and itselfum ceases to be a rather reductiveundertaking largely because of thefailures of artificial intelligenceum that it's realized that there's a lotmore going on in the conscious mindum than pure manipulation of of data butit reminded me too Rupert a comment youmade and I wonder whether this links aswell you made the observation that arecent study in nature had suggestedthat innovation in science is reallyflattening or even falling off even asmore and more money is put into scienceand I just wonder whetherit's because science has become such areductive methodum that uh that that that's happeningand so you know reductionism almost youmight say issort of turn aroundum toum to buy science itselfyes well there's a study in nature uh isum one that looks at Innovation anddisruptive research within scienceand many people have noticed overdecades now that the rate of innovationin science is slowing down there's fewerand fewer real breakthroughs yet moreand more people are working within thesciences and to expenditure on scienceis increasing everywhereum so there's a very strong law ofdiminishing return at workum and one of the things that theauthors of this study in nature did waslooked atthe references it was a analyzed hugequantities of data using computers usingpublished papers and bibliographicalmethodsum bibliometric methodsand one of the things they looked at iswithin a particular field of science sayprotein chemistryum would a paper in that field be quotedin say botany or physiology or somethingelse other fields of inquiry or would itonly be quoted by other protein chemistsand they found it in in until about 30or 40 years ago there was quite a lot ofcross-quotation of papers that sciencewas networked across subjects it's nowgot more and more narrowed down so thatpeople are only creating things in theirown field probably because there are anyreading things in their own fieldthere's so much research going on youcan't read everything and to get aheadin your own field you have to publishlots of papers and get them cited byother people in the fieldum and so the the pressures are on sothey're just narrowing down theattention of scientists to narrow andnarrower fields of Interest with lesschance to cross-pollinate with lesschance to think about ideas that aren'tjust already there within the field soscience is now set up in such a way thatit is designed to develop to deliversmall incremental improvements toknowledge along established lines whereanything that's disruptive that reallydoes lead to new breakthroughs newdiscoveries new potentially newtechnologies and so on is actually notfavored by the system in frozen out byit in factumso I think that themoving back from thosefalse and discredited view ofobjectivity discredited because thereplication crisis objectivelydiscredits it as it wereum the the to this view of of ofobjectivity is useful projections insome circumstances but always asimplification always a a reductionumis is much more helpful andum if in scientific education peoplewere empowered to use their imaginationsencouraged to use their imaginationsencouraged to pay attention to theirdreams or toum ways of seeing how things could beconnected in new waysum it might lead to a great deal morecreativity of course it may not be goodfor their career because if you if youdo new things that other people aren'tdoingum then you're not going to get grantsfrom established fields of sciencethrough your papers in the top journalsin the stand fields of sciencebut something has to be done if we wantthe Sciences to go on being productiveand creative because right now literallyhundreds of billions of dollars arebeing spent every year on scientificresearchand most of the papers published are noteven cited onceum so the point is most of it is acomplete waste of time and manyscientists are devoting their wholecareers to pursuing scientific successin terms of numbers of papers injournals which affects the way they getgrants but in terms of the understandingof nature or the betterment of humanlifeit's really a waste of time and theawful thing is it's not even much funfor those doing it because uh the thethe methods of the pretend objectivityEtc the the attempt to expunge allpersonal elements from at least thepublic reportum means that science has a fairlyjoyous activity for a lot of scientistswho are working really hardum on very narrow problemsumso there's a lot wrong with the way itis at the moment and and I thinkthinking about objectivityMay indeed help to free things upyeah I mean maybe because of the senseof even despairum maybe you know scientists will beginto think can we do it in other waysum you know share quantity again anotherkind of reductionum it's not really serving as well andthen of course as you were talking thatI was remembering Merlin your son's bookentangled lifeum where of course he very deliberatelybrings in all sorts of experiences andweaves it into the discovery of more andmore about this world of fungi and soyou know that's done hugely well it'sbeen recognized by the Royal Societyum so perhaps there is a mood abroadactually to to weave again once morethis notion of the subjective and theobjective and of course it's not justgood for science but it's good for wehuman beings because the worldum can officially be re-enchanted againas well can come back to life from themthat's good for all sorts of reasonsvery good well thanks very muchum I hope that was worth teasing outum for for our listenersum and that they've had thoughts um andmaybe even will have conversationsamongst themselves as well um but it wascertainly good to hear Richard gunton'swork and to explore again now so thankyou thank you Mark",
