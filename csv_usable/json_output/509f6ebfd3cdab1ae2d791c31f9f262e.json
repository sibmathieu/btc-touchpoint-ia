phoenix total dead bitcoinsbefore we dive into the video of courseshout out to sponsors of the show legendi/o this is where you can use yourbitcoin for a variety of differentservices they have their bitcoins saveas account where you can earn intereston your bitcoin paid in bitcoin theyhave their bitcoin back loans this iswhere you use your bitcoin as collateralto secure a Canadian or US dollar loanso if you're in a pinch you don't wantto sell your Bitcoin you think it mightbe a bad time but you do need to getyour hands on dollars well this could bean option for you and finally they'vegot their b2xoffering and that is where you can getdouble the exposure to the pricefluctuations of bitcoin if you want tocheck them out head to the link in theshow notes below and if you utilize thatlink to get a bitcoin back loan they'llactually give you an additional $50 aBitcoin for free into your accountand secondly we've got Rhys wallet thisis a physical Bitcoin gift card that youcan pick up at a corner store near youand gift to anybody it is super easysuper idiot-proof i love it i've giftedit to lots of people all you do is youpick it up you gift it to anybody youlike and they download an app theyscratch and scan a code on the back ofthe card and it creates them their ownpersonally held bitcoin wallet on theirphone and sends them an on chain Bitcointransaction for the face value of thecard if you head over to Rhys walletdot-com and click on the locationsbutton in the top right you can seewhere you can pick one up it's currentlyonly in Canada but keep an eye openbecause they are looking at expandingand if it's not near you at the momentyou can always go to coin cards CA andget one delivered and with that let'sdive inso as I said before this wallet iscalled Phoenix it is a Bitcoinlightning' wallet it is currentlyavailable on Android and they do haveplans to come to iOS for the iPhone somepoint in 2020 but as of the point ofrecording this video that has nothappened yet we're going to take a lookat basic setup we're gonna take a lookat how to send and receive lightningpayments and actually how to send andreceive into your lightning wallet usingregular Bitcoin transactions and thenfinally we'll take a look at some of thefeatures that this wallet boasts as wellas some of the trade-offs made to makeit this simple to usehere we are in the Google Play Store andyou can see it is labeled as Phoenix andthe Bitcoin wallet from the future has alittle bit of details it's got prettydecent ratings so far so we're justgoing to go ahead and installokay a pawn install once you open theapp you get two options either a newwallet or restore your wallet so if youhave a backup that you want to plunk inthere you can but we're gonna do a newwallet and everything is essentially setup right away with a couple extra stepsfor your own security and peace of mindthe first one here is we're going tobackup our wallet so we're gonna hitbackup my wallet and this is much likeany other Bitcoin wallet you would seeout there where you receive a seedphrase which is twelve words this wouldbe the backup of your wallet think of itlike a copy of your house key it is incase you lose your wallet you smash yourphone you delete the app by accidentwell this is your safety net and if youinput this to restore a wallet you willaccess your funds once again however itis like a house key in the way that ifyou give it to somebody like in thisvideo I will be wiping this wall adapterbut with this information anybody canaccess your funds and take your funds ifthey so please so please be carefultreat this very very delicately and donot save it anywhere online use a pieceof paper and a pen and keep it offlineand so I will be back momentarily afterwriting this down okay having writtendown my backup phrase I can check thebox here and hit confirm and that's allset and secondly I'm gonna want to setup a pin code because if somebody getsaccess to my phone I don't want them tobe able to just spend my money so andhit set a pin I'm gonna hit the toggleswitch here to turn it on and it is asix digit PIN for the purposes of thevideo we'll keep it simple one two threefour five six I don't recommend you usethat pin but hey okay we can also dobiometric authentication which is justan easy way of saying use my fingerprintone two three four five six sounds goodscan your fingerprint okay alright sothat savesthe pain of having to put in my pinevery time I want to spend money or openthe wallet for that matter okay and sohere we are on our main screen we see afew things we see a balance we have abig blank open space down below that isactually where incoming and outgoingtransactions will be listed so a historyof everything there is an option for anFAQ up in the top so if you havequestions odds are you can find theanswers to them there and then justreally simple down below we have thelittle settings wheel in the bottom leftand then you have receive and sent andso there's just one other little thing Iwanted to go into which was the settingswheel and I just want to adjust a couplethings in the display and this issomething that a new user may want to doright off the bat anyways so when youhit display there you've got a fewoptions here so I want to set my localcurrency if you're from the US you don'treally have to do anything but if you'refrom elsewhere like myself I'm in Canadaso I'm going to hit Canadian dollars asmy other option for fiat currency theBitcoin unit is set to Satoshi's whichis the smallest piece of a Bitcoin youcan have there are 100 million Satoshi'sin a Bitcoin but you can set these otheroptions or if you prefer to just see howmany full Bitcoin you have you canchoose that here but I will keep it assuch I like Satoshi's easy to wrap myhead around and finally applicationtheme this is just whether you want thelight or the dark theme and I actuallytend to prefer the dark so we're gonnago with that now other than that I'm notgoing to dive into much else here butelectrum server for those of you arecurious that is essentially if you'rerunning your own electrum server oressentially bitcoin node you can connectthis wallet to your own Bitcoin node tokind of I guess trust lessly operatethis wallet a little bit more instead ofpushing the responsibility of running aBitcoin node on to the people at asyncand Phoenix you actually get to do ityourself so a bit more of an advancedoption you don't have to get into thatif you want to see your recovery phraseagain it's there other app accesssettings such asfingerprint and pin all that and thenadvanced stuff like the channelslightning channels you don't need to bediving into that right now especially ifyou're relatively new to Bitcoin for thepurposes of this video I will actuallybe changing this back to the light themejust to kind of keep it easy to seeso on the main screen here there is noadditional setup required so we're goingto go ahead and we're actually going toreceive some Bitcoin right out the gateso what we're gonna do is we're going totap the receive button down below andthis gives you a scannable QR code nowsome Lightning wallets will allow you tosend directly to a lightning walletwithout any sort of like an amount ofpre a pre-made amount or invoice createdhowever you do have the option to createthat here so you can just hit the copybutton to copy this this invoice to theclipboard or you can create an invoicewhich would be them the write buttonhere with little pen and pad of paperand so I'm gonna do that I'm going torequest an amount of 10,000 Satoshi'swhich is just over $1 Canadian and I'mgonna hit create invoice and so itbrings me back to this screen exactlythe same and so if I was in front of anindividual with another lightning walletthey could scan this and send me themoney or I can tap and that actuallycopies the invoice to the clipboardwhich can then be shared with anotherindividual via a text message emailmessaging app really anything you likeso what we're gonna do is we're gonnaactually use that invoice and we'regonna open up another lightning walletthat I have here called wallet ofSatoshi now it's important to note wallof Satoshi is a custodial wallet meaningthey kind of actually have control of myfunds whereas fenix is not so since Ihad copied that invoice to my clipboardwallet of Satoshi automatically detectsit and asked me if I want to cancelwhere I actually pay it I will payokay and so I went over to my wallet allI had to do was hit accept and thatpayment is now incoming now it isimportant to know for those technicalpeople wondering the reason that I hadto accept that time is actually therethey needed to open a lightning Networkchannel with me which is all done in thebackend and kind of abstracted away butthe first time you should receive alightning payment you'll likely need tohit that accept button but outside ofthat I can see that I now have a balanceit is a little bit less than 10,000Satoshi's that I sent over which is afee that is incurred for opening thechannel but after that I should be ableto receive with really no hindrances ofa fee like that which was actually justso you know it was half a percent of theincoming balance so we're gonna doreceive one more time this time we'regonna do an invoice for let's say 1000satoshis I'll create that invoice andI'll copy it head over to wallet ofSatoshi and I can see invoice for athousand I pay it and you can see rightaway it's this payment sent and I cansee right away I didn't need to approvethat one I can now have inbound capacityand it will just be for that firstinbound payment where you need to hitaccept after that you shouldn't havemuch of an issue and so I head back tomy wall balance and now I can see thetwo incoming payments that areimmediately spendable okay so let's seehow to send a lightning payment out soback to wallet of Satoshi I'm going toreceive some money into my wallet andI'm going to add a custom amount I'dlike to receive two thousand Satoshi'sand I'm going to copy that invoicehead over to Phoenix now with Phoenixit's a little bit different it doesn'tauto detect a a copied invoice so youactually have to go to send down at thebottom right the first time you're goingto need to allow your camera so if therewas an invoice in front of me in theform of a QR code I could scan itotherwise if I have something copied onmy clipboard I just hit paste and itobviously sees the invoice and I can hitpay and off it goes if I head over towallet of Satoshi I can see that I'vereceived the payment and I'm good to gothere okay so back out I go and now Ijust want to show you one othervariation of a way to send a lightningpayment from Phoenixso some wallets allow as I said for anon invoice based payment meaning thatyou don't pre select the incomingamounts so wallet if Satoshi is one ofthose as is Phoenix and so what you cando is actually copy this lightninginvoice which will be for a zero amountwhen I head over to Phoenix and I chooseto send and I paste that payment requestor scan it it's going to give me alittle warning and it says that thisinvoice doesn't include an amount thismay be dangerousmalicious notes may be able to stealyour payment to be safe you should askthe payee to specify an amount in thepayment requests are you sure you wantto pay this invoice so there can be arisk of loss of funds by utilizing thisit's not a large amount that I'm sendingI'm not overly worried so I'm gonna justgo ahead and hit confirm this is idealfor something like tipping by the waybut in this instance I'm actually goingto hit send all so what I'm doing isthere's an invoice for zero and I'mopting to overpay it that's actuallywhat's happening on the back end just ifyou're curious but I can hit pay hereand it will shoot off a payment and if Igo I cansee now in wallet of Satoshi I'vereceived a payment and my balance nowtopped up and I can see all the previoustransactions right there so back intoback into Phoenix and now I have a zerobalance I've received a coupletransactions and I've sent a coupletransactions outso what I want to dive into now is whatif you have Phoenix wallet and you needto fund the wallet you'd like to havefunds on the lighting network but youdon't have a way to receive lightningpayment yet you don't have anybodywilling to send you a lightning paymentand all you have is Bitcoin on chain anda regular Bitcoin wallet well thebeautiful part about Phoenix wallet isyou don't need to worry about that youcan simply hit receive and if you lookdown below there's actually a buttonthat says show Bitcoin address and thisallows you to receive an on chaintransaction via the Bitcoin network andinstantly convert it into a lightningChannelso all I have to do and you should notethat there is a fee associated with thatand what that helps cover is the cost ofthe on chain transaction to open thelightning Network channel with yourwallet ok but it's pretty negligibleagain half-a-percent not not terrible soI'm gonna go ahead I'm gonna hit proceedand very simply I'm presented with a aBitcoin address which I can tap and itcopies the address to the clipboard nowI do have another wallet open right nowcalled samurai wallet and very simplyI'm gonna send out a regular Bitcointransaction I'm just gonna go send andI'm going to paste in the address that Icopied to the clipboard now of course ifsomebody was in front of me with aBitcoin walletthey could have scanned that QR code asI mentioned before but I'm gonna sendover hmmlet's say 60,000 Toshi's okay andeverything looks good here now I'm goingto I'd like to be this this to be arelatively quick transaction so I'mgonna bump up the transaction fee alittle bit here it's not super high butI'm gonna go ahead I'm gonna hit Sendandoff it goes okay and now if I navigateback to Phoenix wallet we're gonna see alittle update here in a second on thescreen so I'm just gonna tap okay therewe go and just below my balance it stillsays zero Satoshi's but down below itactually says plus 60,000 SATs incomingwith a little chain beside it meaningit's on chain it's a regular Bitcointransaction so the way this works isonce there is a confirmation on theBitcoin blockchain which typically isaround 10 minutes this balance will showup top and it will actually be spendablevia the lightning Network so all I haveto do to fund this wallet using aregular Bitcoin wallet is send a regulartransaction via the receive screen andthe regular Bitcoin address option andwait for it to confirm so we'll comeback when it's confirmed okay so it'sbeen a few minutes and it looks like theon chain payment has gone through nowyou can see here I sent over 60,000Satoshi's however because again there iscosts associated with opening alightning Network channel it is aslightly diminished balance that I'mreceiving here so fifty-nine thousandseven hundred so it's about half apercent to create the channel but it'sall automated in the background andthat's kind of where that comes fromonce that channel is open again ofcourse to receive regular lightningpayments is negligible when it comes toactual fees associated with this incontrast to a non chain Bitcointransaction so we were able to fund viathe regular Bitcoin network via regularBitcoin address and we can also likewisesend out from the Lightning Network solet's just make sure that this isspendable we'll just do a demotransaction here you can't receivedumb coffee I head over to Phoenix andwe'll just do a test send hey that outlooks good on both ends okay so clearlythis balance is spendable and usable butlet's say I didn't want to keep this onthe Lightning Network any longer and Iwanted it back in my Bitcoin wallet wellI can do that as welland it's quite simple so I'll go over toa Bitcoin wallet and I'm going toreceive Bitcoin into this lightning orinto this regular Bitcoin wallet wellI'm just going to copy my Bitcoinaddress okay so I have that copied on myclipboard or if I were in Phoenix walletwhen I hit Send I could just scan aregular Bitcoin address and it willrealize what I'm trying to do and itwill automate the process or if I'vecopied a Bitcoin address I can simplypaste payment requests it says this is aBitcoin address the payment will be aswap meaning that it will swap out ofthe lightning Network and into a regularBitcoin transaction you don't have to doanything on your end it's just allautomated so I'm going to put in anamount here now the one thing that Iwould really love out of this which theyhave on the lightning end but they donot have on the Bitcoin end is to beable to send all and just have the onchain transaction fee incorporated intothat unfortunately that is not possibleso what I'm going to do is I'm gonnasend over 50,000 Satoshi's I'm gonna hitrequest swap and then I'm going to hitpay because there is a fee associatedwith that and it's going to be a lot ofmath trying to figure out exactly whatthe fee is versus versus the totalbalance now upon sending the swaptransaction it will go out as a regularBitcoin payment right away and if I gointomy samurai wallet I'm just gonna hitrefresh and I should see a new incomingtransaction yeah and there it is thatwould be 50,000 Satoshi's or 0.05Bitcoin so that has executed as expectedand I've got this left over balance andso if I want to get rid of that then ofcourse I can send a regularlightning Network transaction as we didbefore to sweep out the wallet entirelyand then I'm safe to delete it butideally I would love to see thatsend all via swap option integrated intoPhoenix and I'm sure at some point theywill look at doing that because they'vealready abstracted away a lot of theunnecessary extra steps and most much ofthe rest of the wallet so kudos to theguys at Phoenix and asyncnow one last thing I wanted to show youguys before we wrap up here is in thesettings toggle down at the bottom leftand this is for some of you advancedusers you might want to see yourchannels your incoming channels so if Igo to channels list here I can see thatthere are two channels open to mylightning wallet and since I've sent outall of the Bitcoin via lightning NetworkI can see that on my side of the channelI have zero satoshis but I can receiveup to the following amounts withoutincurring any additional costs as far asopening new channels again this is kindof abstracted away and not meant forregular users that just want some quicktransactions at the lowest possibleprice point but if you're interested inthat it is there for you and if you wishto actually close all the channels youcan do so right here but for most peoplethat's not going to be necessary for youso now that we've actually looked at andutilized the Phoenix lightning walletlet's just kind of review some of thefeatures that these guys have added thatyou may have in some places but to havethem all aggregated in a single walletis is pretty great so number one youhave automatic incoming channels so youcan receive a lightning payment themoment you set up your wallet and youdon't have to actually go and set upincoming channels and incoming liquidityon your own that's all handled in thebackend and you don't need to worryabout it number two you can spendunconfirmed incoming funds so when youreceive a lightning payment asyncthough guys that created Phoenix walletare actually sending you what's known asa turbo Channel meaning they open alightning Network channel with you withcapacity already allocated on your sideof the channel so that you can send itnow there is a caveat there it is atrusted channel up until the point theon chain Bitcoin transaction itselfconfirms but it does enable you forquick expenditure of funds and andthey're kind of taking the risk on thatbackup is super easy it's a single 12word phrase much like any other Bitcoinwallet so you can actually delete yourwallet lose your phone whatever youwanted whatever you accidentally dohopefully it's an accident but then youcan simply download the app again inputyour 12 words and your funds are theresimilarly like other Bitcoin wallets youcan also import that backup phrase let'ssay if a sync would out of business oror Phoenix wallet just disappearedaltogether and you couldn't access itanymore you could go into a separateBitcoin wallet likes electrum for yourdesktop and input those 12 words and itwould be compatible and you would beable to access your funds another greatthing that that Phoenix has done here isthey use something called amp and thatis short for atomic multipath paymentslet me break this down for you typicallywith most lightning wallets at themoment you areLimited to send and receive based on thelargest channel that you have so if Ihave a channel between myself and anindividual that's a hundred thousandSatoshi's I have another channel betweensomebody and somebody else that is fiftythousand Satoshi's well I can only senda maximum or receive a maximum of ahundred thousand Satoshi's becausethat's my largest channel but with ampit actually utilizes all of the Bitcoinacross all of your channels and findsroutes to a single pay and end pay pointwith an aggregate of all of thosechannels so in that instance I can sendthe full hundred and fifty thousandSatoshi's as opposed to being limited tomy largest channel same with incomingthey also utilize something calledtrampoline nodes or trampoline yeah Ibelieve it's will just say trampolineanyways they they use trampoline nodesand what this helps do is find easyquick routing for you now there is aprivacy trade-off in doing so for themoment because not as a sync is the onlyone running trampoline nodes but in thefuture when more people are running themit'll actually it likely may be moreprivate than a typical lightning paymentwhich is fantastic but at the at thispoint just know that the trampoline nodethat you're utilizing in order to getthat quick easy routing and haveeverything abstracted away does come aprivacy trade-off meaning that asyncwill know the destination of yourpayment okay because essentially whatyou're doing is you're doing one hop toasync and then giving them furtherinstructions on where to wrote thatpayment so they do see that but at thesame time it's also wrote it through torso other than async it's stillsemi-private okay so keep that in mindand it is a cost to being early to thisstuff and having it work so easily butover time those privacy trade-offs willdwindle and disappearalso one other great feature that theyhave here is submarine swaps and it'swhat you saw when we utilize the regularBitcoin addresses where you can swapeasily into an out of lightning networkusing the Bitcoin addresses and regularon chain transactions so you canseamlessly swap back into a regularaddress you can just scan a regularBitcoin address and send and vice versaso all in all when you pile this allinto a single wallet it's just a lot offeatures and it kind of goes to show howquickly lightning Network is evolvingand becoming more seamless to use when Ifirst started using lightning Network inearly 2018 setting up channels andunderstanding what the hell was going onwas was quite difficult now it's allbeing abstracted away and making iteasier for the end usernow let's touch on fees yes there arefees associated with using Phoenixwallet a lot of them have to do withbeing able to fund channels and andswapping in and out of regular Bitcoinbut what other fees so for sending alightning Network transaction there is abase fee of ten Satoshi's which is abouta tenth of a cent at the moment plus 0.1percent of the total amount sent so tokeep that in perspective if you send ahundred and twenty thousand Satoshi'syou will be paying a fee of around onecent at current Bitcoin prices so that'sabout 120 Satoshi's now channel creationso if you're receiving a lightningnetwork transaction and you have notreceived one yet so like that initialfirst transaction we received its 0.5%or half of a percent of the totalincoming amount for that transaction ifyou're receiving a regular Bitcointransaction or if you're receiving alightning Network transactionyou don't have an incoming channelalready so for both of those thingsactually it's 0.5 percent or 1/2 over80% now if you're swapping out if you'resending a regular Bitcoin transactionout or you're sending from yourlightning wallet to a regular Bitcoinwallet there are no fees that in any waygo to async or Phoenix or anything likethat but it can vary based on whattransaction fees on the actual Bitcoinnetwork are so you are paying theregular Bitcoin network fee to get itout onto the main chain so keep that inmind and that can vary now it should benoted that the fee is here in thelightning wallet and in async andPhoenix right now there's not a lot ofcontrol but that will change andupcoming releases and you will have morecontrol over how you set those fees andand you can balance the trade-offsyourself so all in all I think I thinkthat Phoenix is fantastic I love is thatinteracting between lightning and onchain Bitcoin is becoming more or lesspretty seamless and my inclination is tobelieve that in time the end user willnot really if they don't want to willnot need to know whether they're sendingon chain or off it will automaticallyassume that the cheapest way of sendingthe transaction is the best so what Imean here is in the instance of sendingof sending lightning transactions withthe current fees that we have here as Isaid you're sending 120,000 Satoshi's oraround 10 dollars you're paying a 1 centfee but if you're sending larger amountsso if you're sending $100 then you knowyou're gonna be paying about 10 cents infees and if an on chain transaction willactually be cheaper than that you can dothat manually through this wallet but Iwould love to get to a point where itsaysgives you a prompt and says hey it'sactually cheaper to send on chain do youwant to go ahead and do that and thenyou just go ahead and send an on chaintransaction I think that's where this isheaded and eventually all of that willbe abstracted away and people will justsee okay well you're sending this muchthis is the cheapest way to do it and Ilook forward to the growth of this spaceand the growth of lightning inconjunction with on chain Bitcoin Ithink it's pretty bright so guys let meknow what you think about Phoenix walletin the comments down below give it a tryand and yeah I look forward to all ofyour
