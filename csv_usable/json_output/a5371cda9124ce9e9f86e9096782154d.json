The Miracles of God, the CreatorYou want to see proof of God?Witness then these miracles.Open your eyes.Look around.See existence.See creation.Orderly.Beautiful.Expansive.Your open eyes alone let you witnessThe miracle of creation.The miracle of existence itself.Observe that you are aware of it.That consciousness exists.That you are aware of existing.Aware of being.Witness the miracle of being aware.Aware of being a being.Awareness of being alive.Witness the miracle of life.You are no ordinary being.You are a human being.A being with a mind to understand this.And to learn so much more.The miracle of understanding.And you can act on this understanding.You have free will.Agency.Your fate is not determined.You can act to make your future.Witness the miracle of freedom from determinism.These miracles are all self-evident.They require no proof.Open your eyes.Take in what you see.Introspect.Reach the inevitable conclusions.None of this has to be.Existence itself did not need to exist.Time itself did not need to flow.Order did not need to be.It was created.Crafted.To perfection.Through unimaginable work and energy and effort.So that you may live.Within time.And learn to understand some part of it all.And choose your actions.To determine your journey.To determine the course of your life.2. The Miracle of Human Creativity.You want to know your purpose on Earth?You have been blessed with all these miraclesSo that you too can create.You are a creation with the capacity to create.In fact, and in truth, to survive, you must create.Creativity is an act that begins with opening your eyes,With learning truths about reality.Like the truth that you can take action.Action to change that which is around you.And by learning about realityAnd rearranging its constituentsYou change the worldFrom what it wasInto what you can make it.You can create a dwelling by rearranging wood and stoneTo make it exist in actual reality,Even though it did not exist in realityUntil you created it.You can create garments by creating fabricswhich are themselves rearrangements of fibresfrom cotton bolls, sheep’s wool or even silkworms’ cocoonsSo that you do not have to live in the naked state in which you were created.You can create a fire,a meal,a bed to sleep in,tools to ease your work,philosophy to understand ever more,and art to express your appreciation of it all.Look at you!You powerful, creative being.When you create you fulfill your purpose.You see your potency.It’s power,and it’s limitsThe power to understand reality and to change it,within the limits of the nature that creation imposes.Your appreciation of your potencyYour appreciation of what you createdIs all you needTo appreciate yourselfTo love yourself3. Co-creationYou are not alone.You are surrounded by other creative beings.Other Human Beings.Your neighbors.People, who, like you, create.Who, like you, can love themselves for it.With your neighbours, you can create much more than you could alone.You can work together.Combining each of your creative energies.To create what you could not create without one another.You can Co-Create!Do not forget,It is only with another human being,That you have the power to create the greatest creation humans can create:Yet another human being.New life!New, human life!You yourself are here because other human beings, your parents, acted to create you!And they cared for you.And you also enjoy that which your neighbors from all over the world created and made available to you.Look at how blessed you areto be a free beingcreated by and cared forby god and humans.4. Loving Your NeighbourDo you see now why you should love your neighbour?Do you see why you should love him even as you love yourself?Because in love, in cooperation, you can create an even more beautiful rearrangement of reality.This is the proper relationship between all humans — Brotherly love, Peace, and Cooperation.Co-Creation.5. In the Image of the CreatorTo createas the creator doesFor the appreciation of allIs to act in his image.Any creation you create,Uses his creationsIt uses that which has been previously createdAnd is therefore a co-creation with him.And to co-create with HimIs to learn from Him and from nature which he createdAs your teachersAnd to obey the nature he createdAnd to worship it, and him.He wants for you to createWith your neighborsFor you are all something he worked so hard to create,With so much effort, and creativity:Human beings, a creation capable of creativity itself!6. Your Work Is Your TestimonyYour work, your deeds,Your creative and co-creative work,The best that you can create,does not need any explanationor any defence.It speaks for itself.It is its own proof.It is the proof that you worked honestlyExercising the gifts God gave you,The miracles of creation,To make something in this world,as good as you can make it.Made by youand your neighborsFor yourselfAnd for your neighbors,And for the rest of God’s creationsAnd for God himself.7. Your Creations as Testimony to God’s Creative AbilityYour creations are themselves your testimonyThey are your testament,To show God and othershow good and creative his creations — human beings — can be.Your creations are a show of your love and skill for creating,The act of creating being the work most in the image of God, the Creator.And your creations prove to all how greatis His achievement:That in creating everything in the universe,And in creating you and your neighbours,He created beings who continue in His pathOf endless creation.8. Judging Your WorkWhatever your work isDo not judge it in comparison to the work of others.Judge it only on the basis of whether it is your best work.You are not here to better your neighbour.You are here to do your best.And that is all.And that is a lot.And that is sufficient.And that is how nature and the creator judge it.9. Your Neighbours’ WorkDo not envy your neighbour’s skill and achievement.Appreciate it.Creative skill is holyPraise their creativityWork with your neighbor,In cooperation.Today, your neighbours areeveryone,everywhereon Earth.Because through our combined creativityWe have brought all of humanity together.We have created creations that send communication at the speed of light.And created creations that transport ourselves and our other creationsover land,by water,And through the air.We are all united by these creationsto communicate,to further create,to trade with,and to love one another.10. Choose Love and Creation Over Hate and DestructionSo do not hate your neighbour.For in so doing you miss out on the opportunity to co-create.And worse, you risk becoming involved in the actthat is the opposite of creation.The act of destruction.Remember:You are completely free,And so you do not have to fulfil your potential of being creative.With freedom comes responsibility and choice.You have the ability to hate.You have the ability to destroy.You have the ability to lie.You have the ability to steal.These are vices.They are opposites of virtues,The opposites of loveOf creativityOf truth seekingOf generosity, collaboration, and co-creation.But these vices are acts contrary to your purpose.And contrary to the purpose of all human beings.So do not succumb to them.You must choose to rid yourself of the vicesthat lead to viciousness towards your neighbors .You must choose to replace them with virtuesthrough loving your neighbors.Fulfil your purpose to createIn loveIn peaceFor all mankind’s gloryFor the glory of creationFor the glory of God, the creator.ReligionGodWorkLoveCreativity----6FollowWritten by Tomer Strolight2.3K FollowersDestroying the lies that imprison peopleFollowMore from Tomer StrolightTomer StrolightThe Legendary Treasure of Satoshi NakamotoPrologue: Bitcoin Is Spiritual Awakening:22 min read·Sep 6, 2022--33Tomer StrolightHello.
