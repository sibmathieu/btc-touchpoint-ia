  "text": "let's do it rickstar how are you manlooking forward I'm good yeah I'm goodthanks for having me geez massive honorum I'd say probably liketop three podcasts I've ever listened toum I mean I I did uhI was doing some maths the other day andI worked out that I've actually listenedto more podcasts in terms of time spentthan I have in my five years doingengineering wow no I mean it's it's notsomething I mean top three so well thankyou that's an honor for me but um thatis crazy but I think it's like many ofus you know umonce you start falling down the rabbithole all this stuff becomes socompelling and sure there's a lot ofrepetition and I think that'sparticularly becoming the case nowperhaps I'd love to ask you a little bitabout that as we go forward but you knowthis thing is so foreign in Bitcoin andthe implications are so broad thatyou're just likeyou your appetite is insatiable forfiguring out ways to contextualize andunderstand it you know and so you end upyou know doing like 20 hours a week inin podcasts and reading all the Articlesand listening to guy Swan and andreading the books I mean it's just it'ssuch a it's such a deep rabbit hole it'sso I think we all you know are kind ofin the same position that you were inabsolutely nuts I mean like I think forme it was uhfirst falling down the money Rabbit Holewithin well the investing rabbit holethen the money rabbit hole in the goldrabbit holeand then the Bitcoin one and then I wasmy appetite just got like you said soinsatiable for knowledgeum and thenat one point I found myself likefunny enough in inundated with Bitcoinknowledge like the sort of the technicalside of things and I was just like I wassearching for something else uh maybe abit more like the philosophical side ofBitcoin and that's when I think I foundyour podcast at first and I mean you youlike to go down that route anduh that that was amazing for me likethe sort of Bitcoin fixes this meme kindof comes to mind thereyeah I mean it's definitely the I'mobviously not on the more technical sideof things uh but I certainly appreciatethose that are but you know to me it'sjust it's where the interests or theCuriosity naturally flows becauseI often say like if something isn'trelevant in terms of how it impactsBehavior thenhow can you say that it's relevantbasically you know the when we talkabout all these things being changed orfixed or what have you I mean they'rethat way because they're inspiring somesort of different Behavior or allowingsome sort of different behavior in usand you know the phenomenon that thatdraws so much of my attention isthe the observation that that seems tobe the case you know you look around itbitcoiners who have who are on therabbit hole journey andI mean they'll they explicitly say allthe time that they've changed theirperspective on a lot of things over thecourse of trying to understand thisthing and then that that's obviously ledinto changes in Behavior which hasgenerated changes in their life andtheir lifestyle which has caused changesin their you know their Ambitions andtheir perceptions of progress and youknow what they see their future as andso you know it becomes one anall-encompassing change and two whatseems to be incredibly positive and sowhat could be more compelling thantrying to understand what it is that canuh Inspire such a change like that youknow and then you wind up in the Deepbecause the everything prior to thisthat's generated that kind of a changehas been in the realm of the deeplyphilosophical or theological discussionsyou know or objects or ideas and so howcan we not wind up there if we're reallytrying to figure out like why the hellis this thing so powerful basicallyyeah it really hits you at your corelike it brings you down you sort ofyou start questioningI I started questioning myself oneverything like my my I mean likeeveryone says that come on yeah likethey've all been done they've all gonethrough suchimmense changes I mean I I can't evendescribe myself four years agoI'd like I'd be interested because youknow we talk about that we talk aboutthat Fiat self right and again like thisis clear I mean the demarcation Pointmay not be clear because it's a gradualalbeit in intense progress but at thispoint many people can look back and saythere was the Fiat version of me andthere was the Bitcoin or liberated orhowever you want to characterize a rapidhole version of me and they'redistinctly different and uh that initself is a very kind of bizarrephenomenon but it's so consistent andit'sso consistently positive that you know Ithink it's deserving of of attention soI mean I don't want you to share stuffthat you're not comfortable sharing butlike what what was kind of your journeyofuh emulating the Fiat self being reborninto Bitcoin as it werewell so I mean I'm I'm actually open tosharing pretty much anythingum it's a philosophy I've started totake like uh soI went down um when I first startedUniversity I got diagnosed withdepressionand umthis is quite a kind of a long storyI'll make it short but umeffectively the doctor the thepsychologist couldn't help me work outwhat my problem was and she was justlike look I'll send you to a doctor he'sgoing to prescribe you somesubmits she drew me a little littlediagram of a ship with two islandssaying what the meds are going to dothis is escitalopram or uh I thinkthat's an snrium and effectively the little my littleboat is not going from one Island to theotherso not carrying that sort of uh signalright and so what the pillar is going todo is it's gonna it's gonna give theboat more gas and it'll get it to theother side or help but get to the otherside what's it what's that NRI just forclarity I think it's snri which is aserotonin non-react inhibitor I think Iwas in that one uh okay I can't remembernow butum so I was like oh cool you know 19years old I definitely feel like I had aproblem uh I'll give it a go and then Iwent to the doctorand the doctor told me yeah take thesefor like six weeksum see how you areum consult with the psychologist andyou know we'll we'll take it from thereand I was like okay cool I went back sixweeks time it it really helped meumII say in that mindset back then itreally helped me right now I disagreecompletelyumuh what it did was just numb meum so anyway so I went I went back toand I was like this is really helpingyou know I can cope with class now I cancope with other factors in my life youknow no no ups and downs no picks andtroughsumum and so she said well that's that'sgood like I mean don't worry the thethis pill works like a vitamin when yourbody's you know used enough of it itexcrete the rest and you know yourbody's clever enough to deal with itthat was this that was the messaging Igot around this number one that yourbody's just going to excrete it numbertwo it's not you know nothing to worryabout and it's just a short timeso little did I know this is going tohaveit's it's honestly been the hardestthing I've ever had to do was to kickthat drugand I took it for six years becauseevery single time I try to come off ofit I went cold turkey the doctor didn'ttell me that I had toum either wean myself off this drug Ihad no idea I mean no clue what wasgoing onum so every time I came off I had theselikeincredibly dark thoughts and darkbehaviors and things and and every nowand then I'd like I check myself and I'dbe like you knowuh what am I saying that forand I didn't realize that this was theprofound effects that these drugs had onmy brainuh they they change you and you come upwith it like and so or who's saying thatthere's another valid question like whatis that voice yeah saying all that[ __ ] up [ __ ] you know it's not methat's what I don't identify with thatno you know and uh and So eventually Imean this six years down the line I umafter trying to come off three times uhone whilst crossing the ocean theAtlantic Ocean uh I was horrendous yeahand about in a 80-foot sail yacht wow umyeah that was pretty bad and thenyeah I read a bookwho was it I can't remember who it wasby but it was like the the sort ofeffects of antidepressants and how tocome off of them and I read all of thisandand it just it completely blew my mindat howumat how much this doctor didn't tell meand then if you go and watch uh dopesick I don't know if you've seen DopeSick no man that puts into that puts uhit puts the opioid pandemic into or notpandemic that uh epidemic rightum into like it really shows you what'sgoing on there in America and it reallyand that for me just showed me how thedoctors getum effectively lobbied I mean they gothrough they go to conferences and youknow everything's paid for and at theconference or these sales reps tell themthis is how the drug works and you knowdon't worry about it like do this likethe the theopioid one is is pretty bad because theylied to the doctorsand they told them don't worry that youknow that this will help for the pain ifthey experience more pain it's probablybreak through pain so you double thereyou double their prescription and it'sjust the most addictive thing in theworld like it's it's crazy soyou know that there's just one commenton it that that was one thing during thepandemic that it you know this cleveruse of language so in that casebreakthrough pain right which reallymeans it ain't working and during thepandemic we had these breakthrough andfraction infections and they were youknow basically super common like youknow everyone the the vaccine obviouslydidn't stop you from becoming infectedand but they use this term breakthroughto suggest that it's unusual or thatit's like you know it's not supposed tohappen or it's not you shouldn't expectit to happen and and it's notbreakthrough is a is usually used in apositive light so it doesn't convey asense of like not working or malfunctionit convey like it's both it's both vagueand suggests infrequency when the factis it's a sign of malfunction and it'sincredibly frequent but this is you knowone obviously just one example of howthe language is so perverted that allowyou know uh intentionally basically butanyways intentionally I think yeahso anyway so that basically drew me backuh and I've I've had a lot of reflectionon it and I actually don't blame thedoctor or the psychologist for for thatbecauseI mean if you think about it like thewe're soI don't know I think we're sick as acivilization inspires against us youknowin every domain media every medical andfinancial everything everythingBitcoin lands on everything is a scamaround me like it's it's not slackumyeah well I mean let's pick it apartbecause I think it's useful to do so orat least pick it apart a little bit Imean first of all as you saythe pharmaceutical companies have atremendous amount of wealth and part ofthat is because of the regulatorycapture and the jacking up of prices andthe monopolies and all that kind ofstuff so then they have the the thewealth to wine and dine and schmooze allthe doctors right and make the rulesright exactly and set set the the uhtreatment the protocols exactly right soit's like for this illness this is thethe medicine and it creates an entireaura that that's what medicine is orsorry I shouldn't say medicine that'sthe drug so for this condition that'sthe drug and that becomes the Paradigmof medicine and then they whine and diein the doctors and everyone looks aboveboard and everyone's nice and normalperson and so it normalizes everythingand then the doctors are have a standardof care effectively that that emergesaround that and so above anything elsewhat that incentive that provides themum cover basically you know becausedoctors are very apprehensive aboutstepping outside of the lane becausethey know you know someone could suethem and if they if they're being suedbecause they stepped outside of the thenormal Lane of things then they're gonnahave a big problem on their hands but ifthey just stayed in the normal Lane thenyou know they have a a very viabledefense to you know to to push backagainst those things so you have allthose things uh conspiring to have thedoctors kind of diagnose and prescribein a certain waythen you have the fact that doctors aretypically uh have to see too manypatients right they have they have toyou know churn through however many inthe course of a day so they don't havethat much time to spend with eachindividual patient to really analyze youknow the totality of their life andtheir health and their physiology andtheir psychological State and reallyreally assess the person you know theyzero in on one particular aspect or oror function or pathology of the personand so and you know that's you've madeeven worse in the socialized MedicalSystems which you know many in the worldare at least quasi that and so you haveand well so those alone are enough tomake it so that the patient is notgetting a very high standard of care andthey are not being addressed as a fullyou know symbiotic organism they'rebeing treated you knowumas a machine almost and as a as a very avery isolated approach to problemsoccurring in that machine and no wonderthat when you have all those differentforces and I'm sure there are many moreand if there's any you're thinking of uhplease let me know but no wonder thatthe individuals that are subject to thatcare are having sub-optimal outcomes andresults because that's that's a terriblea horrible system of incentives thatgenerate poor treatments that generatepoor interactions so no wonder peopleare getting spit out of that system youknow confused and worse off and you knownot knowing where to turn to for helpand worse off by Design because I thinkthen you come back into the systemlooking for another cure and the systemwith the pharmaceutical system feeds onyou once more so it's almost like anexponential income for them you knowmake you sick in the beginningcure your and and like you were sayingso theI think doctors fix the symptoms youknow like you you said treat you like amachine oh there's you know a little bitsomething wrong over here uh we'll justfix that there's a cool drug for thatand it takes it away but really what'shappening is the the underlying problemis you're sick yeah you're just sick andand there's so many factors dietuh lifestyle like uh even thoughtsloneliness like everything likeeverything is yeah to be fair to thedoctors most people only want the badsymptoms symptoms to go away they don'twant to deal with all that other [ __ ] sowhen they go into the doctor's officethey say hey I have a pain I have this Ihave that make it go away and the theentire incentive structure that thedoctors are nestled within is isdirected at doing that you know so it wewe can't put all the blame on the latteryou know blame does have to be to be beput on the patients and how theyapproach their own health you know andthis is kind of the the theme withBitcoin is that people are so muchtaking responsibility back forthemselves like they're taking moreindividual responsibility and part ofthat obviously has to do with health andit's not just you know waiting till youget sick and then showing up at thedoctor and say hey this is wrong with mefix it go away it's it's disruptive inmy life and you know I don't want todeal with it it's like well I mean areyou managing all the other aspects ofyour health because obviously it's allconnectedyou know nobody wants to very few peoplewant to do that so again as much as I dothink the pharmaceutical companies TheRegulators the doctors are culpable fora lotyou know it takes two to tango basicallyyeah well and responsibility definitelycomes into it like and that's one thingthat uh so right coming right back to myinitial story where I said I speak abouteverything now is becauseuh instead of just going to apsychologist paying some money forsomebody to listen to youum I kind of believe that the that youyou know depression and things like thatthere's an underlying issue there'strauma in your past you know somethinghas triggered aa a sort of a block in your brain or oran addiction to something alkalism andand things like thatpretty much stem from traumaand so I figured like okayum the drug didn't work well it did workbut I hated my life I mean I was I wasjust flat you know there was no sadnessthere was no happiness there was nothingit was just I was an NPC effectivelyrightum and so I just decided like okay I'mgonna instead of internalizingeverything I'll rather externalize itum and regardless of what the feedbackis at least it's feedback it doesn'tmatter right at the end of the day it'slike you could listen to me and youcould call me an [ __ ] for going offthese drugs or or you could say no Ireally feel your pain or or you know anykind of response is a response and ittriggers some form of dialogue whichthen either you go deeper or not or youknow it just it carries you somewhereand I really thinktalking about it is just it's it's thebest form of therapy likejust externalize it put it out there andsee what happens you know I think youyoudefang it first of all by talking aboutit like that because when you when youkeep something so much to yourself whenyou're so afraid of releasing it outinto the wild I mean it becomes likesomething that eats you alive from theinside you know this this little ball offear just grows and grows and grows andgrows until it kind of consumes you andit's like always behind the veil of ofyour eyes and it's it's it's impactingnegatively everything you do whereas ifat a minimum you can just get it outthere and talk then it's it's not asscary anymore it's not as mysteriousit's not as it's notworking its uh destructiveit's not you're not having a destructiveeffect beneath the surface at least ifit's going to have a destructive effectright it's it's out up in the surfaceand I think what most people find whenthey do that is one people appreciate ittwo many people can relate becauseeveryone has some sort of Darknessinside that's you know that they thinkis shouldn't be there let's sayum and threeI think that's the only way you know youmentioned being an NPC as a result ofkind of having flat emotionsyou know one of my motivations for doingthis when I started one was I was justincessantly thinking about Bitcoin and Ineeded to I needed an outlet for it allbut another one was like who knows ifyour perspective is optimal if it'struthful let's say and you want to knowthat because presumably to engage theworld most fruitfully a truthfulperspective is what's required tointerface with the truth of the worldand then determine a way forward and Imean how does one especially in todayyou know in this day and age with allthe social media algorithms influenceevery influencing everything like how doyou know that the way you're seeing theworld and the ideas and the philosophiesand the perspectives you have areare as uh truthful as they could be andfor me one of the answers to that iswell you can't really know but one wayof gaining more data to your point is toput in your perspective out there yeahright and seeing and seeing what kind offeedback comes back on it because you'reprobably gonna some of that feedback isprobably going to contain Insight ontoyour blind spots you know on yourperspective like you did stuff that youdidn't know you were representing orconveying or communicating and you knowit takes courage to do that for surebecause you know oftentimes we we shyaway from our imperfections but I thinkif you have aif you have a reverence for truth you'regoing to engage in the things that uhwell yeah but bring more of it to you orat least give you the opportunity tobring more of it into your life and yeahhaving these types of public discoursesI think are a very uh powerful way of ofdoing that yeah 100 I mean alsouh something I'm thinking about recentlyor at least over the last few months isuh and I say it a lot is to myself ischecking my biasumand like you said having these you knowpublic debates and things like that isthe best way to check your bias Godargue like I I'm really loving I lovedebating I love arguing and I also I'mnot afraid to be wrong I like I don'tmind it I'll I'll be pretty stubbornwith my argument because I believe youshould be if you do believe in somethingyou may as well run with it untilsomeone can prove you wrong like why notyou know well wrap it to the fullest andthat's the only way to make sure that ifit's defeated you know it's validlydefeated let's say you know and then youcan you can adopt the whatever idea hasovercome it or defeated it I think yeahand take that defeat with humility andmake the change you know like it'sanother thing is like I I feel likechange has got such a negativeconnotation but thanks to bitcoinchange is now amazing to me I think Ithink everyone should embrace changelike you you're going down a certainpath you find something wrong on thatpath you must make a change to keepgoing down that path is literally thedefinition of insanity like yeah whenyou know something is different well youknow something is wrongumso yeah I mean take the change withhumility make the change and move on andthen and you know carry on with youryour journeybut you know I agree and but I think Ido think this because I want to ask youhow Bitcoin has influenced this thisprocess for you and your experiences butI do think this is one of the ways inwhich Bitcoin emboldens people to dothat because it gives them such agreater sense of security and confidenceabout the future that you can let go ofsome of the apprehension you have aboutthe Identity or the ideas or whateveryou've you've so far created to inter tointerface with the world to interactwith the world and to get what you wantout of it you know Bitcoin is basicallya mechanism for helping you get more ofwhat you want out of the world in factthe best that we've ever had and so onceyou begin to understand that andaccumulate that you know basicallyaccumulate it uh I think it it permitsyou that humility that flexibility thatopenness to other ideas and otheridentities and other philosophies uh inin your perception whereas before youknow you mentioned that and I don'tthink anyone listeningwould argue it but we live in quite asick Society you know we said before howmuch is conspiring to kind ofpervert and distort and and uh steer usyeah exactly andand so you can from that perspectiveagain you can empathize with people thatdevelop a fairly rigid perspectivebecause all of that is is scary anduncertain and you know you want todevelop a kind of a shell that allowsyou to Bear all of that and I think alot of people probably do it by ignoringit or or acting like it's not there andthen then you're completely untetheredfrom reality then I mean and this isthis is the MPC sort of meme rightbecause people who are these people thatjust ignore what's actually happeningand develop a Persona in relation to aworld that's not even there I meanthat's what's really scary about what'shappening today as far as I can tell butwhen you and so I can I I can appreciatewhy it's difficult to do and as you saidwhy very few people today have that it'salmost like you either have thatorientation you're trying to maintainthat Persona in relation to an like afalse world let's say or you have anorientation that's most directed towardstruth and if that is your orientationthen humility is just a bypro you don'teven have to try to be you know humbleas you're engaging in this searchbecause you care more about figuring outwhat the truth of Any Given matter isthan whether or not you seem right oryou win nice yeah right so yeah that'sthat's a really good point yeah like II would yeah I meanI'd say I take the humidity but itprobably comes automatically andreally uhI'd sayI almost don't give a [ __ ] what peoplethink about me anymore you know and I'vesaid it to quite a lot of people yeah uhbecause Bitcoin like as you said takesyou down the rabbit holes and you godown some pretty insane rabbit holes inthe search for truthumbut if you can keep the mindset ofchecking your bias you know you canconstantly you can be led down somecompletely you know stupid rabbit holesand I believe againuh that's part of the conspiracy you'vegot to add in those sort of misleadingones to to kind of make sure that theguys are catching on to the truth arekind of stopped a little bit or sloweddownumand so yeah I mean at this pointyou're right I don't think I I don'tthink I take it I don't need to take itwith humility I do anyway because I liketoI like to assure that sure whoever I'marguing with that like I'm okay tochange like I'm not arguing here for thepoint of making you look like an idiotI'm arguing for the point because Ibelieve what I believe andif you believe what you believe let'sargue let's have a debate like and andthe truth wins in the end well at leastat least of uh you know a portion ofthatum the truth will come outand we move on you know like cool we'vewe've achieved something yeah well thatthat's the objective right and and allthe better if it's mutually shared Imean those are the really gooddiscussions with two people whogenuinely have diverging views onsomething but who both also genuinelythem being right is subordinate tofinding a greater approximation of thetruth then those are the really greatconversations because you again youdon't have that adversarial like I'mjust trying to beat you for some sort ofego you know or maintaining my myperspective sort of reason but it's it'sreally like you know we both want to getto the bottom of something let's let'stry to get to the bottom of it but Ithink you know I guess myum the point about humilityis like let's say humility is a very avirtue and you know I'm not saying theBitcoin rabbit holeuh negates the responsibility that weall have let's say to embody and expressvirtues in our life I mean there's stillayou you know life is lived everywherelet's say and there's always anopportunity to refine those virtues andexpress them but it is interesting howand you know this is tangentiallyrelated to bitcoin because I thinkBitcoin is a profound truth but I thinkpotentially one of the powers of Truthand I understand that's a difficult wordto nail you know concept to nail downis that if if you'reyou're like primarily oriented towardsthat or primarily subordinate to thatlet's say then some of the other virtuesat least it seems you know this is justkind ofbubbling up as a result of thisconversation nowhappen by default right so what it likehow interesting is it that and this isprobably like you know something aboutthe hierarchy of values and virtueitself it's like the one at the top ofyou would assume that it woulduhyou know automatically hierarchicallyRank and thereforeuh Inspire the behavior in that's inalignment with them or something likethat I'm butchering this a little bitbut you get what I'm saying what you'resaying yeah if you're really seeking thetruth then the virtue that is humilitywillwill be automatically a part of yourbehavior if it is genuine if that ifthat you know orientation is genuineyeah if you really are seeking for thetruth in your aunts like you said beingegotistical and right arguing for thepoint of argueumyeah and I think uhyou know this sort of virtue structurehas to come from the top which is truthumbut if you takehumans right back to likebasic basic principleswe're just a species who wants toyou know wants to evolve or wants toprocreatebut to do that we need food that we needshelter and we need uh air and light andyou know these little things and thenonce you you know once you've got yourfoundations correct or once you once youbuild that nice Foundation then you thenyou have these little sort of extrathings that you might need like I meanright top level you you get a cardincreases your productivity and youbecomeyou know you're able to gather moreresources or something like that youknow I'm I'm obviously jumping quite faron the timeline there butI feel likeBitcoin by fixing the money becauseeverything you need to surviveyou have to either work forum find luckily or pay forum and luck you I mean you can basicallydiscount that to work for something isis uheffectively you're going to need to bepaid for that anywayum and sowhen you fix the moneyyou do fix the world I mean you fixeverything like becausewe can't gather all our resources you Ican't be a jack of all trades and be amaster of all of them either maybe amaster of one sell all of that and youknow gather all my other resources thatI need by trading off the the masterskillumand then you you know you you build ontop of that and whatever and so moneymoney is the the transaction medium liketheyou need it like money makes the worldgo around it's it's there it has to bethere and soI think if you fix that it's somethingI've been thinking about recently andI'm like uh it might sound crazy but Ithink Bitcoin literally is Utopia thenbecauseI mean no one everyone always used todisagree with utopian thinking oh thereis no Utopia and this and that butif you fix the money you've you almostfix everythingyeah almost perhaps on a long enoughtimeline I think like yeah and wellit's also like what does fix the moneymean does that imply that this iterationis perfect because I think you're rightin saying that almost like the qualityof the money will determine the degreeto whichyou know a market or a society canamply or abundantly or efficiently meettheir needs and then layer on whateveractualization uhis layered on on top of that you knowlike the the meaning component of OurLives because I it doesn't seem likewe're justDNA propagating machines like it seemslike there's another element of us thethe one of meaning of Love of you knowall of these there's something thatseparates us from the animals perhaps itseems maybe it seems that way yeah maybeexactly but it also I also think it'sthe case thatI think Bitcoin is a dramaticimprovement over any form of moneyHumanity has ever had but to call itperfect money we'd have to both knowwhat you know we'd have to knowperfectly what money is and we'd have toknow you know exactly what perfect moneywould be perfect knowledge to callsomething perfect yeah right right andso I think yeah I think it's a dramaticImprovement and those improvements willdramatically improve a lot of theproblems that you know you and I couldprobably list out and identify here nowand probably many that we aren't youknow currently that aware of or wehaven't cast you know our our attentionon quite yetum but I think you know human beings arejust we're goal post-moving machinesright like we will alwaysum strive for more and we will alwaysfind problems with our current situationand so I I doubtand again like does Utopia just meaneverything is perfect and nobody has towant for everything and nobody is everstruggling because you know that almostseems like an NPC sort of environmenttoo in a sense because you're like wellif if there's no struggle there's nostriving if there's no attempt to movefrom one less desirable situation to onewhich is more desirable which kind ofdoesn't seem almost possible in a a youknow a strict Utopia let's say then areyou even conscious you know do you notneed the polarity of of good and bad ofof striving and achieving of light anddark all that kind of stuff for forconscious and free choice consciousnessof free choice to emerge who knows butit seems kind of likely to me so I don'tmy opinion is that we won't have aa Utopia in the strictest sense of thedefinition but I think so many ofthe really deep problems that so fewpeople recognize in the world todaywhich are which doultimately lead back tohow we communicateand store value with one anotherwill be dramatically improved as aresult of Bitcoin becoming a you knowthe global monetary standard or outcompeting all the otheruh potential money's out thereso you know but I'd say also maybe oneway to push back maybe a little bit isthat sure Utopia is is probably relativeas well and personalyeahexactly so what do I mean by it and whatdo you mean by it you know my Utopiawould beuhshe's I mean I haven't put that far intoit but like maybe doing something I loveuh something that doesn't make me feellike I'm going to work but getting paidfor that and earning value so that I canspend my value elsewhereumit's a it's a place where I'm consumingeverything I need that makes me thehealthiest version of myselfum it's a place whereI'm allowed to express anything I wantuhand get good constructive criticism backbut not be like locked up for it or youknowor it's like or just the ability to beplaying golf every day or something youknow something like that like which issuper personal but uh it might bedifferent for you right well if ifyou're saying that you know the thefreedom to live the life that you chooseand pursue meaning and pursueresponsibility and pursue health andpursue loving relationships without anyother impedance then your ownstruggle with yourself let's say and thestruggle with the natural world and Imean there's always going to be uhfriction no matter what domain evensociallyum but if you know the optimize for allthose things if you're calling thatUtopia then you know sure maybe we'llwe'll get something akin to that I I wasmore thinking ofa theoretical Utopia where basicallyeverything is perfect everything isperfect yeah exactly which yeah whichyeah you caught it ain't never gonnahappen yeahum all right so just just back to thethe timeline because I'm interested inkind of filling out the rest of thestory butyou were having this experience and youwere coming off of the the drugs andwas Bitcoin a part of that story or didthat come after that process had yeahI'm not yet I think that was the sort ofthe process thatum kicked me out of my NPC versionum Bitcoin because it just showed youthat you know you can't trust theinstitutions and you can't trust exactlyyou know people I lost a son of trustyeah right right whereas I used to trusteverything right you know doctor knowswhat's best doctor has a spacegovernment you know everyone knowswhat's best they they're trained in thatthe experts exactly the expertsum and so yeah so I went downand then realized like okay I need tochange somethingum and luckily well maybe not luckily itcould have come sooner but if I hadfound uh psilocybin sooner it probablywould have helped me moreumbecausethat reallyhelped me open my mindtame the egoshowed me that you know maybe thingsaren't what they seemum but the the very profound effectswith psilocybin was that um it helped mekick the addiction easier because thething is even though I came off of it Ihad withdrawal symptoms forprobably like two yearsyou know in my and it's so funny likethe physiological changes you go throughsoon the drug I wasumI never felt coldso I work on uh boats or yachts and wego to shipyards every now and then andusually that's done in the winter timeyou know and and most of my Winters werespent in the south of Franceum where you have the mistrial comingthrough which brings extremely coldpolar weatherumand I'm rocking shorts and t-shirtsyou know every day like the yard workersare all looking me like I'm crazy but Icouldn't feel the cold I like I just andI and obviously when it got hot I gotsuper hot like uh just sweat profuselylike I couldn't handle the heatumand yeah about two three years later youknow I'm finally feeling cold again I'mactually feeling cold tonight which is Ilove it I love feeling cold you knowit's it's so weird to say but like my mymy sort ofinternalumtemperature has normalizedumand mushrooms I think helped that butthey also help with the addiction partof it like I don't have any addiction toit anymorebut seeing as though it's one of thehardest things to kick I uh you knowthey're saying once a smoker always asmoker you know you're always drawn tothat cigarette that nicotine that italways hooks you so at the same time Igave up mushrooms I also gave up smokingum sorry not much gave up the drugs Ialso gave up smoking because the boat Iwas joining was a non-smoking bird so Iwas like okay well I gotta do it youknowum and mushrooms have helped mecompletely kick both of those addictionsNo need no no need to take them anymorelike I don't like I smell a cigaretteand I hate it like I don't even want togo near it it actually irritates me whenI breathing smoke you knowumand so yeah so I meanthen you know going from there you'relike okay wellthis pharmaceutical industry has screwedus over and yet he has a random littleplant in the thatyou know helped me fix a lot of thingsand that was that sort of got thingsturning and then and then I kind of wentuh intosite I needed to learn how to invest nowbecause I had this Expendable cash thatI was just sitting in a bank accounteroding away like literally it was thestart ofumwhen I think banks were first startingto introduce negative interest rates andI had no idea what that meant like I hadno financial literacy whatsoeverum and so I just thought okay well Ineeded invest in something and so Ilived in South Africa at the time mydad's a he's a retired mining engineernow and so the influence there was goldbecause he was in Goldman's most of hislife right and so I invested heavily inGold stocks didn't really know what Iwas doing I just put them in there somewent up some went downbut I had skin in the gameum and so that kind of forced me toresearch why I'm investing in thesecompanies and you know okay because theyproduce gold well what's gold like whyis that so cool or why is that soamazingum why is it so sought after and then Iwent down well okay gold was you knowmoney forthousands of years it's this uh it'shard to mine hard to inflateumand thenI don't know I don't actually know how Icame across Bitcoinum but it was that sort of it was thatsort of timeandI didn't I didn't actually see Bitcoinat the time as thisum gold replacementbecause I was I was a gold bug for sureafter after learning about that learningabout the FED learning how money'sprinted and you knowbasically that's money is a scam butgold must be money it should be moneyum I then justtook a plant at Bitcoin and I was on Iwas like a polonyx back in those dayslike right one of those exchanges wherethey still they still had the chat openon the side as well so everyone was justchatting and saying oh this one's goingto spike next and this one and so youmove the Bitcoin into that shift coinand and just try to grow it like it wascrazy I had no idea so anyways I wentuh I kind of traded thatthat stuff to try and learn tradingumuh because I felt like I was good at itwhich no one is he's like yeah I thinkyou're lying to there's very few goodTradersum seems so easy yeah yeahand it's goneyeah so and then umthen it became the the shitcoin casinoof 2018 as well the icos and all of thatand you know I thought I was making allthis money and uh the Bitcoin cash thingwhich that one was more amazing thanBitcoin and ethereum is going toflipping Bitcoin and you know just allof that I got caught up in all of thatandeventuallyafter that something's somethingsomething clicked and something changedyou know like mypursuing of Truth or pursuing ofknowledge uh led me down to believe thatmaybe Bitcoinbeing the onlyoh I hate to say it but crypto at thetimeum was the only one with no CEO or nomanagement team or anything like thatand soI just realized oh hang on I've beenwrong about all of this stuffyou know like uh I don't even rememberthose coins like they're gonna fix thisor there was like something was going tofix theuhthe sort of storage of file store J wasgoing to fix storing files on theinternet like just a lot of [ __ ] andyeah then I then I really got deep intoBitcoin and that was like a an amazingamazing eye-opening for me so amazing infact that uhI felt like I'd gone down another sortof uh depressive depressive time in mylifeit's weird it's like it's kind of as ofthat because kind of like because ofthat yeah because it'suh it was kind of like I've justrealized what a scamright everything else isand I've been taking part in it it'skind of maybe like depressed depressionbecause of guilt or because like youstomach what an idiot for believing thiscrap orbut thenI thinkprobably depression because of arealization and it'sit's a very very profound change that Iwent throughumyou know likeI mean yeah I Bitcoin literally changesyou and and I think that just thephysical or the the sort ofpsychological change you go through is alot to handle and I think maybe that wasthe sort ofdepressive angle to that yeah it's justa lot to handle and then that spurred onthe thirst for knowledge and which wasquite cool because then that brings youout of it again and you're like okayuh I know I was right and I'mcomfortable with what I'm doing now andand then it takes and then you feel ityears again it's maybe more anxiety wasthe the word not depression yeah well Imean once you really once the kind ofthe penny drops I mean that's when theJourney Beginsum and I can appreciate for me like Iwasum like you was a gold bug and hadfamiliarized myself with the problems ofthe world for many years prior to thatand so when when the penny reallydropped for Bitcoin it was kind ofnothing butuh inspiring and hopefulness and youknow justreally like uh invigorating it's likeboom like you know a light bulb goes offand you just gotta I mean you know everythere's so much to do now there's somuchright exactly but I do think it like inin your case and in all our cases and Ithink that maybe the only difference iskind of like the timeline it happens orthe intensity or something like that butI mean we said at the beginning thatkind ofdelineating between the Fiat self andthe Bitcoin itself and I think you knowthat moment that you just describedprobably is the Phoenix moment rightlike the yeah you you realize the truthor you see the light you you you're kindof destroyed by it at least your oldself or an aspect of yourself isdestroyed by it and what emerges fromthat either spontaneously or due to hardwork and dedication and learning andstuff is that Phoenix which isrepresentative of you know the newversion of yourself more imbued withtruth and hope and freedom and thosesorts of things and again like I'mif anyone listening to this is going tobe you know they're not it's not goingto be a surprise I'm using that kind oflanguage but I do think that's whynarrative and myth and story like thoseare the stories that resonate with usbecause they are very much how thesethings occur in our life in a narrativeform you know if like if we want tonarrativize the the Bitcoin Rabbit HoleJourney or the one that you justarticulated it kind of mechanically fitsthat narrative right and I think it doesthat because not only is it true butit's deeply deeply deeply meaningfulwhen it's genuine and that seems to bewhat so many of us are finding out youknow just how genuine and or how uhmeaningful and how valuable it is whenit occursumyeah sorry so go on that's cool yeah soI mean and then it drags you and you youliterally can't let go anymore right I Ilikeit's it's quite weird like I mean you gothroughyou do all the research you do all theunderstanding and then and then you findanother aspect to it the sort ofphilosophical side of things and youknowI've now maybe like it's an old mathteacher once told me once you Board ofthe subject you know your workand so I've always used that throughoutmy life like once I get bored ofsomething I think I I have a goodunderstanding I wouldn't say a perfectunderstanding because no one is aperfect understanding but a good enoughunderstanding that I'm not comfortablewith that positionum and so I like what's next isuhthis you know I've I you understandBitcoin you understand the philosophicalside of it and and how it helps peoplechange themselvesand the next step surely is usingyourself to change the world likeand one person might not be able to doit but luckily everyone's going throughthe same path that I am and you knoweventually we all come to aasynchronized truthand from there surely it's easy tochange the worldwhen everyone's taking part in the samegoaland I feel like that for me that's how Iunderstand Bitcoin it's literally thisdrive to one but maybe that's becauseI'm an engineer like I want to fix likeI love just fixing stuff no matter whatit is if it's physiologicalmechanical engineeryeah so it's just this drive to want tofix thingsumand I think that's got to be the nextstep and that's probably where you knowBitcoin leads us all isalways I mean or is it is it by defaultyou know is Bitcoin fixing us andtherefore everything else or are weputting in the work to fix thingsbecause we understood Bitcoin right welllike so many things I suspect there'ssomewhat of a paradoxical circularitywhere you're not really sure which iscause and which is a fact maybe it'sjust a matter of subjective position inthe process you knowum but of course I I agree with you andyou know you're talking about those daysyou know being on poloniex and you knowthe new [ __ ] coin and watching all thecharts so closely and and all theemotions that that are tied up in thatand isn't it liberating once you kind ofrealize that the real game that's atplay hereto to not have to be drawn in with yourattention with your emotion obviouslywith your Capital into any of that stuffI mean everything seems to just becomeso much more clear focus seems to be somuch more natural you know all all thatnoise just drifts away and you kind ofthink back like oh my God I can'tbelieve how wrapped up I I was and allthat stuff and how much time I devotedto it and now as you say like now as thethe realumlike Focus emerges and as the real youknow game becomes clear and as theknowledge expands and expands andexpands like then you're just confrontedwith thewell one the simple proposition iscreate value contribute and accrue valueand figure out how to put yourself in abetter position to do that through yourown personal refinement of course andthen figure out where which companiesand what areas and what industries whatprojects you can uniquely plug that intoto provide and accrue value and you knowit all becomes so simple you know it'slike that bell curve meme where we'rejust back to being like work and receivereward you know like just like ourcaveman ancestors you know and there wasall this noise and and you knowcomplicated [ __ ] in between but nowwe're being brought back to just a verysimplecalculation and I think among otherthings what that's doing is it isfreeing us up to think about what is ourunique value you know first of all youknow what do we want to pursue what arewe good at how do we want to you knowmore for change or refine ourselvesinto like what do we want to refineourselves into such that we're able togenerate more of a certain type of valueright and I think part of the reason whythere's a lot of interest in thephilosophical or theologicaluh discussions around this stuff isbecause you know primary motivationswhat you aspire to be and you knowquestions like who you are and how tohow to most beneficially change yourselfto to provide valueis intimately wrapped up with thoselarger questions about what you shouldbe striving for and what the highestvalues truly areand so you know here we all aregrappling with those kind of questionsnow and so there's still like there'sstill much to be determined of courselike as you said we don't have perfectknowledge on any of this stuff but itdoes seem that at least for the peoplewhoyou know who have kind of the lightswitch has been flicked onthe noise is just you know things arebecoming very quiet and it's just abouttrying to focus in onwhat brings you the most meaningwhere you can deploy where you cangenerate the most value and how thatvalue you know can be rewarded back toyou as a result of doing that andeverything else just seems increasinglyunnecessaryit kind of like tames the chaos of theworld absolutelyabsolutelyI don't have to you know now that I'msaving in Bitcoin I'm saving enough youknow I'm saving so that my kids kidsare fineand therefore we can take everythingslowly now yeah just chill out like whatdo you want to do what who do you wantto be work on thatbecause we don't have to we don't haveto go through the rat race anymore Ifeel like you know we're out of thethose guys are scurrying past us justwaving at them hey don't worry I'm finewith who I am right now you know I'mworking on something else right andwhat's more liberating than that to beable to have that type of freedom tomake those choices because you know wewe wecriticized the MPC types all the timeand to a degree rightfully so because nomatter what your circumstance you canmake the case that nobodyuh is uh is free of the responsibilityfor determining their own fate let's saybut you can appreciate that all theforces that are conspiring againstpeople to you know to to increase noisein their perception and to distracttheir focus and to you know to make themunhealthy and to keep them on thathamster wheel just day in and day outand how detrimental and degrading thatcan beum you you know you can appreciate itbut you can also it's no wonder thatit's so liberating when you can when youwhen you can extricate yourself fromthat when you don't have the you knowyou don't have to worry about what JayPowell is doing at the FED with interestrates and you don't have to worry aboutyou know what the stupid governmentpolicy is within reason I mean we'restill wrapped up in uh yeah in the Fiatworld but where we're getting a tasteand an assemblance for how it could bedifferent and we're engaging the toolsthat allow us at least as on anindividual level to do that and ofcourse the punch line is is if the morepeople that do that the more that macrocircumstances starved of its ability tocontinue imposing its its dictates onpeople counter to you know what's bestfor them let's say and what they wouldchoose to do for themselvesyeahand just umI hadn't I had a thought thereumbut it kind of escaped me no escapesyeah right in the middle of what youwere sayingum so again back to the that I don'twant to lose the chronology of the storysoumoh I remember what I wanted to ask youabout the so I'm sure at this pointyou're familiar that you know you're notthe first one to note that coming off ofdrugs alcohol cigarettes as a result ofpsychedelic experiences isfairly common uh nowand that's super interesting butum you know no and also you mentionedhow that kind of changed yourperspective on a lot of things and thoseare two I mean I talk about psychedelicsall the time of course but yeah that wasa that was a big one for me in you knowI had a lot of this skepticism about howthings worked and I was you know diggingintoyou know the corruption broadly speakingthat exists everywhere and then you knowyou have an experience like that and itjust you know completely blows your headoff in terms of what you thought realitywas and what you thought you know thiswhole Human Experience was all about Imean it was again it was very it wasvery narrow before and then you know youhave those experiences anduh it's just the aperture gets blownwide open andand it does you know back to this notionof of Truth beinguh liberating in a sense and Truth beingthe thing that you know most inspiresyou and Truth being the thing that youas a result of the the benefits that itis able to bring into your life thething that you most subordinate yourselfto I mean those experiences in myopinion you know and there's a you'vedone the right way in responsible wayall all the the disclaimersseems like it puts you in the presenceof orgenerates a perspective or a type ofperception or a state of consciousnessthat is more clear and truthful thananyone that I had previously experiencedand it's and it's a weird kind of Truthas well it's likeit's a truth you can't really perceiveand in this environment right so yeahabove us yeah it's not like you know thetables in front of me that kind of truthbut it's it's something deeper like youthere's a felt sense of something that'sfar morefundamental than what you're used toexperiencing as a cut off subjectiveindividual in the worldyou know and you you have these kind ofunifying it feels very unifying at timesand it feels very connecting at timesand perhaps that's part of it but andyou know a lot of people will obviouslyjust shrug that off as you knowumbeing intoxicated in some way but Ithink most people that have pursued thisuhthese experiences properlywould smirk at that because they wouldyou know we all kind of know that thisis this doesn't it really doesn't seemlike an intoxication of a you know justlike an alcohol intoxication if anythingit seems like adetoxification where it it brings youfurther into you know Clarity and Truthrather than further rather than awayfrom it as in you know the alcoholicstupor let's sayand it helps to deal with trauma which Ithink shapes your being you know movingforward I mean the um who's that guy DrGabor mate he was on Joe Rogan we werelistening to it the other dayum and he wrote a book onaddiction and Traumaand how childhood trauma sort ofmanifests into addiction later on inlife and so you need to go back and youneed to deal with the trauma and I thinklike you know when you go through like aa really profound mushroom chip forexampleyou could lie there and cry you knowabout something could be happy crying itcould be sad crime it doesn't matter youhave thisI think you relive your trauma again andyouyou deal with it in a much more in a wayhigher like a a higher state ofconsciousness whereyou are you focused on that troll menuand uh it's kind of like it also tamesthe ego but it like it gives youumhuge amounts of empathy towards thattrauma it's kind of like forgivingwhatever happened to you to thatThe Entity or person or thing whatevercaused that trauma kind of gives you theability to forgiveI want to move on now I'm you know I'mI'm done with that trauma like I want todeal with it I want to move on I don'twant to think about it again well notthink about it again but I think I meanyeah and also disclaimerthese are ineffable experiences so wordsalways fall short obviously but yeah Ithink part of its power you talkedearlier about you know wanting to beaware of your biases right within thepursuit of Truth is that right becausebiases are some unknown Distortion ofyour perception that leads to adistorted perception of what is let'ssay and I think the Psychedelicexperience one of the things and ofcourse it does many thingsum but one is it it makes clear thedistinction it like it gives thosethings a separate existence because inyour normal waking consciousness likeall that latent stuff whether it'strauma anxiety stress fear like it justit just clouds up our mind we don'tsee it very clearly and as a result it'svery difficult to deal with each one inisolation but I feel like theseexperiencesthey shift your perspective to such adegree and possibly even show you likethis is consciousnessabsent limitation absent holding on toanything full letting go into whateverthat experience is and this is and theseare the things that are stopping youfrom doing that here they are ping pingping ping ping which one do you want tofocus on right and maybe they theygenerate like experience memoriesassociated with those things or maybethey take on a an archetypal or asymbolic sort ofum uh manifestation but like it's clearthat these are the things and then it'sup to you like do you have the courageto let go enough to deal with thosethings do you have the courage toconfront them and have the will totranscend them and then the courage andthe and the determination to actually doso and the the process seems to be oneof like ultimately letting them go nowwhether you do that through empathy orforgiveness or what have you you knowthat many that perhaps there's manymethods but the punchline seems to beyou have to let go of them and as you dothat sequentially for whatever it isthat's therethat your experience of that unitive oror fundamental form of Consciousnessseems to be enhanced every time you dothat to the point where once you've letgo of it allyou know I I think you enter thatyou know what the I think the HinduFaith might call like a Nirvana typeexperience something like that whereyou no longer even have the capacity todifferentiate your awareness fromeverything else because you're notyou're no longer holding on to anythingthat that tethers youto an individuated form you know I knowthat sounds crazy to most people I thinkyou'll probably uh yeah you know getwhere I'm coming from but it isI I you know the reason why I bring itup is just to say I think theseexperiences even if it doesn't go thatfarit permits an isolated and more clearconfrontation with those things thathave been operating in the backgroundthat might have been hard to bring tothe fore to deal withand I think it it's also it's hard tobring to the fore becausethe trauma is such thatweno no I'd like to kind of describe it aslike we've got you you cal It's acalloused part of the brain you knowwhen you when you're lifting weights andstuff you get your calluses on yourhands you know to protect your hands andI think the brain does that as wellcompartmentalizes that bad memory and itkind of shuts it into a little corner ofthe brainuh and you need accessexactly but for good reason becausewhen people do access them I believethey then fall into addiction orsomething like it manifests intosomething else addiction you know orsome you know you could be you could youcould manifest into a murderer or youknow it could it could go anyway you'reafraid yeah you're afraid of what it'sgoing to do to you I think and so a lotof people have stuff like that I'mafraid to confront what's down there soI'm just gonna leave it down there yeahlock it up I don't want to deal withthat and umand I I mean I'd say it's justchemically speaking mushrooms actuallyenhance neural Pathways in the brainright like have you have you seen animage of a brains I mean I'm sure youhave but I'll just describe it this I'veseen these images of two sort of ringsum and you have all these kind of uhinternal Pathways within the Rings andone's on mushrooms and the other's notand the other is not as maybe got likesay a hundred different individualPathways in there and this one's gotthousands right the pathways areconnecting different areas of the brainexactly it's it's kind of I think thepathway is probably a neural a neuralpathway which is the firing of neuronswithin that pathway and they somehow canpick that upum and measure that and the measurementon mushrooms is thousands of timeslarger so you knowit might be thatin real life we want it we're in conlike in innormal lifeum we would like to deal with that kindof stuffbut the scar tissue in your brain couldbe so strong that right you know somepeople need to be hypnotized to go intothose kinds of uh thoughts and thingsyou know likeyou know really badchildhood trauma where like kids getabused and things they don't want to godeal with that again like that likeimagine being a kid for 15 years gettingabused by your dad andas an adult you've just found your lifenow and you you're coping with life likewhy would you want to go back down thereyou know totally and I and I think it'smaybe not even for a want it's just youcannotum your your mind just physically doesnot let you go down there because you'reprobably decoupled protecting you yeahit's protecting you and I think then themushrooms have has liketo kind of uhtwo working parts to it where one isokay let's fire up your neurons let'slet's find some new Pathways let's let'sfind the hidden entrance to that roomwhich you've closed up everywhere elsebut don't worry we'll find it and thenthe other one is like okay nowwell you know it's the Spiritual Beingsas well in there that are teaching youlessons like again that sounds supercrazy but there is someone thereteaching you lessonsumand maybe that someone is your internalself right the the good self that wantsto come out and say hey I'm still herelet's deal with that and then you so youhave the access to it and the ability todeal with it and it's I mean again likeyou said it's there's no way to describethese with words yeah yeah you know Ihad this I had a conversation in 2018with uh Dr Bill Richards and he washe was the last actually to you know inthe in the early 70s before everythinggot shut down with the Psychedelic uhstudies in in Academia basically he wasthe last to uh perform like tests uh oryou know experiments with it I think inthe University of Maryland perhaps andthen in 99 he and Roland Griffis andanother guy whose Name Escapes Methey they basically were the team thatyou know got the go-ahead from JohnsHopkins to start this stuff again andJohns Hopkins and NYU and a few otherplaces have been leading the chargesince then and it's been great I meanthere's obviously been a a psychedelicRenaissance and I know there's uhconcerns that it's going to be eitheroverly medicalized or overlycommercialized and all that kind ofstuff but this is just part of theprocess I mean we got to get over thestigma first that these things are likedangerous drugs and then we can over thecourse of time the truth will emerge andI think uh you know there'll be moreplaces and more freedom tointeract with these things as as peoplechoose but in in the discussion with himand we talked about you know howspectacularum the influence on drug abuse andalcoholism and resolving drug abuse andalcoholism has been for psychedelics andparticularum psilocybinum he was saying I mean he he's familiarwith the studies you mentioned and it'salmost like they're not even separateright it's like maybe by virtue ofallowing opening up those Pathwaysthat's part of what induces the theconscious experience that you haveright so it's like it may be difficulttodecouple them but what was interestingyou know what he said and I think againthis is not revelatory but just wasinteresting to hear hear him say itbecause he's been present for so many ofthese Transformations and so much ofthis therapeutic work you know he saidwhat's amazing is that and so counter tothe existing pharmaceutical model isthat the benefit that these peoplereceive is not a drug effect right theythey have the drug the so-called druggives them access to an experience andit's somehow something that happens inthat experience that you know in manycases changes them for the rest of theirlives and in many caseslike you you're kind of a perfectexample because you said that like afterthe experiencelike the the emotional draw and even thethe smell and and the association withcigaretteshad a completely different meaning foryou like it had an aversive effectrather than like an appealing effectand somethingI mean and something in that experiencesomething that happened an encounter arealization of therapeutic process ofsome kind who knows is what induced orchanged at and you know we are notnowhere near to understanding reallywhat's going on in that process only tosay that it's consistent enough tosuggest that it is indeed something inthat experience that is causing thateffect not you know thethe you know the pharmacology of a givensubstance let's say because yeah youdon't need to keep taking it you knowit's it's often you know once andyou know I mean I I I don't do it asoften as I'd like anyway I mean I've gotI've got some in my freezer just waitingyou know but II do them at like at times when I wantto yeah it's it's the small thing manit's not a small thing you won't domushrooms you won't do mushrooms twiceuh in in consecutive days becauseit's a it's a hell of a brain work likeyou it's it's draining yeah it's notit's not like a uh and it's just that'sit I would I wanted to say like a partydrug but even them like even MDMA evenumit's maybe different to to marijuana butuh MDMA is also a quite a a heavy ittakes a heavy toll on your body or onyour mind and so to do two days in a rowit takes it takes a lot of effortum I I just find thatI know what I'mgoing to encounter in that space youknow after almost 20 years of experiencewith it and like even stillI mean it's such ait's such afundamental or truthful orchallenging experience I mean you youfor me it's really like you have to gothrough the gauntlet once again ofgoing down into the depths there anddigging around and seeing what's therebefore you can access you knowthe the more Blissful let's say aspectsof the experience and who knows whatyou've accumulated over the course of ayear or two years or however long it'sbeen and you know for me there's alwaysandthere's also the the fact that like somestuff doesn't get resolved just byvirtue of having experience like maybesome things do but you know there'sgonna there's gonna be other aspects ofyour life even if they're purelyaspirational like I don't feel like I'muh fully meeting my potential yet andyou know so that might be with you yourwhole life presumably it will be rightand so there's always going to be thingsthat you need torecapitulate and confronting thoseexperiences and some of them can berather challenging because you know aswe said before youyou rely on different aspects of yourperception and your personality tosolidify enough to see you through theworld and then you go into these thingsand you kind of put them all back on thetable and say likeare they all legit like and then youfeel naked for the time that you do thatand then you know you go through thatprocess so I umI find I take it very seriously and II'm always nervous before them and oh metoo there's never a time I'm not nervousyeah yeah exactly you must be nervousright you know you know yeahum and other than other than that I meanand other than a little you know a beerevery now and then I don't uh you knowtouch any drugs anymore just because thethe thing I seek the most is Clarity andI I find even something like weed justkind of fudges up uhit introduces noise into the system Imight use it strategically occasionallyif I'm trying to you know work onsomething creative or something butand that's one thing I really I likeabout weed is that it is a huge creativedriver[Music]um I noticed uh I heard a story onceaboutum the blues down in like New Orleansthat areaum and how much they used to smoke weeddown there and the quality of music thatcame out you know and then the War onDrugs came along andit's a killed the industry I mean maybenot killed it completely but definitelysuppressed it quite a lot well it cameup in the at least an American culturewith the Jazz musicians in the 50s rightI mean that's where it kind of took holdinitially and that's why there was somuchuh kind of racist rhetoric around itum because it was the I believe it waslike the Spanish and the black Jazzmusicians who wereuh you know smoking it as as part oftheir process let's say and it wasum it was it was what's the worddemonized as a result of that kind oflike in conjunction with you know racistsort ofuh opinions and attitudes at the timeum but yeah I sometimes think demonizednot as a result but as aas a goalto demonize that to then demonize thosepeople to lock them up sorry that's whatexactly yeah like in the American prisonsystem it's proportionately completelymessed up like yeah and so I yeah I feellike they they did it specifically totry and catchoh totally I mean I think I think that'swhat the drug war I mean in the 60sthere was all this anti-war rhetoric andyou know people were veryanti-establishment and I I even thinkthis was likeum documented like I think Nixon startedthe drug war I believe and you know herecorded his whole time in office or atleast a huge portion of it and I thinkum it came to light that you know thedrug war was just how do we uh sweep upall those you know Mischief Makers allthose counter establishment people likewe need a reason to vilify or get rid ofthem it's like well there's a highcorrelation betweenyou know recreational drug use and thesepeople that areum pointing out the corruption in thesystem and have anti-establishmentattitudes so well if we if wecriminalize the drugs we can criminalizethem and problem solved and uh you knowthe drug war over the last 50 years hasbeen the result and it's been such ablight on humanity and so [ __ ]distressing so many people's lives andjustabsolutely atrocious and history willnot be kind to it in my opinion butand hopefully we're starting to poke ourhead out of it a little bit you know Ithink we won't really do that untilBitcoin has resolved a lot of the otherissues in the world but at leastyou know the free flow of informationfrom the internet perhaps hasdemystified a lot of this stuff and itmade it easier to counter misinformationabout drugs and made it easier toShowcase how damaging the War on Drugshas been you know and those things takentogether havestarted to change opinions on it butjust you know just another example ofthe horrendous injustices that have beenable to be carried out because of such amassive imbalance of Empower you knowbetween the state and the people largelywell it's certainly Amplified andexacerbated by you know the Fiat moneysystem and the government control ofmoneyyeah well I think I mean I go evendeeper I don't believe the governmentruns the world I I think there's peoplethat own the government I mean look atthe look at the morons in governmentthey're sure there's no way these guysare smart enough to do what they do uhright well whoever whoever who makesthose decisions exactly that Dynamicstill empowers them tremendously youknow yeahyeah I think I mean I think it's a goodthing that the the Tide's starting tochange a little bitum I do it's weird because I you seeit's on Netflix now there's a lot ofthis uh you know Marco Polo stuff GrahamHancock's an amazing one and there'sthat there's that other cartoon onewhere the guys going through this it's aweird seriesum he just has these like kind ofprofiled moments and he just talks and Iguess they built a cartoon on top ofthat I don't know but I feel likeit's not mainstream for no reason youknow I'm trying to so me and my fiancewe're trying tobelieve that maybe Netflix are good andand they're trying to help us or helppeople understand it and push thenarrative but I mean I remain a skepticon that one I think Hollywood and andmedia in general is so controlled thatthat narrative is coming out on purposeand I mean if you look if you lookaround like you you've seen you knowyou've seen most lots of companies arestarting to form around psilocybin theyexist already that you know thepsilocybin stock is the next best nextbig thingyou know they're already in place andwhat what's the best way to do it likeyou just you get your companies in placefirstand then you drive the narrative andpeople like oh okay and then you youknow theyou you demystified for everyone you getthem allum comfortable with it or you you knowyou take away the stigma that these aredrugs and that they're bad and you knowyou slowly incept into people's mindsand then eventually ah okay don't worryit's free to use now but you can buy itwhere you know you've got to get alicense for it or you know somethinglike that and so I think it's it's onpurpose that this is all coming to lifenow uh but like you saidI thinkI think they they underestimate itbecause I think the changes that peoplewill get are so profound thatit it will it'll go over and above whatthey're trying to stop but all whatevertheir agenda is behind yeslike a Joe Rogan always says he's likethe world should have a mushroom day ifthe world had one day where everyonejust took mushroomseverything would just chill out likeeverythingfreak the [ __ ] out too because a lot ofpeople aren't ready for that [ __ ] no noum you know like I I know what you'resaying and I I'mI tend to think that just what we weresaying about uh the pharmaceuticalsystem doctors and patients beforeeveryone's got agendaseveryone can choose either to appeal toThe Virtuous aspect of themselves or notand this is inclusive of the patientright and I would say The Virtuousapproach for the patient would be to dowhat they can to promote Health in allareas of their life so they're not justshowing up at a doctor's office andsaying I have a pain in my arm or I havesomething wrong with me I don't knowwhat give me a pill for it I want to Iwant it to stop and so everyone kind ofdoing that and perhaps even beingincentivized to do that or orsubconsciously being incentivizedthrough the the corruption and the noisein the system uhgen you know uhgenerates what we have you knowgenerates the system like sure somepeople have more power to execute theiragenda and so they're able to push ityou know from ayou know push it onto more people let'ssay and Hollywood may very well be oneof them I'm sure there are agendasbeyond the profit motive that operate inHollywood and this whole like pedophilia[ __ ] is just ridiculous like yes whatthe [ __ ] is with the this pedophiliastuff that's emerging everywhere it'sjust like insane right it's normalizingus to it well yeah trying to normalizethis right maybe to protect themselvesbecause they're now guilty of of whatthey've done over there right so bynormalizing it they Sorry to to catchoff there no and actually normalizing itthey just obfuscating their or gettingrid of the the punishment that's comingright and I I actually heard Andrew Tatekind of share that perspectiveum on it all like yesterdayum and I'd never you know I'd neverreally consid because I was always likewhat could possibly be the motivationfor this absolutely sick behavior and itbeing represented you know so blatantlyin in so many cases and that you knowthat one kind of makes sense because Ilike well we put it out there and youknow so we're absolved of the karmic uhconsequences or whatever some sort ofthing yeah yeahright it makes it makes some sense butmy my point is just that like that mostyou know that exists clearly but I doalso still think there are manydirectors and film producers andcinematographers and all that kind ofstuff that operate in so-calledHollywood or that produce movies andthey create content that have nothing todo with any of that but they still areat least somehow influenced by theincentive structure or the a broaderagenda or that kind of stuff so you knowit's youwho who knows like what conspiraciesexist what agendas what peoples whateverbut what I'm superwhat gives me a sense another sense ofLiberation because like when I wasyounger I was very much into allpossible conspiracies and and you know Ithink many are valid and over the courseof history many will come to light youknow like false Flags attacks false flagattacks and the like but what I loveabout Bitcoin I mean you could allBitcoin is many things right maybe it'salso Bitcoin is anti-sciop money if youjust don't have to care like it becauseit allows you cost money right right butyou also so you starve them in a senseby by being involved in Bitcoin as welland that's why it's anti-site moneybecause you know psyops everywhere buthow many once yougenerate your own Financial Independencethrough Bitcoin and when you start doingthat you know when you opt out on otherlayers levels let's say and you do thatin other areas of your life how much ofit really influences you and the answeris less and less and then the questionbecomes well with all of the injusticesoccurringwhat's the best thing you can do it'sprobably to put all your effort intothis thing that's allowing people to optout because the more people do that theless subject they are to the madness andthe more they starve the people orinstitutions or organizations orwhomever that are actually carrying outthis crazy [ __ ] and the more they dothat and the more they free themselvesup to act virtuously and to pursue truthand meaning and value the more they youknow contribute to a culture who's doingthe same and the more that cultureultimately shines a light and drowns outand shames and resolves those sick [ __ ]who are doing you know all that stuffwho you know as a result of appealing tonon-virtuous aspects of themselves oryou know however we want to carry evillet's say broadly speakingum and soIrecognize that all the a lot of thingsmay be at play but I don't allow it touh inject noise into my my Consciousnessor my focus because the answer the punchline is still the sameamplify the solution contribute to thesolution adopt the solution slashSolutions and that's that's the way todo it not to get on Twitter and yellabout [ __ ] Balenciaga whatever theflavor of the week thing is becausewhat's that going to do nothinghmm yeah I I do kind of agree with thatbut I also think I I do think that hasuh when people are yelling aboutsomethingum it generates noise attention sure itgenerates attention but then out of thatnoise comes a collective signal whichI think Bitcoin does for us as well itlike we're so we we're a minority now Imean Bitcoin is but we're growing andwe're getting pretty strong definitelyum minority definitely a minority I meanit's hard for people to even grasp whatBitcoin can do like it's you know funnyinternet money right umbut as it grows as people become itI mean we're a collective species likewe share knowledge I don't have tounderstand everything and this is thisis something I've been doing as well aslikeI trust I trust uh people's opinions I Iyou have to uh you you could not but itmakes your job a lot harder to try andfigure out the truth I trust until thethe trust is broken yeahum and so you know once you've built upyourcommunity of trusters or trustedsthat grows stronger and stronger andstronger and they feed off each otherand and you develop that big signaland I think as Bitcoin grows into thatyou know it's just huge because it's notit's not just a country anymore it's notit's not a specific religion it's not asociety of race it's it's everyonegets involved in this and everyonestarts to see the truth and thatgeneratesthis power like you were saying you I'dsay it forcefully takes that power awaybecause people want the truth of uh fromthe from those evil people that we'retalking aboutuh not just starves them I think it onceanswers eventually we you know we wecome out of theumthe sort of Trance that we're in in ourin our sixth society and we want answersnow yeah uh and that's I mean that's whyI defend that maybe I'm taking the theopposite point of view on Twitterbecause I am angry on Twitter I'm sure alot of people who follow me know and butI don't okay I am kind of angry in reallife but Twitter is kind of the outletyeah and I thinkumthat shouting and screaming about it asa collective eventually forms an ideaand then we can render that idea yeahbut maybe one or two people here andthere likethat's just noise it's not a big enoughsample size toto kind of perhaps it I shouldum rephrase it and sayyou know I think it's it's good torecognize it and maybe even say yourpeace about it just to be careful withhow much emotion you allow it to drawfrom you and and because you make agreat point and Ione I appreciate that there is like aso this whatever this whole Bitcoinphenomenon is like it is converging onor oruhlike an ethic is emerging from it andthat ethicyou wouldn't be able to that wouldn't beapparent if it wasn't juxtaposed to thethings that it was critical of right solikeand now you know not many people aregoing to need the ethic of like beingagainst pedophilia to emerge but youknow what I'm saying like this as wereconstitute our values and what Societyshould look like and our philosophiesand all these ideasthey're expressed through how peopleExpress themselves in a market but alsohow people Express themselves and howthey communicate on a platform likeTwitter and so I appreciate that thatthat people call out things because itmakes the ethic appearance an obviousand then we you know and maybe onethat's good just to be informed it'sgood to seewhat it is and you know it's also goodto debate the ethic now again like inthis particular case it's not reallynecessary to debate it but in certaincases we might say like what is theethical or principle line here becausewhat we're doing is like collectively isreconstituting all of that kind of stuffon a on a more fundamental or moretruthful basis and so I reallyappreciate that process and and peopledo have to be vocal for that to takeplace so I think it's it's better justto saybe cognizant of how much emotion orattention you're delegating uh to theseissues and make sure you're doing it ina way that you're conscious of and youagree with and you find Productivetowards your your most your highest endslet's say maybe that's a better way toput it yeah I agree like there's an endgoal to your to your small amount ofnoiseumto try andmake the world a better placeeffectively I mean that's that you knowthat's the toxic maximaliststhey're all shouting and screaming andbut for good reason I meanI'm on that side of the argument Ibelieve the toxic maximalism is is goodinherently because we do call out scamsum you know the FTX thing recentlyI told a bunch of my friends get yourmoney out you know and this was thesignal within the noise thing like I hadno idea about FTX I wasn't following itat all but I've curated my Twittersearch that that I havelike my little circle of trust like I'venot circle of trust but I built thatcommunity of trust that I go into to getsignal from the noise andthings started to to come to light aboutFTX and stuff and it you know somethingstarted to click and I just said guysI think there's something wrong withthis FTX thing you might want to justyou know pull out and just see it take abreak from it for a while why they havetheir [ __ ] there in the first placeshouldn't you have told them ages agoI dobut I you know people need to learntheir lessons like me like everyone elseeveryone has to go through the lessonand no matter how much we tell them itjust seems likepeople have to learn the lesson the hardwayum and they did unfortunatelybutyeah I meanthat signalcame from there you know like and and Idon't know how I don't know why I meanit just did andyeah the toxic maximalistskind of helped a lot of people out Imean Corey Clifton's got a lot of thankyous he's been killing what he's done Imean amazing I I like he he's admittedquite a few times that like he wasn'tvery much liked by many people in thebeginning and I was one of those guys Ithought who is this guy you know makingall this noise on Twitter and the more Ilistened and the more I listened itstarted to develop into signal and thenI thought geez what an amazing humanbeing like what a Jane wouldn't havechanged a huge change I've seen wellmy perspective of him has changedmassivelyum but yeah as long as the as long asthe end goal of what you're rantingabout whether it's on Twitter or in reallife I meanas long as the end goal isinherently good or truthfulthen or I think you're pretty Desiringto be at least aspiring to be yeah yeahit's uh I agree and it I mean it's we'rein interesting times right because uhwhatever you think of Elon Musk thatplatform is probably going to be morereceptive to more types of speech thanit has been over the last however manyyearsand uh you know so when all thoseso-called controversial opinions whichare not really controversial they'rejust non-establishment non-status quosort of rhetoric when when that's kindof permitted again and the marketplacefor ideas is a little bit more free andopenum combined with the emerging phenomenonof Bitcoin andI meanwho knows what's gonna happen but we welive in such phenomenally interestingtimes I mean yeahI always I I I feel likeumour time is going to be the fight forBitcoinand soand my child my my boy is gonna grow upand he's gonna Thrive under labor thatthat I've put into helping fight forBitcoin yeah and I think then they cancome in with that that sort ofgeneration can come in and they'll bethe one that changes again they'reinnocence they can make changes withoutany impedance towards that change or notany of it like a lot less impedance thanwhat we have now I mean yeahyou know like mushrooms not legaleverywhere it's only legal in a reallysmall few placesbut we know that it helps you know butwe have to fight for that so that manypeople can experience it later on I dothink that's a a big that places a bigresponsibility in our shoulders you knowwhich we will probably forever fallshort uh in with you know in relation tobutbecause when when you say that like thefirst thing that comes to my mind islike our actions and how we go aboutdoing this like no one person is isyou know uh critically importantobviously butare the way we engage and interact andbehave and approach this thingcollectivelywillbe a parent and it'll be looked back onand you know it begs a question like howdo you want to see how you behaved ordealt with this phenomenon in thisperiod of its existenceand this of course this applies to justbeing a person generally but in relationto this big momentous historical event Ifeel like especially those of us who arequote unquote early to it and who are insome way contributing even if it's justyou know being an uh out of the closetbitcoiner I think uh it matters like howwe go about doing this stuff which Iwhich I think a lot of people recognizewhich is part of the reasonthere is you know that ethic that Ireferred to before like the reason whyit's people even care that it's thereand to have those conversations becauseeveryone's trying to determine uh anethical way to be or act or makedecisions uh in this era in their lifein relation to this phenomenon and soif we needed any more reason to try tohold ourselves to aa higher standard I mean I think that'sdefinitely one of them our kids andgrandkids will look back and be like youknow uh thank you well yeah and how didyou act during this whole thing whatside of History were you on you knowthat's the question that you need toanswer yourself right now I think rightthat at a minimum but also like even ifyou were on the right side like you knowwhere were you at virtue andresponsibility and and and you know allthe things that you did or said or orsupported like that'll you know we're inthe internet age now so it's all goingto be there to see like this videopresumably will be watchable 100 yearsfrom now and uhso they'll they'll we'll there will be alot to judge us on and so I guess thepoint is is like how do you want to bejudgedyeahand that yeah that's super important forme is like that's one of the majorchanges that I went through you knowlike not giving a damn about the rest ofthe world beforeopening my eyes to bitcoin likeuh that Fiat mindset of just wastefulyeah you know girls drugs booze uh justjust a horriblehorrible way to live you know likeum but then you know coming out of thatandand uh one like like wanting to havegood virtue wanting to put my my flagdown and say this is who I actually wasnotice the change go back into myhistory if you want go all the way backandwatch my timeline change and wire changeand then what coincided with that youknow that's the that I think that's whatwhat one of the like that's what thehistory books are gonna going to be likeyou know how we all track what happenedin 1971 right right what happened in2009oh [ __ ] yeah I think it's going to beprofoundly likelike the New Renaissance it will bestudied forthousands of years yeah and one ifBitcoin goes that far right and andshould be again if if this is successfuland if this continuesthe way it's been going I mean aRenaissance that there is no precedentfor I mean obviously we're using theso-called first Renaissance As kind oflike a an analogy or a way tocontextualize it but the thesubstrate or the the components arethere to do something that's just againhas no precedent you know somethingthat's happening simultaneously on aglobal level with a mechanism or a toolor money that is you knoworders of magnitude more Superior thananything humans have ever had combinedwith you know the other technologicalprowess that we've developed over theintervening you know several hundredyearsyou know all bets are off basically andyeahum I think that makes it all the moreimportant that we are very consideratewith how we act and how we approach thisstuff because all of that is there's alot of uh hope wrapped up in that andpossibility but there's also a lot ofchaos and it's probably gonna matter howhow weshow up and face that chaos how weorganize that chaos yeah yeah exactlyyeah harness it basically well andhonestly yeah[Music]well that's deepI didn't think this is where thisconversation was gonna go it's not to befair I had no idea but I never do soyeah that's great did you was thereyou know anything you wanted to hit oranything you know what you had in yourmind to discuss did you did you want totalk about it before we shut it down oryeah I just umI wanted to give a little shout out tomy South African Bitcoin groupumthey were we joined I just joined thisgroup on signal once I don't evenremember how I got invited into itumbut thethe sort of debates and and chess thatwe had on thereyou know a lot of people say like onbitcoin Twitter has helped them out likeit's kept you saying in this environmentlike I I like to thank those guysbecause thethe sort of collection of knowledgewhether it'syou know somebody looking at thefinancial system or we've even got somedevs in there like umcrypto convert which is the the SouthAfrican company that's started the um Idon't know if you know the Pick and Paychain it was all over Bitcoin Twitter atone point but Pick and Pay is just likea massive supermarket chain in SouthAfrica oh yeah and crypto converts youknow managed toget lightning payments toyou know transact so we could transacton lightning and buy your groceries andthen we've got other guys like Adam onin in Bitcoin and car seat you knowstarting up a little uh circular economyin a tiny little location in Mossel Bayyou know uhadvice starting up which is a pureBitcoin no custody you buy it it goesstraight to your wallet like thesethings all starting out but but the sortofI don't know it was it's kind of liketherapy again like um that sort ofuh sanity bubble within that insanechaotic WorldumI think that's at a it's had a lot ofit's helped me with a lot of things aswellyeah well man it's it's it'sfeels amazing toconnect with people develop genuinerelationships with people with whomyou're so aligned in terms of values andyou're so aligned in terms of theinterests you know that those values areare directing you towards and so yeahand and also the the unifying uh kind ofthe gravity of being on a shared Missionlike that's the really thing yeah yeahthat's everyone like a bigger sharedMission than this one and again it'shappening to all colors Creedseverything all over the worldsimultaneously and it's just and it'salso never had that before yeah exactlyand I mean like all these you know thesignal groups the Twitter groups thetelegram channels all this stuff it'slike revolutionary cafes everywhere youknow you think of like revolutionaryFrance and you know they're gettingtogether in the cafe to hatch your plansor whatever and talk about philosophyand how to reconstitute things I meanthis is happening like on all thesedigital platforms all over the placewith people that are not only you knowmotivated and all that kind of stuff butas this conversation has revealed havebeen kind of woken up like invigoratedwith with hope and possibility andpotential and responsibility anddedication and courage like a genuine Imean the the Renaissance of anything isa internal individual Renaissance that'sbeing shared and Amplified throughinteractions with one another who who asimilar phenomenon is happening to andthey're I mean what's more satisfyingthan that I meanwhole reason why I do this you know andwhy so many of us interact you knowonline or on Twitter or in these groupsis because there's so much alignmentthere's so much shared interest there'sso much we we can and desire to learnfrom one anotherand uh and those the the quality of andthat the degree of genuinenessgenuinenessness or whatever that word isof those relationships is so rare youknow because we've come up in this inthe Fiat world where yes you know youhave loving relationships and greatfriends and all that kind of stuff butto to be so dialed in you know to be soon the same page to be soyou know moving in the same direction atleast from my perspective has been avery rare thingum as much as I've appreciated you knowso many of the relationships I've had inmy life and that they're just so commonnow like I've said it many times beforeon the podcast but like I'll meetsomeone at a conference you know they'llcome up they'll say hi or whatever andyou know within five minutes we'llrealize that we're basically bestfriends you know you have so much incommon I mean yeah exactly and it's it'sI mean I'm so grateful for it but it'sjust such a unique and fulfilling thingto have that happened so uh frequentlynow yeah um and all that taken togetheris just so invigorating and and as yousaid likewe all have our own problems and thiswhole shift that we're wrapped up in Imean there's going to be many timeswhere we get down and we feel like it'syou know it's too much or or whateverand just knowing that there's so manypeople that we can share that with orwho can help us out with that or who wecan lend our experiences and ourinsights and wisdom to all that takentogether just makes it so easy so mucheasier and so yeah of course it'stherapeutic but uhit's just a it's just another resourcethat you can leverage to try to movetoward the things that are most valuableand meaningful and it's again I justgratitude is the the feeling that mostoften prevails for metoo yeahI'm so thankful for I'm so thankful thatI became a bitcoiner and I I'm just sohappy about it like it isit's the best thing that could happen tome yeah isn't that wild I suppose I meana lot of people a lot of people say thesame thing it sounds probably clichednow but it literally is yeah well I meanall the all the bitcoiners will just benodding in agreement and all the peopleall the noise will you know be thinkingwe're insane but you know hey ho whatelse is newwell look man this has been uh you knowsuper enjoyable conversation and uhhopefully we get to do it in personsomeday andum yeah carry Carry On from there sothanks for making the time today andbest of luck with everything and we'lltalk again in the future yeah thank youvery much for having me on appreciate itall right brother take care all rightcheers see ya",
