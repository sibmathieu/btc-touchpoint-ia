science academia what'sbroken about the current system and whyit came to be the way it ishe also talked about bitcoin and howthat fits into the picture[Music]troy cross how's everything going manit's going great how are you jimmyi'm good i'm good where in the world areyou right now i just got back to uhportland oregon last night i'm in myofficeyeahvery nice how are you where are you areyou in austini am i am so you're in portland you knowi know they had some stuff going on afew years ago oh yeah any of theresidualconsequences of that that you're feelingstill or is it mostlyi think definitely we are still feelingit and it's a combination of factors thestuff going onyou know we have a severe homelesscrisishere as we do along much of the five onthe west coastandhousing prices are very highuh not high relative to san franciscoand maybe austin right now but uh highrelative to most of the country and wehad demonstrationsthat turned violent and destructiveand also which brought downyou know the force of the lawin a way that was really reallycounterproductivefrom many of our perspectives one of mystudents actually got abducted byfederal border patrol agentswalking home from a protest hoodedthrown into an unmarked vanand renditioned away to a federalbuildingand interrogated his stuff searched youknow it was wild so it just felt reallyreally weird and and no things havenever quite returned to normal in inportland covid wiped us out we had a lotof restaurants closed downwe're bouncing back but we've got asevere kind of malaise i thinkin terms ofyou know just people who don't have aplace to stay and they're just kind ofparked all over the cityand trash everywhere and it's we're notquite back to normal having said thatyou know the impression of portland thatyou might geteven from what i just said is wrong andmost of portland is still one of themost beautifulyou know cool places that there is thatthere are it's just just not back towhere it was a decade agoi see i see so i'm bringing you on thisshow because you'rea philosopher and we do want to talkabout bitcoin and everything else butwhat do you make of what's happened inthe last few years like what's youropinion sort of like as a philosopherwhat's going on at a deeper macro leveli mean i don'thave a perfect diagnosis of what's goingon that's part of what's scary is nobodyreally knowsbut i do seetrust and communicationsbreaking down across different segmentsof society and i see peoplekind of entrenching and doubling downand becoming more extreme across theboardand basically thei'm an epistemologist that's you know westudy the theory of knowledgeand the way wehave advanced as a species is the waythat we've advanced in all other formsoflifewhich is todivide and conquer to specialize intrade you know this is how cities formedi don't know how to do all the stuffthat you know how to doyou know how to do stuff that i don'tknow how to do and so we specializebecome really good at something we tradefor other stuffand that happened with knowledge toobecauseall i have to do is look around myhallway here to see all of thesespecials see new stuff that i can'tpossibly know because it just takes toomuch time to learn it allgiven the advancement of human knowledgeso we specialize and we tradeand that system of specialization intradeit's not quite like specialization intrade with goodsbecause with a good you can kind ofcheck it for qualitywhereas for knowledgeit's not easy to check it's really noteasy to check when it's highlyspecialized knowledge it is if it's likeyou know somebody building a weapon youuse the weapon it either works or itdoesn'tbut for a lot of knowledge it's not soeasy to check it's complicated and ifyou don't trust those intermediaries oryou're trading knowledge withthe whole system breaks down and you'reback to building up your ownsystem of knowledge from scratchwhichsounds great but is actually almostimpossible givenhow much human knowledge there is andhow it's specialized into all of thesedifferentcrooksyou know crooks and umpockets so i guess what i see as aphilosopher as an epistemologist this isme seeing through my own window is itbreakdown of trust in a socialinstitutionsthat allowed us tonot worry about the truth about all ofthese like details in lifeand just trade for those with each otherand now i see a system where everythingis in question we have groups of peoplewhohighly distrust the other groupsand those institutions that kind ofcertified knowledge those are nottrusted anymoreand you have a socialcollapseyou know because of that it's spiralingever more extreme because we don't havea connection totruthvia trusted basically trustedintermediarieswell you mentioned sort of thisbreakdown and this lack of trustwhat caused that and whylike do they are the people that aren'ttrusting the authorities or in certainfields are they being dumb or do theyhave good reason fortheir behavioryeah that's a great question andi guess here's where i differ from a lotof mycolleagues who are in the academybecause i think it's a mutual i thinkit's caused by three thingsone is it's caused bysystems that amplify misinformationeasily like rumors travel faster thantruth and that's a kind of common storythat in some ways you know post a falsestory on facebook it'll travel fasterthan the truth because it's catchier anddesigned to spreadthat's you know that's a that's a partof the story but a largepart of the story is that theauthorities have screwed up i mean byauthorities i mean people like me andpeople in the academyuh who've been less thanfully transparent and honestand who have also succumbed to partisanrancor and identity politicsand i think once you have this kind ofsocial divide between people who arelike you people who are not like youif the authoritiesseem to be captured by a group identitythat's not yoursyou can't trust what they sayand i feel like a lot of the academyeither has been captured by ideology oreven when they haven'tthey haven't done enough to shed theappearance that they haveso i don't blame people for not trustingauthority and i guess we could go intospecific examples where authorities havescrewed upbut i feel like wei'm not blaming my colleagues in thesense that i know how to do it right anddo it better it's a very hard thing todobut you know government agencies thatcertify knowledge they have to beseen as apolitical they have to be seenas apolitical if they're to be trustedand they aren't being seen that wayand they often aren't that way i meani'll give an example of i saw a famousuh climate scientistpost something on twitter a few weeksagowhere there was a projection that halfof florida would be underwater by somedate in the future i don't remember whatit was 2080 or something like that2100 i don't remember the dateand he posted like oh great you knowit's a red state maybenature has a way of taking care ofitself or something and i just thoughtlike oh my god this is a person who wona macarthur prize who won a sagan prizeand my thought was just great you justfrittered awayyou know so much public trustby aligning yourself not not only beingreally cruel and inhuman but aligningyourself with a political point of viewand dehumanizing everybody who doesn'tshare it now nobody's going to trustyour sciencebecause they'll see your science as asimple kind ofyou know motivated by your desire toimpose your beliefs on others ormotivated by revenge or motivated bysocial factors rather than by an honestaccounting to relay the evidence as yousee itso yeah i i think there's plenty ofblame to go around in the breakdown oftrust but i guess where i differ fromsome others in this view is thati feel like we've lost trustpartly because of our ownclose-mindedness and inability to listento othersand to regain trustyou cannot regain trust as a simplematter of authority or censorship youknow i don't think that the answer islike oh we can bring america backtogether again bycensoring social media effectively it'slike that's obama's moveno i adamantly reject that idea i feellike it would only accelerateit would only accelerate the dissolutionof america and in order to heal americawe have to re-earn trustand that means not dehumanizing peoplethat means listening to people wherethey're at not insulting theirintelligence not insulting themand showing our evidence and just likeit's a hard work of education you're aneducator rightyou're an educator you confrontmisinformation and disinformation everyday about bitcoinandand other things and you know it'sfreaking hardto talk across difference and there's nosubstitute for that that involvestop-down authorityyou know constricting information orquestions ordesignating some people asthe sensors because they have power thatthat makes everything worse in myopinionwell so there's a couple of things thati want to pick you know sort of pull thethread on a little bit one is yourargumentseems to be essentially that a lot ofpeople are bad at presentingtheirresearch or you know their findings andso on and thatit gets perceived bythe opponentsas this is politically motivatedtherefore it's no goodi mean the question for me is does thatactually happen likeis it that they are being truthful theyjustseem partisan and they're bad atpresenting it's a communication issueoris it it does the rot go deeper is itthat they really are partisan and thatthey really are sort of like and this isthe question i think many people inpublic kind of have which isyou know how much of it is just thembeingi don't know the arrogant ivory towerintellectual that can't be bothered toexplain something to you know somebodythat's too dumb to understand it orbut you know what they're saying isactually true versusthey're activelylikesort of manipulating what what theypresent tomake it seemyou knowfavorable towards whatever politics thatthey have like how motivated i guess arethese people by truth and howmuch fidelity is there towards truthyou know versus you know their lack ofcommunication skills these seem to betwo different issues i agree there aredifferent issues and um you know when ii mean one thing about being in bitcoinis you see a lot of motivated reasoningeverywhereand you know the first it's like a verypowerful lesson in epistemology actuallyjust to watch discourse happen in thisspace becauseeverybody has bags and everybody ispumping their bagsand those bags are very obvious in thecase ofyou knowalt coinerspumping their altcoin bags it's so it'sso obvious and your dm's are full ofpeople who want you to do the same forthemandthat's like really obvious instance ofitbut you realize thateverybody's doing it you know peoplepushingthe traditional banking system and thedollar and traditional financethey benefit from pushing thatandeven people whose bags are merelyreputational and historicali thinka lot of the earlyeconomistswhotook a stand against bitcoin and said itwas worth zero seem to becheering for it to go to zerobecause it would make them right youknow what i mean they're justtheir reputation is their bags theydon't have actual bags but they havereputational bagsor identitarian bags and it's almostlike a slogan that applies across theboard that humans are always pumpingtheir bags whatever those bags are andyou can'tyou can't avoid pumping your own bagsand everybody else is doing it too inorder to serve the truth you have to getbeyond that somehowand umand i wouldn't say that's any differentin academia people have bags and they'repumping them of course i mean this iskind of like basic philosophy of sciencewe work within paradigmsthomas kuhnis the one whoi guess sets out this structure ofnormal science and revolutionary sciencemost periods of science work within aparadigm that is there's a set of kindof rules and things you take for grantedand you work inside of that and you dowhat's called normal sciencemaking the theories ever more precisebut you never question thethe foundation of that science and thenthere are periods of revolutionarysciencewhere the foundations get questionedand you know that's people likecopernicusand galileo and darwin who kind of callinto question the reigning paradigm oftheir fieldand those are different kinds of scienceand definitely during normal science youare defending and taking for grantedalmost all elements of the theories thatyou're working inside ofand you're trying to push your ownactualyour own brand within the field andpromoting yourself and some of thatmeans kissing up to the right peoplepaying homage to the right peoplethere'syou know humans are humans inside theacademy it's no differentand then there are the academy aseverybody knows is highly political andpoliticized it would just be utter lieto say otherwise and so those politicalbags are definitely being pumped in theacademythat's true there's an element to thatand and we see it in bitcoin right itwould be utterly foolish for me to tellyou thatthat you know paul krugman is astraightforwardly honest economist whojust can't quite communicate well and istherefore perceived as being biased likehe clearly has a bias he's just he's astraight-up name-calling salty no coinerright that's what he is and he justhappens to have a nobel prize ineconomics and what do you mean and be anew york times columnistyou know but i have to say being insidethe academyi also seethat the vast majority of work thatpeople do is not that you know it's veryhard work of crunching numbersdoing observations setting up studiescritically thinking like the vastmajority of we work we do is notpoliticized or political it's actuallyreally extremely boringand you're just trying to crank it outright that's so both things arehappening and i have seen likescientists be incredibly poorcommunicators that it'sit's what happens it's kind of like youactually know this because you're abitcoin educator and you're good at ityou know how hard it is but you you getcursed by having too much knowledge in asub-specialtythe stuff i work on the most i have thehardest time explainingbecause i'm way into a world that hasits own technical vocabulary its owntraditions and i have forgotten whatit's like evento not know that stuff it's really hardto put myself in the shoes of somebodywho doesn'tyou know and and i see a lot ofscientists in thatin that frame of mind so i think boththings take place i i have to say mywife is ainfectious disease hospital pharmacistand she during the outbreak of thepandemicspentyou know every day all day studying allof the treatments of kovid as each studycame out she analyzed itand then she broke down that analysisand shared it with herhospital team university teamother pharmacists doctors other healthhealthcare providers like what is thebestway we can treat this thing according tothe data that's coming in rightand i saw her break that downevery daywith the utmost integrity andability she had and those studies arenot easy to interpretand find flaws with them but thatspeciality is like taking apart thesethese methodologies but also in thecontext of knowing a lot aboutinfectious disease generally the humanbody generally treatments generallyand so i sawdefinitely bogus studies being touted asgreat studiesfor political reasonsand uhi saw a ton of hype taking over whatwhat was actually the science andand i saw the value of being aspecialist and actually spending yourwhole life studying something and mywife's perspective throughout the wholething was likewhen it came to something likehydroxychloroquine her perspective waslike we don't have any good evidencethat it works we have some preliminaryevidence it's totally not enough to makea clinical recommendations on the on thebasis of it andyou know her perspective was the sameforivermectin for instance it was like wellthere's some promising stuff but notreally enough to make a recommendationandthat reflected hersort of knowledge of all of these otherdrugs for other conditions that had beenthrough exactly the same kind of onepromising study butit was flawed and it works in vitro butthat doesn't mean anything for otherworking people and you know that entirecontext was missing and it was reallyweird to see thatday by day just hard science done forsomebody who just wanted to work ontreating the virus as best she couldup against a political whirlwind ofeverybody speculating you know peoplewith no training at alljust kind of with very very firmopinionswhich she did not have because shedidn't think the evidence supported ityou know so i i've seen honest scienceand an inability to get it across and ofcourse i've seen motivated reasoning inthe academy too there's there's plentyof both plenty of both jimmywell that's a very long answer to sayingbasically it's sometimes one sometimesthe other i guess a question for you atleast as sort of like someone outsidethe academy iswell then how do you determine what'sone and what's the other i think youpretty much said that you knowpart of it ismotivated reasoningand part of it is you know just badcommunication skillsyou know how is a layman supposed totell the difference because you know imeanat least in the field that i'm mostfamiliar with which is economics it alllooks like motivated reasoning to melike the entire department of economicsat every university seemed to beyou know justifying whatever governmentpolicies that happened to beyou know and you know you hear aboutstuff like reproducibilitycrisis and with scientific papers likeoh yeah you know it just seems like okaywell how true was this originally if youcan't reproduce it andyou know like if you have stuff likethat thenyou know how are we that are outside theacademy that don't know these peoplethey don't have this technical languagehow are we supposed to understand thisstuff i mean this is essentiallyvery much in your wheelhouse sinceyou're you're talking about epistemologyofyou know what how are we supposed toknow things ifthere's thisyou know maybe there are people likeyour wife that are very much you knowmotivated by seeking the truth but howdo welike it's all sort of lumped togetheryou know in the quote-unquote academyalong with you know her and paul krugmanyou know essentially are in the academyhow are we supposed to figure it out i imean i really wish i had an answerbitcoin is awesome because you can checkeverything yourself you know we havethis sayingyou know don't trust verifyand it in bitcoin that actually worksyou know it you can inspect every lineof code it's open source you can run ityourself you could basically check it'snot easy but you could check everythingyourselfsome of what's kind of amazing aboutbitcoin is that you can take apartfud that has actually been published inpeer-reviewed journalsjust by knowing the protocol you knowyou can take apart alex devries anduh camila mora and you can take apart alot of the sides of the flood dicejust by actually knowing how bitcoinworks and what it is and that is awesomethere are sections of the world whereyou can verify and obviously that's thegold standard not to trust anyone but toverifybut trust is unavoidableyou do have to trust people becausehuman knowledge is too broad to verifyeverything yourself i guess that's thenews that i bearfrom thetechnology front and i don'tif i had a solution which would allowyou to avoid trust you know that wouldbe greatbut the best thing we have honestlyis the institution of science itselfscience isthe means by whichwe minimize trust in others whilemaximizing the use of their discoveriesyou know the replicability crisis it'sgreat that you brought that upi meanwhat that shows is not a failure ofscience but that science it does showthat but it showsthat we need to do is replicate morestudies would you look you push into whythat crisis happened you know there's abunch of different causes one of them isflat out fraud certainlyone of them that happens a lot inscience there's a lot of fraud inscience one of them was that moreextreme results tend to get publishedbecause they're click-baityonly surprising things get published notboring things and if you just publish abunch of surprising things thenstatistically you're going to publishoutlying experiments that aren'treproducedone of them was a reliance on a certainkind of probability theory frequentismrather than bayesianismand one of them was havinginsufficiently high standards forstatistical significance so there are anumber of different causes that we'veidentified and another one is just likenot funding studies that simplyreplicate other fundings studies likethose being boring again andso we're kind of learning on a metalevel i actually have a colleague hereat reed who's in the psychologydepartment who's done a lot of his workon this replication crisisandbasically the discipline has to learnfrom it and i hopethat actually bitcoinis a lesson for economics and i hopethere will be a retrospective like howdid we miss the rise of thismulti-trillion dollarspacewhat was it about our discipline thatblinded us to iti hope they'll be asking those questionsjust as following the 2008 crisiswe saw the emergence of behavioraleconomics in part in response to likehow did we misshow did we miss this and it was likewe're too wedded to uh efficient marketshypothesis andwe were missing this irrational elementof human behavior so let's incorporateit into our discipline right so so justsorry to give you another long answer toyour question but no no i love longanswers so keep going you knowthe short version isi wish i had a way to sort through allof human knowledge and not trust thesystem we have but the best system wehave is scienceand that's the system that's kind ofbreaking downbecause it you know that's the systemthat has proven to be untrustworthy in awayand uh so all we can dois on the inside in the academy is workas hard as possible to re-establish thattrustdo better you know learn from ourmistakesbe better at listening be better atcommunicatingand more honest when we get things wrongall we can do is do better from thelayperson side i meanyou just can't have a really highcredence value about a lot of thingsthat you maybe thought you could ifyou're just trusting everyone if you canverify that's great definitelyskepticismis warranted if it's something thatcould be politically motivatedskepticism is warranted for me i stillthink science is the best thing i haveto go on for for the vast majority ofof issues and i do defer to mycolleagues anddespite the fact that it is politicizedand i may be getting it wrong some ofthe time because ii don't think the better option is likechecking with your local in-group leaderand asking them what they think becausei don'ti don't think that's a better systemthan science you know there's a hugereplication problem withincults and identity groups they don'texperiment at all and so they don't haverepeated experiments at all so you knowwhat i mean there still isn't a betteralternative i wish there were i wishthere wereand andi make an exception jimmy for you knowthe stuff where you can check for surelike bitcoin and the stuff where it isclearlypolitically motivated which you do seesometimes right and then you just kindof have to write it offwell so you know being in the bitcoinspace and sort of knowing the value ofbeing able to verify things yourselflike i thinkthe part of your answer thatbothers me a little bit is this ideathat the academy or science is onemonolithic entity and in a sense it isand that's what's bothering meit's this you know they seem tosort of claim a monopoly on thatknowledge andyes there's uh you know scientificprotocol and the scientific method andall this other stuff and standards orwhatever but as you said there's a lotthatsort of gets lumped in together you knowif you're measuring the speed of lightyou know that that's one thingbut that gets lumped in with you knowyou know paul krugman or whatever andthey all somehow areall sort of speakingas if they had the same amount ofauthority and you know i was a mathmajor and everything else so for meit's it'sa lot of the sort of purported thingsthat they say likei don't know maybe this is a bias youknow that people like me haveit's like the the softer the science isthe less i trust it because it seemsmuch more sort of motivated reasoningthere rather thanyou know something that you can at leastin theory go and verify like very easilyand there seems to be sort of like apurposeful obscuring in many waysespecially around something likeeconomics which is extremely politicalbut you know even stuff like sociologyor psychology or something like thati don't know what do you think of thisidea that it's the edifice of academiais too big and that maybe that there'syou know there needs to be morecompetition or moreless of a monopoly or thinking that it'sone giant monolithic entity or somethinglike that i agree on everything you justsaidi don't think there's a bright linebetween the hard and soft sciences but iagree there's a spectrumand it gets easier and easier to letsocial factorsinfluence your beliefs the farther yougo on that spectrum away frommathematics which is like the goldstandardandthe funny enough the discipline thatwould study that is sociologythat's the discipline of like how muchinfection of your beliefs and resultscome fromwe need those disciplines becausewe are all human what we are seeingessentially is this big breakdown insocial epistemology it's a sociologicalproblem that we're encountering and tosome extent it's always been there it'sbeen obscuredyou know it's likewith the decentralization of opinionand belief through social media we'vekind of exposed a lot of heterodoxopinions and given them more airtimeit's not like there weren'tall these heterodox take they justdidn't make it on the evening news andthere were only three channelsblaring the evening news right so iagree there's a spectrum number onenumber two another point you made icompletely agree with is that theacademy is not a monolith even withindisciplines there are heterodox wings ihave to say my my colleagues here atreedin the economics department have beenverysupportive and helpful infor my own thinking through what bitcoinis and whether it's valuable i meani think they havegenerally keynesian leanings like alllike you know like from our perspectivelike the whole discipline does but theyhave a set of tools that are valuablefor thinking and those have beenvaluable for me as a bitcoiner too eventhough i disagree with them aboutmonetary policyi think the discipline has made a lot ofyou know discoveriesand there's a lot to be learned from iteven if one disagrees about theand that and so you go inside econ andyou have you know different schools ofthought as you know some of the people iwork with at the bitcoin policyinstitute are economists will luther istherejosh hendrickson sowe have our economists that use the sameset of toolsthere's variation within there but evenwithin the branch of econ that i'm notintoi see a lot of value there in additionto the ideology and yeah i think theacademy needs competition always that'skind of the underlying principle ofscience right it's the opposite of amonolith it's actually constantlycritiquing and retesting and advancingand that's the history of science it'sconflict of ideas it's really adarwinian strugglein the search for truth that we kind ofmake into a social institutionwhere we have these contests right thatis the the institution of sciencebutin periods of revolution scientificrevolution means that whole institutionhas kind of got it wrong and isdefending a wrong paradigm and then weupend it and get another one we call theresult science but the people who areheterodox during that revolution mightnot be called scientists during therevolution they might be calledanti-scientists right while it'shappeningand i kind of think bitcoiners are rightthere they're actually like scientistsare kind of on the cutting edgemonetary theory especiallythey're being called anti-scientificbutin the future we'll just look back onthem as like leading scientists of thatperiodbecause we're gonnascience will eventually follow the truthso yeah i agree with all of that stuffandjust i just think as an insider in theacademy like my big lesson is that we'vegot to do better we've got to bring thatcontest inside we have to learn from itlike i'm amazed that the way thateconomists treat this phenomenon whichis now 13 yearsold andboomingand upending conventional wisdomi would treat this if i were a scientistas an anomaly good this is again inkuhn's languageit's an anomaly something that liesoutside of their paradigm where they'relike well it's nota stable unit of account it's not ameans of exchange it's it's not a goodshort-term store of value so it can't bemoney but it's only value is if it ismoney therefore it's worthless that'sthe conclusionand i've heard that from a number ofeconomists and then they watch thisthing just violate that reasoning inreal time empiricallyand i think that's like a great momentin the history of science that's likefinding athat's like finding astronomicalphenomena that you didn't think couldhappen or you mix some things togetherin a test tube and you find some newreaction that you had never seen beforeand it's like okay time to revisit thetheory retool it and figure out whatthis phenomenon is because ultimatelyeconomics is an empirical science it'ssupposed to even though a lot of ithappens within theoretical assumptionsultimately it's supposed to be useful inexplainingeconomic phenomenaand here's an economic phenomenonexplain it right now the discipline hasno explanation for it so i think it's agreat moment for economists to you knowseize on the puzzle and try to solve itoh so i'm a little bit skeptical of thisabilityfor it to sort of revolutionizethe academy i guess even on a longerterm time scalebecause of you know like the way youpresented it it made it seem like okaywell there's you know differing opinionsall the time andyou know they're you know whatever istrue actually winsespecially in something like economicsthat doesn't seem to be the case and wegetstuff like the science says andthat sentence shouldn't make sense givenhow you describe science which is acompetition whereyou know this thing thatdescribesyou know reality bettershould win but instead this other thingwins yeah and that that phenomenonshouldn't be possible andyou know especially with uh respect tokeynesian economics you had somethinglike stagflation in the 70s whichif it were true that they were actuallyself-reflective and trying to learn thetruththen they would have abandoned some ofthe you knowideological orwhatever their sign says about thisbeing kind of impossibleyou know they would have come around andcome up with you know a different theoryor a different paradigm that wouldexplain that phenomenon but insteadit's more or less been going further inthe other direction which iswe need to defend whatever theeconomists at the fed aredoing and say that it's good or you'renot going far enough in the case of paulkrugman it's almost alwaysyou need to inject more money into theeconomy and you need like it seemsextremely motivated reasoning and andnot at all you know based on truth soyou know as somebody sitting on theoutside i i totally get why people don'ttrustthe monolithic thing because it'spresented a certain way andit's like okay you either accept thewhole thing or you don't and there areclearly things that are wrong soyeah do you blame people for rejectingitno i don't and what you said aboutthe way thatthe discipline is reacted to being wrongis exactly right they're kind ofdoubling downnot seeing their errors and that's alsocommon in the history of scienceso you know econ is different fromphysics but you know galileo was putunder house arrestand in basically thethe church then was the academy nowmaybe maybe people in churches and theacademy will reject that comparison butthe churches where knowledge was seatedand at that time there was no conflictbetween faith and reason because theywere basically because thomas aquinaswas the philosopher of the catholicchurchand he sawone branch science as natural theologyand and the bible has revealed theologyand so he didn't see any conflict thereso they were the academywhen someone violated their beliefs theyput them under house arrest and tried tosilence their books and i think scienceisdoing something very humanand similarnowin trying to squelch out heterodoxopinionsbut it takes some time to come aroundthe difference is that in econ you cankind ofby shaping the narrative you can make itcome true like i feel likepart of the goal of the elite bitcoinhatersin econ and i have somewhere a list ofall of them i've combined like a list ofall theeconsourced bitcoin hateand and a lot of these are economistswho i've read and i i like them in onecase i knowa couple cases i know personallyi feel like what's going on is reallyweird here and different from thephysics thingbecauseyou know the church couldn't make thesun go around the earthbut the economists actually kind of canmake their prediction coming true cometrue in some ways because they controlthe instruments of money itselfand they shape the humanbehavior both through instance ofinstitutions of authority and alsothrough their voicesso it's really weird instead of sciencejust reporting on and recording realityyou have science as an input to realityand that's what's different right like isee krugmandoing his best to make his earlierprediction trueand you know if these institutions aresuccessfulthey will as one uh person put itrecently on twitterburnbitcoin to the ground and send its ashesinto the sun you know that's their goaland i don't think they're gonna succeedin doing that because you know honeybadgers don't care and etc butthat's kind of the goal they have anaction-oriented goal rather than aknowledge-oriented goal likebasic epistemology is matching your mindto the worldby conformingthe mind to the world the direction offit is world to mind fit the worldor sorry mind to world you fit the mindto the worldbutin action it's the opposite you alsowant a mind world fit but you fit theworld to your mindand i think you know the history ofsciencethe goal of science is to fit your mindto the world but what we see with thiskind of motivated reasoning in certainsubsections of science is actuallychangereality so that it fits what you alreadybelieve about itthat's weird and i don't really considerthat to be part of sciencethat's part of politics or something youknow what i mean like make the world howwe want it to be and i see economistslike krugmanstepping between these two roles one andthe one hand he's just analyzing realityand the other hand he's trying to shapeit and what sucks is where you can'ttell what he's doing like if i alwaysknew which one he was doing i would belike okay totally dismiss the krugmanwho's just trying to shape the worldthe salty no coiner krugmanbut listen to what he has to say when heis trying to describe the world but intruth they're not distinct hisdescriptions of the world are shaped byway he wants the world to beand i guess you know i agree witheverything you said except that in thelong run i do think that the truth winsout and these lame attempts to controlitwill ultimately fail although they mightsucceed in the short termand i mean i think at some point it juststarts looking reallyfoolish i feel like the stagflation is agreat example but we haven't yet reachedsort of the pinnacle of the failure ofthis way of thinking and maybe it comeswith uhsomething that many economists mosteconomists probably reject but maybe itcomes with mmtand once we get like full mmt with youknow with a cbdcwith regular payments to all citizensthen a complete collapsethen you get people rethinking the wholeparadigm wait where do we go wrong butit has to get pretty extremeyeah it does have to get kind of extremedoesn't it and that's the part wherewhere i'm prettypessimistic in the academy'sability to correct itself because aslong as it's within certain bounds andit's plausible there is no paradigmshift coming and as youmentioned with respect to the history ofscienceyou know it has to get pretty bad beforebefore people will give up a certainthingand it's only at that point that uhsomething changeswith something like economics it itfeels like it's never going to reallycome to that i really i i hope you'rewrong but i won't say you're wrong but ihope i desperately hope you're wrong andwe can react to things and one of thesayings also is that these things don'thappen until a generation of scientistsdies offthat's another saying right and we mightthere's always this urge among youngpeople coming up in the field like theylearn from their elders but then they'realways going to attack their paradigmsso it's probably if i had to guess iwould saythere are some people who are ingraduate school right now at the bestinstitutions who are paying homagethey're paying their duesbut in their head they're starting toquestion these orthodoxiesand they are going to overthrow them inbrilliantways that we can't even anticipatebecause they're going to be fully versedin you know they're going to be fullyversed in economics at mitat stanford at princeton and thenand then it's going to be like they'regoing to like want all because there's alot of glory for whoever does it there'sa lot of glory for whoever makes thatthat transformative move i wouldn'tdoubt if they're a student at one ofthose institutions right nowpure speculationi'm skeptical of that particularline of reasoning for this reasonespecially in something like economicsyou don't advanceunlessyoulike essentially conform to thatparticular thing a particular paradigmand if you do sort of like flip thatparadigm thenyou've essentially likeargued yourself out of a job and this isthe thing that we've seen in the academyoverthe past 50 years especially in thesocial sciences is that they get waymore conformingto thelike political ideology i thinksomething likeyou know 0.1ofyou knowsocial scienceprofessors are like republican somethinglike that it's it'sthey're all verymuch on one side of the spectrumand it's an ideological sort of likelitmus test thati don't see a way out ofthat coming outout of that becausethere isn't something likeyou know like a telescope astronomicalobservations or something in a lot ofthis stuff that you can point to and saysee you're clearly wrong i mean like youpointed outbitcoin i think shows that a lot ofthese economists are wrong buti don't see them really going andchanging their or even the newer peoplecoming upchanging their stance because they getpaid by the very same people thatperpetuate iti mean it's definitely true and i'lljust add a little more color to itwhen you're coming up you know you haveto get a job and jobs are very verycompetitive in the academy less so ineconomics becauseeconomists have other optionsbut definitely in like sociology andanthropology it's hard to get a joband so you you really don't want to takethe risk of having an unorthodoxopinion that will put some people off ifyou put off one or two people on thehiring committee that's all it takesand then the next hurdle is tenure youhave to publish a bunch of pieces to gettenure and againyou don't want to underminethe goodwill towards you with others onthe committee that tenures you or thepeople who write letters to youso you basically have to get to the10-year point before you're free onceyou get tenure then you could trulyspeak your mind but to get tenure youhave to go through you know what it maybe eight years of graduate school andthen another six seven years ofpre-tenure work so you're you're at thispoint you're 15 years into fakingsomeone you're notin order to speak that's only gettinglonger right because it used to be thatyou could get an academic job right outof posted after a phd now you have thislikeeight-year post-doc wilderness that youhave to go that's right that's rightthere's this postdoc wilderness so it'slike by the time you get tenureat that point you are it's just kind ofan orwellian or souls and easternerspoint butby the point you get tenure you'vealready been socialized into conformityover decadesso you can't expect tenured people to berevolutionaries because theythey're the most conforming people youcan imagine exactly because that's theonly way you can get there really that'sthe only way you can get there soyou're rightand and the other thing you mentionedabout the kind of politicalmonopoly i mean that is tragic to me andi didn't mention this before but that'sbeen kind of behind a lot of my remarksthroughoutabout us in the academy letting lettingpeople down because we don't reflectthat viewpointwithin the academy viewpoint from theright and it's obvious when we speak andwrite it is obvious that for the mostpart we are not on the right side of thepolitical spectrum that's betrayed ineverything every word choice we make thethings that we notice and don't noticeand weirdly enough like this point is anepistemology point called i mean it'scalled standpoint theorythat basically your such situationsocially your identity whether you'reit's your raceor religion or socioeconomic classor your political affiliationsor your nationality these things affectwhat you see and what you miss in lifeand it can't easily be simulated bypeople who don't share those identitiesthat's a standard talking point withinepistemology within sociology and on theleft as an underlying rationale fordiversitybut it's weird that we have not i thinkfully learned that lessonand seen the effects of what happened soif you have a bunch of entirely whiteacademics let's saytalking toa group of possible test subjects all ofwhom are blackand asking them to participate in anexperiment you shouldn't be surprised ifmaybe there's a lack of trust there youknow we had tuskegeeand there's a memory of that it's likeokay but you expect an entire populationhalf of whom has a ideology that youconsider to be wildly immoralto trust what you say when that rep thatideology is completely unrepresented inyour ranks like anyway it's it's a it'sa lesson that has been learned in theacademy and applied elsewhere but notreally and truly to itself and we're nowpaying the price for it in the breakdownof trust in these institutions and iagree the breakdown in trust it's notentirely due to you know it's notentirely misplacedsome of it is legitimate because partsof the academy are politicizedand it's impossible to kind of for alayperson to go in and separate out thedifference instead we've just harmed thewhole institution which is why we haveto heal it and fix it as i see itwell is it healable is it fixablebecause at least from my perspectivewhat i think would actually changethings and make it better isreal competition and i mean that'scompatible right i agree with you i'dlove to see that toobut i i'm in it so i kind of wannanot only am i in it but like you know ii've got a foot in these two worlds iteach at read colleges it's called bysome the most progressive college inamericaand i'm in bitcoin many of whom areat the right end of the politicalspectrumand zealous about itandyou know what's weird is you you talk topeoplein these two communitiesandthey're all the same they're all peoplethey're good well-intentioned sincerepeople who are also flawedwho alsohave beliefs that you think are wrongbut it's likeyeah i i want to reiterate my colleaguesarei think of them astruth-seeking people with integrity whoare trying to do the best they can andthat that goes for almost all of mycolleagues doing almost all of what theydoeven the economists they've beenwonderful to meand so i'm i'm not ready to give up inthe sense that i feel like there's somekind of tragedy of communication herebecause i feel like if people could walkthe halls that i walk and talk to thevery same people i talk to every day andwork with you know you'd see they're notmonsters bent on disinforming the publicand it feels the same way when i'm inbitcoin like what what i hear thestereotypes i hear about bitcoiners it'slike come on have you met any of thesepeople they're awesomethat's why i don't want to give upalthough competition of course iswelcome it's like i'm i'm inside thebelly of the beast andpeople are really great here you knowthese are my friends they're reallydecent peopleyeah i mean i get that there most peoplethat you meet i think are going to benice but there's somethingthat's like characteristic of the entiresystem that maybe is differentthanany individual within it and i don'tknow if it'sthis is uh necessarilysomething that i can articulate verywell butyou know there's sort of likea group attitude that may be worse thanany single person's attitude you knowwhat i mean so so true it'sit's it's definitely true yeah that imeanabsolutely not just within the academybut elsewhere i see exactly that dynamici agreeand in that case you know likethe academy is very hostile topeople that disagree with it andespecially its political points um andthat that seemsto me the thing that sort of harms it inmany ways and whyyou knowi don't know ithink there's like sort of like anascentyou know competitivesort of alternative that's starting tocome upuh because the academy has had amonopoly for so long that that'sstarting to compete with ityeah and i think about like the peoplethat go on joe rogan for example right alot of them are fromthe academy but some of the you knowthey there are veryyou know different points of view andcan sort of hearthe reasoning right they sort of showyouat least through those like four-hourconversations or whatever they they showthe work a lot of times and whereaswith you know a press release from theipcc or something like that it's justsort of like okaywe have no idea of how you did the workor anything like that it looks likeand feels like a political document whatdo you thinki think it'sfirst of all the competition isextremely welcome and i'm really gladthat there are outlets for academics tospeak to the general public and sharetheir work that run around a kind ofcensorship system i mean i'manti-censorship that includesanti-censorship within the academy idon't think thatyou know minority views in scienceshould be squelched and i'm glad theyget an audiencei think it is difficult for lay peopleto evaluate some of these argumentsbecause they do take a lot of trainingand that's notsomething i like it just feels like wellman you know some of this stuff isreally hard and it's first the ipcc iagree completely about like a pressrelease but they also do show their workin these thousandmulti thousand page reports that isdefinitely proof of work they have it'snot just i mean i hate these likeletters i hate group letters in generalyou know i made it a policy not to signany group letter of any kindhate group letters because they'rebasically appeals to authorityand uhi don't like that but uh i do feel likethese these groups do actuallyyou know when they do issue a reportlike there it is every single footnoteevery single sourceall of the data that doesn't mean it'sunproblematic butand if you read the reports actuallythey're muchbetter as science than the releases andthen the letters that people sign andthen the journalism that's written aboutthem right generally when scientists arespeakingin their not just only in their ownvoice butin the context of a scientific articlethey're showing their findings and partof that is also owning up to what theirfindings don't show and some of that islike a confidence interval on whatthey've foundyou knowwhere how certain are we of this wherecould we be wrong i meanthat's the stuff i like actuallyin science but i agree with youbasically if there is censorship uhwithin the academy and there are brightpeople who have different ideas andthere always have been in the history ofscience and there always will be whetherthat's like washing hands between babiesthat you deliver or whether it's ideasabout electricityor or whether it's a you know somebodyin a in ayou know working in a patent officewho has an idea about space and timethemselves andthe history of science is full ofoutsiders with new ideas that challengeorthodoxy and they either find their waythrough the institution of science orindependent of it and are eventuallyvindicatedand i'm glad thoseoutlets exist and they must exist andand if we become more and more likeuniform politically and within theacademy we are onlyenhancinguh the build-out of those otherinstitutions i mean the same goes foreducation as a whole and i have to sayeven though i'm in this businessi think our college charges somethinglike 75 grand a year for tuitioni mean this whole kind of industryit's been propped up by funny money it'screated a massive student debt crisisand it has veered very far fromtheway of thinking of mostpeople in the country or a lot a goodnumber of people in the country and insome ways it's very vulnerable it's veryexpensive it is laden with layers ofadministration and it can be disruptedit could be disrupted onyou know on this kind of sailor academyfront of kind of scaling up educationwith technology much of which is freeand it could be disrupted on theresearch side by an alternativeinstitutionand soi mean that's great that's justcompetitionand i think that will yeah the academywill either adjustit will do a better job of communicatingitself and providing value and do abetter job of incorporating heterodoxviewsminority views giving voice to themgiving critique to them andcommunicating about them or it will losein this competition it's just i meanit's just like competition on themonetary front rightwe will see if education is a coinit willthe market will decide ultimatelywell that'sa really interesting thing to thinkabout because it is sort of like basedon education right like the academy butobviously 70 000 a year uh people arestarting to opt out you know all thisfunny money that's uh that's funding itit does you know it is being questionedandseems likei don't know like the beginning of theend maybe of the academy and i thinkcertainly for a lot of people theywelcome thatwhat do you wish we could keep if itwere to sort of collapseyeah it's kind of collapsing in themiddle of thein the middle of the kind of spectrum ofpriceyou know harvard's not going to collapseprinceton's not going to collapseswarthmore's not going to collapse andalso your kind of local communitycollege and state schoolwon't collapse because they're servingeconomic needs locally in the communityand they're run on a shoestringwhat's going to collapse is kind ofstuff in the middle it's not going toserve the one percent in the society andit's alsonot serving people who are strappedand local businessesthose will collapseand i think that'ssad from the perspective of i knowpeople a lot of people at thoseinstitutionsbut economically it's kind ofokay that's just going to happenin terms of what can survive i don'tknow i think about my uh my father's uhold institution which was universitywisconsinactually when that university was set upits mandate was to help the legislaturesettlequestions of factwhich would enable them to make wiserpolicythe the institution was supposed to belike a truth machineit would produce truths that you couldthen make good law on the basis ofand i think the history of our societyin the u.sbears witness to the success of thatmission state universities in particularfunded a lot of basic research some ofit was funded through the governmentthrough dodbut that basic research set up theunited states to be a powerhouseeconomically world worldwideand we have a more informed citizenry aswelland i think that's been a positive forour country on the whole you know i looki'm an educator i believe in educationi think it's great to spend some time inyour youth especiallyexploring life's great questions liketapping into the best of human knowledgefrom the pastand creating thingsyourself whether that's art music orintellectual product doing scienceyourself like i believe in this i thinkthis makes us a bettercitizenry and a better country andwealthier i hope that that core value isnot losteven as the economic institution ofwhich is you know i think bloated andsomewhat the result of misallocation ofresourceseven as that shrinks i hope we hold onto the core valuesof an educated citizenry an informedpublic policy and cutting-edgescientific research that undergirds a anindustrialleadership in the world you know i meanultimately i believe in science ibelieve in the power of knowledge and ithink we've benefited from it and i hopewe don't give that upjust because the thing has becomepoliticallycaptured and economically bloatedi don't know from my perspective i'dlike to see a lot of especially thesocial science stuff which i don't thinkadds any value whatsoever go awayand maybeput into different institutions becauseto me that's not really learning it'sindoctrination a lot of the i mean ihope you're wrong and it can be donebetter i think this conversation exactlyyou know is already sociologyand yeahno doubt that there it exists such adiscipline and that it could be donebetteri just don't think it can be done inthat context without it becoming superpolitical which you knowdoesn't it becomes way more aboutmotivated reasoning and the truth getssacrificed in that casei would like to see a lot moreengineering but even even in like so i'ma math guy right soeven in something like physics i seeso many people spending time on stufflike string theory whichcannot be proven like literally cannotbe proven andthere are no experiments that anyone'sthought of that can figure out whetheror not it's truebut there arehundreds if not thousands of phddissertations you know entiredepartments full of people that arethinking about that stuff rather thanactually trying to figure out whatreality is that to me is justsort of like mental masturbation um andthat'sthat's what a lot of this stuff tends togo towards in large part because of thissort of rent seekiness of a lot of thesepositions where you know if you can't beproven wrong then you don't haveanything to worry aboutand if you can just like flood peoplethat disagree with youto the end and never really be provenwrong great your your positionposition's secure foreverthat seems to be howthe academy has progressed and i i don'ti don't see how it can reallyreverse that because of all of thefunny money as you say that sort ofprops all of that up they want thosepositions not so that they can seektruth but because it's a goodrent-seeking positionwell i mean as a metaphysician i'm in noposition to throw stones herebut um but i mean i did i do rememberpicking up a book in a bookstore in newyork once by a columbia professor callednot even wrong and it was about stringtheory and its inability to be falsifiedi mean i think there's something so i'vei will say this i mean my thinking isrooted in inin the history of of thinking it'srooted in the history of philosophyand it's very hard to kind of impose atest of testability or meaningfulness orlike that is what i was saying beforeabout that bright line between the hardsciences and the soft sciences it's veryhard to impose that and we've kind oflearned that historically because we'vehad movements in philosophy that triedto do it namely the logical positivistsand a lot of what i hear withinphysics especially physics that rejectsstring theory reminds me of logicalpositivism so for instance somebody toldme somebody in the physics departmentwho used to be in the physics departmentheretold me you know wellif something isn't falsifiabletheni'm not interested in it because itcan't be false and it can't be true andit's not meaningful and i just said tothem the thing that ilearned from the history of logicalpositivism which is like what about thatthing you just saidwhat you just said is that if somethingcan't be testedthen it's not true or meaningfulwell then what did you just say was thattruewas it meaningfulby your own lights it's neither so whythe hell did you say it like what wereyou sayingwe can't avoiditeven the dismissal of everything that'snot testableis not testablelife is bigger and thought is biggerthan just the realm of the testable andi would like to leave a little bit ofspace for it and i think we see that inplato and aristotle and jesus and youknow like in the entire history ofof thinkers but i agree that it isuniquely when something's not testableit is uniquelyuh vulnerableto motivated reasoning politicalinfluence and rent seeking i like thatuse that termbecause totally right in the sense thatyou can kind of build a fiefdomthat is untetheredfrom reality in a waythat's a kind of vulnerability and apossibility that's left open by somethings being untestableand i mean the person i like on this isanother econ hater of bitcoin and that'snothing to lab i mean he's great on thishe's great on this the this is the iyicategory and this is people who don'thave skin in the gameand you know i see that everywhere imean i am an intellectualyet idiot and i am somebody whodoesn't have skin in a lot of the gamesthat iwrite and think about but i i foundtele just absolutely hilarious on thisstuff i meanhe's dead he's he's he might be wrongabout bitcoin but i think on iyes ithink he's very accurate and thatyou know they like what are these peopledoing and are they really doing anythingi don't think he's as far as i know fromhis books he's ever really said thatthe cause of this is reallysort of like this weird monetaryrent-seeking phenomenon whichhappens almost everywhere from what ican seeand it does sort of like add a lot moremotivated reasoning to which whichresults in this behavior but that i meani think about it a lot as a philosopherii feel like i'm entrustedwithnot wasting people's moneyyou know whether that's my student'smoney and it's tuition or whether it'sstate money if i'm working for a stateinstitutionyou know there's a great great deal oftrust because i couldjustengage in what you called mentalmasturbation i could take up problemsthat don't matterand just crank out papers on them andpossibly get them published and you knowmake a life out ofwhat isn't actually valuableand soit's a structural vulnerability but itake it as a matter of personalresponsibility that i should not do thatand then i should only take up questionsthat actually domatter to human beings and to humandiscourse and of course there's nevergoing to be uniformity about that and ofcourse a lot of things that seem to bewasteful turn out not to be and you mustknow this as a mathematician a lot ofmathematical discoveries are made purelyforthe enjoyment and beauty of theirdiscovery and yet they eventually provedto be usefuland you know human beings right the worduseful is uh doing a lot of work in thatsentencewell that's right i mean that's right imean who gets to even say what useful islike i i think to some extentmathematicsis its own end and discovering newmathematical truth is like discoveringmore of space you know that is usefuljust like that that's part of what it isto live a full and rich human life and ifeel the same way about poetry i feelthe same way about philosophy and musicyou know they're like studying thesethings is in and of itself valuable notonly for what comes out of itright soi feel like if we abandon that entirelyin the free market another institutionwill arise that fulfills the human needto study and produce in-depth thesequote-unquote useless things that arenevertheless part of a of a fulfillingexistencedoes string theory reallydo that for quantum computing oryou know cold fusion or all of the allof this stuff thathonestly we've wasted way too much moneyon way too many resources on that reallyhaven't produced anything for manydecades andfor for some of this stuffand seemed to besort ofyou know very ripe forrent seekingwell it's kind of like it's kind of likestartups and you know vc it's likeyou're gonna have a lot ofexcess and you're gonna have that onewinner that pays off hugeand you know cold fusion is not paid offuh take just fusion generallythat hasn't paid off either but if itdoes pay off is it its energy on a vastscale that you know pumps us up thekardashevmeasure you know so it's likeoh man you know and everybody i'vetalked to about it says we're 10 yearsawayfrom with enough investment and ofcourse they've been saying that for thelast 40 years butit's like it's hard to turn down aninvestment because the potential payoffis sobig and i don't know about string theoryhonestly i i can't well but this is sortof like the flaw of academia which hasessentially become financialized in myopinion which is thatyou know money solves everything rightyou just pour more money into it andwe'll have more knowledge in this areai think string theory is proof thatessentially what happens is you pour alot of money into it and it goes touseless waste right like likethis is true of education as well wherethey're like okay if we just put moremoney per student their thing willimproveit's thissort of likemeta assumption about the role of moneyin everything which is thatif you just add more money it'll improvex and that's just not true it's way moreaboutthe systems and the people involved andhow they operate and the incentives thatyou give them if you just pour money itit almost never works like from aneconomic perspective yeah i mean icertainly agree with you abouta lot of those cases i mean some thingshowever require a lotof funding and we learned this inphysicsbasically followingphysics radically changed as adiscipline because of world war ii youknow the search for the bombwe went from small physics to bigphysics you know in the 1930s you couldgather all the leading physicists at oneconference in the world physicistsdidn't have a lot of moneythey they madeincredible breakthroughs like relativityand quantum mechanics without any moneyto speak ofbut the bomb changed everything wecreated an institution that largely didbecome about applying for and managinggrants like leading physicists like youcan manage a ton of money they'rerunning like fiefdoms corporationsreallyand and that did lead to various kindsof breakthroughs and now you havemassive particle accelerators there's noway to do that from the armchair andcheaply sosome of what big science does nowdoes take a hugeinvestmentwell so the question then is how much ofit isis the result of all of this funding andlikeat least for me looking at the historyof physics like the stuff pre-world warii is way more significant and paradigmchanging than the stuff after world warii so adding that money actually if youlook at it from a purelycorrelational standpointdoesn't seem to have actually made muchand like people are trying for newparadigms all the time string theorybeing one of them but it actuallydoesn't explain reality better and it'salmost alwayslike sort of off on these weird tangentsthatand you know particularly expensivestufflike particle accelerators instead ofother things that might be way moreuseful like how much of that are wemissing nowbecause we went this route ofyou know big physics as you sayyeah that's a great question and i wishi knew more i don't know any more thanyou do on that front like what is malinvestment in researchand how do we improve theyou know return on investment in sciencegenerallyand i don't disagree that there's atremendous amount of mal investment butit's also not clear how you doinvestment in a way that gives you abetter return it's just someone who isyou know written grants and is oncommittees that award grants and workswith colleagues who are writing grantsall the time like the process of writinggrants is exactly the process of tryingto achieve a more efficient investmentand it just sucks for everybody i meanwriting these grantsoccupiesa tremendous amounts of time and energythat actually keep you from yourresearch but we make the grant writingprocess more and more like there aremore and more hoops to jump through toget the money thrown at you andthat's precisely to avoid malinvestmentbut what ends up happening is that yourjob then becomes about jumping throughthese hoops rather than learning stuffso so it's it's yes it's malinvestment idon't know exactly how it gets fixed buti know that a lot of the attempts to fixit actually make it worsekind of like you know kind of like ifyou want to spend money for a governmentagency and you work for let's say thedepartment of defense or whatever theythey've bought too many whatever 5 500toilet seats so now you have to jumpthrough 12 hoops to buy a toilet seatthe hoops that you jump through mightmight waste more money than actuallyjust paying a lot for an occasionaltoilet seat when somebody finds aloophole right anyway it's kind of likethat in the academy it's really hardgenerally to seewhere science will grow and what countsas apromising investmentkind of likeregular vc decisions but even harderbecause we're like in advance of knowingstuffand i feel like you know i i've i'veactually talked to some people who headthese organizations the national sciencefoundation and kind of about thisproblemand uh some amount of waste isinevitable for the return limiting thethe waste isincredibly difficultand yeah maybe maybe this is thebitcoiner perspective maybe the problemgets a lot easier when you can't justprint money andthe money is scarcer to be to begin withand i take your point about physicsbeingin a way not as groundbreakingpost-world war ii but what we don't knowis what physics would look likein the history of you know saysemiconductorswithout public that massive publicinvestment without big physics whatwould we know and how would it have gonehow much more impoverished we've been wecan't really see that counterfactualright so yeah a lot of people really canbut what we do have is pre-world war iilike you saidyeah wasn't much money going inwe got relativity we got quantum we gotlots of like groundbreaking thingslike actual experimentation that thatproved a lot of that stuffit seems to me likethe academy is like that giantgovernment programwhere uh like post-world war ii like howuh science has been donewhereas like pre-world war iimaybe it was a lot more likeyou know individuals sort of doing itandi'm sure you can tell me better but itseems to me that the history of sciencea lot of the people that make thesebreakthroughsare not even scientists or evenengineers they're justpeople that are really into the topictheysort of fund their own stuff andand you know come up with an experimentand you know public like sort of likelet people know about it and that that'showscience used to progressseems like this government giantgovernment program versus entrepreneursthat seems to be the big model changethat that's happenedyeah yeah i think uh going back inhistorythe institution of science didn't reallyexist it hasn't existed for i mean theword science didn't exist until whateverwas 1850 or somethingthere was the church and there werepeople who were working for the churchand that was the kind of closest we hadto the institution then we haduniversitiesbut nothing approachingthe institution we have in science todaywhat i love reading about these old youknow parties in victorian england wherepeople did science experiments like forfun in their basements like they wouldyou know have all their friends out totheir mansion andput together us an experiment to testlike the nature of light orwhatever you know so science scienceused to be a a leisure activityaristotle would call it leisuresomething you work in order to do thatscience was in that category and i wouldsay even more than entrepreneur it waslike a leisure activity and then it gotpushed over into the work categoryscience it used to be a way of sort ofthe highest way of of exercising yourhumancuriositythat is very difficult to do now giventhe scope of human knowledge i mean likewhy haven't we had breakthroughs likerelativity and quantum theorypost war it's it's because that waslow-hanging fruit man that waslow-hanging fruit like you can you knowwhat i meanthere aren't just likewhen you learn physics nowyou know at reinference i can speak tothis you have to start taking physics onday one uh when you come here and youhave to take physics throughout yourentire educationyour fourth year you get to relativityand quantum theoryin your senior yearthat's where yournow your experimentation like startswhereas pre-war that wasn't in thecurriculum because it hadn't been evendiscovered yet right so there's justlikewe have less and less low-hanging fruitand more and more what we learn requiresthe uptake of knowledge of everythinghumans have got to this point and then alot of thatrequires like fancy experimentation likeeven these pre-war experiments likemeasuring the speed of light is nottrivialyour setup has to be perfect to measurethe speed of lightthat's really tricky and like we have anuclear reactor here at reed we have usthe only student-run nuclear reactor inthe country again that's not reallysomething you can have in your victorianbasement you know maybe it will be withsmrs but you know getting a nuclearreactor set up is uhvery very tricky you know soscience has advanced far enough thatamateur discoveries are very difficultyou know and it's one of the thingsthat's so cool aboutbitcoin and one of the things thatamazed me coming into itwas it was a place where amateurscould just seriously roll out of bed andmake contributions you could you couldmake a commit withouthaving a phd in computer science rightyou could make a contribution and it'sincredible or to the general discussionand i believe that's true across ofcourse a lot of areas but in a lot ofareas it really isnotlike well i i don't know i'm going tohave to disagree with you on that onebecause i i think you underestimate thesort offirst of all the desire of a lot ofpeople to just learn for learning sickand second be thesort of creativity of people to discovernew things on the cheap maybe it's veryexpensive because that's the money'smoney was always sort of availablewhereasif you were forced to figure out someway to test some nuclear reactionpeople would have come up with somethingmore interesting and fast uh you knowthrough the work of genius instead ofthat same person you know doing a20-year journey to get to tenure at auniversity maybe maybe they you knowfigure something out in their basement idon't knowi mean i hope you're right and i wouldlove toto see it and i'm actually sure there isa lot of you know i'm sure there is alot of low hanging fruit around that wehave missed i do believe as you say inhuman curiosity ingenuity it's just it'sjust that a lot of the you know grantproposals that i see for instance idon't see a cheaper way to study themthan doing what people are proposingmaybe that's my own lack of imaginationbut ii don't see it if you don't have a grandthing then people just do it on theirown right like and and do it smaller ormaybe there arerich people you know like the oldmedicis or whatever and yeah and soit's sponsoring artyou see academics around the world thatare incredibly resourceful where whichare at under-resourced institutionsyou know scihub means we can sharescientific papers for free basicallyeverywhere yeah you do see smart peoplearound the world with institutions withfewer resources kind of doing the bestthey can with what they have and it'spretty cool you're right that does existalready in a way just from underfundedplaceswellthis has been an interesting discussionabout epistemology and science and allthat stuff where can people find youwhere can people contact you yeah thishas been an interesting discussion wehaven't even really talked about youknow what i've done in bitcoin and stuffit's fine people can figure that out onby following me on twitter i'm at thetropro t-h-e-t-r-o-c-r-oi'm also a fellow at the bitcoin policyinstitutebpi where i'm writing mostly aboutmining and energyandlet's see um yeah i'm at read collegei'm in my office right now but i'mactually on a leave right now unpaidleave just to work entirely on bitcoinand explore this spaceso i have a foot kind of thoroughly inthe bitcoin worldand if you want to contact me to talk tome about particularly issues on energybut really anything in bitcoin and i'dlove thatfeel free to reach out through twitterdmsall rightunchained capital is a sponsor of thispodcast i'm an advisor to the company iknow the team well and i'm excited forwhat they are building if you needcollaborative custody or a bitcoinnative financial services partnerlearn more at unchained.comwell that wraps it up for this episodeof bitcoin fixes this troy cross can befound atthe trokrow on twitter until next timefiat the lindesteyou[Music]welcome to bitcoin fixes this where weexplore the impact that bitcoin willhave in all aspects of societytoday's guest is troy crossprofessor of philosophy and bitcoiner wetalk about science academia what'sbroken about the current system and whyit came to be the way it ishe also talked about bitcoin and howthat fits into the picture[Music]troy cross how's everything going manit's going great how are you jimmyi'm good i'm good where in the world areyou right now i just got back to uhportland oregon last night i'm in myofficeyeahvery nice how are you where are you areyou in austini am i am so you're in portland you knowi know they had some stuff going on afew years ago oh yeah any of theresidualconsequences of that that you're feelingstill or is it mostlyi think definitely we are still feelingit and it's a combination of factors thestuff going onyou know we have a severe homelesscrisishere as we do along much of the five onthe west coastandhousing prices are very highuh not high relative to san franciscoand maybe austin right now but uh highrelative to most of the country and wehad demonstrationsthat turned violent and destructiveand also which brought downyou know the force of the lawin a way that was really reallycounterproductivefrom many of our perspectives one of mystudents actually got abducted byfederal border patrol agentswalking home from a protest hoodedthrown into an unmarked vanand renditioned away to a federalbuildingand interrogated his stuff searched youknow it was wild so it just felt reallyreally weird and and no things havenever quite returned to normal in inportland covid wiped us out we had a lotof restaurants closed downwe're bouncing back but we've got asevere kind of malaise i thinkin terms ofyou know just people who don't have aplace to stay and they're just kind ofparked all over the cityand trash everywhere and it's we're notquite back to normal having said thatyou know the impression of portland thatyou might geteven from what i just said is wrong andmost of portland is still one of themost beautifulyou know cool places that there is thatthere are it's just just not back towhere it was a decade agoi see i see so i'm bringing you on thisshow because you'rea philosopher and we do want to talkabout bitcoin and everything else butwhat do you make of what's happened inthe last few years like what's youropinion sort of like as a philosopherwhat's going on at a deeper macro leveli mean i don'thave a perfect diagnosis of what's goingon that's part of what's scary is nobodyreally knowsbut i do seetrust and communicationsbreaking down across different segmentsof society and i see peoplekind of entrenching and doubling downand becoming more extreme across theboardand basically thei'm an epistemologist that's you know westudy the theory of knowledgeand the way wehave advanced as a species is the waythat we've advanced in all other formsoflifewhich is todivide and conquer to specialize intrade you know this is how cities formedi don't know how to do all the stuffthat you know how to doyou know how to do stuff that i don'tknow how to do and so we specializebecome really good at something we tradefor other stuffand that happened with knowledge toobecauseall i have to do is look around myhallway here to see all of thesespecials see new stuff that i can'tpossibly know because it just takes toomuch time to learn it allgiven the advancement of human knowledgeso we specialize and we tradeand that system of specialization intradeit's not quite like specialization intrade with goodsbecause with a good you can kind ofcheck it for qualitywhereas for knowledgeit's not easy to check it's really noteasy to check when it's highlyspecialized knowledge it is if it's likeyou know somebody building a weapon youuse the weapon it either works or itdoesn'tbut for a lot of knowledge it's not soeasy to check it's complicated and ifyou don't trust those intermediaries oryou're trading knowledge withthe whole system breaks down and you'reback to building up your ownsystem of knowledge from scratchwhichsounds great but is actually almostimpossible givenhow much human knowledge there is andhow it's specialized into all of thesedifferentcrooksyou know crooks and umpockets so i guess what i see as aphilosopher as an epistemologist this isme seeing through my own window is itbreakdown of trust in a socialinstitutionsthat allowed us tonot worry about the truth about all ofthese like details in lifeand just trade for those with each otherand now i see a system where everythingis in question we have groups of peoplewhohighly distrust the other groupsand those institutions that kind ofcertified knowledge those are nottrusted anymoreand you have a socialcollapseyou know because of that it's spiralingever more extreme because we don't havea connection totruthvia trusted basically trustedintermediarieswell you mentioned sort of thisbreakdown and this lack of trustwhat caused that and whylike do they are the people that aren'ttrusting the authorities or in certainfields are they being dumb or do theyhave good reason fortheir behavioryeah that's a great question andi guess here's where i differ from a lotof mycolleagues who are in the academybecause i think it's a mutual i thinkit's caused by three thingsone is it's caused bysystems that amplify misinformationeasily like rumors travel faster thantruth and that's a kind of common storythat in some ways you know post a falsestory on facebook it'll travel fasterthan the truth because it's catchier anddesigned to spreadthat's you know that's a that's a partof the story but a largepart of the story is that theauthorities have screwed up i mean byauthorities i mean people like me andpeople in the academyuh who've been less thanfully transparent and honestand who have also succumbed to partisanrancor and identity politicsand i think once you have this kind ofsocial divide between people who arelike you people who are not like youif the authoritiesseem to be captured by a group identitythat's not yoursyou can't trust what they sayand i feel like a lot of the academyeither has been captured by ideology oreven when they haven'tthey haven't done enough to shed theappearance that they haveso i don't blame people for not trustingauthority and i guess we could go intospecific examples where authorities havescrewed upbut i feel like wei'm not blaming my colleagues in thesense that i know how to do it right anddo it better it's a very hard thing todobut you know government agencies thatcertify knowledge they have to beseen as apolitical they have to be seenas apolitical if they're to be trustedand they aren't being seen that wayand they often aren't that way i meani'll give an example of i saw a famousuh climate scientistpost something on twitter a few weeksagowhere there was a projection that halfof florida would be underwater by somedate in the future i don't remember whatit was 2080 or something like that2100 i don't remember the dateand he posted like oh great you knowit's a red state maybenature has a way of taking care ofitself or something and i just thoughtlike oh my god this is a person who wona macarthur prize who won a sagan prizeand my thought was just great you justfrittered awayyou know so much public trustby aligning yourself not not only beingreally cruel and inhuman but aligningyourself with a political point of viewand dehumanizing everybody who doesn'tshare it now nobody's going to trustyour sciencebecause they'll see your science as asimple kind ofyou know motivated by your desire toimpose your beliefs on others ormotivated by revenge or motivated bysocial factors rather than by an honestaccounting to relay the evidence as yousee itso yeah i i think there's plenty ofblame to go around in the breakdown oftrust but i guess where i differ fromsome others in this view is thati feel like we've lost trustpartly because of our ownclose-mindedness and inability to listento othersand to regain trustyou cannot regain trust as a simplematter of authority or censorship youknow i don't think that the answer islike oh we can bring america backtogether again bycensoring social media effectively it'slike that's obama's moveno i adamantly reject that idea i feellike it would only accelerateit would only accelerate the dissolutionof america and in order to heal americawe have to re-earn trustand that means not dehumanizing peoplethat means listening to people wherethey're at not insulting theirintelligence not insulting themand showing our evidence and just likeit's a hard work of education you're aneducator rightyou're an educator you confrontmisinformation and disinformation everyday about bitcoinandand other things and you know it'sfreaking hardto talk across difference and there's nosubstitute for that that involvestop-down authorityyou know constricting information orquestions ordesignating some people asthe sensors because they have power thatthat makes everything worse in myopinionwell so there's a couple of things thati want to pick you know sort of pull thethread on a little bit one is yourargumentseems to be essentially that a lot ofpeople are bad at presentingtheirresearch or you know their findings andso on and thatit gets perceived bythe opponentsas this is politically motivatedtherefore it's no goodi mean the question for me is does thatactually happen likeis it that they are being truthful theyjustseem partisan and they're bad atpresenting it's a communication issueoris it it does the rot go deeper is itthat they really are partisan and thatthey really are sort of like and this isthe question i think many people inpublic kind of have which isyou know how much of it is just thembeingi don't know the arrogant ivory towerintellectual that can't be bothered toexplain something to you know somebodythat's too dumb to understand it orbut you know what they're saying isactually true versusthey're activelylikesort of manipulating what what theypresent tomake it seemyou knowfavorable towards whatever politics thatthey have like how motivated i guess arethese people by truth and howmuch fidelity is there towards truthyou know versus you know their lack ofcommunication skills these seem to betwo different issues i agree there aredifferent issues and um you know when ii mean one thing about being in bitcoinis you see a lot of motivated reasoningeverywhereand you know the first it's like a verypowerful lesson in epistemology actuallyjust to watch discourse happen in thisspace becauseeverybody has bags and everybody ispumping their bagsand those bags are very obvious in thecase ofyou knowalt coinerspumping their altcoin bags it's so it'sso obvious and your dm's are full ofpeople who want you to do the same forthemandthat's like really obvious instance ofitbut you realize thateverybody's doing it you know peoplepushingthe traditional banking system and thedollar and traditional financethey benefit from pushing thatandeven people whose bags are merelyreputational and historicali thinka lot of the earlyeconomistswhotook a stand against bitcoin and said itwas worth zero seem to becheering for it to go to zerobecause it would make them right youknow what i mean they're justtheir reputation is their bags theydon't have actual bags but they havereputational bagsor identitarian bags and it's almostlike a slogan that applies across theboard that humans are always pumpingtheir bags whatever those bags are andyou can'tyou can't avoid pumping your own bagsand everybody else is doing it too inorder to serve the truth you have to getbeyond that somehowand umand i wouldn't say that's any differentin academia people have bags and they'repumping them of course i mean this iskind of like basic philosophy of sciencewe work within paradigmsthomas kuhnis the one whoi guess sets out this structure ofnormal science and revolutionary sciencemost periods of science work within aparadigm that is there's a set of kindof rules and things you take for grantedand you work inside of that and you dowhat's called normal sciencemaking the theories ever more precisebut you never question thethe foundation of that science and thenthere are periods of revolutionarysciencewhere the foundations get questionedand you know that's people likecopernicusand galileo and darwin who kind of callinto question the reigning paradigm oftheir fieldand those are different kinds of scienceand definitely during normal science youare defending and taking for grantedalmost all elements of the theories thatyou're working inside ofand you're trying to push your ownactualyour own brand within the field andpromoting yourself and some of thatmeans kissing up to the right peoplepaying homage to the right peoplethere'syou know humans are humans inside theacademy it's no differentand then there are the academy aseverybody knows is highly political andpoliticized it would just be utter lieto say otherwise and so those politicalbags are definitely being pumped in theacademythat's true there's an element to thatand and we see it in bitcoin right itwould be utterly foolish for me to tellyou thatthat you know paul krugman is astraightforwardly honest economist whojust can't quite communicate well and istherefore perceived as being biased likehe clearly has a bias he's just he's astraight-up name-calling salty no coinerright that's what he is and he justhappens to have a nobel prize ineconomics and what do you mean and be anew york times columnistyou know but i have to say being insidethe academyi also seethat the vast majority of work thatpeople do is not that you know it's veryhard work of crunching numbersdoing observations setting up studiescritically thinking like the vastmajority of we work we do is notpoliticized or political it's actuallyreally extremely boringand you're just trying to crank it outright that's so both things arehappening and i have seen likescientists be incredibly poorcommunicators that it'sit's what happens it's kind of like youactually know this because you're abitcoin educator and you're good at ityou know how hard it is but you you getcursed by having too much knowledge in asub-specialtythe stuff i work on the most i have thehardest time explainingbecause i'm way into a world that hasits own technical vocabulary its owntraditions and i have forgotten whatit's like evento not know that stuff it's really hardto put myself in the shoes of somebodywho doesn'tyou know and and i see a lot ofscientists in thatin that frame of mind so i think boththings take place i i have to say mywife is ainfectious disease hospital pharmacistand she during the outbreak of thepandemicspentyou know every day all day studying allof the treatments of kovid as each studycame out she analyzed itand then she broke down that analysisand shared it with herhospital team university teamother pharmacists doctors other healthhealthcare providers like what is thebestway we can treat this thing according tothe data that's coming in rightand i saw her break that downevery daywith the utmost integrity andability she had and those studies arenot easy to interpretand find flaws with them but thatspeciality is like taking apart thesethese methodologies but also in thecontext of knowing a lot aboutinfectious disease generally the humanbody generally treatments generallyand so i sawdefinitely bogus studies being touted asgreat studiesfor political reasonsand uhi saw a ton of hype taking over whatwhat was actually the science andand i saw the value of being aspecialist and actually spending yourwhole life studying something and mywife's perspective throughout the wholething was likewhen it came to something likehydroxychloroquine her perspective waslike we don't have any good evidencethat it works we have some preliminaryevidence it's totally not enough to makea clinical recommendations on the on thebasis of it andyou know her perspective was the sameforivermectin for instance it was like wellthere's some promising stuff but notreally enough to make a recommendationandthat reflected hersort of knowledge of all of these otherdrugs for other conditions that had beenthrough exactly the same kind of onepromising study butit was flawed and it works in vitro butthat doesn't mean anything for otherworking people and you know that entirecontext was missing and it was reallyweird to see thatday by day just hard science done forsomebody who just wanted to work ontreating the virus as best she couldup against a political whirlwind ofeverybody speculating you know peoplewith no training at alljust kind of with very very firmopinionswhich she did not have because shedidn't think the evidence supported ityou know so i i've seen honest scienceand an inability to get it across and ofcourse i've seen motivated reasoning inthe academy too there's there's plentyof both plenty of both jimmywell that's a very long answer to sayingbasically it's sometimes one sometimesthe other i guess a question for you atleast as sort of like someone outsidethe academy iswell then how do you determine what'sone and what's the other i think youpretty much said that you knowpart of it ismotivated reasoningand part of it is you know just badcommunication skillsyou know how is a layman supposed totell the difference because you know imeanat least in the field that i'm mostfamiliar with which is economics it alllooks like motivated reasoning to melike the entire department of economicsat every university seemed to beyou know justifying whatever governmentpolicies that happened to beyou know and you know you hear aboutstuff like reproducibilitycrisis and with scientific papers likeoh yeah you know it just seems like okaywell how true was this originally if youcan't reproduce it andyou know like if you have stuff likethat thenyou know how are we that are outside theacademy that don't know these peoplethey don't have this technical languagehow are we supposed to understand thisstuff i mean this is essentiallyvery much in your wheelhouse sinceyou're you're talking about epistemologyofyou know what how are we supposed toknow things ifthere's thisyou know maybe there are people likeyour wife that are very much you knowmotivated by seeking the truth but howdo welike it's all sort of lumped togetheryou know in the quote-unquote academyalong with you know her and paul krugmanyou know essentially are in the academyhow are we supposed to figure it out i imean i really wish i had an answerbitcoin is awesome because you can checkeverything yourself you know we havethis sayingyou know don't trust verifyand it in bitcoin that actually worksyou know it you can inspect every lineof code it's open source you can run ityourself you could basically check it'snot easy but you could check everythingyourselfsome of what's kind of amazing aboutbitcoin is that you can take apartfud that has actually been published inpeer-reviewed journalsjust by knowing the protocol you knowyou can take apart alex devries anduh camila mora and you can take apart alot of the sides of the flood dicejust by actually knowing how bitcoinworks and what it is and that is awesomethere are sections of the world whereyou can verify and obviously that's thegold standard not to trust anyone but toverifybut trust is unavoidableyou do have to trust people becausehuman knowledge is too broad to verifyeverything yourself i guess that's thenews that i bearfrom thetechnology front and i don'tif i had a solution which would allowyou to avoid trust you know that wouldbe greatbut the best thing we have honestlyis the institution of science itselfscience isthe means by whichwe minimize trust in others whilemaximizing the use of their discoveriesyou know the replicability crisis it'sgreat that you brought that upi meanwhat that shows is not a failure ofscience but that science it does showthat but it showsthat we need to do is replicate morestudies would you look you push into whythat crisis happened you know there's abunch of different causes one of them isflat out fraud certainlyone of them that happens a lot inscience there's a lot of fraud inscience one of them was that moreextreme results tend to get publishedbecause they're click-baityonly surprising things get published notboring things and if you just publish abunch of surprising things thenstatistically you're going to publishoutlying experiments that aren'treproducedone of them was a reliance on a certainkind of probability theory frequentismrather than bayesianismand one of them was havinginsufficiently high standards forstatistical significance so there are anumber of different causes that we'veidentified and another one is just likenot funding studies that simplyreplicate other fundings studies likethose being boring again andso we're kind of learning on a metalevel i actually have a colleague hereat reed who's in the psychologydepartment who's done a lot of his workon this replication crisisandbasically the discipline has to learnfrom it and i hopethat actually bitcoinis a lesson for economics and i hopethere will be a retrospective like howdid we miss the rise of thismulti-trillion dollarspacewhat was it about our discipline thatblinded us to iti hope they'll be asking those questionsjust as following the 2008 crisiswe saw the emergence of behavioraleconomics in part in response to likehow did we misshow did we miss this and it was likewe're too wedded to uh efficient marketshypothesis andwe were missing this irrational elementof human behavior so let's incorporateit into our discipline right so so justsorry to give you another long answer toyour question but no no i love longanswers so keep going you knowthe short version isi wish i had a way to sort through allof human knowledge and not trust thesystem we have but the best system wehave is scienceand that's the system that's kind ofbreaking downbecause it you know that's the systemthat has proven to be untrustworthy in awayand uh so all we can dois on the inside in the academy is workas hard as possible to re-establish thattrustdo better you know learn from ourmistakesbe better at listening be better atcommunicatingand more honest when we get things wrongall we can do is do better from thelayperson side i meanyou just can't have a really highcredence value about a lot of thingsthat you maybe thought you could ifyou're just trusting everyone if you canverify that's great definitelyskepticismis warranted if it's something thatcould be politically motivatedskepticism is warranted for me i stillthink science is the best thing i haveto go on for for the vast majority ofof issues and i do defer to mycolleagues anddespite the fact that it is politicizedand i may be getting it wrong some ofthe time because ii don't think the better option is likechecking with your local in-group leaderand asking them what they think becausei don'ti don't think that's a better systemthan science you know there's a hugereplication problem withincults and identity groups they don'texperiment at all and so they don't haverepeated experiments at all so you knowwhat i mean there still isn't a betteralternative i wish there were i wishthere wereand andi make an exception jimmy for you knowthe stuff where you can check for surelike bitcoin and the stuff where it isclearlypolitically motivated which you do seesometimes right and then you just kindof have to write it offwell so you know being in the bitcoinspace and sort of knowing the value ofbeing able to verify things yourselflike i thinkthe part of your answer thatbothers me a little bit is this ideathat the academy or science is onemonolithic entity and in a sense it isand that's what's bothering meit's this you know they seem tosort of claim a monopoly on thatknowledge andyes there's uh you know scientificprotocol and the scientific method andall this other stuff and standards orwhatever but as you said there's a lotthatsort of gets lumped in together you knowif you're measuring the speed of lightyou know that that's one thingbut that gets lumped in with you knowyou know paul krugman or whatever andthey all somehow areall sort of speakingas if they had the same amount ofauthority and you know i was a mathmajor and everything else so for meit's it'sa lot of the sort of purported thingsthat they say likei don't know maybe this is a bias youknow that people like me haveit's like the the softer the science isthe less i trust it because it seemsmuch more sort of motivated reasoningthere rather thanyou know something that you can at leastin theory go and verify like very easilyand there seems to be sort of like apurposeful obscuring in many waysespecially around something likeeconomics which is extremely politicalbut you know even stuff like sociologyor psychology or something like thati don't know what do you think of thisidea that it's the edifice of academiais too big and that maybe that there'syou know there needs to be morecompetition or moreless of a monopoly or thinking that it'sone giant monolithic entity or somethinglike that i agree on everything you justsaidi don't think there's a bright linebetween the hard and soft sciences but iagree there's a spectrumand it gets easier and easier to letsocial factorsinfluence your beliefs the farther yougo on that spectrum away frommathematics which is like the goldstandardandthe funny enough the discipline thatwould study that is sociologythat's the discipline of like how muchinfection of your beliefs and resultscome fromwe need those disciplines becausewe are all human what we are seeingessentially is this big breakdown insocial epistemology it's a sociologicalproblem that we're encountering and tosome extent it's always been there it'sbeen obscuredyou know it's likewith the decentralization of opinionand belief through social media we'vekind of exposed a lot of heterodoxopinions and given them more airtimeit's not like there weren'tall these heterodox take they justdidn't make it on the evening news andthere were only three channelsblaring the evening news right so iagree there's a spectrum number onenumber two another point you made icompletely agree with is that theacademy is not a monolith even withindisciplines there are heterodox wings ihave to say my my colleagues here atreedin the economics department have beenverysupportive and helpful infor my own thinking through what bitcoinis and whether it's valuable i meani think they havegenerally keynesian leanings like alllike you know like from our perspectivelike the whole discipline does but theyhave a set of tools that are valuablefor thinking and those have beenvaluable for me as a bitcoiner too eventhough i disagree with them aboutmonetary policyi think the discipline has made a lot ofyou know discoveriesand there's a lot to be learned from iteven if one disagrees about theand that and so you go inside econ andyou have you know different schools ofthought as you know some of the people iwork with at the bitcoin policyinstitute are economists will luther istherejosh hendrickson sowe have our economists that use the sameset of toolsthere's variation within there but evenwithin the branch of econ that i'm notintoi see a lot of value there in additionto the ideology and yeah i think theacademy needs competition always that'skind of the underlying principle ofscience right it's the opposite of amonolith it's actually constantlycritiquing and retesting and advancingand that's the history of science it'sconflict of ideas it's really adarwinian strugglein the search for truth that we kind ofmake into a social institutionwhere we have these contests right thatis the the institution of sciencebutin periods of revolution scientificrevolution means that whole institutionhas kind of got it wrong and isdefending a wrong paradigm and then weupend it and get another one we call theresult science but the people who areheterodox during that revolution mightnot be called scientists during therevolution they might be calledanti-scientists right while it'shappeningand i kind of think bitcoiners are rightthere they're actually like scientistsare kind of on the cutting edgemonetary theory especiallythey're being called anti-scientificbutin the future we'll just look back onthem as like leading scientists of thatperiodbecause we're gonnascience will eventually follow the truthso yeah i agree with all of that stuffandjust i just think as an insider in theacademy like my big lesson is that we'vegot to do better we've got to bring thatcontest inside we have to learn from itlike i'm amazed that the way thateconomists treat this phenomenon whichis now 13 yearsold andboomingand upending conventional wisdomi would treat this if i were a scientistas an anomaly good this is again inkuhn's languageit's an anomaly something that liesoutside of their paradigm where they'relike well it's nota stable unit of account it's not ameans of exchange it's it's not a goodshort-term store of value so it can't bemoney but it's only value is if it ismoney therefore it's worthless that'sthe conclusionand i've heard that from a number ofeconomists and then they watch thisthing just violate that reasoning inreal time empiricallyand i think that's like a great momentin the history of science that's likefinding athat's like finding astronomicalphenomena that you didn't think couldhappen or you mix some things togetherin a test tube and you find some newreaction that you had never seen beforeand it's like okay time to revisit thetheory retool it and figure out whatthis phenomenon is because ultimatelyeconomics is an empirical science it'ssupposed to even though a lot of ithappens within theoretical assumptionsultimately it's supposed to be useful inexplainingeconomic phenomenaand here's an economic phenomenonexplain it right now the discipline hasno explanation for it so i think it's agreat moment for economists to you knowseize on the puzzle and try to solve itoh so i'm a little bit skeptical of thisabilityfor it to sort of revolutionizethe academy i guess even on a longerterm time scalebecause of you know like the way youpresented it it made it seem like okaywell there's you know differing opinionsall the time andyou know they're you know whatever istrue actually winsespecially in something like economicsthat doesn't seem to be the case and wegetstuff like the science says andthat sentence shouldn't make sense givenhow you describe science which is acompetition whereyou know this thing thatdescribesyou know reality bettershould win but instead this other thingwins yeah and that that phenomenonshouldn't be possible andyou know especially with uh respect tokeynesian economics you had somethinglike stagflation in the 70s whichif it were true that they were actuallyself-reflective and trying to learn thetruththen they would have abandoned some ofthe you knowideological orwhatever their sign says about thisbeing kind of impossibleyou know they would have come around andcome up with you know a different theoryor a different paradigm that wouldexplain that phenomenon but insteadit's more or less been going further inthe other direction which iswe need to defend whatever theeconomists at the fed aredoing and say that it's good or you'renot going far enough in the case of paulkrugman it's almost alwaysyou need to inject more money into theeconomy and you need like it seemsextremely motivated reasoning and andnot at all you know based on truth soyou know as somebody sitting on theoutside i i totally get why people don'ttrustthe monolithic thing because it'spresented a certain way andit's like okay you either accept thewhole thing or you don't and there areclearly things that are wrong soyeah do you blame people for rejectingitno i don't and what you said aboutthe way thatthe discipline is reacted to being wrongis exactly right they're kind ofdoubling downnot seeing their errors and that's alsocommon in the history of scienceso you know econ is different fromphysics but you know galileo was putunder house arrestand in basically thethe church then was the academy nowmaybe maybe people in churches and theacademy will reject that comparison butthe churches where knowledge was seatedand at that time there was no conflictbetween faith and reason because theywere basically because thomas aquinaswas the philosopher of the catholicchurchand he sawone branch science as natural theologyand and the bible has revealed theologyand so he didn't see any conflict thereso they were the academywhen someone violated their beliefs theyput them under house arrest and tried tosilence their books and i think scienceisdoing something very humanand similarnowin trying to squelch out heterodoxopinionsbut it takes some time to come aroundthe difference is that in econ you cankind ofby shaping the narrative you can make itcome true like i feel likepart of the goal of the elite bitcoinhatersin econ and i have somewhere a list ofall of them i've combined like a list ofall theeconsourced bitcoin hateand and a lot of these are economistswho i've read and i i like them in onecase i knowa couple cases i know personallyi feel like what's going on is reallyweird here and different from thephysics thingbecauseyou know the church couldn't make thesun go around the earthbut the economists actually kind of canmake their prediction coming true cometrue in some ways because they controlthe instruments of money itselfand they shape the humanbehavior both through instance ofinstitutions of authority and alsothrough their voicesso it's really weird instead of sciencejust reporting on and recording realityyou have science as an input to realityand that's what's different right like isee krugmandoing his best to make his earlierprediction trueand you know if these institutions aresuccessfulthey will as one uh person put itrecently on twitterburnbitcoin to the ground and send its ashesinto the sun you know that's their goaland i don't think they're gonna succeedin doing that because you know honeybadgers don't care and etc butthat's kind of the goal they have anaction-oriented goal rather than aknowledge-oriented goal likebasic epistemology is matching your mindto the worldby conformingthe mind to the world the direction offit is world to mind fit the worldor sorry mind to world you fit the mindto the worldbutin action it's the opposite you alsowant a mind world fit but you fit theworld to your mindand i think you know the history ofsciencethe goal of science is to fit your mindto the world but what we see with thiskind of motivated reasoning in certainsubsections of science is actuallychangereality so that it fits what you alreadybelieve about itthat's weird and i don't really considerthat to be part of sciencethat's part of politics or something youknow what i mean like make the world howwe want it to be and i see economistslike krugmanstepping between these two roles one andthe one hand he's just analyzing realityand the other hand he's trying to shapeit and what sucks is where you can'ttell what he's doing like if i alwaysknew which one he was doing i would belike okay totally dismiss the krugmanwho's just trying to shape the worldthe salty no coiner krugmanbut listen to what he has to say when heis trying to describe the world but intruth they're not distinct hisdescriptions of the world are shaped byway he wants the world to beand i guess you know i agree witheverything you said except that in thelong run i do think that the truth winsout and these lame attempts to controlitwill ultimately fail although they mightsucceed in the short termand i mean i think at some point it juststarts looking reallyfoolish i feel like the stagflation is agreat example but we haven't yet reachedsort of the pinnacle of the failure ofthis way of thinking and maybe it comeswith uhsomething that many economists mosteconomists probably reject but maybe itcomes with mmtand once we get like full mmt with youknow with a cbdcwith regular payments to all citizensthen a complete collapsethen you get people rethinking the wholeparadigm wait where do we go wrong butit has to get pretty extremeyeah it does have to get kind of extremedoesn't it and that's the part wherewhere i'm prettypessimistic in the academy'sability to correct itself because aslong as it's within certain bounds andit's plausible there is no paradigmshift coming and as youmentioned with respect to the history ofscienceyou know it has to get pretty bad beforebefore people will give up a certainthingand it's only at that point that uhsomething changeswith something like economics it itfeels like it's never going to reallycome to that i really i i hope you'rewrong but i won't say you're wrong but ihope i desperately hope you're wrong andwe can react to things and one of thesayings also is that these things don'thappen until a generation of scientistsdies offthat's another saying right and we mightthere's always this urge among youngpeople coming up in the field like theylearn from their elders but then they'realways going to attack their paradigmsso it's probably if i had to guess iwould saythere are some people who are ingraduate school right now at the bestinstitutions who are paying homagethey're paying their duesbut in their head they're starting toquestion these orthodoxiesand they are going to overthrow them inbrilliantways that we can't even anticipatebecause they're going to be fully versedin you know they're going to be fullyversed in economics at mitat stanford at princeton and thenand then it's going to be like they'regoing to like want all because there's alot of glory for whoever does it there'sa lot of glory for whoever makes thatthat transformative move i wouldn'tdoubt if they're a student at one ofthose institutions right nowpure speculationi'm skeptical of that particularline of reasoning for this reasonespecially in something like economicsyou don't advanceunlessyoulike essentially conform to thatparticular thing a particular paradigmand if you do sort of like flip thatparadigm thenyou've essentially likeargued yourself out of a job and this isthe thing that we've seen in the academyoverthe past 50 years especially in thesocial sciences is that they get waymore conformingto thelike political ideology i thinksomething likeyou know 0.1ofyou knowsocial scienceprofessors are like republican somethinglike that it's it'sthey're all verymuch on one side of the spectrumand it's an ideological sort of likelitmus test thati don't see a way out ofthat coming outout of that becausethere isn't something likeyou know like a telescope astronomicalobservations or something in a lot ofthis stuff that you can point to and saysee you're clearly wrong i mean like youpointed outbitcoin i think shows that a lot ofthese economists are wrong buti don't see them really going andchanging their or even the newer peoplecoming upchanging their stance because they getpaid by the very same people thatperpetuate iti mean it's definitely true and i'lljust add a little more color to itwhen you're coming up you know you haveto get a job and jobs are very verycompetitive in the academy less so ineconomics becauseeconomists have other optionsbut definitely in like sociology andanthropology it's hard to get a joband so you you really don't want to takethe risk of having an unorthodoxopinion that will put some people off ifyou put off one or two people on thehiring committee that's all it takesand then the next hurdle is tenure youhave to publish a bunch of pieces to gettenure and againyou don't want to underminethe goodwill towards you with others onthe committee that tenures you or thepeople who write letters to youso you basically have to get to the10-year point before you're free onceyou get tenure then you could trulyspeak your mind but to get tenure youhave to go through you know what it maybe eight years of graduate school andthen another six seven years ofpre-tenure work so you're you're at thispoint you're 15 years into fakingsomeone you're notin order to speak that's only gettinglonger right because it used to be thatyou could get an academic job right outof posted after a phd now you have thislikeeight-year post-doc wilderness that youhave to go that's right that's rightthere's this postdoc wilderness so it'slike by the time you get tenureat that point you are it's just kind ofan orwellian or souls and easternerspoint butby the point you get tenure you'vealready been socialized into conformityover decadesso you can't expect tenured people to berevolutionaries because theythey're the most conforming people youcan imagine exactly because that's theonly way you can get there really that'sthe only way you can get there soyou're rightand and the other thing you mentionedabout the kind of politicalmonopoly i mean that is tragic to me andi didn't mention this before but that'sbeen kind of behind a lot of my remarksthroughoutabout us in the academy letting lettingpeople down because we don't reflectthat viewpointwithin the academy viewpoint from theright and it's obvious when we speak andwrite it is obvious that for the mostpart we are not on the right side of thepolitical spectrum that's betrayed ineverything every word choice we make thethings that we notice and don't noticeand weirdly enough like this point is anepistemology point called i mean it'scalled standpoint theorythat basically your such situationsocially your identity whether you'reit's your raceor religion or socioeconomic classor your political affiliationsor your nationality these things affectwhat you see and what you miss in lifeand it can't easily be simulated bypeople who don't share those identitiesthat's a standard talking point withinepistemology within sociology and on theleft as an underlying rationale fordiversitybut it's weird that we have not i thinkfully learned that lessonand seen the effects of what happened soif you have a bunch of entirely whiteacademics let's saytalking toa group of possible test subjects all ofwhom are blackand asking them to participate in anexperiment you shouldn't be surprised ifmaybe there's a lack of trust there youknow we had tuskegeeand there's a memory of that it's likeokay but you expect an entire populationhalf of whom has a ideology that youconsider to be wildly immoralto trust what you say when that rep thatideology is completely unrepresented inyour ranks like anyway it's it's a it'sa lesson that has been learned in theacademy and applied elsewhere but notreally and truly to itself and we're nowpaying the price for it in the breakdownof trust in these institutions and iagree the breakdown in trust it's notentirely due to you know it's notentirely misplacedsome of it is legitimate because partsof the academy are politicizedand it's impossible to kind of for alayperson to go in and separate out thedifference instead we've just harmed thewhole institution which is why we haveto heal it and fix it as i see itwell is it healable is it fixablebecause at least from my perspectivewhat i think would actually changethings and make it better isreal competition and i mean that'scompatible right i agree with you i'dlove to see that toobut i i'm in it so i kind of wannanot only am i in it but like you know ii've got a foot in these two worlds iteach at read colleges it's called bysome the most progressive college inamericaand i'm in bitcoin many of whom areat the right end of the politicalspectrumand zealous about itandyou know what's weird is you you talk topeoplein these two communitiesandthey're all the same they're all peoplethey're good well-intentioned sincerepeople who are also flawedwho alsohave beliefs that you think are wrongbut it's likeyeah i i want to reiterate my colleaguesarei think of them astruth-seeking people with integrity whoare trying to do the best they can andthat that goes for almost all of mycolleagues doing almost all of what theydoeven the economists they've beenwonderful to meand so i'm i'm not ready to give up inthe sense that i feel like there's somekind of tragedy of communication herebecause i feel like if people could walkthe halls that i walk and talk to thevery same people i talk to every day andwork with you know you'd see they're notmonsters bent on disinforming the publicand it feels the same way when i'm inbitcoin like what what i hear thestereotypes i hear about bitcoiners it'slike come on have you met any of thesepeople they're awesomethat's why i don't want to give upalthough competition of course iswelcome it's like i'm i'm inside thebelly of the beast andpeople are really great here you knowthese are my friends they're reallydecent peopleyeah i mean i get that there most peoplethat you meet i think are going to benice but there's somethingthat's like characteristic of the entiresystem that maybe is differentthanany individual within it and i don'tknow if it'sthis is uh necessarilysomething that i can articulate verywell butyou know there's sort of likea group attitude that may be worse thanany single person's attitude you knowwhat i mean so so true it'sit's it's definitely true yeah that imeanabsolutely not just within the academybut elsewhere i see exactly that dynamici agreeand in that case you know likethe academy is very hostile topeople that disagree with it andespecially its political points um andthat that seemsto me the thing that sort of harms it inmany ways and whyyou knowi don't know ithink there's like sort of like anascentyou know competitivesort of alternative that's starting tocome upuh because the academy has had amonopoly for so long that that'sstarting to compete with ityeah and i think about like the peoplethat go on joe rogan for example right alot of them are fromthe academy but some of the you knowthey there are veryyou know different points of view andcan sort of hearthe reasoning right they sort of showyouat least through those like four-hourconversations or whatever they they showthe work a lot of times and whereaswith you know a press release from theipcc or something like that it's justsort of like okaywe have no idea of how you did the workor anything like that it looks likeand feels like a political document whatdo you thinki think it'sfirst of all the competition isextremely welcome and i'm really gladthat there are outlets for academics tospeak to the general public and sharetheir work that run around a kind ofcensorship system i mean i'manti-censorship that includesanti-censorship within the academy idon't think thatyou know minority views in scienceshould be squelched and i'm glad theyget an audiencei think it is difficult for lay peopleto evaluate some of these argumentsbecause they do take a lot of trainingand that's notsomething i like it just feels like wellman you know some of this stuff isreally hard and it's first the ipcc iagree completely about like a pressrelease but they also do show their workin these thousandmulti thousand page reports that isdefinitely proof of work they have it'snot just i mean i hate these likeletters i hate group letters in generalyou know i made it a policy not to signany group letter of any kindhate group letters because they'rebasically appeals to authorityand uhi don't like that but uh i do feel likethese these groups do actuallyyou know when they do issue a reportlike there it is every single footnoteevery single sourceall of the data that doesn't mean it'sunproblematic butand if you read the reports actuallythey're muchbetter as science than the releases andthen the letters that people sign andthen the journalism that's written aboutthem right generally when scientists arespeakingin their not just only in their ownvoice butin the context of a scientific articlethey're showing their findings and partof that is also owning up to what theirfindings don't show and some of that islike a confidence interval on whatthey've foundyou knowwhere how certain are we of this wherecould we be wrong i meanthat's the stuff i like actuallyin science but i agree with youbasically if there is censorship uhwithin the academy and there are brightpeople who have different ideas andthere always have been in the history ofscience and there always will be whetherthat's like washing hands between babiesthat you deliver or whether it's ideasabout electricityor or whether it's a you know somebodyin a in ayou know working in a patent officewho has an idea about space and timethemselves andthe history of science is full ofoutsiders with new ideas that challengeorthodoxy and they either find their waythrough the institution of science orindependent of it and are eventuallyvindicatedand i'm glad thoseoutlets exist and they must exist andand if we become more and more likeuniform politically and within theacademy we are onlyenhancinguh the build-out of those otherinstitutions i mean the same goes foreducation as a whole and i have to sayeven though i'm in this businessi think our college charges somethinglike 75 grand a year for tuitioni mean this whole kind of industryit's been propped up by funny money it'screated a massive student debt crisisand it has veered very far fromtheway of thinking of mostpeople in the country or a lot a goodnumber of people in the country and insome ways it's very vulnerable it's veryexpensive it is laden with layers ofadministration and it can be disruptedit could be disrupted onyou know on this kind of sailor academyfront of kind of scaling up educationwith technology much of which is freeand it could be disrupted on theresearch side by an alternativeinstitutionand soi mean that's great that's justcompetitionand i think that will yeah the academywill either adjustit will do a better job of communicatingitself and providing value and do abetter job of incorporating heterodoxviewsminority views giving voice to themgiving critique to them andcommunicating about them or it will losein this competition it's just i meanit's just like competition on themonetary front rightwe will see if education is a coinit willthe market will decide ultimatelywell that'sa really interesting thing to thinkabout because it is sort of like basedon education right like the academy butobviously 70 000 a year uh people arestarting to opt out you know all thisfunny money that's uh that's funding itit does you know it is being questionedandseems likei don't know like the beginning of theend maybe of the academy and i thinkcertainly for a lot of people theywelcome thatwhat do you wish we could keep if itwere to sort of collapseyeah it's kind of collapsing in themiddle of thein the middle of the kind of spectrum ofpriceyou know harvard's not going to collapseprinceton's not going to collapseswarthmore's not going to collapse andalso your kind of local communitycollege and state schoolwon't collapse because they're servingeconomic needs locally in the communityand they're run on a shoestringwhat's going to collapse is kind ofstuff in the middle it's not going toserve the one percent in the society andit's alsonot serving people who are strappedand local businessesthose will collapseand i think that'ssad from the perspective of i knowpeople a lot of people at thoseinstitutionsbut economically it's kind ofokay that's just going to happenin terms of what can survive i don'tknow i think about my uh my father's uhold institution which was universitywisconsinactually when that university was set upits mandate was to help the legislaturesettlequestions of factwhich would enable them to make wiserpolicythe the institution was supposed to belike a truth machineit would produce truths that you couldthen make good law on the basis ofand i think the history of our societyin the u.sbears witness to the success of thatmission state universities in particularfunded a lot of basic research some ofit was funded through the governmentthrough dodbut that basic research set up theunited states to be a powerhouseeconomically world worldwideand we have a more informed citizenry aswelland i think that's been a positive forour country on the whole you know i looki'm an educator i believe in educationi think it's great to spend some time inyour youth especiallyexploring life's great questions liketapping into the best of human knowledgefrom the pastand creating thingsyourself whether that's art music orintellectual product doing scienceyourself like i believe in this i thinkthis makes us a bettercitizenry and a better country andwealthier i hope that that core value isnot losteven as the economic institution ofwhich is you know i think bloated andsomewhat the result of misallocation ofresourceseven as that shrinks i hope we hold onto the core valuesof an educated citizenry an informedpublic policy and cutting-edgescientific research that undergirds a anindustrialleadership in the world you know i meanultimately i believe in science ibelieve in the power of knowledge and ithink we've benefited from it and i hopewe don't give that upjust because the thing has becomepoliticallycaptured and economically bloatedi don't know from my perspective i'dlike to see a lot of especially thesocial science stuff which i don't thinkadds any value whatsoever go awayand maybeput into different institutions becauseto me that's not really learning it'sindoctrination a lot of the i mean ihope you're wrong and it can be donebetter i think this conversation exactlyyou know is already sociologyand yeahno doubt that there it exists such adiscipline and that it could be donebetteri just don't think it can be done inthat context without it becoming superpolitical which you knowdoesn't it becomes way more aboutmotivated reasoning and the truth getssacrificed in that casei would like to see a lot moreengineering but even even in like so i'ma math guy right soeven in something like physics i seeso many people spending time on stufflike string theory whichcannot be proven like literally cannotbe proven andthere are no experiments that anyone'sthought of that can figure out whetheror not it's truebut there arehundreds if not thousands of phddissertations you know entiredepartments full of people that arethinking about that stuff rather thanactually trying to figure out whatreality is that to me is justsort of like mental masturbation um andthat'sthat's what a lot of this stuff tends togo towards in large part because of thissort of rent seekiness of a lot of thesepositions where you know if you can't beproven wrong then you don't haveanything to worry aboutand if you can just like flood peoplethat disagree with youto the end and never really be provenwrong great your your positionposition's secure foreverthat seems to be howthe academy has progressed and i i don'ti don't see how it can reallyreverse that because of all of thefunny money as you say that sort ofprops all of that up they want thosepositions not so that they can seektruth but because it's a goodrent-seeking positionwell i mean as a metaphysician i'm in noposition to throw stones herebut um but i mean i did i do rememberpicking up a book in a bookstore in newyork once by a columbia professor callednot even wrong and it was about stringtheory and its inability to be falsifiedi mean i think there's something so i'vei will say this i mean my thinking isrooted in inin the history of of thinking it'srooted in the history of philosophyand it's very hard to kind of impose atest of testability or meaningfulness orlike that is what i was saying beforeabout that bright line between the hardsciences and the soft sciences it's veryhard to impose that and we've kind oflearned that historically because we'vehad movements in philosophy that triedto do it namely the logical positivistsand a lot of what i hear withinphysics especially physics that rejectsstring theory reminds me of logicalpositivism so for instance somebody toldme somebody in the physics departmentwho used to be in the physics departmentheretold me you know wellif something isn't falsifiabletheni'm not interested in it because itcan't be false and it can't be true andit's not meaningful and i just said tothem the thing that ilearned from the history of logicalpositivism which is like what about thatthing you just saidwhat you just said is that if somethingcan't be testedthen it's not true or meaningfulwell then what did you just say was thattruewas it meaningfulby your own lights it's neither so whythe hell did you say it like what wereyou sayingwe can't avoiditeven the dismissal of everything that'snot testableis not testablelife is bigger and thought is biggerthan just the realm of the testable andi would like to leave a little bit ofspace for it and i think we see that inplato and aristotle and jesus and youknow like in the entire history ofof thinkers but i agree that it isuniquely when something's not testableit is uniquelyuh vulnerableto motivated reasoning politicalinfluence and rent seeking i like thatuse that termbecause totally right in the sense thatyou can kind of build a fiefdomthat is untetheredfrom reality in a waythat's a kind of vulnerability and apossibility that's left open by somethings being untestableand i mean the person i like on this isanother econ hater of bitcoin and that'snothing to lab i mean he's great on thishe's great on this the this is the iyicategory and this is people who don'thave skin in the gameand you know i see that everywhere imean i am an intellectualyet idiot and i am somebody whodoesn't have skin in a lot of the gamesthat iwrite and think about but i i foundtele just absolutely hilarious on thisstuff i meanhe's dead he's he's he might be wrongabout bitcoin but i think on iyes ithink he's very accurate and thatyou know they like what are these peopledoing and are they really doing anythingi don't think he's as far as i know fromhis books he's ever really said thatthe cause of this is reallysort of like this weird monetaryrent-seeking phenomenon whichhappens almost everywhere from what ican seeand it does sort of like add a lot moremotivated reasoning to which whichresults in this behavior but that i meani think about it a lot as a philosopherii feel like i'm entrustedwithnot wasting people's moneyyou know whether that's my student'smoney and it's tuition or whether it'sstate money if i'm working for a stateinstitutionyou know there's a great great deal oftrust because i couldjustengage in what you called mentalmasturbation i could take up problemsthat don't matterand just crank out papers on them andpossibly get them published and you knowmake a life out ofwhat isn't actually valuableand soit's a structural vulnerability but itake it as a matter of personalresponsibility that i should not do thatand then i should only take up questionsthat actually domatter to human beings and to humandiscourse and of course there's nevergoing to be uniformity about that and ofcourse a lot of things that seem to bewasteful turn out not to be and you mustknow this as a mathematician a lot ofmathematical discoveries are made purelyforthe enjoyment and beauty of theirdiscovery and yet they eventually provedto be usefuland you know human beings right the worduseful is uh doing a lot of work in thatsentencewell that's right i mean that's right imean who gets to even say what useful islike i i think to some extentmathematicsis its own end and discovering newmathematical truth is like discoveringmore of space you know that is usefuljust like that that's part of what it isto live a full and rich human life and ifeel the same way about poetry i feelthe same way about philosophy and musicyou know they're like studying thesethings is in and of itself valuable notonly for what comes out of itright soi feel like if we abandon that entirelyin the free market another institutionwill arise that fulfills the human needto study and produce in-depth thesequote-unquote useless things that arenevertheless part of a of a fulfillingexistencedoes string theory reallydo that for quantum computing oryou know cold fusion or all of the allof this stuff thathonestly we've wasted way too much moneyon way too many resources on that reallyhaven't produced anything for manydecades andfor for some of this stuffand seemed to besort ofyou know very ripe forrent seekingwell it's kind of like it's kind of likestartups and you know vc it's likeyou're gonna have a lot ofexcess and you're gonna have that onewinner that pays off hugeand you know cold fusion is not paid offuh take just fusion generallythat hasn't paid off either but if itdoes pay off is it its energy on a vastscale that you know pumps us up thekardashevmeasure you know so it's likeoh man you know and everybody i'vetalked to about it says we're 10 yearsawayfrom with enough investment and ofcourse they've been saying that for thelast 40 years butit's like it's hard to turn down aninvestment because the potential payoffis sobig and i don't know about string theoryhonestly i i can't well but this is sortof like the flaw of academia which hasessentially become financialized in myopinion which is thatyou know money solves everything rightyou just pour more money into it andwe'll have more knowledge in this areai think string theory is proof thatessentially what happens is you pour alot of money into it and it goes touseless waste right like likethis is true of education as well wherethey're like okay if we just put moremoney per student their thing willimproveit's thissort of likemeta assumption about the role of moneyin everything which is thatif you just add more money it'll improvex and that's just not true it's way moreaboutthe systems and the people involved andhow they operate and the incentives thatyou give them if you just pour money itit almost never works like from aneconomic perspective yeah i mean icertainly agree with you abouta lot of those cases i mean some thingshowever require a lotof funding and we learned this inphysicsbasically followingphysics radically changed as adiscipline because of world war ii youknow the search for the bombwe went from small physics to bigphysics you know in the 1930s you couldgather all the leading physicists at oneconference in the world physicistsdidn't have a lot of moneythey they madeincredible breakthroughs like relativityand quantum mechanics without any moneyto speak ofbut the bomb changed everything wecreated an institution that largely didbecome about applying for and managinggrants like leading physicists like youcan manage a ton of money they'rerunning like fiefdoms corporationsreallyand and that did lead to various kindsof breakthroughs and now you havemassive particle accelerators there's noway to do that from the armchair andcheaply sosome of what big science does nowdoes take a hugeinvestmentwell so the question then is how much ofit isis the result of all of this funding andlikeat least for me looking at the historyof physics like the stuff pre-world warii is way more significant and paradigmchanging than the stuff after world warii so adding that money actually if youlook at it from a purelycorrelational standpointdoesn't seem to have actually made muchand like people are trying for newparadigms all the time string theorybeing one of them but it actuallydoesn't explain reality better and it'salmost alwayslike sort of off on these weird tangentsthatand you know particularly expensivestufflike particle accelerators instead ofother things that might be way moreuseful like how much of that are wemissing nowbecause we went this route ofyou know big physics as you sayyeah that's a great question and i wishi knew more i don't know any more thanyou do on that front like what is malinvestment in researchand how do we improve theyou know return on investment in sciencegenerallyand i don't disagree that there's atremendous amount of mal investment butit's also not clear how you doinvestment in a way that gives you abetter return it's just someone who isyou know written grants and is oncommittees that award grants and workswith colleagues who are writing grantsall the time like the process of writinggrants is exactly the process of tryingto achieve a more efficient investmentand it just sucks for everybody i meanwriting these grantsoccupiesa tremendous amounts of time and energythat actually keep you from yourresearch but we make the grant writingprocess more and more like there aremore and more hoops to jump through toget the money thrown at you andthat's precisely to avoid malinvestmentbut what ends up happening is that yourjob then becomes about jumping throughthese hoops rather than learning stuffso so it's it's yes it's malinvestment idon't know exactly how it gets fixed buti know that a lot of the attempts to fixit actually make it worsekind of like you know kind of like ifyou want to spend money for a governmentagency and you work for let's say thedepartment of defense or whatever theythey've bought too many whatever 5 500toilet seats so now you have to jumpthrough 12 hoops to buy a toilet seatthe hoops that you jump through mightmight waste more money than actuallyjust paying a lot for an occasionaltoilet seat when somebody finds aloophole right anyway it's kind of likethat in the academy it's really hardgenerally to seewhere science will grow and what countsas apromising investmentkind of likeregular vc decisions but even harderbecause we're like in advance of knowingstuffand i feel like you know i i've i'veactually talked to some people who headthese organizations the national sciencefoundation and kind of about thisproblemand uh some amount of waste isinevitable for the return limiting thethe waste isincredibly difficultand yeah maybe maybe this is thebitcoiner perspective maybe the problemgets a lot easier when you can't justprint money andthe money is scarcer to be to begin withand i take your point about physicsbeingin a way not as groundbreakingpost-world war ii but what we don't knowis what physics would look likein the history of you know saysemiconductorswithout public that massive publicinvestment without big physics whatwould we know and how would it have gonehow much more impoverished we've been wecan't really see that counterfactualright so yeah a lot of people really canbut what we do have is pre-world war iilike you saidyeah wasn't much money going inwe got relativity we got quantum we gotlots of like groundbreaking thingslike actual experimentation that thatproved a lot of that stuffit seems to me likethe academy is like that giantgovernment programwhere uh like post-world war ii like howuh science has been donewhereas like pre-world war iimaybe it was a lot more likeyou know individuals sort of doing itandi'm sure you can tell me better but itseems to me that the history of sciencea lot of the people that make thesebreakthroughsare not even scientists or evenengineers they're justpeople that are really into the topictheysort of fund their own stuff andand you know come up with an experimentand you know public like sort of likelet people know about it and that that'showscience used to progressseems like this government giantgovernment program versus entrepreneursthat seems to be the big model changethat that's happenedyeah yeah i think uh going back inhistorythe institution of science didn't reallyexist it hasn't existed for i mean theword science didn't exist until whateverwas 1850 or somethingthere was the church and there werepeople who were working for the churchand that was the kind of closest we hadto the institution then we haduniversitiesbut nothing approachingthe institution we have in science todaywhat i love reading about these old youknow parties in victorian england wherepeople did science experiments like forfun in their basements like they wouldyou know have all their friends out totheir mansion andput together us an experiment to testlike the nature of light orwhatever you know so science scienceused to be a a leisure activityaristotle would call it leisuresomething you work in order to do thatscience was in that category and i wouldsay even more than entrepreneur it waslike a leisure activity and then it gotpushed over into the work categoryscience it used to be a way of sort ofthe highest way of of exercising yourhumancuriositythat is very difficult to do now giventhe scope of human knowledge i mean likewhy haven't we had breakthroughs likerelativity and quantum theorypost war it's it's because that waslow-hanging fruit man that waslow-hanging fruit like you can you knowwhat i meanthere aren't just likewhen you learn physics nowyou know at reinference i can speak tothis you have to start taking physics onday one uh when you come here and youhave to take physics throughout yourentire educationyour fourth year you get to relativityand quantum theoryin your senior yearthat's where yournow your experimentation like startswhereas pre-war that wasn't in thecurriculum because it hadn't been evendiscovered yet right so there's justlikewe have less and less low-hanging fruitand more and more what we learn requiresthe uptake of knowledge of everythinghumans have got to this point and then alot of thatrequires like fancy experimentation likeeven these pre-war experiments likemeasuring the speed of light is nottrivialyour setup has to be perfect to measurethe speed of lightthat's really tricky and like we have anuclear reactor here at reed we have usthe only student-run nuclear reactor inthe country again that's not reallysomething you can have in your victorianbasement you know maybe it will be withsmrs but you know getting a nuclearreactor set up is uhvery very tricky you know soscience has advanced far enough thatamateur discoveries are very difficultyou know and it's one of the thingsthat's so cool aboutbitcoin and one of the things thatamazed me coming into itwas it was a place where amateurscould just seriously roll out of bed andmake contributions you could you couldmake a commit withouthaving a phd in computer science rightyou could make a contribution and it'sincredible or to the general discussionand i believe that's true across ofcourse a lot of areas but in a lot ofareas it really isnotlike well i i don't know i'm going tohave to disagree with you on that onebecause i i think you underestimate thesort offirst of all the desire of a lot ofpeople to just learn for learning sickand second be thesort of creativity of people to discovernew things on the cheap maybe it's veryexpensive because that's the money'smoney was always sort of availablewhereasif you were forced to figure out someway to test some nuclear reactionpeople would have come up with somethingmore interesting and fast uh you knowthrough the work of genius instead ofthat same person you know doing a20-year journey to get to tenure at auniversity maybe maybe they you knowfigure something out in their basement idon't knowi mean i hope you're right and i wouldlove toto see it and i'm actually sure there isa lot of you know i'm sure there is alot of low hanging fruit around that wehave missed i do believe as you say inhuman curiosity ingenuity it's just it'sjust that a lot of the you know grantproposals that i see for instance idon't see a cheaper way to study themthan doing what people are proposingmaybe that's my own lack of imaginationbut ii don't see it if you don't have a grandthing then people just do it on theirown right like and and do it smaller ormaybe there arerich people you know like the oldmedicis or whatever and yeah and soit's sponsoring artyou see academics around the world thatare incredibly resourceful where whichare at under-resourced institutionsyou know scihub means we can sharescientific papers for free basicallyeverywhere yeah you do see smart peoplearound the world with institutions withfewer resources kind of doing the bestthey can with what they have and it'spretty cool you're right that does existalready in a way just from underfundedplaceswellthis has been an interesting discussionabout epistemology and science and allthat stuff where can people find youwhere can people contact you yeah thishas been an interesting discussion wehaven't even really talked about youknow what i've done in bitcoin and stuffit's fine people can figure that out onby following me on twitter i'm at thetropro t-h-e-t-r-o-c-r-oi'm also a fellow at the bitcoin policyinstitutebpi where i'm writing mostly aboutmining and energyandlet's see um yeah i'm at read collegei'm in my office right now but i'mactually on a leave right now unpaidleave just to work entirely on bitcoinand explore this spaceso i have a foot kind of thoroughly inthe bitcoin worldand if you want to contact me to talk tome about particularly issues on energybut really anything in bitcoin and i'dlove thatfeel free to reach out through twitterdmsall rightunchained capital is a sponsor of thispodcast i'm an advisor to the company iknow the team well and i'm excited forwhat they are building if you needcollaborative custody or a bitcoinnative financial services partnerlearn more at unchained.comwell that wraps it up for this episodeof bitcoin fixes this troy cross can befound atthe trokrow on
