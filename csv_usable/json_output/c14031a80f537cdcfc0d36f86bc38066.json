  "text": "foreign[Music]welcome back to the Bitcoin layer I'mNick Bhatia and today we bring backMichael Saylor Michael thank you so muchfor joining us againyeah awesome to be here Nickso Michael we brought you back to talkabout the stock market versus Bitcoinlast time you gave us an amazing set ofmetaphors to compare Bitcoin andCommercial Real Estate the advantagesthat Bitcoin has over this other type ofstore of value commercial real estatetoday we want to talk about the stockmarket so many people equate Bitcoinwith the stock market because they bothare trading as risk assets in themarkets today but we know that that'sonly one aspect of this relationship sotoday I wanted to start by asking youabout the potential comparison ofBitcoin to stocks what are the benefitsof owning stocks before we get intoBitcoin why do people own equitywell umI think there's two questions there likehow does Bitcoin compare to stocks andthen uh why do people own Equity uh whydon't I start with the first question uhwhat's the difference between uh Bitcoinand owning a stockum I I think that um first of allBitcoin is a commodity that is uh scarcewhere the primary use case is money orthat is a long-term store of valueso the reason you want to hold Bitcoinis is you want to own a product on anopen network for a long period of timeand its use case is to be money and sothe you know the value and use is storeof valuenow um when you're holding a stockyou're holding a share of equity in acompany in essence you're you're owninga corporation is propertyum if your goal is to own that as astore of value over a long period oftime then of course that is competitiveuh to bitcoin financially speaking somepeople own companies for other purposesum and we could talk about those but butI think it's instructive for an investorthat's thinking about whether they wantto allocate to bitcoin or whether theywant to allocateto equityto consider the differenceso I think the place you got to start isif you are a company you're an economiccreatureand everything in the economy everythingin the world wants to kill you and youneed you need to have that understandingwhereas Bitcoin is like a like amonetary virus or an energy virusa corporation is a creature and so ifyou want to understand the risks thatcorporations faceit's instructive just to start byreading the 10K it's a publicly tradedcompaniesso I would say a very practicaleducation would be to purchase to get to10ks of 10 or 100 different companiesand just start to read all the riskfactorsbecause these are actually pretty wellwritten uh corporations spend a hugeamount of money on lawyers and thelawyers are Highly Educated extremelythoughtful extremely articulateum and very risk adverse and they willwrite pages and pages and pages of riskfactorsthis is the answer to the Investor'squestion if I invest a dollar in thiscompany what could go wrongand they give you they give you ananswer and I have umI have they really give you a parade ofhorriblesI've spent many many years of my lifesince 1998 I've been a public companyofficer so I've been studying a publiccompany prospectuses and and generalbusiness risk probably since two yearsbefore we came publicso that goes back away[Music]umand uh if I were to catalog them into avariety of classifications I would starthere I would say the first risk of anyinvestor in inequity is governance riskyour uh you're risking your money basedupon proper corporate governanceexercise by the board of directors andby the management team so the officersand the directorsif um if the board is uh is bad or goesbad or if the directors go bad they canembezzle funds from the company they canthey can drive the company off a cliffthey can create a civil war within thecompanyum if they can't work out their issueswith each otheror if they can't navigate all of the allof the challenges that uh approach thecompany in the future then the entirething breaks down so uh so governancerisk is a challenge and and governancerisk illustrates the the generalunderlying challenge of corporations ingeneral which is the people are the weaklink corporations rely upon human beingsand Human Action is ultimately thesource of most of the liabilities incompanies and what you find is the MoreHuman Action uh that is required to runthe operation the more risk there is andmany of the greatest corporations andthe most successful equities are theones that manage to execute on abusiness strategy with the least amountof human behavior if if the business isso simple that it doesn't need peopleand and there are no decisions to bemade and it runs on autopilot those aregenerally good businesses and the morepeople involved and the more decisionsneed to be made the more risky it isso you know the first risk factor is isgovernance risk the second risk factoris operational risk every business hasto do something whether it's serve foodor manufacture catch up or ship productsfrom point A to point B or fly airplanesor run a factorythe fact that it does something isoperational and if you don't if youdon't operate the restaurant or thesteel Refinery or the aircraft properlythen the shareholders suffer and ittakes normally great degrees of talentsometimes courage uh sometimescommitmentin order to and or to operate uh thatbusinessum and uh and in the event of umof uh strange volatilities in theenvironment the operation gets harderbut operation is never easy if you'veever been if you've ever been in a steelRefinery or an oil an oil uh drill riguh you would know or if you ever triedto fly an airplane yourself even underthe best of circumstance it's not easyto operateso that's the second risk the third riskis strategic risk uh in my experiencemost uh most of the software companiesthat we competed against they failedbecause the board and the CEO made a badacquisition so the company will decidestrategically need to enter a newbusiness we're threatened by somethingand they will change the operation andmaybe the strategy is I'm going toacquire another company so I pay 10billion dollars for a company that'sreally only worth one billion dollars uhand I blow up nine billion dollars ofshareholder capital in one deal that's ajust a strategic faux pas the operationcan be fine but in in one decision theboard and the CEO destroy billions andtens of billions of dollars toshareholder capital and oftentimes whenyou make those dilutive Acquisitionswhere you buy something which just blowsup in your face then it's hard torecover from thatum99 of mid-size software companies failgo out of business because of dilutiveAcquisitions in my career every singleone of my competitors went out ofbusiness because it did a string ofdilutive Acquisitions which wereill-advised where they bought that theywere a weak company and they boughtother weak and dying companies in aneffort to Stave off their own corporatedemise and they just accelerated theirown corporate demise why they underminedtheir producteven strong companies make thesemistakes like Microsoft bought portionsof Nokia and took multi-billion dollarwrite-offs sap took a 10 billion dollarwrite-offumit's uh it's always happening uh in oneshape or former anotherumthat's the third risk the fourth risk isFinancial Risk a company has a lot ofmoney moving around they have to put itin Banksumin in my career at microstrategy we hadmoney in a Brazilian bank the bank wasembezzled by the CEO we lost the moneywe had money in uh in an Argentine Bankuh the Argentine government Froze allthe assets devalued them we lost themoneyum if you actually trust your money to acounterparty and they steal it from youyou're in trouble so so uh there'scredit risk there's counterparty riskthere's banking risk you always have iteverywhere and if you trust the wrongFinancial counterparty they'll bankruptyou and uh we just saw in the cryptoindustry we saw lots of companies go outof business in some cases because theytrusted another counterparty or they hadtheir assets in another bankum the fifth risk is competitive riskmaybe I'm the best in the world atsomething like I produce Nokia was thegreatest mobile phone company and theygot wiped outuh somebody else produces a productquick that's better than mine that'scheaper than mineuh they might be an in-kind competitorI'm a restaurant someone else has abetter restaurant they wipe me out uhI've manufacture steel someonemanufacture steel cheaper they wipe meout I'm an airline someone else hascheaper flights they wipe me outum you cannot avoid uh competitive riskover the long termbut there's another kind of risk whichis like not in kind competition but I'llcall it technology risk I'm the world'sleading manufacturer of um of horsehorse buggies and then Henry Ford comesalong with Carr and nobody wants horsebuggies anymore or I'm a horse breederor I'm a buggy wet manufacturer or I Iproduce electric light bulbs that areincandescent and then people wantfluorescent and then they and then Ihave fluorescent light bulbs and theywant LED light bulbs and so over timenew types of technology I I'm theworld's leader in typewriters and thepeople on mainframes or or computers orword processors and I'm Wang and I'm theleader in word processors and I gotwiped out by the PCso there are always technology cyclesand and here is a it's a it's a cruelrisk becauseum the world is full of examples ofcompanies that got wiped out by a bettertechnologyXerox you know Kodakbut the world is also full of companiesthat got wiped out because they saw thenew technology coming and so they madean acquisition or they invested obsceneamounts of money to compete and theystillfailed even though they thought theywere going to compete and so thistechnology risk drives that strategicrisk element up people justify badstrategies based upon technology threatsso ultimately and of course the reasonthat they make the 10 billion dollarstrategic mistake is they thought theywere fending off the likeTime Warner decided to merge with AOLand one of the most catastrophically youknow failed mergers in history becauseTime Warner said yeah you know we needto get into like video streaming and theinternet and the internet represents arisk to the media business so thesolution was to buy AOL for 150 billiondollars now AOL said oh we're at riskfrom you know Google and and the likeand so we have to sell ourselves so youhave one uh one frightened strugglingcompany merging with another frightenedstruggling company and the result whenit does settled was something like 150billion to 200 billion dollars ofshareholder Capital got wiped outbut they and and was that a governancefailure or was that a strategic failureor was that a technology failure allthose risk factors drove people to likeit light a hundred billion dollars onfirethey all thought they're doing the rightthing but of course this is Human Actionthe fact the risk factor is there'ssomeone that has the ability to issue ahundred and fifty billion dollars worthof stockin order to solve a problem as We Knowby looking at the world oftentimes whenyou have someone with enough power uh tomake 150 billion dollar decision it'scoin flip they might make the right onebut they might make 150 billion dollarmistakeand you know the difference between thatand Bitcoin is in Bitcoin nobody has thepower to issue 150 billion dollars ofnew Bitcoin if they did then you have ahundred reasons why we ought to do itevery month that some yeah someone comesup with it people are very creative atcoming up with reasons to do things andthey have an interest in it so so uhpeople basically become uh you know youcould call them hypochondriacs theyimagine that the world will end if theydon't save the whale save the seal stopthe carbon stop nuclear power if wedon't get to the moon if we don't get toMars if we don't not get there if wedon't start the war if we don't stop thewar if we don'tchange everybody stop nylon if we don'tstop oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexicoeverybody imagines things if we standtoo close together if we don't close theschools if we let people get onairplanes without getting scanned inmetal detectors if we don't if we don'tif we don't there's always a risk andevery risk justifies a hundred billiondollar or a trillion dollar decision andgenerally they're all mistakesbut if you can make the decision thenyou probably make the mistakeso technology risk is uh you know isfacing your firm over a hundred yearsyou're going to find whatever you'reproducinggets attacked right if you know whatlasted 100 years John D rockefeller'soil companies they produced a barrel ofoil what was the threat well it'sthreatened by electricity electric carsdid it work well first it tried then youknow we had electric cars in 1920 butthey failed but then 100 years laterthey didn't fail uh nuclear power was athreat natural gases threat liquidliquefied natural gas is a threat youknow oil from another country is athreat everything's a threat you knowmaybe we shut down nuclear power plantsit's not a threat you know maybe coal isa threat maybe maybe we won't need asmuch energy anymore solar is a threatmaybe wind is a threat maybe Hydro is athreat everything is a threat or itisn't a threat right and you have tolive through 100 Years of that and thatmeans you got to have a board ofdirectors deciding whether to spend allthe shareholders money to fight threatand of course A lot of times the answeris I have to have the resolve to notreact to the threat because 9 out of 10or 99 out of 100 of the threats don'tform but then occasionally the threatdoes formso then you got seven political riskand uh political risk can come from themayor of your town the mayor decidesthat um that they don't want to haveyour kind of business within City Limitsand so they Zone it out actually it canstart at the neighborhood zoning boardthey can Zone you out then the neighborand then the mayor can Zone you out thenthe governor can change the regulationslike right now New York State you knowis suing paxos over their stable coinokay that's a New York action it's noteven a federal action so the state cantake action against you or an or yourown country where your domicile can takeaction against you uh or a foreigncountry another nation state can takeaction against you Banning you fromtheir business or their citizens so younever know where those political riskwill come from but political risks workbecause a corporation has Nexus and ithas uh has legal standing which means uhwhich means there's a CEOthat's going to actually have to flyaround the world so you know you thinkthat you're immune but say you operateonan online poker siteand then uh you are domiciled in Monacoor you live in uh UAE well so the CEO ofthe online poker site you know is flyingfrom Monaco to the Bahamas on vacationand the airplane stops in DC to changeplanes and that he gets arrested in DCbecause he's crossing the U.Sjurisdiction and he gets arrestedbecause he's a person moving through youknow United States airspace and while itmight be legal to operate poker sites incyberspace or outside the U.S it's notlegal in the U.S and sothere you have political risk right andand it happensum companies have uhum have a locational Nexus and so thattakes us the risk factor eight uhfacilities risk if you have a placeright uh if you have a factory if youhave a restaurant if you have um if youhave a ship and it's in a place in theworld then you have a risk to it uh andthe risk is you you have to cross intosome geopolitical jurisdiction where itmay be either illegal to do that or itmay be regulated like you can do thatbut you have to collect a huge amount ofinformation on your customers and sinceyou don't have that information thenthen that's illegal or uh you have aboat and it has 10 bottles of wine on itbut you didn't pay customs duties on thebottom bottle of wine and you movethrough our you know 12 miles offshoreand now that's illegal you just becamean illegal cargo Smuggler because youdidn't get these stamps on that crateand so the facilities risk is you knowin our industry we saw it with theCrackdown of Bitcoin miners in China youhave a minor in China the Chinesegovernment decides they don't want youto mine Bitcoin in China okay there'syour facilities risk hard to move thefacilities so corporations oftentimeshave facilities of one sort of the otherumthe umif you if you if you bottle ketchup orif you bottle uh carbonated beverage andif you want have one Factory then yourfacilities risk is very calm it's veryconcentrated so when the state or thecity or the nation shuts you down you'velost everythingthe way that Bitcoin for examplemitigates this is that Bitcoin isdecentralized so in fact Bitcoin hasthousands of facilitiesin 100 jurisdictions and you could shutdown all of them in any jurisdiction andit would have zero effect on the valueand the efficacy of the asset itself infact you could shut down 99 of thefacilities in 99 of the jurisdictionsand Bitcoin is just as valuable as itwas Bitcoin with three extra hash ofhash rate is still the most securecrypto asset in the world and soBitcoin is an example where you candiminish the facility by 99 but itdoesn't diminish the value propositionbut now imagine shutting down 99 of theFour Seasons uh hotels or 99 of theCoca-Cola refineries or 99 of theanything steel refineries well you knowyou've got one percent of your steelleft and one percent of yourmanufacturing left means the equity hasno valueso soum the facilities risk isis tangible for a corporation thatproduces thingsbut it really isn't tangible forsomething like Bitcoin because it's soanti-fragile and decentralizednot effective now we take uh number nineon my Hit Parade is regulatory risk uhand here this refers to the fact thatthe Regulators can create rules for whatyou do and they can change the ruleslike for example is it legal for me tosell a box of cerealokay is it legal for me to operate aclinic that gives blood transfusions orgives you physicalswell the truth is uh it's all subject toregulation it would be illegal for youto have a nurse license in West Virginiaworking in a clinic in Virginiaunless I changed you know line item onpage 147. now the problem is there aremillions of pages of regulations sothere are millions of pages ofregulations they're changing via everyCounty city state country and crossdomicile and for every use case all thetime and it's hard to comply with themit's even harder to know you'recomplying with them and even if youthought you were complying with themit's always possible for one of yourdisgruntled employees or competitors toarrange for it to look like you're notcomplying with them and uh and and youknow so this becomes a challengechallenge like for exampleI operate a bar you operate a bar Idon't like you and so I just arrangedfor a bunch of underage people to comeinto your bar and order a drink and thenI call you know the Bureau of AlcoholTobacco enforcement and I have them hangout at your bar and they notice thatyou're breaking a ruleokay it's like just like you know drugcartels notoriously when they call andthey you know and they give hints to youknow to law enforcement they're rattingout their competitorso actually what you end up in aregulatory environment is is onecompetitor wraps out another competitorand that's part of regulatory risk anduh and then maybe I just you know leanon a little bit to actually cause you tobreak the rule what if I even you knowplant an employee you know in yourfacility you know to cut Corners rightnobody ever nobody ever shuts down abillion dollar Factory for breaking arule and says oh it was this employeethat did it right the corporation isliable for the behavior of a hundredthousand employeesum so uh regulations are hardum 10. and that takes me to employeerisk right you have a lot of employeesright employees have foibles maybe theemployee you know shows up to work drunkyou know or or uh or maybe they show uphigh and then they say something theyshouldn't have said okay I get in anelevator I'm drunk and I'm I'm high andI'm your employee okay and now you'reliable so you you have examples wherethere's like the billion dollar Teslalawsuit where Tesla is getting suedbecause of something one of theiremployees said in an elevator to someother employee and so you run a companyactually when you're a shareholder andthe company has a million employees youcould say this is great I have a millionemployees working for me but if youthought about it you realize this is uhthis is interesting I have a millionemployees and I am I am legally liablecivilly liable or criminally liable foreverything and anything any of themmight do at any timeone of your employees in a foreignjurisdiction can break the foreignPractices Actand then you as a shareholder arecivilly liable you might not becriminally liable but you're actuallygoing to lose all your moneyright when they get shut down becausesomeone that worked for the company didsomething inappropriatesouh importantI have I had employees so you know theemployees want to go on a business tripuh the company pays for them to rent acar so they take the car out and they goout you know drinking and then theydrive the car into a wall and they wreckthe rental car you're liablethe company is liable right it's companyrental car there are company employeesthey're in a company business tripso whatever your employees do right andthe pursuit of company business you'reyou're uh almost always civilly liableand yeah you're always you'refinancially liable when they wreck thecar you're civilly liable if they hit astation wagon with a family in it andthe family you know suffers and thenthey sue you and you might be somewhatcriminally liable if they actually youknow attempt to influence a foreignofficial or they break some kind ofbright line that is has criminalliability uh which bubbles up to thecompanyso um more employees more risk if youhad a company without employees thatwould be better right because if thereare no employees they for example inBitcoin since there is no employee ofBitcoin there's no one to take the thecompany rental car and drive it off acliff or or take an innocent civilianyou know uh in the car and drive it offcliffso uh having no facilities and havingyou know technically if you own Bitcoinyou don't own any facilities you don'thave any employees there is no board ofdirectors rightso and uh and and ironicallythe technology risk isn't really thatmuch of a risk because the the productof Bitcoin is to serve as Global moneyforever so if what you wanted to holdwas 121 millionth of all the economicenergy in the human race for the nextmillion yearsthat idea is not going to change for amillion years I'm still wanting to hold121 millionth of all the energy in thehuman race for a foreverwhereas the the ID behind the iPhonechanges every year and the idea behindyou know it was Coca-Cola then it wasDiet Coke then it was new coked and it'sCoke Zero then it's Coke Cherry VanillaCoke then it's you know Coke cream showto Coke then it's you know whatever coatthey keep changing the idea right andand uh that's the difference betweenhaving a complicated product or serviceidea and just having a monetary ideaum you know after employees uh we've gotvendor riskyou know the classic the classic chartis you know Michael Porter had thischart it's like well you've got yourcustomer risk you've got your competitorrisk you've got you're not in not inkind competitor risk and you got yourvendor risk you know and he articulatedthose four competitive forces now thetruth is the four was the fourpolitically correct forces there's a lotmore forces that are that are dilutingthe shareholders in those four butclearly one of them is vendors I run aBitcoin mining rig and then myelectricity provider doubles the cost ofelectricity oopsyou know I run a restaurant and then mypotato you know provider doubles thecost of potatoesI run a steel Refinery and ore doublesin price you know I use electricity or Iuse oil and the cost of oil doubled youknow in my plasticsogenerallyum when you look at companiesin terms of who's senior in the capitalstructureyou know the way you think of it iscommon stock Equity holders are juniorthey take the first losses then thepreferred Equity holders are senior tothem because they keep their value afterthe common stock loses all its valuethen the uh then the the juniorcreditors that hold Junior unsecureddebt are kind of senior to the preferredshareholders and then the and then theum you know sometimes secured creditorsor senior creditors or senior to themand then there are certain asset-backedlenders that they have the ability toclaim their assets back in the event ofdefault and and the assets might havesome value so they're a little bitseniorand then um then you get down to likeum you know more senior in the capitalstructure would be like landlords ifthey have the ability to evict you fromyour facilitythat's good but really senior to themare the are the utility vendors theperson the company that provides youwith your telephone service yourelectricityif you're like a Wall Street broker andthe phone company can turn off yourphonethat's senior to the real estatelandlord and it's definitely senior toall the creditors and all the equityholders because you know the phonecompany can turn your business off infive minutes no recourse or no recourseat all right you're just out of businessand the power company can shut off yourpowerand they shut down all your computerservers and you're just out of businessimmediately so electricity andTelecommunications are are much seniorto everything else and then of courseif you manufacture tires and you needpetrochemicals you know you need rubberright or if you manage if you're runninga restaurant and you need food when whenthe vendor of your food or your rawmaterials Cuts you off you're justcompletely utterly out of business rightso they can renegotiate those contractswhenever they want at will and if yougot in a fight if you say oh I have a10-year contract for mytelecommunications and the contract saysyou're not allowed to turn off mytelephonewell um if the telephone company isMonopoly and they say well just sue usand they turn you off anyway you're notgoing to last 10 years in court yourbusiness goes to zero you have no moneyto pay your lawyers you're not gonna beable to sue them it's kind of like I Isell you your oxygenokay so when I sell you your oxygen andI jack the price by a factor of ahundred and you refuse to pay it wellyou've got about 180 seconds before yourlegal appeal runs out so so vendor riskis tangible and very sophisticatedcompanies they always think first of allI need these Ironclad contracts but butthere's only there's always a questionof is the contract durable andenforceable and will I be dead as agoing concern before the contract youknow is enforcedand if you're going to be dead like forexample if apple is going to cut you offfrom the eye store and you you'rerunning a mobile app and and without themobile app being downloadable you'll bedead in 12 months or 24 months right youcan't afford a five-year litigation withApple so so ultimatelythe only way to protect yourself in thatcase is you have to find three or fourcompeting vendors and you need to beable to switch between them uh quicklynow that's I mean that's well and finein theory right like I need threevendors of natural gas but there's onlyone pipeline that runs to my facility orI need three vendors of crude oil or anythree vendors of of electricity butthere's only one or two vendors ofelectricity in the cityokay so what happens when there's onlyApple and Google and I want three butthere's only two and they actually havethe same terms wellnow I just have an impossible to manageriskand that's why say Bitcoin is superioruh to a company with vendor risk becausebecause uh Bitcoin actually has lots ofways to mitigate that riskumif you're and you always have to beconsidering that right that's why youwould want to have a hundred differentjurisdictions where you can mine Bitcoinand as long as a Bitcoin miner can runfor five to ten years you know it'll befive to ten years after your vendor Cutsyou off before you have a problem and inseven years right not now you go to adifferent Bitcoin Hardware manufacturerif every Bitcoin Hardware manufacturergoes bad on you you have seven years tofigure out how to engineer your ownsemiconductors before you have to thinkabout the theoretical dwindling of thehasheryright so how much time do you have todeal with the vendor breakdown rightum boy your electricity company cut youoff or double the price of course theywill so that's a problem if yourbusiness is creating hash ratebut if your business is holding Bitcoinit's not a problem because even thoughthe electricity company may actuallysqueeze the Bitcoin minerall that means is you can Bank you canbankrupt the Bitcoin miner and then theelectricity company takes over all theBitcoin mining Rigs and they operate theBitcoin miners as a benefit to bitcoinholders you see ultimately you know Icould you know I could be uh the Chinesegovernment and I bankrupt uh 50 exahashworth of hash rate eventually theChinese government will realize theyshould just take those Rigs and operatethem themselves because they want themoney but if they don't then uh the hashthe hash power moves to Kazakhstan orsome other part of the world where itgets operated by another company and ifthe if the power company bankrupts thatcompany then eventually a Kazakh powercompany owns it and if they don't wantto operate it well they could just burnit but if it's worth something whywouldn't they sell it to some otherPower Company in some other part of theworld that has free Powerso so the vendor risk that exists whenyou manufacture a productthat is not money that is notdecentralized it doesn't exist the sameway for Bitcoinso that takes you to customer risk rightthat's a risk factor number 12.umcustomer risk well maybe your customersstop buying your Coca-Cola or maybe theystop vaping or buying your cigarettes ormaybe they stop buying the best examplewould be you know the customers don'twant to buy a-track cassettes oreight-track tapes you know or they don'twant to buy DVDs anymore or they don'twant to buy you know horse and Buggiesanymore or buy planes or you knowwhatever whatever you thought was a goodbusiness they don't want to buy itanymoreumthe other risk uh that's sort oftechnical risk but I guess the otherpart of customer risk which uh you knowclassical competitive theorists wouldrefer to is the risk that your customergets too powerfulso maybe I'm in the middle of the marketand I'm a wholesale food dealer andthere's one company which becomes 40percent of all of my businessright um or um maybe I'm Qualcomm and Isellum smartphone chips and Applebecomes uh 50 of my revenues and thenwhat happens is my customer starts tosqueeze me they ratchet they ratchetdown the price like since I'm half ofyour business I want a deep discountWalmart used to be that when Walmartgets to be such a large portion of ofyour business they squeeze your pricesdown until you're shipping to Walmart atcostor below costthere are a lot of companies that wouldactually sell their product at a loss tothe mega retailer in order to buildtheir brand so they could make money inanother part of the marketplace and uhand so you can end up with thatsituation it's like we don't make anymoney off of off ofum the product we sell through uh themonster distribution Channel like theApple channel the Walmart Channel but wedo it because we want to stay inbusinessso when your customer is a distributorthey get too powerful they may squeezeyour margins to zero the other problemis uh you know Amazon's my customer andthey look at what I'm selling maybe I'mselling batteries through Amazon andthey decide to White Label the batteriesnow you've got Amazon batteries wellyou've got Amazon t-shirts or you've gotAmazon brandedum you know extension cordsall right Amazon light bulbs and orWalmart you know all of these bigplayers Target Walmart Amazon eventuallythey do this thing where uh SearsRoebuck they would create their ownvariety of productbecause they actually see it's a bigbusiness and they call it controldistribution apple and Microsoft andGoogle do the same thing where you knowyou have a successful product Spotifyand eventually you get Amazon music andyou get apple music and you know you getGoogle YouTube music because the idea ofstreaming music was deemed to be a goodthing and so that gets harder becausethey brand it but then they build itinto the operating system and now it'sbuilt into the iPhone and built into theiOS so so your customers eventually endup squeezing you one way or the other ifthey're also corporate entities andumif they're just um maybe they'regovernment providers maybe they're agovernment customer so the government'sbuying your product maybe at some pointum if they're a friendly government thenthey basically pay you a lot of moneyand that's good right the company has tosupport the politicians who then supportthe company and then it becomes verylucrative like military industrialcomplexum or iron triangle where the governmentsupports the vendor that's the good casethe bad case is it's a hostilegovernment and they're a big customer sothey drive the prices to zero or theypass a law saying you have to sell tothem at cost and they strip your patentsfrom you so so uh customer risk isalways thereum that takes us to risk 13 right risk13 is reputational riskum you have uh you have a CEO okay theCEO is a brilliant CEO but it turns outin college the CEO you know wrote athesis on why it was cool to smoke weedokay and today the CEO is you know mayberunning a ketchup Factory in a statewhere the governor doesn't like smokingweed and so the CEO becomes a Target sothe board of directors is great butsomebody on the board of directors goesto a bad divorce and in the divorce alot of embarrassing facts come out andthat becomes embarrassing for thecompany because it turns out that thethe director that has the bad divorceapproved the Compensation Plan of theCEO and now there's a question ofwhether they were compromised so so aslong as there are people that govern thecompany the people have a history maybemaybe one of the officers or directorsof the company campaigns for theopposition party or or the leading partyin their their uh politicallyembarrassingso the reputation of the companycan be impaired through some activityyou know the head of your business in acountry in South America got in ascandal and that rubbed off on youuh so maybe that happens maybe uh maybea director officer has a reputationmaybe any employee that's famousumthe Kanye West episode with Adidas whereyou're a spokesperson that's selling abillion dollars worth of your tennisshoes gets in an unrelated Scandalhaving nothing to do with tennis shoesbut ultimately Adidas loses money theAdidas shareholders lose money rightthat's just an example of reputationalrisk it's unavoidableumrisk 14 would be War riskokay maybe you get in a war maybe uhmaybe you manufacture in a war zone likeyou manufacture in the Ukraine or maybeyou sell into a country which gets intoa war or uh maybe you have to ship yourproducts through the Black Sea whilethere is a warand uh and during the war right ifyou're lucky maybe you're uh you're uh awar provider and you get rich off thewar but maybeyou know we know the story of say DupontCorporation sells explosives during awar and they get big but how about allthe companies that sell you know howabout recreational cruises in theAtlantic during World War Oneit didn't help them right so you knoweveryone that operated a luxury hotel inthe south of France during World War Oneand World War II didn't help them so thewar can destroy your business with nosympathyyou know famous example in the south ofFrance than one of the most beautifulhotels in the south of France you know aguy slaved his entire life uh to createhis own hotel he always dreamed about itand he built might have been the HotelMajestic but I don't remember exactlybut he built the greatest hotel in thesouth of France he borrowed up to thehilt to do it uh it was the jewel youknow of the French Riviera and hebrought it online in the late days oflike 1913 1914. the war breaks out theentire tourism business gets shut downand the government seizes the hotel andturns it into a military Hospitaland for the next four years right ituses a hospital you can imagine prettymuch half of all the capital will bedestroyed if you turned a luxury hotelin a hospital you know it gets returneduh to the shareholders after the war butof course they've been bankruptuh the guy that started was bankrupt hedied destitute that was that oopsyou know it's kind of it's just it's atragic story but for so many differentreasons but War has a you know and NoOne's Gonna actuallyno one's going to grieve for the guyright because it's like you know who areyou you wanted to run a luxury hotel andwe had greater more important things onour hands people feel sorry aboutsomeone that died in the war rightly sobut but every business that goteconomically wiped out in a war is justcollateral damageand that you know accounts for a lotlike like maybe 98 of the businesses inEurope you know during World War IIwiped outuh you know so then we go to 15 ourfavorite uhyour operator Corporation you're anequity holder you have currency riskcan't avoid it rightumin South America you have uh exposurecurrency is the lifeblood of thecorporation you can't do businesswithout trading in the currency it's themedium of exchange and so every currencyin South America collapses every 20 to30 yearsand every currency in Africa iscontinually uh lapsing right like theCFA is lapsing at 20 30 40 percent ayear so whatever currency is the nativecurrency in the in the market where youoperate is a drain on the equity of theshareholders my company uh my companyhas the leading business intelligencecompany in Argentina for the past 25yearsbut the Argentine currency the peso hasbeen losing value at 20 30 40 percent ayear just lapsing value from from onepeso to the dollar to 370 pesos to thedollarso how do you extract profit from aMarketplace when you're accumulating thecurrency that's collapsingespecially since you were you knowcollapsing currencies always come withcapital controlsso umthe most successful currency in the lasthundred years is the US dollarthe US dollar uh you know as I'veestablished right it collapsed 99.7percent against uh Miami Beach realestate over 92 years99.7 percentthe house that I am in went from ahundred thousand dollars in value to 46million dollars in value over 92 yearsit works out to seven percent a year for92 years we are on track for it to bea hundred million dollars by theCentennial okay so we will literally bea99.9 percentlapse in value over a hundred years ofthe strongest currencyof the 20th century so the winner ofevery war and the world Reserve currencyloses 99.9 percent of its value over 100yearseverything elseis worseso I don't know how you measure worsebut I mean it means practically speaking98 of all currencies lose 100 of theirvalue over the hundred years and most in20 yearsso the problem with uh with currencyrisk is is uh what it means is a companycan't run with positive working capitalyou have to run with negative workingcapital it means that accumulatingbillions of dollars of profit means thatyou know you have 10 billion dollarsthat's losing 20 percent of its economicpower in a bad year and 10 in a goodyear and 30 percent in a horrific yearso you're continually lapsing energyinto the economyso that currency risk causescorporations to do irrational things onething you do is you borrow tens ofbillions of dollars you you borrow tonsof money and so you go into debt theother thing is you don't accumulateasset you don't accumulate equity andthe other thing you do is you okay youpursue a strategy of Acquisitions thereason all my competitors went out ofbusiness is they realize that they can'tgrow The Core Business seven or eightpercent a yearright conventional wisdom is if the ifthe currency is losing seven percent ofits value a year you have to grow yourrevenues ten percent or your cash flowsten percent for the equity to hold anyvaluebutalmost no businesses can be grown at 10a yearnow you could say well well don't Googleand apple grow at 10 a yearwell Apple no Google not right nowbut uh the point one percent of thebusinesses that do grow ten percent ayearare the ones you read about 99 of thetime so you have an adverse selection inthe media where what you read about isyou read about Apple and Google whichare the greatest digital monopolies InOur Lifetime that grew well for a whileand they wiped out99.9 percent of their competitioneverybody else gets wiped out theaverage business can't grow 10 a year sowhen the currency is grown at sevenpercent a year in the US when thecurrency has grown at 14 a year in thedeveloping world that means that acompany in the developing world has togrow its revenues 20 a yearin that currency or they have to growtheir revenues 10 percent a year in theUS dollar andyou can't do that so what you do is youlever up by by borrowing a ton of moneyand buying your stock back and you'rerunning on no equityand that way you have no asset youde-capitalize the companyand that increases the riskexponentiallyevery company you read about that wentthrough an lbo and then they couldn'tmake their Debt Service paymentsyou know go and Google companies thatfail because they couldn't meet DebtService you'll find thousands andthousands and thousands of companiesthey couldn't meet their Debt Servicethey were wiped out because they kepttaking on debt to create uh to createEquity value and that's one problem andthen the other problem isI decide I'm going to grow the top lineby buying another company so I do amerger of equals Microsoft is buyingActivision you know Salesforce by slackSalesforce buys Tableau these companiesbuy other companies at a multiple of uhfour times Revenue eight times Revenue10 times Revenueokay why would you do that well becauseyou got to keep the revenue growing andthe Top Line growing and you Availyourself of acquisition accountingand that's a way to protect Equity valuethe Time Warner uh AOL deal it actuallyworked for the shareholders for about 12to 24 months during which they all gotliquid they sold and then it collapsedand everybody lost everythingso this currency risk is driving allthis other pernicious Behaviorand uh and it and it has another effectuh we'll talk about when I finish thisit it it's what destroys thediversification strategies and theindexing strategies but we'll come backthat in a bitum16 is tax risk uh and tax risk isyou know you you do business you've gotyou've got the risk of being taxed by acity taxed by a state taxed by a countytaxed by a country and the taxes can uhcan vary but you know when someonedecides they don't like whatever you'reselling they put a ayou know a windfall profits tax on youor they put a withholding tax on you orthey put a value and use tax on you anduh they just tax you out of existenceand it's very difficult uh to deal withthat and over a hundred years that'sgonna change all the time17 is weather risk you know you you'vegot a business you want restaurants andwhen uh when the weather's bad peopledon't go out you have open-airamphitheaters when the weather's badthey don't go out right weather is ahuge driver of business and there's noway to control it if you're lucky it'sjust it's just routine cyclical weatherif you're unlucky it's a tsunami and itwipes out your entire Resort and youlose five years of profitright or you lose you lose all yourcapitalso so weather risk affects lots ofbusinesses many of them don't evenrealize they're affected by itum18 is customs riskthat is uh all of the cross-bordertrading taxes that are being put inplace a lot of companies and China gotwiped out by Customs that were put onthem but you know you've got NorthAmerican Free Trade Agreement whichisn't free trade agreement that wipesout half the businesses the benefit ofother half the businesses so this isthis Customs technique is being used asa weapon of political policy andeconomic policy andand the challenge there is yourcompetitor may decide uh to influence apolitician to create a customs rule thatwipes you out that helps themso people just wage economic War throughpoliticians via customs and duties andit's continually going on everybody atwar with everybodythe problem of course is I can take amillion dollars and I can use it toinfluence a politician to create abillion dollar penalty for my competitorso it's extremely unfair and it's sortof unethical it's unethical and it'sunfair but it's also uneconomic becausesomeone destroys a billion dollars ofvalue with a million dollars it's a veryit's kind of like if I had the legalright to take a bullet and put it inyour head and and shootshoot youwith everybody's shooting everybody it'syou know if everybody just you know if Irun a health care clinic and I just goand I can machine gun down all thedoctors and the competing Health CareClinicwell a thousand doctors are dead andthey collectively took 20 years of theirlife or 30 years of their life to becomedoctors so I wiped out 3000 years worth of medical you knowmedical trainingand I deprived the civilization of howyou know I deprived my city of half ofits health care but I made a lot ofmoney doing it so you're creatingeconomic Carnagethrough this Customs process I'mdestroying I'm wiping out a billiondollar plant in the wrong country justlike what's going on right now insemiconductors I have a plant which I'llmanufacture semiconductors not in theU.S so what I do is I wipe that out andforce you to rebuild the plantin the U.S using a customs duty and it'sjust creating economic Carnage andsomehowif I passed a rule basically doublingcustoms duties on everything that wasforeign I wipe out half of the capitalvalue of everything in the worldovernight with a with a brush of a penor a keystrokeI double the price of everythingokay I wipe out the equity capital ofeverybody that's an equity investor inall those factorieswhat one I should pause here and make apoint on equity which is um people thinkthatumthat uhthere will always be value and equitybut umbut there's no reason why Equity has tobe worth anythingum if the government if if public policyis sufficiently critical or hostile toequity uh to equity holders I can drivethe value of every of every piece ofequity and all corporate ownership tozero in a countryI'll give you a simple example of thatin North Korea or in Cubaright if I literally Outlaw privateownership the value of equity all goesto zero but you can also conceptualizein a free market economy where the wherethe policies are so hostile to equityholders that all of the value goes tosenior debt holders where it goes to thecreditors maybe uh maybe the people thatown the debt and the company actuallymaintain their Capital but the peoplethat hold the equity get driven to zeroand in a in a bankruptcy that happensand a bankruptcy you can see a billiondollars of equity goes to zero but abillion dollars of debt maybe actuallytrade sideways is a billion dollars ofdebt it gets recapitalized so there's noguarantee that uh Equity is ever worthanything and when you start to seeincreased government interventionit typically Works to the detriment ofthe unsecured creditors or the or theequity holders and it works it may ormay not impact the secured creditors andsometimes there's no effect on that onthe vendors or the utility uh creditorsright the people that are sellingelectricity they might benefit from itumso that's 18 Customs risk uh 19 is legalriskso so every company because it has uhbecause it acts because it does thingsit takes on legal risk maybe it producesuh a product which is non-compliantmaybe the people in the factory dosomething which is non-compliant maybeuh maybe there's a law that says thatyou're not allowed to show up to workwithout a mask maybe there's a law thatsays that you have to have a certainlicenseright so there's millions of pages oflossand so when when some maybe uh the guythat runs your restaurant fires thewrong personand they take offense maybe when hefires them he uses a cuss word or aswear word and so he he swears at themand he's rude to them and so they sueand there's a trial by jewelry and thenyou lose a 700 million dollar lawsuit soyou take on civil liability because ofthe behavior of your employees and itcould be civil it could be Criminaland umit's never a defense that uh the companycan't say wellthat person just worked for us he's notthe if you're the shareholder you can'tsay that's just an employee the employeehas the the power to bind the companycontractually but also if the employeeis driving a truck with your brand on itand they and they drive it into a schoolbusyou have the Civil liability and maybeif the employee operates a candidate barfactory and they don't they don'tactually abide by the right Health Carestandards or they do maybe they ship acandy bar and it kills somebody youmight have a criminal liabilityso ultimately civil and criminalliabilitiesum accrued to the equity holderand you can't avoid that and that takesme to my to a special type of legal riskuh this is risk factor 20 tort riskand tort risk is you're doing anythingthat anybody doesn't like so they justsue youokay and and you've got all the time uhall all the time you have this tort riskit's like you manufactured a car and itwas rear-ended and exploded so I assumeI assume you you manufacture a car witha seat without a without a seat belt andI die because I go through thewindshield I sue you you know youmanufacture a car without somethingright all the time uh any kind ofproduct fails or it doesn't work as Iexpected it to work so you get suedclass action lawsuitsall kinds of lawsuitsyou know derivative lawsuits may youknow you took a risk we didn't want youto take so we sue youyou took a risk you disclosed it and thewrong way the reason that the 10ks haveuh so many pages of potential risks isbecause the attorneys are attempting todisclose every possible risk factor anyway that that the shareholders mightlose money because they anticipateand five to ten years someone's going tosue the company by the waythe company can make a hundred exitsit's it's gain and you can still getsued right uh everything works perfectlyand then it trades down 27 and thensomeone still sues you and when they sueyou they will say well the managementteam acted irresponsibly and we didn'tknow and the attorneys want to be ableto say well in this paragraph of the 10Kwe disclose that it's possible that ahostile government would take thisaction against us right it's possible werely upon management as possible so tortrisk is always with us and you you readabout all these horror stories like acompany can get a billion dollar youknow legal judgment against themlike such and such you know restaurantmanager you know yelled at customer andcustomer sued said their civil rightswere violated and 350 million dollarlawsuitokay what the heck it happensthat's risk factor 20.21 patent riskso you create a product and the productuses words on a computer screenand occasionally when uh you know whensomething goes negative the words Flashin red and someone sues you and said Ihave a patent for the use of redflashing numbers on a computer screenand so you know and you use a button andsomeone says I have a patent for the useof buttons on computers and then youactually make it possible to send peoplemonthly reports via email and someonesues you and says I have a patent onusing email to update customers onstatusand then you know you create some otherproduct and you know the product uses anorange heart and someone says I have apatent on icons with the color orange inthem and you would be shocked at howmany random patents are everybody triesto patent everything I think at at onepoint you know someone was suing uhBlackberry because they're usingelectronic devices to send emailback and forthright everybody thinks they inventedeverythingand the sad fact of the matter isthere's this bias I mean the entire ideaof patents is is oh I I came up withoriginal idea and so I should be paidfor ityou know I I think it's kind of afiction you know if you trace thehistory you said what what's the oldestknown Factory they can find a stone axFactory uh from 1.7 million years agoand they found like 500 Stone axes 1.7million years old and what it tells youin a blink of an eye is 1.7 millionyears ago there's an economy wherepeople created a factory theymanufactured Stone axes they had someform of money they traded it for forfurniture and for food because nobodyneeds 500 Stone axes for themselvesright and they probably had rules aroundit and they probably had a mediumexchange and they had warehouses andthey probably kept score and there wasprobably fabrics and if you could dostone axes you can have clothing and youcan have shelter and you can have foodand you can have storage and you canhave Logistics and carts and all thesethingsbut the thing is after 1.7 million yearsthe only thing we have left is the stoneaxes because they're the only thing hardenough to last 1.7 million yearseverything else decayednothing else lasts so we have toreinvent that stuff every 10 000 yearsfor 1.7 million yearsbut somehow or other humans think thatrecorded history is the only time in alot that we invented stuff and so westart attributing people with with theidea starting 4 000 years ago or 300years ago you know you had the idea fora printing press 300 years ago wellmaybe but maybe like 200 000 years ago adude created a seal out of mud and hewas printing stuff you know out of outof wood but you know he got murdered bysomeone from the other Valley and I gotburned and we just don't remember him orher right so patents are just this ideathat I can invent stuff and I canconvince I can I can prevent you fromusing itand ultimately everybody's always tryingto patent random the use of arithmeticyou know in displays something silly butyou know Lord help you if you run acompany you will be sued and there arepatent trolls and the patent trolls willbasically Sue everybody for use of ofwords and numbers and computers to doanything even thoughit's pretty self-evident most of theseideas get invented ten thousand timesit's not that anybody could invent theidea but like one out of a hundredthousand people can pretty much reinventwhatever anybody else invented and thequestion is do you have the right toreinvent it or invent it or do you doyou have have not the right to invent itand this is a problem for shareholdersbecause the shareholders you know aregetting continuously sued and you knowyou know Nick you know why big companiesaccumulate patent portfoliosthe number one reason why is we all knowwe're going to get sued and so when weget sued our strategy is to counter Sueeach other to say okay well you have apatent on the use of the color blue andI have a patent on the use of the colororange and so what if we cross licenseand you're allowed to use blue andorange and I can use orange and blue andwe can go about our business andgenerally that's how it gets settledthe danger is the trolls and the trollsare these parasitic lawyers and theydon't produce anything and there's andthe reason they don't produce anythingis if they produce anything they couldbe counter sued so they just haveportfolios of patents and they just goabout suing everybody for everythingeverywhere because they just object tosomeone being able to use arithmetic intheir computer program and ultimatelythey leave a small entrepreneur with thecost of spending 10 million dollars todefend the use of arithmeticand a computer program and their idea isthere'll be a parasite and you'll givethem some of your moneyand if you get sued by a hundred patenttrolls and you give them each onepercent of your revenues right thenyou've got nothing leftand so they just are parasites just likea tapewormand there's a hundred parasites if theyall got one percent of your consumptionyou're dead and so do healthy organismsdie by a parasite yeah they're fungusthey're bacteria the viruses they'reparasites and they continue and it's youknow it's awful for the human race orfor productivity butyou know first they will basically Sueeverybody then they will pay thepoliticians to pass laws to protect thetort Lobby and the you know and the thetort trolls and that's lifeand the patent trolls so it takes me to22. risk factor 22 health risk thesecompanies you know are operated by humanbeings just like your body as cells yourbody is replacing your cells every 90days you knowyou have to but imagine if the cellscontinue on when the cells cling uh thenthe cells become cancerous right andthat's eventually when the body can'treplace your cells then uh you age youbecome less flexible eventually you dieand that is the the life cycle of anorganic beingin a corporation the problem is you knowwhen the CEO is 45 okay what about 55what about 65 what about 75 what about85 do you really want a 95 year old CEOI mean at some point as the officers andthe directors age and as the employeesage uh they become fragile and theydon't learn so well people that are 85years old don't learn the same thingsthat people that are 25 years old aren'tso there's a life cycle as you age youhave health problems you might haveheart problems you might have metabolicdiseases you might have all sorts ofissues you get kind of distracted byyour own mortalityright and uh you know if you're ifyou're lying in the hospital after yoursecond heart attack it's it's moredifficult for you to take a long-termview towards your corporationyou're thinking about other things atthe very least you're distractedright if you're not distracted by yourown personal problems you're distractedwhen they administer all the painkillersand then they administer thebenzodiazepams and and the mood alterthe mood umleveling drugs that they give to peoplethat had cardiovascular surgery so so asuh officers and directors and employeesand these corporations age you have allsorts of health risk andit's just like that it's a risk right isit 99 likely you can do your job surebutum you know if you're flying an airplaneyou know how do you feel about anairplane when the guy flying theairplane has had three heart attacks andhe's 75 years old and he's on 14different medicationsI can tell you how you feel yeah youprobably won't get cleared for flightright that would be politicallyincorrect if I said that about certainother professionsbut you know if you're going to be a ifyou're going to be a bus driver for youknow elementary school kids you're goingto fly an airplaneyou know you know do you really wantyour heart surgeon to go into your heartsurgery and they're on 17 medicationsmaybe not soat some point corporations have to dealwith that health risk and of course asthey're dealing with the health risk ifthey actually fire someone or replacethem because of those health issues theyget sued by the tort lawyersor The Regulators you're insensitive youknowour country is run by octogenariansright yeah you notice and and there's alot of interesting colorful back andforth over whether it's good forcountries to be run by octogenarianswhen the Soviet Union was run byoctogenarians we objected to that rightit creates you know interestingexistential crisesand uh you know that takes us to thislife cycle risk23. uh everybody has life cycles rightso when you're 25 years old and you'resingle you have a different view of theworldand when you're 85 years old and you'regoing through your fourth divorce andyou have children and grandchildren andyou own half the company and they'refighting over the company and you havedynastic strugglesright uh you actually have all thesecorporate governance issues and you haveall these risk Equity holders uh thisfamously happened in in the SumnerRedstone Viacom case where uh SumnerRedstone was controlling shareholder andhe had a fight with his daughterand in the middle of it was the CEOs ofthe companies he controlled and then allthe shareholders right and their viewwas we're being abused in this dynasticpower struggleyou know there are lots of otherexamples that I could go intouh life cycle uh risk is a challenge itdoesn't occurif the company was run by an immortalcreature that lived a million yearsand that's what Bitcoin isyou don't have a life cycle risk becausethere is no life cycle right the thesatoshi's protocol isn't going to dieand it doesn't have childrenand Satoshi isn't around to have anopinion and there's no bad divorcecomingright and so you're not going to havethese issuesthese things happen with other companiesall the timeum and the result of these first 23 riskthey just try one last thing which isdilution riskultimately your Equity holder and theway the companies deal with all theseother risk is whenever they fail tomanage one of the first 23 risks theyjust issue more stockor they dilute the shareholders and umthere there's a good reason to issue astock if you're issuing a stockcreatively and you're acquiring assetsthat are more valuable than the stockyou're issuingthat's okaybut when you're issuing stock dilutivelyand you're acquiring less assets oryou're simply paying off a liabilitythen you're diluting out to shareholdersand and over time you get deluded eitherby issuance of equity or by absorbing anoffice off balance sheet liabilitythat uh catastrophically blows up at apoint seven years in the future and atthat point you realize that the equityis worth nothingsoor it's worth much lessso these are um those are the 24 keyrisks that every company Equity holderhas to accept and and every everydirector every CEO of the company has tothink about every one of those risksevery minute of the dayand if you're an equity holder you haveto be thinking about them continuouslyand you're worrying about them all thetime you can never just buy the share ofstock and put it in a safe and go tosleep for 20 yearsbecause any of those risks I name canwipe out 100 of your asset and All OfHuman Action is a liability workingagainst you nowhow do you mitigate for that well I meanyou can pretty much hire a money managerthat runs a mutual fund for you or ahedge fund for youand umso the money manager is attempting tomitigate that risk but now you've gotthe counterparty risk of trusting themoney manager and you've got to pay themtwo percent of all your assets everyyear and 20 of the gainand if you calculate the cost of saydoing a conventional hedge fund way whenyou agree to a 2 and 20 contract if yougive a million dollars to a moneymanagerthen statistically over a decadethey're going to get 20 percent of yourmoney just through the management feeand then because they get 20 of theupside via volatility you calculate thetypical volatility of the s p and youconclude that that's another 18 percentso they're going to get 36 percent ofyour Capital risk free in 10 yearsyou've given up one third of all yourmoney to the managerokay and what do you get you get nobetter you get basically3.8 percent lower return than the s pindexso if the s p is yielding eight percenta year you get four percent a yearyou're getting destroyed they're gettingyou know one third of all your money sothat doesn't work over the course of ahundred years or even over 10 yearsand most of them 95 percent of thesehedge funds underperform the s p indexso that's the problem with that and nowwe have to go the question of what aboutthe indexwhy don't you know maybe Michael maybeyou're right about the 24 risks ofcompanies but I'm really smart I'm goingto just pull my money in the index fundwell what you're missing is the index isis just a another mutual fund and it'sjust uh another anotherumway uh to select a basket of stocksso the s p index is the most commonlyarticulated one and the s p is 500stocks and you know in this WesternMarket but there's a selection biasyou're basically trusting someone someAnalyst at standard and poor to selectthe 500 companies and weight themand they get to choose the algorithm forselection and waiting andit's an arbitrary algorithm that theychoose and not not the 500 biggest onesthey picked the 500 the you know saynon-financial companies and yeah theysort of weight them buttheir 500 companies with substantialexposure to the US dollarsothe problem is you're trusting theindexer and indexes become obsolete I'llgive you an example of one the Dow Jonesindex the Dow Jones index is notrepresentative even of a Market Basketof large companies anymore it's all it'sonly 25 particular companiesand um most of the companies in the DowJones index 100 years ago aren't on itanymore they just randomly put companieson it and it doesn't track even thebroad Equity Marketso you've got random indexesbut here's the real big problemyour index has adverse selection bias soyou happen to pick the index the mostsuccessful index of the last hundredyears in the most successful currencyand the index is being manipulated viaquasi-hedonic adjustments basicallyarbitrary adjustments every year they'rejust randomly throwing out the losersand putting winners that they think makesense in the index for marketingpurposes if they didn't adjust the indexyou would find that 95 of the companiesin the index would go bankrupt and soyou're actually choosing an indexerfor the next hundred years and that'sthe problemso I suggest this thought experimentwhat if you took the top 100 companiesand and you constructed an index in eachof the top 100 countriesso you take a hundred countries like goto Zimbabwe and you take the take thetop 100 companies in Zimbabwe starting1980.and you take the top 100 companies inSouth Africa and the top 100 companiesin Japan and in Germany and in Argentinaand in Venezuela and in the U.S and inBritain and in Franceand in Norway and in Russiaso now you got your indexes now roll theclock back to 1900 and just check howeach of those indexes performs againstgoldor against Miami Beach real estateand what you realize is that 99 of theindexes go to zerobecause every index is correlated to thecurrencyright there is no index you canconstruct in South America that doesn'tlose all your money in 50 yearsand there's no the any index youconstructed in Germany lost all of yourmoney nearly all of your money afterWorld War One you know remember theWeimar Republic but everything goes tozero then it loses all your money afterWorld War IIrightgoes to zero so you get wiped out twiceuh you get wiped out at least once inJapan you get wiped outabout three times in Russia you getwiped out five times in Argentina so youdon't quite get wiped out if you have apolitically adjusted index in the U.Sbut it's because there are they'remanipulating right the CPI on the dollarand then manipulating the s p indexand uh and and you've got one other bigassumption that goes with that which isif you put all your money in the s pindex you assume that the s p indexer isgoing to be virtuous for the nexthundred yearsyou assume that the that the Westernthat the United States is going to besuccessful for 100 years and you assumethe U.S dollar is going to be thedominant currency for a hundred yearsand you assume that you will be able tocontinually continue to keep your assetsdomiciledin that economy for the next hundredyears you and your heirs if you make allthose four assumptionsthen you might get something that sortof tracksyou know a Market Basket of equitiesbut um it's not clear to me I don'tthink any any serious scientist has doneenough research to prove that uh stockpicking even index stock picking canactually outperform uh the collapse ofthe of any currency because uh everyevery analysis generally has been biasedin favor of the index and the currencyjust like uh there's no honest CPIcreated by any member of the existingFinancial establishment nobody will tellyou that the dollar lost 99.7 percent ofits value over 92 years they will say itlost 95 percent of its valueright and they won't give you an honestanalysis of the return of the s p indexif it was stat if it was staticallymaintainedand they'll say well of course you can'tstatically maintain the indexescompanies come and gookay well then give me an algorithm toestablish an index that is not subjectto human corruptionan uncorruptable algorithmsoyou know I think uhI think our time is nearing an end and Ihave a lot more to say on the subjectbut we'd have to keep it for a futurepodcast you know I could I could giveyou if you look at the history of Disneyand I suggest people study the historyof Disney they're a great example ofevery kind of this risk right thatthat share I'm going to do this veryfast because I don't know how to talkthe shareholders lost a huge amount ofmoney when uh when Frank Wells died in ahelicopter skiing

boardthis is just one example of Carnage andanxiety after another for 25 yearsand this is like the successful companyand this is kind of the life of theequity shareholder just living inanxiety and and every other company hasthe same story and they will continue soI guess I would summarize with thison one you know you know there's thefamous Saint zupry quote right thedesign is perfect when there's nothingleft to take awayif I take a company and a product I takeaway the product I take away the boardof directors I take away the CEO I takeaway the facility I take away the NexusI take away the brand I take away theemployees I take away all the trading Itake away all the motion I take away thecompetitors I take away all the newideasI take away all of the uncertainty andthe volatility I take away the humanfactors and the life cycle I take awaythe life and the death and the Aging Itake away the dramawhat have I got left I got BitcoinBitcoin is a company where I StrippedAway 24 different risks every you wantto ruin Bitcoinevery time you want to come up with anew idea let's change the protocol let'sdo this let's do that let's make itbetter right you get ethereum rightethereum is I got all these new ideasthey have 10 years worth of new ideas onthe roadmap they have new ideas all thetime this idea that idea if you want todestroy if you want to convert yourcommodity which is money into an equitywhich is technology you keep injectingnew ideasand the arrogance of humanity ishuman beings are born thinking thatthey're bulletproof and indestructibleand for whatever reason we also arrogantright1.7 million years agosomebody figured out how to run a stoneax Factory and I bet you everybodylistening this podcast if I dropped himin the middle of the Wilderness theycouldn't figure out how to manufactureStone axes and set up a factory and turnout 500 a month they'd probably all dieof starvation yet 1.7 million years agopeople figured it out they created aneconomy they invented all this stuff andthe human race keeps inventing andforgetting and inventing and forgettingand inventing and and they rise to acertain levelso every new generation age 18 or 22 or25 they think that they're going to doit betterand therefore they want to I could runthat company better I could build thatproduct better if I was in charge of thecity I could run it better if I was incharge of the economy if I ran thefootball league if I invented the newgame if I invented a new product if Iwas in charge of marketing everybodythinks they could do it betterand what they what they don't realize isthey have this inventor bias becausethey invented it it's their idea theythink it's beautiful and it's a milliontimes better than any other idea andthey they have an ignorance they don'tunderstand all of the ways that it won'tbe betterwhen it gets introducedso a corporation when you're a corporateshareholder you think by owning acompany you will have something whichwill outperform Bitcoinyou're going to outperform perfect moneyand the only way to outperform perfectmoney is you have to outrun you have tomanage all of the all of the risks Imentioned and outrun the currencydebasement rateyou have to manage every single risk andgrow more than seven percent a year youknow in your working capital and that'show you outperform perfect money andmaybe all these things worked better inthe past because we never had perfectmoneyright uh because people thought I'mtrying to outperform t-bills right Ican't use goldas a medium of exchange I can't havegold running through my veinsif I had gold running through mycorporate veins then I'm my money has ahalf-life of 35 yearsright the energy in my working capitallost 35 years if I've gold runningthrough my veins but if I have uh the USdollar running through my veinsmy money has a half-life of uh five toten years ten years let's say it soso in that particular caseit was a different thing but now youcould have uh you can have umBitcoinas your currency uh store of valuemedium exchange and as a half-life ofinfinityso what that says theoretically is youshould probably be doing a lot lesswith your working capitaland you should be saving a lot morethat's an another way of getting to thisidea that in a Fiat world where thecurrency is collapsingyou have to you have to buy and doanything with your money because thecurrency is going to zero in a hurryright you live in Zimbabwe you'll buystacks of soap and toilet paper andanything that's tangible and do anythingbecause you might as well spend it onFood Eat Drink be merry for tomorrow wedie rightso in an economy like thatall of the economic energy goes towardconsumption dissipation or evenproduction or experimentationin the near termbut in an economy where you have perfectmoney or or properly engineered moneyyou really start to say well the risk ofdoing all this other stuff is so high Ishouldn't do itas an individual you shouldn't have somuch allocated to equity right youshould be shifting your portfolio awayfrom things that have a theoreticalreturn of seven percent or five percentit ought to have a theoretical return of20 percent and there aren't many thingsthat have a theoretical return of 20 soso you should shift the way your Capitalback to strong moneybecause because Bitcoin is is thisrisk-free return over the long termand umthat causes the individual to be a saverif you're an investor it means thatinstitutional investors should shifttheir Capital allocations away fromequityand you shift toward a stronger moneyand uh and if you're a corporateexecutive you should shift your investinstead of doing a billion dollaracquisition you would just keep thebillion dollars and keep it in yourtreasury rightlike microstrategy doesn't have toinvest a billion dollars in buyinganother business intelligence companybecause we have a billion dollars on ourbalance sheet in Bitcoinright or billion so we can simply holdthe Bitcoin and get a yield and a returnfor our shareholders over the long termso so the way that you think is going tochangeand ultimatelyI I think that as a as people understandthe risk factors embedded in equitythen the consumer the family theindividual investor the family theInstitutional Investorthe The Sovereign wealth fundand the corporate treasurerand the institutional the institutionthe agency all of them will change theirView and their allocation because it isuh it is it is much less rational to beusing equity and Equity indexes as astore of valuewhen you have an alternative which isproperly engineeredone could argue that you know goldwasn't fast enough and it lost favor asmoneyand so people all migrated uh for awhile they migrated to sovereign debt asa store of valueand that makes sense sovereign debt isthe store of value when the interestrates are seven or eight or nine percentand the inflation rate of the monetaryinflation rate is seven percentit's not a great idea I mean it's itbasically is a parity store of valueright a great store of value yields 14against the seven percent inflation ratea good store value yield seven percentagainst the seven percent inflation ratea crappy store of value yields threepercent against the seven percentinflation rate when that happenseveryone stampedes to the s p index ororETFs or Equity indexes or just rawequity and that's what's happened in oureconomy in the past decadeand uh I think I think uh the world'srational as people get educated theywill gradually reallocate theirportfolios and I I would say right nowclearly the world is over educated andover over marketed inequities right wehave much much more of the financialeducation infrastructure allocated uh toeducating people on equity and ETFs andmutual fundsI I just went to a conference I walkedthrough an entire conference and they'relike there's thousands and thousands andthousands of expensive sophisticatedFinancial professionals and suits thatare explaining to you you know one oftheir 8 000 mutual funds or ETFs orsomething so the world is overeducatedin that and the world is under educatedin sound money in Bitcoinbecause the economics are such thatyou know if you if you look at all thecrypto funds they wouldn't even holdBitcoin because they don't get two andtwenty you don't get 35 percent of thecapital you raise if you invest inBitcoinyou couldn't justify charging twopercent management fee and a 20participation so if I I'm effectively ifI'm getting 35 of all the capital Iraise to pitch an altcoinor to pitch inequitythen I'm going to over Market themyou know I've I've never had and Nickand my entirecareerin 30 years I've never had a person in asuit show up in my office and Pitch meon a simple investment strategyI've never had an educated Person Pitchme on whole own Bitcoin and hold foreverI've never had them pitch me on just buysome high quality property and waitI've never had them pitch me on justhold the index and waitI've never had them pitch but I've neverhad a doctor pitch me on why don't youjust fast just stop eatingexercise a bit moreI've never had a doctor tell me juststop doing bad things and start doinggood thingsbecause nobody gets paidright the guy with a PhD and the suitdoesn't get paid the doctor doesn't getpaid the Pharma company doesn't get paidthe CEO doesn't get paidso ultimatelyit's up to it's up to pro bono you knowethical educatorsrightto to stand up and tell the world whywhy things like living healthy orfastingor owning Bitcoin or ethicalethical imperativesand uh that's what we're doing right nowI suppose so so thanks for listening tome on this do you have any final uhquestions or you know what we'll doMichael's we'll we'll do a follow-uphereum where we can break down maybe some ofthe additional nuances to what it's liketo compare Bitcoin and equities butyou've given us so much to chew on herewith a couple dozen risk factors thatare present in equities that we don'tsee in Bitcoin and you've you answeredmy main follow-up question along the waywhich was well do index funds mitigatethese risks that you're talking aboutand your answer is no not whole not holyand um so thank you Michael so much forjoining us today and explaining to usthe difference between equity andBitcoin and really how we should thinkabout these two asset classes over thecoming decades not just in the presentum
