Cate's experience at medical school was powerless to stop her own health deteriorating, causing her to look at nutrition as a deeper cause of health problems, sending her down a rabbit hole to discover the horrors of modern seed oils, and the devastating damage caused by mainstream theories of health and nutrition, particularly the work of \"the Keynes of Nutrition\" Ancel Keys, who has arguably killed more humans than anyone in history. Cate contrasts his work to that of Weston Price, \"the Mises of Nutrition\", whose study of traditional diets worldwide remains enormously informative and useful, in spite of the medical and nutrition establishment ignoring it. Cate also explains how your food determines the health, fitness, and beauty of your children, and the warped financial incentives of modern fiat medicine.ResourcesCate on TwitterCate’s books Deep Nutrition, The Fat Burn Fix and Food Rules on her official websitePhD thesis that influenced Cate’s early ideas on nutrition: Lipid peroxidation in Vivo by Eva SödergrenBook criticised by Cate for manipulation of statistics: The Seven Countries Study: A Scientific Adventure in Cardiovascular Disease EpidemiologyThe Future of Fat SummitThe Weston Price Foundation’s official websiteDentist and beauty theorist Stephen R.
