How or when will it start?What will be 'the last straw that breaks the camel's\nback' for hyperbitcoinization on a global scale?How do you foresee governments responding to it?[ANDREAS] How many people here have heard of,\nor understand, the term \"hyperbitcoinization\"?Not enough, great. Let me let me start by clarifying.\n\"Hyperbitcoinization\" is this idea of a tipping point...at which the sustainability of a fiat economy, especially\nin the presence of a vibrant cryptocurrency economy,is no longer there and people abandon \ntraditional fiat [currency] in droves.Where there will be a mass conversion over to Bitcoin.To me, that is a maximalist position that is more or less\na fiction. I do not believe we will have a moment when...Bitcoin will become the dominant replacement\nfor all fiat, I don't believe that will ever happen.In fact, if it was happening, then we would \nhave a full-on currency war in our hands,and we do not want to engage in that\nwith nation states that have armed thugs.That is not [good for] your personal safety.All of you people who are driving around \nin Lamborghinis with bitcoin license plates...[Laughter] You will be the first ones to go.But then again, I don't think hyperbitcoinization\nwill happen, certainly not on a global level.There might be tipping points where certain countries\nsuffering from irreversible currency crisis and collapse,that cannot establish pegs to [other] currencies like the\nU.S. dollar or afford to launch a new paper currency...The cost of printing paper currencies\nis in the tens of millions of dollars.Very often, the countries having these collapses realize\nthat they can't even afford to print the new currency.That becomes a gating problem. We have seen that\nin Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Brazil, and a few other places.The cost of printing exceeded the \nresources the government had.It turns out that is the cure for inflation: \nrun out of money to print [more] money. [Laughter]In some countries, as a last resort, you will see people\nchoosing to conduct the majority of their business...in cryptocurrency because it is the best, most\nportable and accessible alternative out there.I think we will see that happen on a local basis,\nnot in a massive global tipping point where...everybody is fleeing for the exit.At least, I hope it doesn't. That is an apocalyptic scenario\nwhich will disrupt the world economy so badly.We don't want that. Nobody should hope \nthat the world economy collapses just so...everybody can see the truth about Bitcoin.That is cutting off your nose to spite your face.\n\"Oh great, now we all have bitcoin!\" \"Yeah!\"Also, we will belong to marauding bands of Mad Max\npersonalities, fighting for scraps of food. [Laughter]\"But hey, we have Bitcoin! Awesome!\"\n\"See? I was right!\" you say, as you gun down...a person who is trying to take the piece\nof bread out of your mouth. [Laughter]Yeah, let's not do that.\nI don't believe in hyperbitcoinization.I would hope we see a much more orderly transition\nto a pluralistic world where people have many choices,and their freedom has increased,\nwithout first hitting rock-bottom.",
