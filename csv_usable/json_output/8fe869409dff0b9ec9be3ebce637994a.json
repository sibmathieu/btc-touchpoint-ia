It has literally saved the lives of my friends and many Ukrainians. Without it, we would not have been able to raise money so quickly to pay for protective equipment for soldiers in the early days of the Russian invasion” - Lyudmyla KozlovskaThe activists reference a letter written by a group of \"global tech experts\" which told Congress that cryptocurrency is 'unproven' and a solution 'in search of problems.' Notably, all but two of the anti-crypto letter's authors enjoy the benefits of the dollar or euro system. \"Our problems are real and the proof is in our stories and work,\" the activists write. ‍This is not the first time some of the human rights leaders have advocated for open source software and internet freedom. \"Just as some of us have acted to defend the open web in the past, today we stand to defend an open monetary system and its power to connect the world.\"‍‍‍RelatedreadreadFinancial Inclusion & Human Rights11/16/20226 minHard on Bitcoin, Soft on Crypto Crime: A Case Study of the New York TimesRead articlereadreadFinancial Inclusion & Human Rights6/7/20222 min 21 Human Rights Leaders Urge Congress to Learn About Bitcoin Read articlereadreadFinancial Inclusion & Human Rights4 minA Case for BitcoinRead articleSign up to receive the latest in policy analysis, news, and original research.Thanks !
