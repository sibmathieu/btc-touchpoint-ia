  "text": "all righthi everyone i'm sergey kotler from thetrifleandwe've seen the slides i'm going to dosome real talk but first i just want tosay i'm just so incredibly happyto to be here and uhfinally made it to palerni palace andto celebratepeace a daywithall of you guysand and celebrating is a key word hereyeah it's important and i think it's animportant aspectof our community that we celebrate itright even though one can make a veryvery decent argument thatas a financial investment by paying 10000 btc for two pizzas uh maybe not thesmartest but i think that everybody herei hopeknows and feels thatlast law is okaywe don't need to run a gofundme for himyou know it wasn't his last bitcoinsumbut also because pizza dayand that event uh in in history uh youknow it embodies the sort of the unitythe yin yang of it all you know that hedid use bitcoin as a medium of exchangewhich was part uh of establishingbitcoin as a storeholder value rightwhich in turn makes it useful as amedium exchange and these things gotogether you can't have one without theother it's completely unthinkable anddiscussing it doesn't make senseyeah because you need both you know andanda lot of this stuffeverything that we discuss uh stillin the in the community and all of thatwas already discussed uh you know in insatoshi's email newannouncement post or in the earlybitcoin talk post and so on there's notthat much new in on under the sunand by the way if you've read booksabout bitcoin but you haven't read allof the writings from satoshi then youhave homework to doi'm just saying yeah but you know thisclassic quote of like imagine a basemetal that is a scarce is goldbut kind of useless for everything elsebut has this one magical property thatcan be transported over a communicationschannel right that part is veryimportantother than that it's just uselessand if it somehow acquired any value atall then it would be useful because youcould buy it here and sell it there youcan send it over the internet and itwould be a great thingmaybeit could acquire its first valuecircularly right so this is like 2010 hesets up speculation you knowmaybe maybe it might just make sense toget some in case it catches onrightand and so everything that we see todaywe saw already then yeah in inin all of these thingsum but i think that this duality is uhuhis important right because uh at the endof the daywhatever visionthat you have for bitcoin or for cryptoor whatever you know there's a lot ofdifferent views but none of it worksunless bitcoins are freedom money andfor bitcoin to be freedom money it needsto circulate freely right and this iswhat whywhy i do uh what i do um andi think it's importantthis aspect toto highlightsoin this talk i'm going to you know openuh our metaphorical kimino quite a biti'm going to share uh some stats somethat we haven't shared beforeum and i'm going toto share some learnings that we've hadover seven years of building bit refilland and the purpose of this i'mi think primarily talking to the peoplein the space that are building things umbecause i think it's importantto you knowif you can learn these things fasterthan we did and to understand thesethings it'll be better yeah andit's always no matter what the truth isit's always better to know yeahthe reality umthan to not knowand somy my commitment to this talk is uh lotsof transparency openness uh also to notbe misleading with stats which is easyto do i promise not to do thatmy askfrom the audienceis that you listen to me as a friendwho is talkingand that you listen to the main messagesi i'm sure there's going to be a word ortwo that you can cut out of context andflame me on twitter but let's discussthe main messages because i think thisis importantokaysilence is acceptance rightall rightso who who the hell am i i'm i runmario already introduced i run the a bitrefillmaybe quick raise of hands how manypeople here know what bit refill is justalready all right mostand how many have bought something onboth refillall right there we gonumber this it's pretty goodso yeah bit between philis on a quest to make bitcoin freedommoney to build a circular economy andfor that you need to be able to tobuy stuff because honest to god likewhat kind of internet money is thatwe're building here if you can't buy with it yeah i think and sorefill uh let's uh you know pay yourbills refill your prepaid phones uh butthe bread and butter of it is that wesell gift cards uh forfor e-commerce or for actual commerce umwe do this uh all over the world we'veumnow we have a couple of products in inczech republic we have mao cz anduh alsasome stuff like thatumanywaysand soyes we've been doing this for sevenyears um i think to my knowledge we arethe number one largestservice that people useuh to buy things in the real world withcrypto umi don't know maybe maybe someone willcall me out on this but i actually thinkit's the casesofirst stat is thatum in the last month bit refillprocessed 186000 cryptocurrency purchaseson our websitenowand this is a this is a typical monthit's not misleading somehow or whateverright and i mean it's you know it's kindof a high number it's not the highestbut like to give you a reference i thinkum bitchpay has a network of 200 000merchants they have twitch and microsoftand shopifyand that entire network does 70 000transactions per monthumso so it's something at least yeah thisis sort of why you should listen to meumwe'reahead of some let's say anywayum let's time to to talk some uh aboutsome uh some real stats because i thinkthat'sumthat's where uh interesting things willhappen the first stat is like oh dopeople play with bitcoin or with othercryptos or whatever so here's thebreakdown umby payment methods on bit refills yeahso you see that on-chain bitcoin isstill going strong at number one yeahbut now down at 31right followed by ethereum at 23 percentand then you have tether and tron uhbinance pay tether and ethereumlitecoin and then we have lightning yeahjust behind uh litecoin but at aroundfive percentand so some people sometimes say like ishould count by transactions becauseyeah we can do that but that would alsobe misleading because you know one userwould can go in with lightning and makeyou know a one dollar purchase for afree fire game and then another and thenanother and then another whereas uhanother guy will go in and make onepurchase for 20 in free fire tokens andis that reallyyou knowis the former really worth 20 times morei don't know i think it's misleading umbut we can also count by unique usersmaybe that's a moreif you want to count heads and not eurosuh we can count heads and then it lookslike this um the launch and bitcoin isnow up at 40ethereum's down at 15so understanding is that ethereum userswell if you're paying 20 50 whateverbucks for a transaction you're going tomake bigger transactions yeah right umand you see that tethering ethereum goesall the way down and lightning goes up alittle bit and actually passes likelitecoin ininin this modelbut so the question here iswhy not more lightningright i meanfrom my standpoint i've been a bigbeliever a bit refill has been a bigbeliever in lightning from the start wewere you know the the first to roll outuh uh maintenance support for payingwith lightning we had the firstreal world purchase with lightning we'vealways tried to do all of the lateststuff umbut unreasonably bigon lightning and i mean if you'd askedme four years ago where we'll be withlightning in four years i would havesaid well in four years it's going to be90 lightning right that would have beenif you asked past sergey yeah but wedon't observe this yeah right and so ifif the world the observations of theworld don't matchum your your internal expectations thatyou kind of have to evaluate um andassess to saywhat's whathere andthere's been a lot of thinking aboutthis stuff and a lot of digging and i'mgoing to walk you through this stuffyeah because i think thatlightning has a marketing problemand in fact it's not lightning specificit's transactional bitcoin as a wholeright i meanuhlightning has a problem liquid has iteven worse um there's a lot of thesethings in the in the transactionalbitcoin space that are you knownot taking off as big as i think theydeserve toand andthe key word here is marketing problemright so a lot of us here are techiesand nerds and we see things from thatperspective and we always expectthere to be a technical problem that wecan solve by building with codeand those of us who were around in 2017with all of the block size wars anddiscussions um you know how lightningcame to be from from that politicalenvironment and all of that and so atthat time there was a scaling problem itwas a technical problembut now we don'tright because the blocks are empty onbitcointhis many people use use lightning evenfewer use bitcoin cash yeah and so on sothere is uhthere is amarketing problem here and and this iswhat i what i want to to address yeahright because again none of thisworks unless the coins circulate freelynow and so i'd like to introduce a modelto to understand the world here and thatis to split up bitcoin uh the movementand the community and then the bitcointhe tool the thing that you use right souma tool is something that uhit's easier if you think about somethingelse think of a tool that you use uhlet's say bittorrentrightsolike i might use bittorrent to downloadthelinux distro or something like thatthere's very legal umbut i don't belong to the bittorrentcommunity i don't hang out on bittorrenttwitter i would not dream of going to aconference to talk about bittorrentright probably the same for youand when iif i need to install bittorrent i willtype in bittorrent client mac on googleand i will get one of the top onesthat looks legit enough right and iwouldn't care so much is it the best onei wouldn't care so much about what thetechnical discussions in the bitcoinbittorrent community are uhthe politics which i'm sure there is butthat's irrelevant to me because i'mpretty sure that number one is going tobe good enough to get the job done andthat's all i need right so it's a toolwhereas the movement is what makes usall spend our livesenergygoing to conferences uh discussingflaming people and so onso if we dig deeper in into this uh andagain you can be a member of one or twoor both right and i i'm not valuejudging here yeahrightbitcoin is for freedom so you can dowhatever the you want with it andwe shouldn't moralize or kill peopleinto doing anything elseit's very important but like if you lookat bitcoin the tool so we're at uh atthe parallel police the the home of theeuropean cypher park movement i thinkmaybe even globalyou know and so that the tool is whereyou have all of the the cypherpunkystuff uh you know do the transactionsthat they don't want you to doright i mean the dissidents you knowthey they don'tcare about bitcoin the same way that wedo they use bitcoin to raise money theycare about their dissidentbusiness for the societal change rightthat is their their movement bitcoin isjust a tool for them right and that'salso where privacyi think belongs right because if youdon't make transactions with bitcoin youdon't particularly careabout privacy aspects there's there'shuddle on both sides right there'speople that huddle because it's acommunity value to huddle but there'salso a lot of people that just you knowbought some bitcoin they think it'sgoing to go up they don't particularlycare about it it's a it's a speculativevehicle and a tool for them righton the tool side is where we see the useof wallets and here we see the theemergence of the yeah the circulareconomy and so on andbut at the same time if we look at theat the movement at the communityyou know it's a community incurrently we're in a phase where it'svery like this is how you should livelife you know you should have low timepreference you should not eatcarbs and seed oils and all of thatstuff right and there's like a long listof things that you should and should notdo you should stack sats you shouldcustody your own keys ideally in offlineideally in the multisig of severaloffline wallets and so on you should runa full node it's really greatum and you should umsort ofnot worry so much because one dayif we just drive drive it up uh theprice up then the magical uh hyper bitcolonization will happen which is a youknow an apocalyptic type scenario whereeverything will be bad for everybodyexcept for us and we're going to be inthe citadelsandit's very messianic right from like it'sarmageddon anyway that's not where whatwhere i'm going with this but also likean important tenant ofuh of the communities that you shouldn't coins rightdon't in any way uh and there's goodreasons for this historically coins have been uhfraudulent and scammy and people havelost money and all that we know thisstuff right so it's there for a goodreason but one thing that we noticeis kind of absent i thinkin large parts of the movement side isis actually you know making transactionsyou knowand that's not reallyi think surprising becauseit's not it's very consistent to be abitcoiner to believe in bitcoin and thevision of bitcoin the values to thecommunity not necessarily have a needfor for the tool itself you know and sothere's a lot of people in the in in thebitcoin movement that do all of thesethings and they're in compliance withall of the values but they you knowthey're just you know it isnot using it and that's fine right againwe're all here everyone who's here ishere for the movementwe have to be very clear about thisright people don't travel to aconference about at allumso i'm not sort ofwrecking down on uh on the moment i'mjust describing it but so this thingwhere you know there's all of thesevalues and things that you should do andyou shouldn't uhyou should like stats and you shouldn'tuh um yeah you shouldn't use you youshould coins and in the end that leadsto things like this yeah where last yearsome guy announced a bitcoin pizzaservice uh which uhuhyou couldn't buy with bitcoin uh andthis was in compliance uh with the withthe values of the community becausethere were no coins on that sideright only fiat yeah and uhand fiat is currently i you know notreally seen as a coin or whateverum butmy point is is that wewe see things like this and this is apart of uh uhof of the community but itdoesn't use the tool right so you can bea member ofuh the the community the movementwithout using the tool and vice versaright so if you look at this it's alittle bit like a venn diagram rightthere's there's people that use bitcoinas a toolthere is people thatuse you know like yeah it's such astrong word like use and love like ifyou think about in the romantic sense itconveys the message very clearly whatthe difference is um rightand there are people there in in themovement yeah and um and again uh all ofus here are uhhere because of uhof the moment actually i actually thinkthat like this particular event is inthe cross section which is why i'm so uhso excited about thisumbut it's very importantto be mindful of this that there area bunch of people that are in themovement that are actually notdon't have a need for the tooland that's fine they're great peoplethey're our friendswe are i am in to a large extent in thatcategory myselfthere's also a whole bunch of peoplethat use bitcoin as a tooland don't give a about our movementa lot of them right and as it should bei think yeah right we're building auseful tool for the world and so there'sgoing to be a lot of people that use itand don't particularly care about any ofthe stuff that we're discussing hereright but but again you need to bemindful of selection bias here becauseif you look around here you're not goingto see anyone from the just the toolcamp because they don't come toconferencesthey also don't hang out on bitcointwitter for obvious reasonsright yeah so there is like an unknowngroupof uh and the majority of people thatuse bitcoin as a tool do not care aboutthe movement they just use it as a tooland a large part of the bitcoin movementdoes not necessarily need and care aboutusing it as a tool and and this isimportant just keep in mind thisdistinction um and uhand be aware of observation bias yeahthat's you know same as with the theworld war ii planes that came backyou know if you only look at where theplanes got shot you get the wrongimpression because you only see theplanes that actually made it back so youdon't see the planes that actuallydidn't make it back in the points ofthis this little slideall right everyone alonguh let's let's go for some more statsand i think this is where it's going toget uh a little bit interesting soi'm bitter phil uh we built this thingcalled the wallet selector in thecheckout experience it's an optionalfeature around 40 of our users use itand the way that it works is that youyou select from a list which which brandof wallet you use and then we adapt thepayment experience so if your wallet ishas certain bugs we adjust for that umweyou know we use pc1 addresses for thosewho can't support those but we use oldstyle addresses for those who don't andthere's like a lot of little thingsright it allows us to to roll out themost uh most recent and cool stuff butalso be supportive of the people thatstill work with with the old stuff umand again around 40 it's not mandatoryand most people don't use it but around40 percent use it and and sowe we trackwhat they choose because it'sinteresting and you're going to see inthe next couple of slides is thatknowing which wallet somebody uses tellsyou quite a lotabout this person and how they use thisstuff um it doesn't tell you their theirage or gender but it tells you many muchmore interesting things than that rightso let's look at some stats uh from uhfrom bit rifles wallet selector andlet's look at bitcoin users andlightning and unchain uh together thebiggest one is achieve a wallet uhi i hit the others because i want us toplay a game the chiva wallet is thegovernment wallet in el salvador umwe're doing a big effort in el salvadorso there's there's a lot ofusers that use it also it has a bit ofbugsand thepart of the bias of this particularexercise is that wallets that have manybugs are more likely to be selected inthe wallet selector so battery phil canadjust for the bugs right but anywaythere's a lot of people that use it shipwalletlet's leave that for here and now i wantus to play a game you can see there'sthe big orange bar and the big uhwhat do we call a color[Music]light bluebar and i want us to play a game and theway that we do is that you shout if youhave an idea ofuh of uhwhat one of these two are and then wevote and then we see how we're doing sojust shout what do you think these twobig ones arebitcoin dall righthuhblue walletblockchain.comphoenixcoinbase what did you sayshieldbox wallet interesting yeahtrust walletoh man a lot of different optionsyeah okay so i guess let's go throughthem how many think there is blue walletall right how many things it's uhbitcoin dor bitcoin corenot even sure um how many thingsschildbachall rightuh which ones the else did i forget howmany thing is blockchain.comhow manythinkwhat else did i forget nowcoinbase how many think coinbaseall right all right right okayyou actually did much worse than iexpected umyeah i i expected you guys to get theblockchain wallet umit's uh it's been around since alwaysand it's still uh but it's not thenumber one anymore yeah it's not whatnumber two bitcoin was umnobodyeven guessed what the biggest bitcoinwallet is isn't that weirdbitcoin nofinance wallet of satoshi good guessesbut no breeze phoenix no nomoon i mean we already established thatlightning wallets are less than sevenpercent so maybe you should not guessthosebread wallet noit's interesting huhfinance we already guessed it uh weactually have a finance pay option sothey go there so we don't see binance somuch here yeahit's a decent guesswe have a winnersothe the largest bitcoin wallet outsideof el salvador is exodusum it recently passed blockchain.com forthe biggest one and here you can see theother top 10 20 uh whichever then yousee the blue wallet and moon andactually bitcoin is up there as well uhtrust wallets and all these things andactually like i'm very surprised thatelectrum is uhis like chugging away is a solid 10percent or whatever and it's been likethat since forever and still is likethat and try it and test it so shout outtothomas in the election squadokay and so what if we remove lightningfrom this and we look atbecause the question is who theuses unchained bitcoin these days righti mean half of the guesses here were forlightning wallets well let's look aton-chain bitcoin yeah well then you seeexodus and blockchains the trust walletcoinbase electrumbitpay wallet bitcoin core ledger trezorand so onand i want us to do another interactiveexercise so i want everybody to bringout their phoneand i want you to do this thing with mewhere you open the app store or thegoogle play storeand you'll be surprised how manyprominent products people in the bitcoinspace have not done this very basicexercise you search in the app store orthe google play store for the phrasebitcoin walletand you you're going to have differentresults from different countries anddifferent situations different ai blahblah blah but like scroll around there alittle bitbecause if you remember we talked aboutbitcoin the tool right and the way thati would install bittorrent would be tojust google bittorrent to just get oneof the top onesthis is what people getand it's not like you know the evil aisof apple and google are misleadingcustomers no they they run data on whichones people install and use and theygive them the most used oneswe goodso i think that based on that we need toadd another point yeah to bitcoin thetool yeah that peopledo with a bitcoin at all and that is coinsbecause really all of the top bitcoinwallets are coin wallets right andit kind of does make sense thatyou know well i mean it is in some waysthe killer app of the spacethat the speculation has been theresince uh 2010 uh and people will uhuse bitcoin wallets and they will alsouse bitcoins andthat is life for them also stable coinsrightand so speaking of bitcoins i justwanted to do a very quick detour to tolook at our friends at the differentconference and look at what this stufflooks like in the ethereum world yeahi'm not going to go deep into this butlike yeah so if you look at ethereum thetool in the moment they're actually alittle bit closer together right i meanyou have in in the tool you know thatthey they have securityit's not the same definition of securityand they accept a lesser level ofsecurity but there is some securityright and ethereums are upset aboutsolana because it has too littlesecurity and so on it does have certainprivacy it's not on chain privacybecause it reuses addresses and all ofthat but you know what you can uh youknow use different dexes and and d5things and so on to actually cover yourtracks uh pretty well there's also a lotof dexes that don't require you to usekyc so there's a large amountlarge use ofof kyc free things umthe d5 thing the main activity is todefy thingsright smart contracts and yield and thatrequires you to use a wallet right soethereum users use wallets quite a lotmore than uh than in the bitcoin worldright and they also have the you knownumber go up or where they call it we'reall gonna make it um and they also havea in a different way from bitcoinanti-scam uh idea they have a differentdefinition of what a scam is and adifferent threshold but there isdefinitely uh some of that in in thatcommunity as well um and and so if wethe previous tasks that i showed werefor bitcoin now let's look at crypto asa whole uh for the wallet selector andbit truthful and suddenly a new winneremergesumthe largest crypto wallet in the worldis metamaskit doesn't even support bitcointhere'sand this is by users if you count byeuros it's going to be even bigger rightbecause they make bigger transactionsbecause it's expensiveumbut i think this is like it's importantto beaware of this dynamic i meanwe're at petrified we're very bitcoinbiased we speak at bitcoin conferencesmainly yeah we believe in this thing sothis is uh unexpected as an outcomelet's sayand so the conclusion that i draw fromall of this is that you know we livelike in a galaxy that circles around theblack holeand i call that that called the casinoand it's like a collective name foreverything speculation related right andfrankly even just plain buy and holdbitcoin it is a speculative activityright uh the way that satoshi describedit it mightit might make sense to get some in caseit catches on we're speculating on thefact that bitcoin will become the moneyof the future and because of that it wasgoing to go up in value and that's alsospeculative so we're all kind of like inthis universe of circles around and thecasino but there's also other thingsthat are even more casinoyou getthis so let's get let's go back to tolightning for a second and and so let'ssee from the movement and the tool howpeople actually talk about lighting andwhat things that they typically sayright so people they use bitcoin as atool they'll be like oh lighting isgreat it's fast and cheap and thenthey're gonna be like okay how do i getmy paycheck how do i get my salary onlightning yeah and then the nextquestion is like okay but how can i lockmymy value into usd because my it's mysalary and i actually don't want tospeculate with it i want to pay my billsnext month as welland then the next question is like okaybut how do i coins with itrightbut an interesting thing is that if youlook at bitcoin the movementand in the community people are superexcited about lightning right we havelightning emojis in our in our twitterhandles lighting is the future it'sgoing to make coins obsolete andthere's certain things that you shoulddo to express your support of lightningyou should run a node and support thenetwork i still don't really know whatthat means but whateverand you should you know i earn yieldon my uhon my bitcoins with lightning because ii do routing of transactions and i'mvery concerned about liquidity and thesethings that i'm talking aboutbut there's not so muchtalk about actuallyyou know buyingyeahand that's interesting right becauselighting is this it's a politicalinvention in a lot of ways it's alsotechnical invention but there's a lot ofpeople that feel love we go back to thislove and use there's a lot of peoplethat lovelightning that don't necessarily uselightning and and and there is a certaini even would call it like a teenage sextype of thingwhereeverybody is talking about lightningandeverybody thinks that everybody else isusing it all the timei'm not but i'm going to keep a downloadon that right but i've done it a coupleof times you knowright but there is such a dynamic rightand and sothat that brings us to like themarketing problem and also what theproblem is with this whole bitcoin onlymovement and that it that has beengrowing lately which comes from a verygood place of good values you shouldn'tdo coins because it's bad and allof that which i would 100 agree with butbut in the end um it ends up limitingthe marketingto the people that are in theintersectionuh of the movementright but you don't get users of thepeople who are you in the movement butdon't use the toolbut you also don't get the people thatuse the tool but are not interested inthe movement right because they want tobuy coinsand do all of the other things i'm i'mexaggerating a little bitand so what happens is thatyou know we have this universe thisgalaxy that spins around the casino andthen there's this little lightning isspecific lightning only bitcoin onlycircular economy that is trying to buildits own little galaxy outside of thatand it doesn't interactwith the big oneand it's actually like my this is notproportion in proportion the lightingone is much much smaller you can be sureof thatumnowi'm not sayingwhat should be doneright that is up to everyone to assessand make choices and there's a very goodargument uh for building uh the theparallel uhgalaxy herei think it's important to be aware ofthis so that you can make this choice ina competent way uh knowing uh what iswhatbecause the casino has a lot ofstrengths and i think we need to behonest about it you know it has accessto almost infinite capital from tradingrevenues and venture and all of thatstuff right and so as a resultthe casinos become the on-ramps rightthey they they build the umthe on-ramps and and so in the end imean like the best example was a whileago the the navalny campaign in russiathey had a donate with crypto and theyhad two options the one first one wasdonate with bitcoin i had a one addressand the second one was donate withbinance smart chainand then they had a ref link to binancebecause that's the best on-ramp forrussiansand that wasyou know again they use it as a toolthey're not here for the movement rightso they don't care about any of ourstuff they just want to get money uh fortheir stuffand then that exercise actually endedbadly because the binance is kyc andthey ended up giving out the kycinformation you know and they ended upgiving away the information to therussian government and people got introuble but that's more of a problemwith binance the exchange uh not as muchwith finance smart chain and it stillkind of likeexpresses all of this trouble anywayand the casino also brings us animportant thing i think which is stablecoins which we've seen thatit's in high demand for people who liveon bitcointheyumwant their value to not go up and downso much in many cases and we see thegrowth of tether but also stable valuethings like uhlike strike and and that type ofcustodial stable value services and soon and then the casino has you knownumber go up i mean the casino has amuch better number graphand the yield stuff else has butwhatever okay enough about thismy point is that it's important to knowyour customer personaright and so for bit refillwe see the world like this uh our ourcustomers are those who use bitcoin as atooland people who are in the movement areour friendsright so you buy your friends beersand you show google ads to the customersso that they can find out that yourthing exists because they don't come toconferencesand others can have other choices hereyeah right yeah but againit's important to be mindful of what isyour friends and uh what is yourcustomers and they can be different inour case it's very different it's alwaysuh amazed me how on bit refill i canlike post uh like hey we're looking fora translator for georgian language andyou know within 10 minutes we get fivestrong leads but yeah if i'd be like heywe have some gift cards you can buy ingeorgia and i saidsilent therebecause our our we're part of themovement and so our friends are in themovement umbut a lot of them are are not interestedin buying stuff and that's fine weshouldn't guilt themsobased on thisthere is a i don't know how many arefamiliar with thismodel it's like a user experiencetype tool to find out like what is therealuh what is the real job to be done likewhat is the the customer trying toachieve really really really right andyou need to interview them a lot and askfollow-up questions and maybe even getthem drunk and so they actually exposewith a real real job to be done this andit's very important and again i'mtalking here for people who are buildingin the space it's very important that ifyou're building a tool or a company or aservice or whatever it's very importantwhat is the real job to be done hererightand and you can build things by the wayuhyou don't have to havethis uhthis type of attitude there's a lot ofcompanies that build things for themovementright there's a lot of companies wherethe customers are members of themovementyeahand they build things for them and itactually helps in a lot of ways becauseyou get a nice push twitter gets behindyou and you you very quickly you knowmanage to to convert a large part of themovement into your customers and thenyou kind of like okay yeah that is thetotal uh total addressable market andtwo people will never find out aboutyour thingthe biggest thing i think again i'vebeen on this point a lot of timesit needs to be excitingwecan't moralize i know that our communityis very like you should do this youshould do that and blah blah i thinkthat's wrong yeah i think that in theend if we're going to getbillions of peopleusing the stuffusingi don't think we need to get all ofthose billions to care so much that theywould travel to come to conferencesi thinkthat and for a lot of people they haveother options there are some people thatare like by either by choice uh orbecause they have another other no otheroption yeah but there's also a lot ofpeople that you knowthey can use bitcoin but they can alsouse other things rightand and so for those people i actually idon't believe in moralizing i think thatwe need to make it excitingright and i don't know if you've watchedthe bit refill on the internet latelywe've been doing a lot of stunts andlike new brand and all of thatpoint is that we want to make it into alifestyle brand into a statement thatyou know heyi'm the kind of person thatum thatlives some bitcoin and this is somethingthat i do and that's pretty cool andexcitingit's not something that i do because ifeel like i should support the communityno it did this for me because it's cooland iyou know just give you a reference againyou remember i bragged about uh lessthan 200 000 transactions per month butlike like just coinbase alone has almost100 million verifiedwith identity customers and their publiccompany now so i think they can't lieabout this anymore umright and so like okay all of ourmetrics the some people clapped it yeahlike but it's still like twotransactions per month per thousand uhof coinbase uh verified customers rightso there's a pretty big opportunity hereand i think that maybewe should look at all of these peoplethat have tried a little bit of bitcoina little bit of crypto a little bit ofwhatever and see okay how do we get themuh into into the circular economy how dowe get them into using the toolsthat we are building but also how do webuild tools that are useful for themspecificallyand i mean if we if we grow those kindsof metricsi mean we'reif all of those become part of thecircular economy we're in a good trackfor the cypherpunk dreambut but that's not easy yeah it's not aneasy task and and the reason why i'm i'msharing all of this is because we can'tdo this alone uh we need other people toto also build these things andthe dream is is a world whereyou know we see bitcoin companies uhdoing big billboard ads on the streetsin a world where it actuallymakes sense and that's the world that uhi want us to get toso i'm gonna end there uhinthe mandatory uh glory to ukraine and toall of the bitcoiners that are literallyfighting
