  "text": "Hey, everyone.Welcome to the show.I’m here with Jason Lowery.Jason, this is long overdue.This discussion is long overdue.I’m really excited to have this with you,\nso welcome to the show.Jason Lowery (00:01:53):Thanks, Preston.I’ve been a low-key fan boy of yours for\na while.So very excited to be here.Preston Pysh (00:01:58):I’m honored.I’m honored.Hey, so I want to start off this conversation\nwith this idea of property rights.So Jeff Booth is really big on first principles.Let’s start with the first principles thinking\non all of this, and you had made this recommendationto me when we were talking about how to go\nabout the show.I think it’s a great idea about property\nrights and how they first emerged, and thenI guess we’ll just take it from there after\nyou take that away.Jason Lowery (00:02:26):Okay.Cool.Yeah.So property rights, how they first emerged,\nhow sapiens first started managing their internalresources, determining who has control authority\nover those resources, determining how to settledisputes related to property rights, and also\nachieving consensus on the legitimate stateof ownership and chain of custody of property.So at some point in the time scale of human\nbeings, we started experimenting with differentprotocols for doing that, but where we came\nfrom was effectively a proof of power protocol.Jason Lowery (00:03:05):So before sapiens and even before primates,\nmost animals, especially pack animals, whenthey just took down a kill and they have excess\nmeat, it is an existential imperative forthose pack animals to manage those resources,\nto determine who has the pecking order, essentiallylike, “How do you divvy those up?Whose property does this belong to?”So it’s important to realize that this is\nan existentially important question.Jason Lowery (00:03:33):The way natural selection has optimized itself\nis what you see in surviving animals today,which is for the overwhelming majority of\ncases, when pack animals have property todistribute amongst the pack, they feed and\nthey breed the most powerful members of thepack.So the powerful, the power projectors, power\nas in watts, as in joules per second, literallythe strongest members of the pack get first\ndips, and then if they have property disputeslike a group of wolves, like a pack of wolves,\nthey settle those disputes through physicalpower competition.So they snarl and bite at each other, and\nthey’re constantly doing this.So they’re constantly snarling and biting\nat each other and establishing the state ofownership and chain of custody of their property\nusing this proof of power protocol, you couldcall it.Jason Lowery (00:04:26):The reason why they appear to have done that\nis because of, like I said before, naturalselection.So something that a lot of people forget when\nthey’re evaluating or studying nature issomething called survivorship bias, where\nthey forget that what you observe in natureis what has survived a very rigorous selection\nprocess.So the reason why you see so many pack animals\nuse this proof of power protocol for establishingconsensus on the legitimate state of ownership\nand chain of custody property within theirpacks is because all the other animal packs\nthat used other techniques didn’t survive.Jason Lowery (00:05:06):So right away, you already see that this proof\nof power protocol where people settle disputeswith power competitions and achieve consensus\non the legitimate state of ownership and chainof custody of property, and determine resource\ncontrol over it using physical power, thatis the protocol that has survived natural\nselection.That’s why you see it in nature.So that’s just something too that’s worth\nnoting because humans, sapiens, for whateverreason after we transitioned from the upper\nPaleolithic era into the Neolithic era, inthe beginning, there wasn’t really much\nof a sign.There isn’t really much of a sign in the\nhuman fossil record throughout the Paleolithicage of any meaningful scale like killing of\nhumans, human on human killing.There’s not really much on in the fossil\nrecord.Jason Lowery (00:05:54):In the Neolithic age, we adopted new types\nof protocols for establishing consensus onthe legitimate state of ownership and chain\nof custody of our internal resources, andthen after we established these new protocols,\nyou start to see signs of massive scale warfare.So this is really important to pull the thread\non from both an anthropology perspective,but also the core.Really, what it comes down to when we talk\nabout Bitcoin is really just a philosophyabout how do you determine the basis for which\nyou establish resource control authority anddeter, have consensus on those legitimate\nstate of ownership and chain of custody ofan underlying piece of property.Jason Lowery (00:06:33):So what sapiens started doing is they started\nabstracting.Sapiens have really big neocortexes.They started coming up with imaginary alternatives\nto the proof of power protocol.So what they effectively started doing was\nappointing people with imaginary power.We could call it rank, for example.So in the neolithic age, you started to see\nsigns of rank, and it was really obvious inthe fossil record because of how they bury\npeople of high rank.They bury people of high rank with much more\nliterally gold-plated graves and the greatpyramids and stuff.These are people with such imaginary power\nthat they are … People legitimately believethey’re gods.Jason Lowery (00:07:14):So early in this age, we had god kings.So the god kings got the resource control\nauthority.So they were the ones that determined what\nthe legitimate state of ownership and chainof custody and property was, and if people\nhad disputes on their property rights, thatgod kings would adjudicate those disputes,\nbut at the end of the day, it is all justan abstraction, right?Let’s be real.They probably weren’t actually gods and\nthen there’s no indication that they were.Preston Pysh (00:07:41):I think you see some of this abstraction in\njust … You ever see these videos of maybea smaller dog being the alpha dog and there’s\nother larger dogs there, but the little oneis dry, it’s calling the shots in the house.Is that abstract power?Would you consider that being just because\nthat little guy has convinced the others thatit’s more powerful, even though it’s physically\nnot, it’s very clear that it’s physicallynot, in their mind, the larger dogs are looking\nat and saying, “Yeah, I guess I need tolisten to this little thing that’s yapping\nat me,” or whatever.Jason Lowery (00:08:18):So that is actually a great example for two\nreasons.So the first one is the little yapping dog\nis, in my opinion, doing the physical powerprojection technique.So what a yapping dog is doing is saying,\n“I will impose a physically prohibitivecost on you.I am defending my territory by signaling to\nyou my capacity to impose a severe physicalprohibitive cost.”So it’s a form of deterrence.This is the same thing that we do when we\nblow up, rattling.They’ll get a B-2 bomber fly low pass right\nacross their coast just to remind them orwhen you’re down range, all the shows of\nforce.Preston Pysh (00:08:57):Peacocking.Jason Lowery (00:08:58):Yeah.You’re just letting people know, it’s\nlike, “I have the capacity to impose severephysical prohibitive cost.”Now, the reason why it’s hilarious with\nwhen the little dog does it is because whenthe little dog is yapping at the bigger dog,\nthe bigger dog has been domesticated.They’re both domesticated.So those dogs have been their wolves, extremely\naggressive wolves that over 40,000 years havehad their physical aggression and their inclination\nto be physically aggressive, essentially bredout of them.So domestication is the process of humans\ndeliberately removing a animal pack’s inclinationto impose physically prohibitive costs, making\nthem docile.Jason Lowery (00:09:41):The reason why that’s a such great example\nis because that gives us what is essentiallywhat we need to causally infer that the relationship\nbetween when you stop projecting power, whenyou forfeit your power and you stop trying\nto secure yourself by imposing physicallyprohibitive costs on your attackers, there’s\nthis direct causal effect of you become lesssecure.Jason Lowery (00:10:04):So for example, a lot of people will say,\n“Well, correlation doesn’t necessarilyimply causation,” but if you have randomized\nAB testing across 40 different domesticatedanimals and in every case when you remove\ntheir physical aggression, when you removetheir capacity and inclination to impose severe\nphysical prohibitive costs on their attackers,they do become demonstrably insecure.We have the data to do the causal inference\noff that because we eat it for breakfast andfor lunch and for dinner or we cuddle with\nit like we do with our dogs.Jason Lowery (00:10:37):So domestication is proof that if you do a\ndifferent protocol than the proof of powerprotocol, then you risk systemic exploitation\nbecause that is what domestication represents,fundamentally, is the systemic exploitation,\nand it’s randomized.It’s like a natural experiment because we\nnever actually-Preston Pysh (00:10:55):Because nothing … You’d never see that\nin nature.Jason Lowery (00:10:56):Right.Yeah.So I always joke because I love wiener dogs\nand I love Italian greyhounds and whippets,but I always joke, “Those are abominations\nof nature.We literally bred these creatures to worship\nof us.They would never survive in the Siberian wilderness,”\nand if that yappy little dog ever acted thatway to Siberian wolves, it wouldn’t turn\nout the way.So they only get away with that because they’re\nall domesticated animals.It’s the same reason why.That is essentially the foundation of modern\nagrarian society is our ability to make animalsless physically aggressive, less inclined\nto impose physical power, to impose costson us, and then as a result of that, we can\ntake advantage of them.Preston Pysh (00:11:43):I’m not trying to jump ahead, but I guess\nwe got our example of proof of stake rightthere.Jason Lowery (00:11:48):Well, so what we have shown using a causally\ninferable randomized dataset is that thereare dramatic strategic security implications\nfor choosing not to project power becausewhen we do it to animals, look what happens.We turn orcs into ox and then they become\npack animals and they become slaves and theygrow our grain to feed the other slaves that\nwe’ve domesticated, slave being the domesticatedcandid animals.Jason Lowery (00:12:18):You turn boars into pigs, you turn jungle\nfowl into chicken.So the difference between a boar and a pig\nis the pig doesn’t put up a fight.So that gets to be a major issue when we get\nto agrarian society because of abstract thinking.Abstract thinking enables theology, philosophy,\nenables ideologies, and it became consideredmorally reprehensible to use physical power\nas the basis for which you settle propertydisputes or determine resource control authority\nor chief consensus on the legitimate stateof ownership and chain of custody of property,\nand it was essentially morally condemned fortwo reasons.Jason Lowery (00:13:02):The first one being because of the energy\nthat it uses.It’s very energy-intensive to establish\na pecking order using physical power.Just watch a pack of wolves.It looks exhausting.They’re constantly fighting against each\nother.Then of course, obviously, if you use physical\npower as the basis to do this, then you riskphysical injury if you’re doing it kinetically.So if you’re imposing physically prohibitive\ncosts kinetically using force to displacemass, then obviously, you’re going to have\naccidents.I say accidents because a lot of pack animals\nhave natural instincts to basically pull theirpunches to effectively not injure each other.Jason Lowery (00:13:43):So they have to figure out a way to use power\nas the basis to achieve consensus on the legitimatestate of ownership of property, but they have\nnatural instincts which prevent them fromobviously killing each other because that’s\nan obvious existential threat.If wolves fought each other to the death over\nevery stake, there would be no pack anymorebecause all the wolves would die, and humans\nhave the same, and most, a lot of primateshave the same natural instinct.Jason Lowery (00:14:06):So lieutenant colonel, I think his name’s\nGrossman, Army psychologist and a bunch ofother psychologists, they’ve led multiple\nstudies to show and basically quantify theaversion that humans have to injuring other\nhumans.The famous example that I always use that\nI got from Lieutenant Colonel Grossman wasthe example of Gettysburg, where when they\ntook the rifles off the soldiers that werekilled in Gettysburg, and 80% of those rifles\nhad never been fired, and several of thoserifles had been double and triple stuffed\nwith ball and powder.So it was implying that these soldiers that\nhad died were not firing their shots and werein fact faking full fire and reload sequences\nduring the battle.Jason Lowery (00:14:55):That’s how powerful the natural instinct\nis to not impose lethal costs on or not physicallyor lethally injure fellow humans.Then he makes the argument that when you started\nhaving long range weapons and then, of course,airplanes and bombs and stuff like that, you\nbasically stop seeing the person you’rekilling, and that was part of the reason why\nwar fighting became so lethal during the 1900sis because you don’t have that natural instinct\nprohibiting you anymore.Jason Lowery (00:15:20):So anyways, that is all to say that humans\nhave a very strong inclination to not usephysical power as the basis for which they\nsettle disputes, determine who gets to controlthe resources and achieve consensus on the\nlegitimate state of ownership and chain ofcustody of property.So they use an abstract form of power, and\nthis abstract form of power is consideredbetter because it does not use energy.Jason Lowery (00:15:47):It reminds you of proof of stake, right?Also, obviously, it doesn’t cause injury\nbecause it’s abstract, right?You can’t cause injury because it’s not\neven physical.So that was the basis of abstract power hierarchies.The reason why agrarian society adopted these\nabstract power hierarchies where they hadthese people of different ranks, they had\nthe judges, they had the kings, and they hadthe resource control authority, and based\noff of what they say, you get to do all thethings that you need to do to manage resources,\nbut there are, of course, major systemic differenceswhen you do that.Jason Lowery (00:16:22):So we’ve already established that when you\ntake the will to fight out of domesticatedanimals, they become systemically exploitable.That same thing repeated itself when agrarian\nsociety first adopted these abstract powerhierarchies because these god kings essentially\nexploited their populations at egregious scales.Preston Pysh (00:16:41):You still see this today.I mean, look at North Korea.They think Kim Jong-un a god.It’s crazy.Jason Lowery (00:16:48):Yeah, yeah.It’s a trust based system.You have to trust in your god king and the\nbenevolence of your god king effectively becausewhen you create an abstract form of power,\nthey are essentially, in many cases, unimpeachable.They have unimpeachable power now, and you\nhave also technically removed the constraintsof their control authority.So whereas the alpha wolf can only control\nwhat he has the physical power to control,if you change it to abstract power, there\nis technically no limit to what that god kingcan claim power over.So you can expand their abstract power and\nabstract resource control authority at zeromarginal cost.He can just say, “I’m the god, so everything’s\nfine,” and it’s like, “Okay.Well, I guess you’re right.”So if you look at how-Preston Pysh (00:17:41):Jason, real fast.It seems like the physical power would’ve\nbeen bound by geographic region.You can only expand it so far, at least throughout\nhistory, and we can get into the argumentsof where we’re at now with Bitcoin, specifically,\nbut in the past, it seems like you were boundby a range or it was very difficult to extend\nout.Jason Lowery (00:18:04):Yeah.So that’s actually a huge point because\nI’ve made this point before too.Let’s fast forward to today, okay?There’s a bunch of physical resources.The main one that people seem to enjoy is\nthe surface area of the earth, that is a resourcethat sapiens seem to value.So the question is, how should sapiens manage\nresource control authority over the surfacearea of the earth and determine what the “legitimate\nstate of ownership and chain of custody”of the surface area of the earth is?Jason Lowery (00:18:38):So if you take an extraterrestrial point of\nview and you’re an alien and you’re visitingearth and you’re looking at the sapiens\nfrom your extraterrestrial point of view,sapiens are just one single species.So you look at them and then you would note\nto yourself, you would say, “That’s interesting.They don’t have centralized control over\nthe surface area of the earth.For some reason, they decentralize their control\nauthority over the surface area of the earth,and they do it using a massive scale, global,\nphysical power projection.”Jason Lowery (00:19:14):So there’s no one government that has abstract\ncontrol authority over all the resources ofthe earth.In fact, sapiens deliberately prohibit that.How?By imposing a physically prohibitive costs\non gaining single and centralized controlauthority over all of the surface area of\nthe earth.So effectively, that is the proof of work\nprotocol where we are using power, physicalpower, and we have a bunch of different large\nscale physical power competition, and thebenefit of that large scale power competition\non a global scale is decentralization of controlauthority over earth’s natural resources.Preston Pysh (00:19:58):Wow.Jason Lowery (00:19:59):So basically, yes, you’re exactly right.In fact, at scale, because a lot of people\nwill say, “Well, military centralized power,”it’s like, “No.Take a global picture of it.It is precisely the case that no country can\ngain 51% control over all the natural resourcesbecause we’re constantly engaging in this\nphysical power competition,” and anytimeMr. Genghis Khan or Mr. Adolf Hitler or whoever\ntries to achieve centralized control authorityover physical resources, the reason why this\nsystem is secure is because there’s no limitto how much power honest people can sum together\nto make it too physically cost prohibitedto achieve centralized control authority over\nresources.Preston Pysh (00:20:45):The idea just struck a chord on a book that\nI read that I’ve never even talked aboutbefore, but this was a book that in the summary\nat the back of this, it gets into that exactpoint that you just made is the physical cost,\nthat great, and here’s the title of thebook, The Rise and Fall of Great Powers.This is by Paul Kennedy, and that’s one\nof the main things at the end.The summary is that the thing that you see\nthrough each one of these great powers throughouttime is they overextend themselves militarily.It almost always also corresponds with them\ndebasing currency and trying to, a lot ofthe stuff you’re seeing right now playing\nout in the world as far as offsetting someof that and expending and having all this\ngross fiscal spending and the power projectionas they push out to a company that large fiscal\nspending to try to offset the issues thatthey’re having with their currencies.That being the crux of how all these great\nsuperpowers have failed over time.It’s a fascinating read if people want to\ndig into it.What was the one that you just held up, Jason?Jason Lowery (00:21:57):This one’s called The Collapse of Complex\nSocieties.This was recommended to me by Natalie Smolenski\nfrom the Texas Blockchain Council, but it’snot just that.It has multiple different explanations for\nhow complex societies break down, but yeah,that’s a clear trend in history.The opposite is also true.Another clear trend is when people stop keeping\na military or they deliberately impede theirown capacity to project physical power, they\ntend to have Hannibal at their gates reallyquickly.So there’s a balance there, but yeah, it’s\nreally interesting.Preston Pysh (00:22:42):Another point that’s very pertinent to the\nworld today, but anyway-Jason Lowery (00:22:50):Yeah, there’s so many good examples now.I often joke.It’s just like, “I don’t even need to\nwrite this thesis anymore because it’s justplaying out in realtime.”Preston Pysh (00:23:00):It’s crazy.Jason Lowery (00:23:01):By the time it publishes, it’ll just be\nprobably obvious, but I guess what we’restarting to speak about now is the systemic\nbenefits, the systemic trade offs of abstractpower hierarchies as a basis for controlling\nresources and physical power hierarchies.So the big ones that we’ve highlighted is\nwhen you use physical power as the basis forwhich you manage your resources, physical\npower is inclusive.Meaning, every single person can have access\nto physical power.Jason Lowery (00:23:37):You all are always able to swing a fist or\nswing a sword if you ever achieve a statewhere you’re being invaded or you’re being\nexploited by your god king.So it’s a highly inclusive protocol everyone\ncan fight.Physical power is also unbounded.So there is no limit to the amount of … There’s\ntheoretically no limit to the amount of physicalcosts you can impose in watts, especially\nafter humans discovered fire because it usedto be like animals can only project as much\npower as they can summon endogenously offof their own calories that they ingest and\ncan swing through their muscles, but especiallyonce humans found gun powder and these other\npower projection technologies, what that representsis you’re tapping into an exogenous supply\nof power and then using that to impose physicallyprohibitive costs on your attackers or your\nexploiters.Again, power meaning physical watts.Jason Lowery (00:24:31):So that game, this power projection game,\nhas scaled to the point of nuclear weapons.That’s how when we say there’s theoretically\nno limit to the amount of power that honestpeople can summon to defend themselves, that\nhas scaled to the point of we could actuallydestroy the planet at this point.We have that means now.That’s how high this honest people can scale\nthat.Jason Lowery (00:24:55):Another big one, and this is a huge one, when\nwe get into a future conversation about proofof work versus proof of stake is that physical\npower is systemically exogenous.Meaning, it cannot be systemically exploited.Whereas rank people can change their rank\nor people can change the rules so that rankhas more abstract power than not, right?Rank is instantiated by the system itself\nand, therefore, is systemically exploitable,but physical walks is an ontologically different\nphenomenon that exists completely outsideof these abstract power hierarchies that we\nuse to manage resources.So it doesn’t matter.Jason Lowery (00:25:35):This is why all those movie examples where\nthe … It’s like those David-Goliath stories,where it’s like there’s someone of high\nrank, there’s some king, and they’ve gottheir abstract power hierarchy, and they’ve\ngot themselves systemically secured, and it’sjust like you’re just going to get steamrolled\nby these peasants with their sorts becauseyou can’t exploit their power.It’s exogenous to the system that you’re\nthe king of.Then another big one, and you mentioned this\ntoo, but it’s a huge one, is that, obviously,physical power is physically decentralized.So you can actually validate, you actually\nsee physical power, and you can actually validateit.Okay.Compare that to stake.Well, actually, let’s say the bad sides\nagain, though, physical power is energy intensiveand physical power is prone to causing injury.So those are the downsides, but everything\nelse, if physical power was not energy intensiveor if it was highly energy efficient, and\nif physical power had no capacity to causeinjury, say, if it was in an electric form,\nthen it would be a fantastic, it would bea highly systemically secure protocol, and\nit would probably not be condemned as ideologicallybad on any philosophical or theological reasons\nbecause it is so good at preventing systemicexploitation or invasion.Jason Lowery (00:27:02):When you use abstract power, abstract power\nis non-inclusive.So not everyone gets to have a high rank.In fact, usually, there’s one person at\nthe top and they’ve got most of the power,but the point is not everyone can have access\nto it.So it’s non-inclusive and, therefore, not\nfully representative.Jason Lowery (00:27:21):Another problem with abstract power is it’s\nbounded in zero sum.So there is a hard limit.There’s a mathematical limit to how much\nabstract power that honest people can useto represent their interests or do some other\nthings, and that becomes a very big systemicdifference that is important to call out with\nproof of stake, but we’ll wait until weget there.Then another problem with abstract power is,\nobviously, it’s physically impossible tosee it.It’s impossible to validate if it’s decentralized.Like we said before, there’s essentially\nno limit to how far you can scale your abstractpower.Preston Pysh (00:28:02):It only exists in the imagination of the one\nto number of people that are part of saidsystem, correct?Jason Lowery (00:28:11):Yeah.So if they’re unsympathetic to your abstract\npower, then it’s completely useless or ifthey don’t understand your laws because\nthey speak completely different language orif you’ve been geographically separated.Preston Pysh (00:28:23):So for abstract power to work in the interim\nbecause it seems like it’ll always be aninterim way to project power, the trend of\nparticipants always has to be going up insteadof collapsing down.Is that fair?Jason Lowery (00:28:38):Yeah.You expand the scale of your abstract power\nhierarchies by adding more participants.There are some benefits that are worth calling\nout.The benefits of abstract power is it is not\nenergy intensive, so it’s highly efficient.It’s like if you live in a well-functioning,\ntrustworthy society, then it is just fantastic.You can get enormous resource abundance from\nit because people are trustworthy and they’refollowing the rules and they’re sympathetic\nto the rules and the people that you trustas intermediaries and the judges are fair.It works out really well, and it has directly\nled to the enormous amounts of resource abundanceand prosperity that sapiens, agrarian society\nhas experienced.Obviously, it is not capable of causing injury.Jason Lowery (00:29:26):The problem that you just highlighted is it\ntends to break down over time.The root problem, as someone said, with all\nthese abstract power hierarchies is that peoplemust be trusted not to exploit them, not to\nbe unsympathetic to them, not to invade them,and history is filled with examples of breaches\nof that trust.Preston Pysh (00:29:46):So it requires trust.Jason Lowery (00:29:48):So it is a trust-based system, yes.You must trust the people of high rank that\nare appointed over you to not abuse theirrank or you must trust the neighbors that\nare unsympathetic to your laws, the Hannibal’sout there, the Genghis Khans out there to\njust-Jason Lowery (00:30:00):The Hannibals out there, the Genghis Khans\nout there, to just not roll in and take yourstuff.And so, for these reasons, it’s systemically\ninsecure because so long as you have and relyon abstract power, you are technically powerless\nfrom a physical standpoint.You have no capacity to impose severe physically\nprohibitive costs on people who either tryto invade you or try to exploit you.Preston Pysh (00:30:27):Parasites are not allowed into an abstract\npower situation, or it will eventually collapseupon itself.Jason Lowery (00:30:37):But the problem is, if you are a parasite\nor a sociopath or you’re just a guy thatwants a lot of control authority over resources,\nabstract power hierarchies create a nice,beautiful honey pot for you.All you have to do is become a high ranking\nperson.Preston Pysh (00:30:55):They’re incentivized to find it.Jason Lowery (00:30:59):Yeah.It’s like moths to a flame.Preston Pysh (00:31:01):Wow.I’m sorry, but to me that’s a super powerful\nstatement that I have never thought about.Jason Lowery (00:31:09):And also, that’s why you see nepotism in\nabstract power hierarchy over the course ofa growing society.So they will come up with abstract reasons\nto say why these high ranked positions shouldstay in the bloodline.And so I’m the king.I was appointed by [inaudible 00:31:26], there’s\nsome God that says I have a divine right tobe this powerful, abstract powerful.And my son carries my blood and therefore\ncarries my abstract power.They come up with reasons.And over time that becomes very bad because\nthe people at the high positions of abstractpower are literally deformed.They’re inbred freaks.The King Tut Exhibit is here in Boston.King Tut was not a healthy person.These God kings and the kings, there’s so\nmany examples.It’s not meritocratic at all because there’s\nliterally inbreeding just to keep their abstractpower.Jason Lowery (00:32:05):Anyways, yeah.And so it’s like moths to a flame.It is actually way easier to exploit people\nthrough positions of higher rank than it wouldbe if they used physical power as the method\nto do it.And so, this gets back into the case with\nthe wolves or with any form of abstract power,or sorry, physical power projectors in nature.It’s like, yeah, these wolves constantly\nfight over each other, but that alpha is notexploiting their pack like humans can through\ntheir abstract power hierarchies.It is much more of a meritocracy than what\nsapien structures look like, what their abstractpower structures look like for that reason.Jason Lowery (00:32:48):And so this is why I often bring up the example\nof stags or a lot of different herbivoresbecause what’s cool about what they’ve\ndone is they actually evolved a way to continuethe power projection game where they use physical\npower as the basis through which they achieveresource control, authority and determine\nlegitimacy of ownership or chain of custodyof property.But they have designed these weird things\nthat come out of their heads and they’renot horns.So they’re not pointy.They’re all tangled at the end.And so when they butt heads and they fight\neach other, they actually get entangled bydesign to prevent themselves from injuring\neach other.But those same antlers can be used to stab\nenemy predators that are attacking them.Jason Lowery (00:33:36):So they’ve created a way where they can\nuse physical power and they can still havelethal things on their heads to help impose\nphysical costs if they need to defend themselves.But when they use those same devices to achieve\npecking order internally, it minimizes thecapacity for injury.It doesn’t completely eliminate it.Accidents happen, and sometimes their antlers\ninterlock a little bit too much and they die.Preston Pysh (00:33:59):Another one that I find fascinating on the\nproof of work is bees.I find how the queen bee, I guess, goes out\nand then the fastest one is the one that geneticline is passed on.You might know more about it than I do, but\nthat is just fascinating to me.And it’s exactly what you’re getting at\nas far as projecting watts or power in thisphysical power display.Jason Lowery (00:34:28):Honey bees are a fantastic example of strategic\nsecurity because they literally create a honeypot.Security problem, right?It’s honey, everyone wants their honey.Yeah.It’s literally a honey pot security problem.Honey bees have stingers, but those stingers\ndon’t protect the individual honeybee.When a honey bee stings something, they will\nsink that thing so deep in their skin that,because of how it’s designed, the only way\nto get that thing to detach from the personthey sting is to disembowel themselves and\nthen they die.So a stinger on a honeybee is not designed\nto protect the honeybee, it’s not designedfor self-defense.The stinger of a honeybee is designed to inflict\nas much pain as possible on an attacker, toimpose as much physically prohibitive costs\non an attacker for the systemic defense ofthe hive.And they will die in the process of doing\nit.Not to protect themselves, but to protect\nthe hive.And it’s just a great illustration of that\npoint.Jason Lowery (00:35:32):The really easy and simple way to think about\nit is, everything has a benefit to cost ratioof attacking or being attacked.There’s some benefit of attacking someone\nand there’s some cost of attacking someone.And so if you want to be systemically secure,\nyou need the cost of attacking you to be ashigh as possible, and you need to strive to\nkeep it high in order to keep your benefitto cost ratio as low as possible.And you can never know how much is enough\ncost.You don’t know how much ability to impose\nphysically, severe physically prohibitivecosts you need to ensure that you’re ‘secure’.So you just have to be able to ensure that\nyou have that ability and strive to do itas much as possible and kind of manage it.Jason Lowery (00:36:12):When you use abstract power hierarchies and\nyou get enormous amounts of resource abundance,but you don’t have a military to protect\nit.So you have all this freshly irrigated farmland,\nbut you have no soldiers to protect it, yourbenefit to cost ratio is extremely high.The benefit of attacking you is high.The cost of attacking you is low.You’re going to get Sargon the Conqueror\nor Charlemagne or Napoleon or all these othereconomists that have ever lived.They’re going to take advantage of your\nhigh benefit to cost ratio.And this is how it works in nature too.So it’s not like it’s a sapien thing.Preston Pysh (00:36:45):So let’s pause there.So people are hearing about power projection,\nthey’re hearing about physical power projectionversus abstract.I would just generically say the one is proof\nof work, the other one is a proof of stakeidea.And we’re going to cover those in much more\ndetail here.But before we do that, I want to ask you about\nthe basics of computer science and how computerprogramming emerged before we then transition\nthose ideas that we just talked about to proofof stake and proof of work found on protocols.Jason Lowery (00:37:17):Yeah, this is really helpful if you just have\nkind of a quick crash course on computer sciencebecause it’ll make arguments about the difference\nbetween proof of work and proof of stake alot simpler to understand.So at the end of the day, a computer is simply\na general purpose state machine.So it’s a machine where you can change its\nstate.And so back in the day, 2,000 years ago, the\nGreeks had astrolabes, and you could calculatewhere the stars are going to be in the future,\nwhere the heavenly bodies are going to bein the future.And the state machine programmer would change\nits state by pulling a lever or pushing abutton or turning a dial in some cases.So you’re changing the state of this machine.Jason Lowery (00:38:01):And these state machines are named after their\nfunction, not their form.So the main function of a state machine is\nto compute something, to compute the positionof the heavenly bodies in the future or to\ncompute whatever.And so these computers, these state machines,\nhave existed for 2,000 years.But only a little over 150 years ago, I guess\nmaybe a hundred years ago now, 200 years ago,yeah, 200 years, they have been general purpose.So for 2,000 years, state machines were special\npurpose state machines.So if you wanted to compute something, you\nhad to build a dedicated machine to computethat.Jason Lowery (00:38:36):Babbage and his friends, in the 1830s, start\nconceiving of this idea called a general purposestate machine.And the reason why that was such a big deal\nis because you no longer had to build a specialpurpose machine to do a compute that you needed.You could just program this general purpose\nmachine to do it.But the act of programming was the act of\ngiving this thing instructions manually bypressing buttons or turning a dial or pulling\na lever.And also, the big leap there is that now the\nact of programming or the act of buildingand designing a special purpose state machine\nto do your computation became an abstractidea.So you actually didn’t need to build anything.You just needed to think of a good design,\nand then figure out how to translate whatwas in your brain into instructions for a\nmachine.For example, the first computer programmer,\nAda Lovelace, her program was for a machinethat didn’t even exist.Babbage’s analytical engine in the 1830s\nwas never built because it was too expensiveto use, but she could still program it.She could still conceive of the sequence of\noperations that general purpose state machinewould need in order to act like a special\npurpose state machine.Jason Lowery (00:39:53):So an easy way to think about what programming\nrepresents is kind of to think about Shakespeare.Shakespeare comes up with a story, an abstract,\nfictional story called, what’s the famousone?Romeo and Juliet.So Romeo and Juliet is just a fictional story,\ndoes not physically exist.It’s a figment of his imagination.And then Shakespeare converts that from an\nimaginary story that’s only in his brain,and he writes it down.So he uses a symbolic language, a syntactically\nand semantically complex language to translatethe fictional story in his head onto a script.And then he hands that script to an actor,\nand then the actors give a performance.So in that sequence of events, Romeo and Juliet\nis still just an abstract story.It still only exists in abstract reality.It doesn’t physically exist.Just because the medium through which it’s\ncommunicated, the script, physically existsdoesn’t mean Romeo and Juliet exists.And just because actors can act it out and\nhave an emotionally moving performance thatpeople think is real doesn’t mean Romeo\nand Juliet is anything but a fictional story.It’s still just a figment in this guy’s\nimagination that he’s communicated througha physical medium.Jason Lowery (00:41:02):Computer programming is effectively the same\nway.Computer programmers think of fictional designs\nin their brain, fictional stories.They write those down on scripts using a newly\ninvented symbolic language called machinecode.And then they hand those scripts to machines,\nand then machines can actually read those.And then the machines act like.They basically role play.These general purpose state machines role\nplay according to the instructions that they’vereceived.So at no point did the program actually physically\nexist, just the medium through which it wastransferred to the machine.So if you took my computer right here, this\ngeneral purpose state machine, it is a bunchof circuitry.It’s a bunch of floating gate transistors\nwith electrons on them.So that exists right now.As soon as I ‘load a program on it’, nothing’s\nchanged.It’s still the exact same circuitry.It’s still the exact same electrons stored\nin floating gate transistors.And if I ‘remove or delete’ that program,\nthe circuits and the floating gate transistorswith the electrons in them are still there.The only thing that has physically changed\nis the state of the machine, not the stateitself.Jason Lowery (00:42:16):So this usually trips people out when you\nexplain it, but programming or a program thatyou have loaded or the piece of software that\nyou have loaded is just the symbolic meaningthat you apply to the state change of the\nstate machine.And that’s because a human’s effectively\nfigured out a way to apply symbolic meaningsto circuits, and then they get those circuits\nto repeat that symbolic meaning back to them.So a painter thinks of a scene, and he uses\nphysical paint and canvas to depict that scene.Of course, the scene isn’t real, just the\npaint and the canvas is real.And so that’s what we would do with computers.So technically, Preston, you have no experiential\nknowledge of me whatsoever.Everything that you are seeing is an abstraction\nright now.You are not looking at me.You are looking at light emitting diodes in\nan array on a plane controlled by a generalpurpose state machine.You just know based off of where we are with\ntechnology that I’m probably real, I’mprobably not an AI talking to you.Preston Pysh (00:43:18):I don’t know.I’m not convinced.Jason Lowery (00:43:21):But 20 years in the future, it might not be\nso easy.And so everything that you see on a computer\nscreen is a symbolic representation of what’sin someone’s brain that a state machine\nis acting out for you and making a very convincingthing.And then you false equivalate or you think\nthat it’s real because the physical mediumthrough which it’s communicated to you is\nreal.So you’re making a false correlation between\nyour abstract ideas and this symbolic meaningand the thing that you see in front of you.But they’re actually two completely separate\nthings.A program is just an idea floating in abstract\nreality, virtual reality.That’s why it’s called virtual reality.And a machine, a general purpose state machine,\nis what physically exists in shared objectivereality.Jason Lowery (00:44:11):So why do we say that?Because that is an extremely trippy way.That’s an extremely hard thing to wrap your\nhead around, that we have invented essentiallya symbolic language to speak to machines who\nthen speak back to us.And that what we’re effectively doing is\nshowing each other what’s only in our imaginationsthrough the machines that we program, through\nthis virtual reality.That’s really hard to understand.So what people do to make it simpler to understand\nis they do something called hypostatizationwhere they treat these abstract things as\nif they were concretely real just for simplicity.So we just talk like a program is a physically\nreal thing that is ‘loaded’ onto a machine,just like people talk about the fictional\nstory of Romeo and Juliet is loaded into thepages of the script.We just say that it’s-Preston Pysh (00:44:58):It’s a file, it’s a folder, it’s a trash\ncan here on my desktop.But it’s none of those things.Jason Lowery (00:45:05):Those are abstractions.They don’t physically exist.They’re just figs of our imagination.And it makes it way easier to handle what\nis an extreme leap in abstract thinking thathumans only recently discovered 80 years ago\nthrough stored programs, general purpose computerswith von Neumann and his studies.That is so complex.Machine code is so complex-Preston Pysh (00:45:26):It is binary.I mean, mind blowing.Jason Lowery (00:45:31):Yeah, they invented a new logic through Boolean\nLogic.So they’re implying symbolic meaning to\nbinary states that are then physically inputinto a computer.And it’s mind blowing.It’s way more complex than any human could\nreally understand like maybe von Neumann could.Preston Pysh (00:45:50):I want to pause here because where we’re\ngoing with this, and I think this is importantfor people just to kind of, like why are they\ntalking about this stuff?We’re talking about this because we’re\nabout to talk about how Bitcoin, and I’mnot trying to steal the punchline here, but\nI think it’s important for people to correlatewhy what you just explain is so important.We’re going to talk about the physical reality\nof energy expenditure, which is real in tangibleform, versus virtual reality, ones and zeros\nand how one can be exploited and the otherone can’t, and how there’s a tie to physical\nreality in one and there’s no tie to physicalreality in the other.And that’s a foot stomp moment.And I’m sorry if I stole.Jason Lowery (00:46:37):No, not yet.No, I still got the punchline.Preston Pysh (00:46:41):So that’s important.That is something to kind of pause, think\nabout, don’t forget it because where we’regoing next ties a lot of what he was just\ntalking about to this much more deep divein proof of work for Bitcoin, proof of stake\nfor, call it Ethereum or any other proof ofstake token that’s out there, which is pretty\nmuch everything other than Bitcoin.So are you ready to go there or did you have\nother things that you wanted to talk aboutwith respect to the computer science stuff?Jason Lowery (00:47:15):With computer science, the last thing I’ll\nleave is, it’s so complex that we just pileon different abstract ideas to make it simpler\nfor us to comprehend what is way more complexthan we comprehend.So over the four decades following the development\nof stored program computers where you canapply symbolic meanings to the states of state\nmachines and all this trippy stuff, that’swhen we get assembly language and then eventually\nhigher order languages like we use today likeC or, in Bitcoin’s case, C++ or Python and\nall these other things.These are just languages that make it easier\nto communicate to these machines and, specifically,to communicate our abstract ideas that we\ndesign in our brains and then we get our computersto role play back to us.Jason Lowery (00:48:05):Cyberspace, this idea of cyberspace, is virtual.Obviously it’s a virtual reality.And so everything in cyberspace does not physically\nexist.The only thing that really physically exists\nis all the machines and all the computer screensthat we use to basically role play.And it’s like the famous line from the Matrix,\nwhen Neo’s visiting the oracle and he seesthat little boy monk and he is like, “Instead\nof trying to bend the spoon, only try to realizethe truth.There is no spoon.”That’s actually a legitimate computer science\nprinciple.There is no spoon.We use things like object oriented design\nas a technique to manage the complexity ofprogramming.And so we arbitrarily choose to describe the\ncomplex emergent behavior of the machinesthat we program as if it were an object or\nan orientation of objects simply to make iteasier-Preston Pysh (00:49:06):Because it’s too hard to wrap your head\naround it otherwise, right?Jason Lowery (00:49:08):Yeah.It’s too hard to program computers.But more importantly, it’s too hard to explain\nyour design to other people unless you explainit in terms that they understand.And since all humans live in a three dimensional\nreality where objects are oriented aroundthemselves, we arbitrarily choose to describe\nthe complex emergent behavior of these machinesas objects.But the objects are not real.The spoon is not there.There is no spoon.Preston Pysh (00:49:35):It’s just a charge or no charge.Jason Lowery (00:49:39):And the story of Neo is, once you realize\nthat software is just an abstraction, thenyou can figure out how to exploit it.And then that’s how Neo gets his powers\njust because by just simply realizing thatnothing in the matrix is real, therefore there’s\ntechnically no restrictions, no physical restrictions,limits to his power.And so software-Preston Pysh (00:50:00):Reminds you of a clip I might play here at\nthe end of the show.Jason Lowery (00:50:04):Yeah, I know.And so that’s really important when it comes\nto the field of software system security becauseit’s important to recognize that software\ndoesn’t break, it can’t break.Software just does exactly as it’s told.So it does exactly as it’s designed.So if there’s ever a hack or if there’s\never something bad that happens, nothing wasbroken, people are just taking advantage of\nthe rules of the system.Jason Lowery (00:50:35):And so how do people make software more secure,\nespecially if it’s in charge of sensitiveinformation or it has sensitive commands?Sometimes software runs major weapons systems.The way that most software security is done\nis by creating an abstract power hierarchywhere you assign rank to certain positions.So like admin privileges or admin rights,\nthese people higher up in the ranks have morecontrol authority, they can access more information\nor they can do more dangerous commands.And the way you keep your software secure,\nat least in the old way, is by these abstractpower hierarchies.Of course, since everything in software is\nabstract, then the basis through which youchoose to determine resource control authority\nwithin your software instantiated system orthe basis through which you choose to achieve\nconsensus on whatever the legitimate stateof ownership and chain of custody of whether\nthe abstraction you’ve created in software,you have to use an abstract power hierarchy\nto do it because there is no alternative,not until we get to hashing.Jason Lowery (00:51:40):But that’s why it’s just important.There is no spoon.We arbitrarily choose to describe software\nas objects to make it easier to understandtheir complex emergent behavior.And for the purposes of system security, technically\nall software is an abstract power hierarchywhere usually the developer is the one who\neffectively functions as the God king whogives themselves the most abstract power,\ntherefore the most control authority overwhatever resources that software manages.So like Mark Zuckerberg and all these big\ntime, they’re God kings.They wield these enormous amount of abstract\npower.They have control over billions of people’s\ncomputers and the information on those computers.And they have control authority over resources\nfor no other reason than they’re the highestranking person on Facebook.Preston Pysh (00:52:29):Wow.That is so profound.Jason Lowery (00:52:33):Yeah.And in cyberspace you’ve got all these God\nkings emerging.And so you kind of see them doofing it out.And so it’s in this migration of human society.Now we’re, once again, using abstract power\nhierarchies to manage our resources, but nowwe’re doing it in cyberspace, managing things\nlike information.But if you have abstract power over machines,\nand people become increasingly more dependenton those machines, then that translates to\npower over the people too.So for example, weaponized misinformation.If people get all their information from social\nmedia and then you’re in charge of socialmedia, if you’re the head honcho at Facebook\nor whatever, you get to control the informationthat people see that affects their behavior.So it is enormous.People today in cyberspace have levels of\nabstract power that would make the pharaohsblush.Preston Pysh (00:53:25):Don’t you think that they also have a bit\nof physical power too?Because when you describe physical power as\nwatts, just look at these server farms.Take Zuckerberg for example, all of this data\nand all this information that he is storingon behalf of these billions of people require\nwatts in order to run these on the hardware.So would you argue that there’s a mix between\nphysical power and abstract power that a guylike that wields?Jason Lowery (00:53:54):Yeah, I guess you could say it’s a mix.There’s two different realities to keep\ntrack.And this will be helpful when we talk about\nproof of work.There’s abstract reality.All that data on a server, again, it is symbolic\nmeaning that we assign to electrons in a floatinggate transistor.It’s not actual data, there’s not actual\nones and zeros.We choose to say this switch and this position\nis a one and this one is a zero.And through extraordinarily complex semantic\nand syntactic language which we get Romeoand Juliet or information out of it.So there’s shared abstract reality.And then in shared objective reality, there’s\nthe actual physical hardware of the systems.Jason Lowery (00:54:34):And yeah, I guess you could say they have\nphysical control over that physical hardware,but that is defended the good old fashioned\nway.That’s on a plot of land, and it’s probably\ngot a big old fence with a bunch of barbedwire around it.It’s being physically defended.So they have control authority over that.And I guess the physical power of their fence.And they probably have armed guards.So in fact, I know they do have armed guards.That is a form of physical power.But that pales in comparison to the amount\nof abstract power and resource control authoritythey have from and through cyberspace.Jason Lowery (00:55:12):Now let’s fast forward.So for 60 years, we once again have another\nhoney pot problem where you have these massivedata repositories.You have this capacity to control a bunch\nof people’s computers all across the world,but you have no capacity to impose physically\nprohibitive costs on the abuse of that information,that data or the abuse of that abstract power.And you have all these people that are designing\nsystemically exploitative abstract power hierarchiesthrough their software.It’s very obvious.And then you also have all the just massive\nlevels of hacks and everything.A hack is just people taking advantage of\nthe rules of the system.Nothing breaks in a hack, it’s just systemic\nexploitation.So this big problem with hacking is just essentially\na big problem of people systemically exploitingabstract power hierarchies.And a main challenge of all this is just the\nfact that you cannot impose physically prohibitivecosts on people in, and from, and through\ncyberspace, at least not until Adam Back.Jason Lowery (00:56:11):So that’s why when you think of the hash\ncost function, that’s why it’s such abig deal is because what he did was he created\na program whose sole purpose is to imposea real world physically prohibitive cost on\npeople and programs on other computers.So to solve a hash function, you have to use\nbrute force, physical power.You have to use just electricity and just\nguess a bunch.So the only point of solving a hash function\nis to impose an electricity casa, physicalcosts and watts and non-kinetic, so a non\nlethal physical cost, but still a severe physicallyprohibitive cost on solving the hash function.Jason Lowery (00:56:51):And then in return for solving the hash function,\nin case of Adam Back’s invention with Hashcash,you get a receipt.You say, “Okay, I have proven that I have\ndone this work.”Or in other words, I have proven real world\npower, I have proven that I have been imposedby real world physical costs.And so there’s a very subtle but important\nimplication of that from the perspective ofcyber security.Because in the case of Adam Back, the reason\nwhy he created this was to defend againstsystemic abuse.It’s literally called a denial surface counter\nmeasure.So what an easy way to systemically abuse\npeople is to spam them through email, right?Because there’s no marginal cost.Preston Pysh (00:57:30):I think that’s when Adam came up with this.Jason Lowery (00:57:33):And so Adam, the point of hashing is to impose\na real world, physically prohibitive coston people who are spamming or otherwise systemically\nexploiting the abstract power hierarchiesinstantiated by your software.And that’s a big deal.That’s a big piece because, once again,\n7,000 years ago, you’ve got God kings exploitingpeople through their abstract power.Eventually the slaves figure out, we can impose\na physically prohibitive cost on our God kingsand they’ll stop exploiting us.Fast forward to 1997, you’ve got people\nabusing their abstract power hierarchies andAdam Back comes up with a mechanism through\nwhich you can impose physically prohibit ofcosts on people exploiting you, and it issues\na receipt and it’s a proof of work receipt.But it doesn’t really matter what it’s\ncalled because it’s all abstract anyways.The point is, you’re imposing physically\nprohibitive costs on people, not in abstractreality, but through shared objective reality.That’s a big deal.Jason Lowery (00:58:26):And from a computer science perspective, it’s\nalso a big deal because it’s kind of creatingthis gateway between worlds where you have\nreal world electricity passing into the hashfunction.And then coming out of the hash function is\na receipt that you can then abstract as anobject and then pass around or, in his case,\nit wasn’t transferable.But the point is, instead of most things in\ncomputer science where you hypostatize anabstract thing as a concretely real thing.Proof of work does the exact opposite.It’s reverse hypostatization, where you\ntake a real world thing, electricity, watts,and then you treat it as an abstract receipt.And so that’s huge because now, in cyberspace\nor on your computer, if you see that proofof work receipt, you see proof of real, you\nsee proof of something that physically exists.That’s not true for anything else that you\nsee on a computer screen.Preston Pysh (00:59:17):For people that are hearing all this terminology\nand they’re saying, I hear what you’resaying, but I just can’t really understand,\nwhat’s happening in the math?How is the code actually able to imply or\napply that physical work in physical realityto the person who’s the attacker?And so if I was going to just very simply\ntry to demonstrate to people in real timewhat’s happening there, this is a way that\nI’m going to put some proof of work on Jasonright now.Jason, I’m thinking of a number between\n1 and 10.And go, I want you to start guessing what\nit is.Jason Lowery (00:59:59):Three.Preston Pysh (00:59:59):No.Jason Lowery (01:00:00):Five.Preston Pysh (01:00:01):No.Jason Lowery (01:00:01):Eight.Preston Pysh (01:00:02):No.Jason Lowery (01:00:03):Nine.Preston Pysh (01:00:00):No.Jason Lowery (01:00:00):Five.Preston Pysh (01:00:01):No.Jason Lowery (01:00:01):Eight.Preston Pysh (01:00:02):No.Jason Lowery (01:00:03):Nine.Preston Pysh (01:00:04):No.The number was seven.So he would keep going through this, right?Until he gets it right.But he’s expending watts, he’s expending\nenergy trying to figure out what the numberis, and so through the mathematics, he would\nthen be able to…When he does find the answer and he does see\nthat it’s seven, he can mathematically,through encryption, prove that that was the\nonly answer to the question that I asked,which would’ve had…The way I asked it was it’s between 1 and\n10 and to go, right?There’s a way to verifiably prove that that\nwas the only right answer to the questionthat I asked through mathematics.And this is what’s happening, where…And we’re doing this digitally over the\ninternet, right?This is what’s happening in a proof of work\nsystem that these miners are solving for,and it’s verifiable through mathematics.Jason Lowery (01:00:57):And there’s a lot of different ways that\nyou could design a physical cost function.Adam Back just seems to just nailed it.There are several other people trying to solve\nthis problem, but the beauty of Adam Backis that it appears to be perfectly fair, like\nthere’s no advantage gained by anyone.You just have to brute force it, you just\nhave to randomly guess, and then you’rejust randomly lucky.Preston Pysh (01:01:22):Yeah.Jason Lowery (01:01:22):And so it imposes physically-prohibitive costs\nevenly to anyone who tries to solve it there.It has no favorites, essentially.But it’s important to emphasize that a proof\nof work cash cost function is a physical costfunction.Its sole purpose is to impose a real-world\nphysically-prohibitive cost on the peoplewho try to solve it, and that’s huge because\nif you demand that someone essentially collateralizeor present proof of work in order to send\nyou an email, in the case of that, and that’sHashcash, or to do anything to execute any\naction or to send any bit of information,then what you have technically done in the\nnon-abstract reality of shared objective realityis impose a physically-prohibitive cost on\nthem.Preston Pysh (01:02:09):Yeah.Jason Lowery (01:02:10):So we’re talking, this is like the real\nworld, like now you figured out a way to essentiallycountervail the abstract power of software,\nof the people who code software, because it’slike your software is not allowed to execute\na control action or send any information unlessyou present proof of real to me, and by demanding\nthat receipt, you’ve technically imposeda real-world physically-prohibitive cost on\nthem.And so Finney took that and he was like, “Okay,\nthat’s pretty sweet.Let’s make that a transferable or a reusable\nproof of work.”So Adam Back is kind of a stamp, like you\njust stamp an email, “Okay, this has imposedphysically-prohibitive costs on someone.”But with reusable proofs of work, then now\nyou have enabled this system where you canimpose physically-prohibitive costs on people\nfor anything that you want because these proofsof work can be applied to emails, they could\nbe applied to like anything.Jason Lowery (01:03:02):And so that was the original important thing\nabout hash cost function and proof of work.Now, it had nothing to do…I mean, you could choose to call it a way\nto systemically secure money, but it’s that’snot really what it is.It’s a whole new transformational way of\ncybersecurity and people are just happen tobe using it for a piece of software that would\ninstantiate something that we could call moneyand monetize.But on its own, by itself, proof of work is\na major leap in cybersecurity and computerscience, even if it has nothing to do with\nmoney whatsoever.Jason Lowery (01:03:37):But the big question hanging over that was,\n“Okay.Wow, this is pretty insane.We’ve created a way to impose physically-prohibitive\ncosts on people using this tokenized formof cyber power, this reverse hypothesized\nthing where we’ve taken a physically realthing but then transferred it into cyberspace\nas an abstract thing but it can still imposereal-world physical costs.”The million dollar question was, who gets\nto control that?Because whoever can control that is now, once\nagain, another god king, right?And so that’s where Satoshi comes in because\nhe figured out a way to make it so that theprotocol which controls this reusable proof\nof work token itself is secured by its ownhash cost function.So it’s like a self-enforcing, self-securing,\nreusable proof of work token protocol.Jason Lowery (01:04:27):So the easy way to think of it is, really,\nwhat you want to do is, if you’re goingto demand this cyber power token as collateral\nto execute a sensitive command action or sendinformation, then you have to have some way\nto track its position in cyberspace, essentially,and so you need a ledger of some kind, you\nneed someone to record where it is and haveverifiable ownership of it at all times, which\nmeans you have to have someone to write thatledger, okay?But if you have someone that has the authority,\nthe abstract control authority to write theledger, they have enormous abstract power\nbecause they can control which transactionsget added and they can also withhold transactions.So whoever’s in charge, whatever entity\nis allowed to add or withhold transactionsof the cyber power token has enormous abstract\npower.Jason Lowery (01:05:16):And so Satoshi, the beauty of Bitcoin is like,\n“Okay, well how do you decentralize thatcontrol authority over that ledger?”Well, how do you do it?You make the people who solve the hash cost\nfunction the people who get to write the ledger.So by doing that, you impose a real-world\nphysically-prohibitive cost on people whoattempt to control the ledger, and then boom,\nright there, now you have a proof of powersystem, just like natural selection is vetted,\nright?You have people who have the means, who have\nphysical powers, fully inclusive, everyonehas access to watts.Physical power is physically decentralized.There’s watts all over the world.You can pull watts out of the air, the wind,\nout of the water, out of natural gas, outof solar.So this power’s available everywhere exogenously,\nsystemically exogenously, so there’s noway that you can code a systemically exploitable\npiece of software that prevents people fromusing their real-world watts.It’s fully inclusive, so everyone can have\naccess to these watts.Jason Lowery (01:06:16):But the big one is it’s unbounded.So let’s say if someone starts gaining a\nlot of control authority over this ledger,well, because you’re using watts power as\nthe basis through which you achieve controlauthority over the ledger, that means there\nis no, theoretically, just like there wasno theoretical limit to the amount of kinetic\npower that people can use to defend theiraccess to their property in the real world,\nthere is no physical limit, there is no theoreticallimit to how many watts honest people can\nsummon to impose severe physically-prohibitivecosts on anyone who tries to gain and exploit\ncentralized control authority over the ledger.Jason Lowery (01:07:01):And so that’s the primary basis through\nwhich this system is secured, is there’sno limit to how many watts that people can\nsummon to defend it.And it’s clear that Satoshi was concerned\nabout this, because in eight pages, he mentionsthe word attack 25 times.He talks about people attacking with the same\nprotocol more than any other word.And this whole thing is like, “Okay, listen,\nif you use physical power, if you make itso that you can achieve control of authority\nover the ledger, unless you solve the hashfunction, that gives honest people the ability,\nthe unbounded ability to impose physically-prohibitivecosts.So their benefit-to-cost ratio now can plummet\nbecause there’s no limit to how much theycan cost, they can impose on anyone trying\nto gain 51% of the control.And that’s where decentralization really\ncomes from.There’s obviously decentralization and the\nnodes and everything, but really, it’s thedecentralization of the control authority\nover the ledger achieved through using thephysical power as the basis through which\nyou can have control authority over the ledger,and there’s no substitute for physical power\nfor doing that.Preston Pysh (01:08:04):Let’s go to proof of stake.Jason Lowery (01:08:06):Okay.So just like in the birth of agrarian society,\nwhere people start condemning the use of physicalpower as the basis through which they settle\ndisputes over property, determine controlauthority over property, or achieve consensus\non the legitimate state of ownership and chainof custody of property, people started to\ncondemn the use of physical power for theologicalreasons, because it’s energy-intensive or\nprone to cause injury.In the case of proof of work, obviously, doesn’t\ncause injury because it’s electric, it’snon-kinetic.But it is energy intensive, okay?So once again, you have these abstract power\nhierarchies emerging, where people are makingthe claim that it is, on some ideological\nbasis, not on any meaningful systemic basis,especially meaningful from the point of view\nof systemic security, they’re claiming thatit is “ideologically bad” to use proof\nof work because of the energy that it expends.Jason Lowery (01:09:06):This happened with agrarian society, and this\nis how most kings rise to power, right?They say, “Okay, the use of physical power\nto establish control authority over resourcesis morally bad.We should use rank to do it.”Proof of stake is effectively proof of rank.It’s people saying, “Okay, we should forfeit\nour capacity to project physical power todefend ourselves and go back to, go rewind\nourselves 25 years back in the history andprogression of computer science and go back\nto abstract power hierarchies.”It’s important to note the primary design\nconcept of proof of stake existed before proofof work came out.People were already using and designing abstract\npower hierarchies to manage control over arandomly thing, like coins that they extracted.That was already being done.Proof of stake goes back to that.Jason Lowery (01:09:54):And so the easy way to simply compare, like\nwhen you start to look at the difference betweenproof of work and proof of stake, and if you’re\nnew to this and you’re trying to reallygenuinely understand the main systemic differences,\nit really just comes down to two differenttheories on how to secure your access to your\nproperty.The proof of work theory is, you secure your\naccess to your property by preserving yourability to impose severe physically-prohibitive\ncosts on anyone that would try to take itfrom you, deny your access to it, or exploit\nyour rules.Proof of stake says we can create some abstract\nform of power and then use that as the basisthrough which we defend ourselves.Jason Lowery (01:10:33):And so those are the two fundamentally different,\nlike that’s the main difference, is canI design, can I use a general purpose state\nmachine to design a program to create abstractpower that does the same job as physical power?That’s what stake ostensibly does.And if I do that, can a thing which does not\nphysically exist…Remember, there is no spoon, so state is not\nreal, state does not physically exist.Can a thing that does not physically exist\nachieve the same complex emergent behavioras a thing that does physically exist?So can a system that is defended through physical\npower have the same complex emergent propertiesas something that is defended through abstract\npower?And I don’t, well…Preston Pysh (01:11:15):Talk to us about validators, specifically\non Ethereum, how they work, and then talkto us about slashing, because in their abstract\npower, as you would describe it, this is howthey claim that they will defend the integrity\nof the ledger.Jason Lowery (01:11:33):Yeah, so the idea behind slashing is we can\nimpose cost by allowing honest people to “slash”the stake of validators that might be abusing\ntheir control authority over the ledger.Preston Pysh (01:11:47):So if I’m a validator, I have whatever amount\nof ETH to set up my validation node, and I’mlooking at transactions and I’m saying,\n“Yep, these ones are good.Include these ones in the next block.These ones are good,” and you think that\nI’m a dishonest broker and enough peoplelike you agree with you that I’m a dishonest\nbroker, you can slash me out of the validationmechanism.Is that correct?Jason Lowery (01:12:12):Yeah.What we’re going after here, the main thing\nthat’s making this secure and insecure iscontrol authority over the ledger.So validators have control authority over\nthe ledger.They’re essentially the gatekeepers.They get to choose which transactions get\nadded to the ledger or which ones don’t,but that is a double-edged sword because that\nalso means they get to withhold transactionsfrom the ledger, which technically means they’re\nperforming a denial-of-service attack.So you have to protect yourself against that.Now, the way Bitcoin does that is, the people\nwho are validating or the people who are addingtransactions to the ledger, if they start\nto be abusive, you can basically just hashthem out of the hash amount of their control\nauthority.But with validators, you can’t because stake\nitself is zero-sum, okay?For example, let’s just say there’s a\nsituation where some single entity controls60% of all stake.If some single person controls 60% of all\nstake, they can split that stake across millionsof validators and it would still be the same\nsingle entity and then they could use thosevalidators to start tactfully withholding\nspecific transactions from the blockchain.Preston Pysh (01:13:26):And so when you say they have 60% of the stake,\nyou’re saying they have 60% of the validators,because if they had 60% of the coins that\nare outstanding on that protocol, they couldhave way more than 60% of the validators,\ncorrect?Jason Lowery (01:13:39):Yeah.So there is a difference between the number\nof coins on the protocol and the number ofcoins that are parked in validators, but the\nworst case scenario is, 60% of the stake iscontrolled by a single entity and they put\nall of that in validators.That would be the worst case scenario.Or actually, that could be the best case scenario\nbecause you have to look specifically at thestake, and if someone controls 60% of all\ncoins, they can have far more than 60% ofthe stake that’s being used in validators.Preston Pysh (01:14:15):Yes.Jason Lowery (01:14:15):So just to give them the benefit of the doubt,\nlet’s just assume that everyone who ownscoins is using it in a validator, like all\nthe honest people are putting up their biggestfight possible to try to resist, so you’ve\ngot like 40% of all the coins being stakedby honest people and then 60% of the coins\nbeing staked by dishonest people.The whole point of bringing this up is, in\nthat situation, because stake is bounded andzero-sum, the honest people can’t get more\nstake.They can’t simply regain control authority\nover the ledger by adding more stake becauseit’s a zero-sum and out.This isn’t a problem in proof of work.If you only have 40% of the hash, if honest\npeople only have 40% of the hash, there’sno limit to how much hash they can add back\ninto the system, there’s no limit to howmuch computing resources they can get and\nelectricity they can get.But in stake, you’re stuck.Preston Pysh (01:15:08):And let’s frame this real fast.In a world where you have runaway fiat printing\nthat has no production cost whatsoever andnation states that could print by coins off\nthe protocol and then start staking them,there’s arguably an incentive to act this\nway, to control which transactions are beingincluded, not included, stuck in the mempool.I mean, at that point, you can do whatever\nyou want.Jason Lowery (01:15:40):Yeah, there’s nothing physically preventing\nyou from just printing all the money to buyall the stake to gain the control authority\nover the ledger.That’s one of the dangers of coupling control\nauthority over the ledger to something thatdoesn’t physically exist.Preston Pysh (01:15:54):That has no tie to physical reality.Jason Lowery (01:15:57):That has no tie to physical reality that you\ncan’t see.So the easy way to think of it is, remember,\nall objects in software, there is no spoon.So stake does not physically exist.That means it’s not verifiably physically\ndecentralized.It’s like physically impossible for it to\nbe verifiably decentralized because it’snot a real thing.So no one can prove that stake isn’t already\ncentralized.Preston Pysh (01:16:18):Right now.Jason Lowery (01:16:19):You just have to trust that it isn’t.And then if it is and then people start to\nabuse the control authority that they haveby virtue of having majority stake, then that’s\nwhere slashing will supposedly help the honestpeople because, okay, the honest people can\nslash the stake of the people that are usingit to attack the network, censor transactions,\nor do whatever bad things they can do withthe control authority that they have.Preston Pysh (01:16:42):And then you get into the whole argument discussion\nof what’s considered honest and who arewe talking about, how they view what is honest,\nright?Jason Lowery (01:16:51):Exactly.Preston Pysh (01:16:52):Look at the world today, it’s a perfect\nexample of that exact point, is, are you inthis camp or that camp, or who’s right and\nwho’s wrong, while the people in your family,you could probably split them right down the\nmiddle of what they believe in and both ofthem think that they’re right.Jason Lowery (01:17:10):Yeah.There’s three main critical problems with\nthe idea of slashing that I see just as amilitary adversarial thinker.The first one is, first of all, how would\nyou even attribute an attack?So if someone has 51% control of 50% of all\nEthereum and they’re staking all of it,right?And so the majority of staked Ethereum is\ncontrolled by one person.Because it’s not a physically real thing,\nthey can trivially divide that stake acrossmillions of validators and then they could\npick which validators they want to use tostart tactfully withholding transactions from\nspecific targets.So they call this censoring, but it’s just\nwithholding valid transaction requests fromthe blockchain, and you could do that and\nyou could do that across validators, okay?So how do honest people identify that the\nattack is even occurring if it’s happeningacross millions of different validators controlled\nby a single entity?That’s really difficult to do.Preston Pysh (01:18:09):Impossible to do?Jason Lowery (01:18:11):Yeah, I don’t know, but-Preston Pysh (01:18:15):But maybe.Jason Lowery (01:18:17):What I do know is that it is physically impossible\nto verify that stake isn’t centralized.Preston Pysh (01:18:22):Yes.Jason Lowery (01:18:23):So it’s going to be really hard to make\nthe claim that there is a 51% attack occurringif it’s already physically impossible to\nverify that it’s not or is centralized inthe first place.Okay, so that’s assumption number one, that\nyou can even have attributability, and I don’tknow how that could happen, like I can’t\nreasonably figure out how people are goingto come to consensus about that.Because if you look at how Vitalik describes\nit is, if beyond a reasonable doubt that wehave identified that an attack is occurring,\nthen we could slash.It’s like, “Okay, well, how are you going\nto achieve beyond a reasonable doubt?”Because I don’t know how you would do that.Any self-respecting attacker isn’t going\nto put all their sake in one validator.I don’t even think they can because I think\nit’s limited.Jason Lowery (01:19:04):Okay, so that’s problem number one.Problem number two, this gets to your point,\nwhich is, you’re assuming that people willthink that the synth strain is bad.That almost never happens in actual sanctions\non financial systems, Canada being a greatexample.When they started sanctioning or denial-of-service\nattacking Canadian truckers, a lot of peopledidn’t think that was a bad thing, okay?So how are you going to achieve consensus\nfrom the majority of the people that theyshould even slash someone if there is some\ntheological, philosophical, or ideologicalreason why they are abusing their validators.Preston Pysh (01:19:42):Because at the end of the day, everybody on\nthe planet has to agree with the idea thatif you and I want to transact, if I want to\ntransmit some type of value to you, I shouldhave the right to be able to do that.Jason Lowery (01:19:55):Right.Preston Pysh (01:19:56):Regardless of what anybody else in the world\nthinks, right?Jason Lowery (01:20:00):Yeah.And what are the chances that everyone’s\ngoing to believe that, especially when onlyselect few people who might be easy to perceive\nas bad are the ones being denial-of-serviceattacked?Preston Pysh (01:20:10):Yeah.Jason Lowery (01:20:10):You see all of it with Canada and then, obviously,\nyou see it with the sanctions against Russia.Most people, like a lot of people think that\nit’s good that we are denial-of-serviceattacking or 51% attacking Russia and censoring\ntheir transactions off Swift for ideologicalreasons, okay?Preston Pysh (01:20:28):And people will always think that until it\nhappens to them and they’re on the wrongside of the equation.Jason Lowery (01:20:33):Right.Yeah.But in reality, what you would expect is if\nsomeone has that much control authority ofthe ledger, they would only be using it to\ndenial-of-service attack certain people, noteveryone.Preston Pysh (01:20:43):Yeah.Jason Lowery (01:20:44):And so what are the chances you’re going\nto get everyone else who isn’t being attackedto come to unanimous conclusion or how ever\nmuch conclusion you need to prove withouta reasonable doubt that the censoring is occurring\nand that it’s a bad thing when in most casesof sanctions, people think it’s justified\nand they aren’t mad about it?Jason Lowery (01:21:02):So that’s problem number two.And then the third and glaring one is slashing\nworks both ways.Preston Pysh (01:21:09):Yeah.Jason Lowery (01:21:09):Okay?So the honest members can always slash the\nmajority stakers that are abusing their controlauthority over the ledger, but the people\nwith the majority control authority over theledger because of their majority stake can\nslash the honest people back to maintain theirmajority stake, and so you get basically into\nslash wars instead of hash wars.Preston Pysh (01:21:28):It goes back to what we were talking about\nearly on where the apex predator of an abstractpower hierarchy, they would do anything and\neverything to ensure that they can continueto control this system, this protocol.But for the people that are at the bottom\nof this protocol or this social order, ifyou will, they don’t have the incentive\nfor it to be kept in place because they’rethe victim of this environment that they have\nto operate within.Jason Lowery (01:21:59):And it’s worth just repeating like we’ve\ncreated over the last 5,000 years, we haveused symbolic language to formally codify\nabstract power hierarchies where rank is ostensiblydecentralized across senates or voting systems,\nwhere we hire something like 500 representativesof rank, we use voting systems, and we trust\nin them to represent us.But over the course of those 5,000 years,\ntime and time and time again, they get exploited.People find a way to systemically exploit\nthe rule set to take advantage of the abstractpower.There is an enormous incentive to do that\nbecause it’s a giant honey problem.And so when you go to a proof of stake system,\nwhat you have, once again, done is createdan abstract power hierarchy and a voting system\nand you’re just making this claim that thislike thing won’t be systemically exploited,\nthat people aren’t going to figure out howto abuse the rules.Jason Lowery (01:23:03):And it’s silly to me because people can’t\neven verify that it’s not already centralized.People don’t know.You have no idea who is behind the stake.So at least in governments, oppressive governments\nor regulatory captured governments, you atleast can see your oppressors.In stake, they’re anonymous and you have\nno idea what’s behind these people.So it seems to be extremely systemically insecure,\nbut even if you don’t believe that, it is100% irrational to make the argument that\na system based on something abstract whichdoesn’t physically exist can have the same\ncomplex emergent behavior of system securityas a system that uses something that is physically\nreal, like power.Like you can’t reasonably make the argument\nthat they will have the same emergent propertiesbecause they are very physically and systemically\ncompletely different systems.Preston Pysh (01:23:59):I want to play a clip as we’re talking about\nhow the apex predators have an incentive tokeep these systems in place.This is a clip.I’m going to play it, I’m not going to\ntell you what it is, and then I want to captureyour thoughts after we’re done playing it.And this is an apex predator of the existing\nproof of stake system.Here it comes.Speaker 1 (01:24:23):Mr. Dimon, if I can ask you one other question,\nI’d like to ask of another topic that I’vebeen very focused on, which is the rapid development\nof digital assets and related financial technology.I believe the United States should lead the\ndevelopment of emerging technologies likedistributed ledgers and blockchain, and the\nfederal government should provide the certaintyneeded for the country to serve as a hub for\nfinancial innovation.And I’ve developed legislation to help define\nqualified stablecoins, which I know the chairwomanand the ranking member are also working on,\nand to select the appropriate regulator.I’ve read that you’re a little skeptical\nof some of these new technologies, but whatare the biggest things keeping you from being\nmore active in the space?And do you worry that we would miss the vote\nand give other nations like China an opportunityto advance their digital currency and other\npayment systems that could undermine the USdollar?And I’d love to get some of your thoughts\non that.Jamie Dimon (01:25:05):So you have to separate blockchain, which\nis real, DeFi, which is real, ledgers, tokensthat do something and deliver information,\nmoney, ideas, simplify smart contracts.That’s one thing.I’m not a skeptic.Okay, I’m a major skeptic on crypto tokens,\nwhich you call currency like Bitcoin.They are decentralized Ponzi schemes, and\nthe notion that’s good for anybody is unbelievable.So we sit here in this room and talk about\na lot of things, but $2 billion has been lostevery year, $30 billion of ransomware, AML,\nsex trafficking, stealing.It’s dangerous.There’d be nothing wrong with the stablecoin,\njust like a money market fund, properly regulated.Preston Pysh (01:25:51):All right, Jason, your thoughts?Jason Lowery (01:25:55):Again, all software is abstract, and because\nsoftware is abstract, there’s a lot of semanticambiguity about what kind of matters and what\ndoesn’t.And so…Preston Pysh (01:26:08):And real fast, that was Jamie Dimon from JPMorgan\nChase, if people didn’t hear the names oraren’t familiar with the clip.I’m sorry.Keep going.Jason Lowery (01:26:17):Yeah.No, this is great because let’s use adversarial\nthinking here.From Jamie Dimon’s point of view, to your\npoint, he’s the top dog, he’s the apexpredator in his abstract power hierarchy,\nright?He’s the god king.He needs to do whatever he can to maintain\nhis abstract power.He’s talking about because software is so\nsemantically ambiguous and because it’sall abstract, a common tactic, and you see\nthis with like the crypto world, is you picksomething random and you say that’s the\ninnovation.Preston Pysh (01:26:48):Yeah.Jason Lowery (01:26:48):So you say, “Oh, it’s blockchain.That’s the innovation,” “Oh, it’s\nsmart contracts that are the innovation,”or, “Oh, it’s this,” or it’s, “Oh,\nit’s that,” and it’s like-Preston Pysh (01:26:56):Everything but Bitcoin.Jason Lowery (01:26:57):Yeah, it’s like wave here and then don’t\npay attention to the thing that actually matters,which is Bitcoin, which is-Preston Pysh (01:27:07):Work.Jason Lowery (01:27:07):… physical cost functions and physical decentralization\nof control authority over resources.And so that’s exactly what Jamie Dimon is\ndoing, and you’ll see this with everyone.You’ll see this with the CBDCs, you’ll\nsee this with like Ethereum, for example,is they say that something else is the innovation\nto try to get you into their abstract-Preston Pysh (01:27:28):They won’t even talk about it.Like Andreessen Horowitz, right?They had some big giant recap, crypto recap\npaper, I think it was Pierre Rochard thatwas talking about.Bitcoin wasn’t even mentioned-Jason Lowery (01:27:43):Wow.Yeah.Preston Pysh (01:27:43):… in the entire report, but yet it has the\nlargest market cap of any type of “cryptoasset,” using air quotes there for people.Jason Lowery (01:27:54):And if you study computer science, if you\nstudy software reuse, the most common formof software reuse is design reuse, so people\ntake a design of an existing piece of softwareand then tweak it a little bit.Preston Pysh (01:28:07):Yeah.Jason Lowery (01:28:08):Majority of cryptocurrencies out there is\nreused Bitcoin, right?But they tweak it-Preston Pysh (01:28:13):Minus the proof of work.Jason Lowery (01:28:14):Minus the proof of work.So they copy the design of Bitcoin, then they\nremove the proof of work, and they createan abstract power hierarchy where they have\nthe control authority over the ledger in somebackdoor way or some trap door way through\nthe systemic exploitation of the rules.Preston Pysh (01:28:30):They get VC money, they then pump the marketing\nto get a bunch of people to buy it, then theyget their bags pumped, then they offload it,\nand then they probably go and buy Bitcoinwith the proceeds.Jason Lowery (01:28:41):Yeah, I mean, if they were smart.I would do that if I were kind of evil that\nway.Preston Pysh (01:28:46):No, you wouldn’t.You’re not evil like that.Jason Lowery (01:28:49):But the point is, whatever you do, don’t\nlet people realize the value of physicallydefending their access to their property or\nphysically defending their policy againstsystemic exploitation using real-world physical\npower.Condemn it as much as possible.Get people to forfeit their physical aggression,\ndomesticate them, and then once they stopusing physical power, they adopt abstract\npower hierarchies and then they become thedomesticated animal that you can exploit.And so you’ll see this with everything now,\nis they’re going to come up with every possibledifferent way to get you to not appreciate\nproof of work or the use of real power tosecure your access to the things that you\nfreely choose to value, and you should justbe very, very-Preston Pysh (01:29:33):Skeptical?Jason Lowery (01:29:34):Yeah, that should raise red flags.Anyone tries to raise the argument that the\nuse of physical power to physically defendyourself by imposing severe physical costs\non attackers is somehow bad because of the-Preston Pysh (01:29:45):Red flag.Jason Lowery (01:29:45):… energy it uses, that’s a red flag.That’s a god king trying to build an abstract\npower hierarchy, trying to trap you, and that’sexactly what Jamie Dimon here is doing.He’s saying, “Okay, well, this blockchain\nisn’t bad and smart contracts aren’t bad,but that thing called Bitcoin, that’s bad,\nand look at all these bad people.”So he’s the…Jason Lowery (01:30:00):Called Bitcoin that’s bad.And look at all these bad people.So he’s the shark trying to get you to think\nthat your swimming pool isn’t safe.And he is trying to say what is safe is this\nopen water where I swim, you just have tobe careful.Preston Pysh (01:30:15):All right, here’s the next clip I’m going\nto play for you.You ready?Jason Lowery (01:30:18):Yeah.Preston Pysh (01:30:18):Here it comes.Vitalik (01:30:20):So I did look to summarize that one of the\nways that I think about this in a more philosophicalway is, Proof of Work is based on the laws\nof physics and so you have to work with theworld as it is.You have to work with electricity as it is,\nhardware as it is, what computers are as itis.Whereas because Proof of Stake is virtualized\nin this way, it’s basically letting us createa simulated universe that has its own laws\nof physics.And that just gives us as protocol developers\na lot more freedom to optimize the systemaround actually having all of the different\nsecurity properties that we want and-Jason Lowery (01:30:58):That we want.Vitalik (01:30:59):… if we want the system to have a particular\nsecurity guarantee.And then often there is a way to modify the\nupper stake mechanism to also achieve it.So it’s just much more flexible and it shows\nthrough in the efficiency and the securityof the network.Preston Pysh (01:31:16):Way more flexible, Jason, to give us the security\nthat we desire.Jason Lowery (01:31:23):Yeah.I study system security of software intensive\nsystems at MIT, for whatever reason I findthat interesting.And so I took as many graduate classes as\nI can on that.And it’s actually extremely common.So what’s happening here is Vitalik is making\nthe claim that if you remove the physicalconstraints, it will somehow make it safer\nor make it more secure.But he doesn’t realize is the thing that’s\nachieving the security is the physical constraints.Preston Pysh (01:31:50):Yeah.I mean you’re not going to…Fort Knox, right?It’d be like saying, “Oh yeah, we’re\ngoing to take the walls down, we’re goingto remove the fence, we’re going to remove\nthe security guards, we’re going to movethe brick walls, we’re going to remove the\nmetal casing around the vault, to make itmore secure Jason.”Jason Lowery (01:32:10):Yeah.But this isn’t just true for this scenario.We’ve studied, at least in my graduate classes,\nso many different fields make the same mistake.Aviation has made this mistake multiple times.Preston Pysh (01:32:20):In what way?What do you mean?Jason Lowery (01:32:21):Well, you replace a physical interlock or\na physical impediment with something digitalor with a piece of software.And then you end up inadvertently removing\nthe physical constraint that was actuallykeeping that thing safe.And then the rocket blows up or the airplane\nblows up, or the Boeing 737 dive bombs.Jason Lowery (01:32:46):And so this is a common problem.It is just something that software developers\ndo for some reason, is they think that, forwhatever…they don’t realize that system security\nis a complex emergent behavior, and oftenthe result of physical constraints that cannot\nbe replicated in a virtual environment wherenothing physically exists.And it was so refreshing to hear him make\nthis assertion because I had already starteddown this path of making the distinction between\nProof of Work and Proof of Stake, and sayingthe reason why Proof of Stake isn’t going\nto work is because stake doesn’t physicallyexist.And what they’re essentially doing is trying\nto make the claim that they can virtualizePhysical Power and still achieve the same\nlevels of systemic security.I had already made that argument.I had already written 50 pages on that for\nmy thesis that I’m having to write.Preston Pysh (01:33:35):I’m sure you did.I’m sure you did.Jason Lowery (01:33:37):And then he said it, he said it on the night\nof Proof of Stake.And I saw it in the morning and I was like,\n“Oh my God, this is it.”Preston Pysh (01:33:44):Oh, the Holy Grail.Jason Lowery (01:33:45):Yeah.Preston Pysh (01:33:46):The Holy Grail.Jason Lowery (01:33:47):I had already been arguing with people on\nTwitter about it and they weren’t buyingit.And so I was starting to feel insecure.I was like, “I don’t know if this is the\nright angle to take.”And then Vitalik just flat out says it.Preston Pysh (01:33:55):He knew.Jason Lowery (01:33:55):He flat out makes the assertion that you can\nremove the physical constraints, replace itin a virtualized environment, and he’s claiming\nthat it will be more secure.Preston Pysh (01:34:04):Yeah.Classic.Jason Lowery (01:34:04):And that is just god king, Abstract Power\nbuilding 101 right there, is convinced peoplethat to forfeit their Physical Power and the\nphysical constraints protecting them.Preston Pysh (01:34:17):So I’ve often wondered, as you’ve been\nvery public in your research, your just interactionson Twitter.And for people who are not familiar with you,\nlet me just describe my point of view of howJason Lowrey came on the scene.Jason Lowery (01:34:36):Oh boy.Preston Pysh (01:34:36):So here we are on Twitter and we’re just\nintellectually battling with each other, jokingaround, whatever, on a constant daily basis,\njust having fun really.And somebody posted this screenshot of this\nguy on LinkedIn going to battle; basicallydoing what we do on Twitter every day, but\ndoing it on LinkedIn, which was just hilarious.You have no idea how hard I laughed the first\ntime I saw one of these JPEGs of you justbeating up some total suit on LinkedIn.And so evidently somebody reached out to you\nand said, “Hey, the real conversation’shappening here on Twitter.”And-Jason Lowery (01:35:16):It was Greg Foss.Preston Pysh (01:35:17):Was it Greg Foss?Jason Lowery (01:35:18):Yes.Preston Pysh (01:35:18):Okay, I didn’t know that.Yes.So Greg Foss reaches out to you, you then\ngo on Twitter and you immediately captureda really large following.A lot of people, myself included, battling\nwith you over some of the choice of wordsthat you used.But you know what, when I look at how much\nyour thesis has evolved through the time thatyou’ve been at MIT writing this, I can see,\nJason, that you took a lot of the things thatpeople were saying to heart and really wanted\nto understand other people’s vantage point.You weren’t battling with them via ego,\nyou were battling with them intellectuallyto try to understand their point of view.And all of that has come out.And I think people that are listening to this\nconversation can see that evolution in yourwriting and your thesis that you’ve developed.Preston Pysh (01:36:04):But here’s my question.Sorry to keep going on.My question is this.How has MIT and the professors there received\nthis?Because I would think that it hasn’t been\nreceived well, because it seems like so muchof the Proof of Stake, saves the energy usage\nstuff, is so indoctrinated at the academiclevel that I would think that you’re literally\nbanging your head against the wall.Jason Lowery (01:36:32):Yeah.So I got invited here…I forgot that’s how I got famous is through\nthe bashing of suits on LinkedIn.I forgot about that.Greg Foss, yeah he was like, “Dude, you\ngot to come to Twitter.Your people are here.You don’t really get it.”Preston Pysh (01:36:47):We were watching…People were posting these things on Twitter,\nthese screen grabs, and I’m telling youwe were laughing so hard.Jason Lowery (01:36:56):I was so afraid to come to Twitter.And I was like, “I’m going to say something\nthat gets me in trouble.”And sure enough, day one I say something about\nthe grounded theory methodology…So I’m using a grounded theory methodology,\nwhich is essentially you try to just talkto people as much as you can.Preston Pysh (01:37:15):Interviews.Yeah.Jason Lowery (01:37:16):Preferably talking to people who are knowledgeable\nin your subject matter area.Well, there ain’t no such thing as an expert\nin cryptocurrency, as much as people on LinkedInlikes to put it on their profiles.No one actually-Preston Pysh (01:37:27):Web3, they’re putting Web3 Jason.Jason Lowery (01:37:29):Yeah.There’s no such thing as an expert in this\nfield yet.It’s too new.And so if you want to find the most knowledgeable\npeople, they’re going to be on LinkedIn.Or they’re…No sorry, not LinkedIn.God no, not on LinkedIn.On Twitter.Preston Pysh (01:37:40):Twitter.Jason Lowery (01:37:41):They’re going to be on Twitter.Preston Pysh (01:37:42):And their name’s probably going to be douchebag5\nor something like that.Jason Lowery (01:37:45):Yeah, right.No, and it’s true.And then they’re going to have a cartoon\nas their profile picture with laser eyes,but those people have enormous technical knowledge.Way more so than you could get from any professors\nhere.Not all of them, but most people in any institution\njust because this field is so new.And so my approach to this thesis was a grounded\ntheory methodology where I engage in unstructuredinterviews with the public, or with anyone\nI could find, and then just have intellectualdebates on them.And then I use their feedback to… and that’s\njust the grounded theory methodology is youjust use their core concepts and you improve,\nimprove, improve, improve, and try to getto what’s called saturation.And so yeah, no, I owe all my ideas to the\nsomething like 70,000 comments that I’vereplied to in the last year.Jason Lowery (01:38:31):Okay, sorry.I just wanted to address that because I do\nreally appreciate all the help and all thepeople like you that I get to meet, that can\nhelp shape this.It’s really important to me to do this publicly\nbecause of my job and the reason why I’mat MIT.I am a US National Defense fellow.I am an active duty officer.I am researching the national strategic implications\nof Bitcoin and I am going to send this straightto the Joint Chiefs once we finish it.And I am going to be advising senior policy\nmakers and I already do.And so I don’t want that to be secret.I want that to be an open conversation and\nI want to be as fully transparent as possible.Jason Lowery (01:39:05):Now in terms of how people at MIT react to\nit, I have seen the same thing you’ve seen,which is this obsession with Proof of Stake.There’s that MIT article that talked about,\nit’s such a big deal and I get in lots offights with those people.But luckily the way MIT’s structured is\nthere’s different schools and no one reallyhas any claim over any particular subject.So there’s not one department that gets\nto claim all Bitcoin research or all cryptocurrencyresearch.There’s people in the business school, there’s\npeople in engineering school, there’s peoplein the computer science school and you pretty\nmuch have freedom of action.Jason Lowery (01:39:44):And so what I did was I deliberately steered\naway from the professors.I do clash with most of the line of thinking\nwith the business school people here, they’rejust so into Web3 and crypto right now.It’s just kind of hopeless, I don’t even\ntry to talk to them now.I found the expert in software security and\nsoftware system security.I found the expert with 40 years of knowledge\nand literally wrote the book on system securitythat the whole world uses.And I found her and she was also skeptical.She’s like, “I think it’s all scam.”But I was like, “Okay, then you should be\nmy advisor and let me prove to you using yourown area of expertise why Bitcoin is the exception.If I can convince you using your own area\nexpertise of why Bitcoin actually is a majornew change in cybersecurity, then wouldn’t\nthat be a good thesis?”And she was like, “Okay, cool.”So I found her as my advisor.Preston Pysh (01:40:42):And?Jason Lowery (01:40:42):So far it’s going well.I won’t know if it’s successful until\nI publish next year, but man, she’s justawesome.She’s actually…like I said, she’s one of the world leading\nexperts in system security.And Ethereum developers have been starting\nto go to her conferences and I’m just [inaudible01:41:03].Yeah, so it’s just kind of funny.It’s like anytime an Ethereum developer\nsigns up or whatever, she’s like, “Hey,check this out.”Preston Pysh (01:41:08):So this is something I want to just say.So if somebody from your school, or one of\nyour advisors, are listening to this, thething that you get in this space, and I was\ntalking to you a little bit about this beforewe started recording, is you get people that\ncome to Bitcoin from so many different expertise.Some people come from the software side, some\npeople come from the game theory side, somepeople come from the finance side.I’m coming from the financial lens and that’s\nhow I found Bitcoin in 2015.How I found it is I had the opinion that the\ncredit markets were going to implode and thatthere was no way out for central banks to\ncontain how broke credit markets had become,because I was looking at this long term credit\ncycle that was made famous by Ray Dalio.And I was just looking at it as just like,\nwhat can possibly catch all of this buyingpower when this neutron star of credit explodes?That’s how I personally found Bitcoin.So I came with that bias.I came with that lens.Preston Pysh (01:42:09):And so, one of the things that sold me on\nBitcoin versus everything else that was happening,was if you’re going to catch something with\ncall it 300 trillion dollars worth of buyingpower and it’s going to implode like a neutron\nstar, security is the primary thing that peopleare going to want to nest that buying power\ninto, to ensure that it can’t be taken.There has to be some type of enormous amount\nof security and Physical Power behind thesecurity of that in order for it to ultimately\nwin.Because when you look at how bond investors\nlook at their invest…they’re obviously not concerned about the\nyield because you just started getting…And I wouldn’t even call these good yields,\nespecially when inflation’s at 8% and they’reoffering 4% on the 10 Year Treasury, you’re\nguaranteed to lose 4%.They’re not there for the yield, they’re\nthere for the preservation of buying power,and it’s to the tune of hundreds of trillions\nof dollars that they just want to preservethe buying power.So if this thesis of the credit markets exploding\nis valid and true, which I’m saying as anif, because I’m trying to look at it as\nobjectively as possible, how can anybody thinkthat that’s going to manifest itself anywhere\nother than the most secure protocol or moneyon the other side of such an event?Preston Pysh (01:43:32):And so I guess that’s me venting a little\nbit.And I’m sorry to go off on a tangent because\nthis show’s not about me, it’s about youand your thesis here.But I find it frustrating that people are\nnot seeing that.Instead they’re caught up in these tokens\nor these get rich quick ideas that, “Oh,it’s an innovative blockchain, smart contract,\nJamie Dimon BS.”And they’re missing the elephant that is\nso big in the room that it’s suffocatingthe person.They can’t see it, it’s literally suffocating\nthem because it’s so big.Jason Lowery (01:44:15):Can I vent on this real fast.Preston Pysh (01:44:16):Yes, please.Jason Lowery (01:44:16):So you came in from the financial perspective.My first job in the military was as a blast\nand ballistics research engineer where I literallymeasured the watts of bombs that go off and\nbullets that go off.So I’m literally measuring our ability to\nimpose physically prohibitive costs on peoplein watts.Jason Lowery (01:44:37):My second job in the military was as a subject\nmatter expert in electronic warfare, specificallydirected energy weapons.So once again, using watts as a measure to\nimpose severe physical prohibitive costs forthe sake of securing something.Okay?Jason Lowery (01:44:51):Then I transitioned into the world of space,\nI became an astronomical engineer, learnedhow to use and design spacecraft.And then I was part of the founding team of\nofficers that stood-up US Space Command andalso US Space Force, which was essentially\na question of, well how do we impose physicallyprohibitive costs in a completely new domain.Jason Lowery (01:45:14):So what I’m saying is I know a lot about\nthe use of watts, the importance of wattsfor achieving security, and the question of\nhow do you start using watts in a new domainto secure the stuff that you care about.So what attracted me to Bitcoin was just this\nidea that of course, it’s going to be thecase that we are going to figure out a way\nto use watts to impose physically prohibitivecosts on people in and from through cyberspace\nto defend ourselves in and from through cyberspace,especially our cyber-property, and especially\nour policies are our rule sets and the softwarethat we use.So the missing ingredient of cyberspace is\nthe ability to impose physically prohibitivecosts in and from through cyberspace using\nwatts, obviously we’re going to that future.It doesn’t make any sense, I don’t understand\nhow anyone can think that we wouldn’t goto that future if we’ve already done it\nin land.We’ve already done it in sea, we’ve already\ndone it in space, of course we’re goingto do it in and air.Of course we’re going to do it in cyberspace.Jason Lowery (01:46:18):And so you have to just be looking out what’s\nit going to be a protocol that people useto impose physically prohibited costs on people\nin and from through cyberspace.And that’s clearly Bitcoin.And that was clearly the original intent of\nBitcoin.And it’s supposed to be a denial service\nor denial of service counter measure or acounter measure against systemic exploitation\nof software.That’s how it started.That’s how they talked about it.Yes, Satoshi took it and framed it as a cash,\nbut like we said before, that just happensto be a great use case.One of many use cases that this type of technology\ncould be used to secure, but it isn’t limitedto just cash.And so I’m in the same boat.It’s so frustrating for people to just…Especially at big institutions like at MIT\nfor people just to ignore the major-Preston Pysh (01:47:05):Yes.But think about it makes sense, Jason.It goes back to what you’re talking about,\nAbstract Power, right?There’s no more Abstract Power going on\nthan in an academic institution of who’swho and who’s tenured and whose class is\nmost noteworthy.Jason Lowery (01:47:28):I guess my point is you could have called\nBitcoin anything, it could have been calledBitunicorn or just anything.It doesn’t matter what it’s called, whatever\nit was called.It would’ve still been a major leap in the\nfield of computer science and cyber security.It’s just such a dramatically different\nway of doing things that is so completelyunique and different, that no matter what\nyou call it.And it’s just that we happen to call it\nmoney and we happen to use the first use casefor which we started to secure this was as\na peer-to-peer cash system.People just get obsessed with this idea as\nBitcoin only being a monetary system.But it’s like no, what we have done is we’ve\ncreated a giant global scale physical defenseinfrastructure that people are using to physically\ndefend what they value, not just the moneybut [inaudible 01:48:20]Preston Pysh (01:48:19):There’s the time and energy.Jason Lowery (01:48:22):You could use it to defend you against emails.And it’s only a matter of time, so people\nare going to start using the lightning protocoland they’re going to start using Bitcoin\nas basically a cyber dome to protect peopleusing this Physical Power infrastructure.They’re going to figure it out.And it’s only a matter of time and I wouldn’t\nbe surprised that it emerges in the next coupleyears.And it’s like that is such, in my opinion,\na bigger deal and more importantly, a moreinevitable deal.Of course that’s going to be something that\nhappens.Of course, we’re going to start figuring\nout how to use protocols to physically defendourselves through cyberspace.And for whatever reason, that’s just missing.People just aren’t thinking about that.Maybe that’s because people don’t think\nabout it often.And maybe because I’m the guy that measures\nwatts because I’m the military guy, I’mjust more inclined to see that sooner, than\nthe-Preston Pysh (01:49:11):Yeah.I think that’s what it is.I think that when you pull back the thread\non how many complex academic and real worldthings are colliding here to understand the\nmagnitude of all of it coming together, youjust have to have some expertise in a whole\nlot of different domains to get it.Jason Lowery (01:49:36):Yeah.It’s a very tough systemic problem that\nis multidisciplinary.It combines computer science, it combines\nanthropology, it combines political history,it combines military strategy and it combines\nmoney.And then you have to be able to just zoom\nout and see what the big picture is, likewhat is the ‘so what’.And I think what the ‘so what’ is, for\nthe first time occurring society, we figuredout how to use a power based control structure\nto manage resources and to achieve consensuson the legitimate state of chain custody of\nproperty and to physically defend ourselvesin and from through cyberspace, and we’ve\ndone all these things at the same time andwe’ve done it non lethally.And that’s huge.Preston Pysh (01:50:18):It’s unreal.Jason Lowery (01:50:18):This is going to be so much bigger than money\nif people start using this thing beyond justmoney.And I think it’s going to start happening.And so that’s the message I’m trying to\nget out.Preston Pysh (01:50:30):So Jason, let’s say that you had policy,\nanybody in government or policy listeningto the discussion, which I’m sure we might\nhave.What would be, if you had to frame up guidance\nto them, what would be the one thing or twothings that you would say to a person who’s\nlooking to implement policy on some of thisstuff?Jason Lowery (01:50:52):Couple of things.So this is an example I like to use; when\ngun powder was first invented, when blackpowder was first invented for more than 200\nyears, it was considered to be medicine andit was monetized and traded as medicine.So they invented this new power projection\ntechnology and they called it medicine foressentially no other reason than the fact\nthat the doctor who invented it was intendedto build medicine and named it medicine.And so for that reason they just called it\nmedicine and traded it as medicine.Called it fire medicine.And then they noticed that it was quick to\nhold a flame.They weren’t quite sure what medicinal purposes\nthat could be used for, but whatever.The point is, it was a power projection technology.And you could have gone to doctors and you\ncould have asked doctors for their professionalopinion on how good this black powder stuff\nis as medicine.Jason Lowery (01:51:46):But whatever they would have to recommend\nwouldn’t have been useful for the real purposeof this black powder stuff.And I say that because we keep on saying software\nis an abstraction.What Proof of Work really represents is a\ncybersecurity system as specifically a systemwhere people are learning how to defend themselves,\nlearning how to defend the access that totheir property that they freely value or to\ndefend their policy against systemic exploitationand abuse or just to figure out how to use\nthis thing for all sorts of new cybersecurityreasons.And it was called a coin and people act like\nit’s a coin, but that’s just one of manyuse cases of this thing.Jason Lowery (01:52:26):And so Adam Back, I talked to him about when\nhe first invented the hash function.And he first called the receipt for solving\nthe hash function a stamp.And so imagine how ridiculous it would be\nto go to the United States Postal Office andask for their technical inputs about the technical\nmerits of Bitstamp, just because it was arbitrarilycalled stamp.Or imagine how ridiculous it would be to ask\na meteorologist about the technical meritof that stuff that stores your emails just\nbecause it’s called a cloud.So just because we happen to call this power\nprojection system, this massive scale physicaldefense system that people are using to secure\ntheir property, a coin, doesn’t automaticallymake it the case that the United States Treasury\nDepartment or the United States Federal Reserveis qualified to be talking about the technical\nmerits of this technology.Preston Pysh (01:53:23):Wow.Jason Lowery (01:53:23):Least of all is the freaking bankers because\nof the- [inaudible 01:53:27]Preston Pysh (01:53:26):Perverse incentives.Jason Lowery (01:53:28):Yes.Because of the very obvious incentives we\nheard Dimon talk about.So the last people qualified to be talking\nabout the national strategic security implicationsof this power projection technology is the\nUnited States Treasury Department, is anybank.And so who’s running the conversation about\nthe national strategic security impacts ofBitcoin right now and why?And what qualifications do they have?Because from my perspective, from a guy who\nactually spends all his time studying powerprojection technology, I do not think they’re\nqualified to be talking about the technicalmerits with this technology.At least not about Bitcoin specifically or\nanything that uses the Proof of Work protocol.And so my recommendation to any policy maker\nthat might be listening to this is, the lastpeople you should be listening to are bankers\nand financiers about power projection technology.That’s silly.It’s like listening to doctors about the\ntechnical merits of-Preston Pysh (01:54:26):Gun powder.Jason Lowery (01:54:26):Black powder, just because they called it\nmedicine.[inaudible 01:54:31]Preston Pysh (01:54:30):That is not the response I was ever expecting\nto hear from you.That’s fascinating that you frame it that\nway because as a person that comes with afinancial lens, a very financial lens to this,\nI just would not have ever viewed it fromthat optic.I view it as very financial.Jason Lowery (01:54:49):And it definitely is because to your point\nearlier, if you’ve created the most securesystem ever, it’s going to double as a great\nthing to monetize, to secure your money.Preston Pysh (01:55:01):Yeah.Jason Lowery (01:55:03):But people also monetize black powder.That doesn’t mean that…So you just have to be careful here because\nof the second point, which is anytime anynew power projection technology has emerged\nthroughout history to include black powder,to include torpedoes, to include aircraft,\nto include nuclear weapons or whatever, anytimea new power projection technology emerges,\nit becomes a strategic selling point.And there’s many examples in history where\nbad things happen because countries don’tappreciate its strategic importance soon enough.Preston Pysh (01:55:41):Wow.Jason Lowery (01:55:42):China just made this mistake, in my opinion,\nat an epic scale by seeking-Preston Pysh (01:55:46):Epic scale.Totally agree with you.Jason Lowery (01:55:48):But the problem is China’s very authoritarian.And so once they figured out that they messed\nup, they can pivot quickly too.They can pivot quickly back into Bitcoin.And so I guess my advice to people is, if\nthis is a power projection technology, ifthis is a wholly new way for people to defend\nthemselves or particularly their property,then-Preston Pysh (01:56:11):Better take it serious.Jason Lowery (01:56:12):You should take it extremely seriously from\na national strategic standpoint.And the last thing you should do is be too\nquick to kick it out of your country or disenfranchiseit or condemn it because you could be handing\nthe keys to the kingdom over the next 500years to someone you don’t want to hand\nit to.And so this is a very serious matter if you\nconsider it from the perspective of nationalstrategic defense, not as a monetary system,\nbut of a global physical defense system.Preston Pysh (01:56:42):That’s pretty profound.Jason, give people a handoff if they want\nto follow you where they can do that.Also, can we have links in our show notes\nto your drafts and the papers and everythingthat you have academically written to date?Can we do that?Jason Lowery (01:57:01):Yeah.I don’t know how much I’ve published.I started a website, so I’ll send that link.Preston Pysh (01:57:05):Perfect.That’s perfect.Jason Lowery (01:57:07):Yeah, so the first question is where can you\nfind me?Is that it?Preston Pysh (01:57:10):Yeah.Jason Lowery (01:57:10):Yeah.Just on Twitter.I mean I just use Twitter to…Jasonplowery, L-O-W-E-R-Y.I just use that as my interface to engage\nwith what I believe are the subject matterexperts in here, which is just Bitcoin Twitter.It’s such a bowl of knowledge that you can\ndrink up everyday.Preston Pysh (01:57:26):And if you’re feeling like you want to use\nsome Physical Power, he’s on LinkedIn.Jason Lowery (01:57:31):I’m on LinkedIn too, but I have to be.I’ve got to be more professional on LinkedIn.Preston Pysh (01:57:39):I think you’re plenty professional, sir.I think you [inaudible 01:57:42]Jason Lowery (01:57:42):I get a lot more freedom on Twitter.Preston Pysh (01:57:45):Oh lordy.We’ll have links to LinkedIn, to Twitter\nand your website there where you’re postinginterviews, you’re posting some of the things\nthat you’re writing.What a pleasure.Thank you so much for making time to have\nthis conversation.I thoroughly enjoyed this.I learned a ton and wow, what exciting work\nthat you’re doing there at MIT and it’sbeen fun for me to see the progression.It really has.And I’m sure there’s a lot of other people\nthat share that sentiment that have engagedwith you on Twitter.Because I know you’re very active with a\nlot of the people that are providing counterresponses and different opinions.Jason Lowery (01:58:27):And I appreciate all of the honest feedback.It’s extremely helpful and I hope you can\nsee that I have been incorporating that.Preston Pysh (01:58:34):Bravo.Jason Lowery (01:58:34):Thank you.Thanks for talking to me so long.And sorry I took so long but this has just\nbeen great.Preston Pysh (01:58:38):No.No.God.This was a blast.So thanks Jason.Really enjoyed it.",
