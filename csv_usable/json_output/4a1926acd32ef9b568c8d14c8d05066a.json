She was too young to realize it, \nbut thanks to her industrious, frugal parents,  she would have the means to pursue \na meaningful education and career.But when Farida's family woke up \non the morning of January 12, 1994,  everything had changed. Overnight her parents \nlost half of their savings, not due to theft,  bank robbery, or company bankruptcy but a currency \ndevaluation imposed by a foreign power more than  4,500 kilometers away. The previous evening \nfrench officials and IMF bureaucrats met in  Dakar to discuss the fate of the CFA franc. For \nyears the currency used by citizens of Togo and  other West and Central African nations had been \npegged to the French franc at a rate of 1 to 50.  But when the late night meeting \nconcluded, it was 1 to 100.The economic fates of tens of millions of \npeople had been decided by French leaders  with the complicity of pro-french rulers \nof countries such as Togo and Ivory Coast.This is French monetary colonialism, an \nexploitative system of monetary control which has  outlasted political colonialism and allowed France \nto retain control over the economies of 15 African  countries and subsidize the French way of life. \nDespite decades of uprisings, the system stands to  this day but is now being challenged by a new form \nof resistance: open-source code. At the height  of its imperialism, the French Colonial Empire \nstretched over 11.5 million square kilometers.  After World War II, the French had fought tooth  and nail to keep their colonial possessions \nbut eventually were forced to give them up.  However, the benefits of the resources \nand labor of French colonies in West and  Central Africa were too rich; Paris devised a \nscheme to have its cake and eat it too, ending  political colonialism while orchestrating monetary \ncolonialism. This was the birth of the CFA Franc.The French understand that by controlling \nthe colonial Franc currency, also known as  the CFA Franc, it increases its power against \nits former colonies and allows it to siphon  the wealth back to Paris in numerous ways. The \nCFA Franc was originally introduced in 1945.  By the 1990s it had been devalued by 99.5 %.  The CFA farmers and producers have no recourse. \nFrance still manufactures all of the notes and  coins used in the CFA regions, charging \n45 million euros per year for the service.  And if CFA residents want to travel abroad. they \nare forced to convert their colonial Francs to  Euros as the CFA currency is worthless outside \ntheir countries. France again takes its cut.  With the guise of generosity, France grants \nloans to its CFA Nations for infrastructure  developments, but the work is contracted to \nFrench companies. This is the infamous double loan  the taxpayers of countries like Ivory Coast are \non the hook for the entire loan plus interest  while the French get paid back twice, first \nin an immediate sense when the loan is used to  pay a French company to complete a project and \nthen later when the principal plus interest is  paid back on the loan. By denying CFA Nations the \nability to produce their own manufacturing-based  economies and by steering CFA Nations away from \nconsumption agriculture and towards producing  inedible exports designed for World Markets, they \neliminate sovereignty and engineer dependence.  Today, the CFA system has been Africanized. Togo's \ncurrency now shows local culture and flora and  fauna, but these are only superficial changes \nthe banknotes are still made in Paris. French  officials still sit on the boards of two of the \nthree regional CFA Banks, and the wealth generated  by the French authorities in the first seven \ndecades of the CFA system, when Paris got to keep  National reserves and dictate monetary policy, has \nnot been returned. The World Bank and IMF work in  concert with France to enforce the CFA system and \nrarely if ever, criticize its exploitative nature.  The IMF managing director position has often \nbeen held by a French official recently  Christine Lagarde. Contradicting the values of \nliberté, egalité, fraternité, French officials  have propped up tyrants to enforce the CFA zone \nfor the past six decades. Omar Bongo in Gabon,  Paul Biya in Cameroon, and Gnassingbé Eyadéma in \nTogo have amassed 120 years in power between them.  Those who resisted French rule have paid a heavy \nprice, Togo's first post-colonial leader Sylvanus  Olympio, formerly moved to create a Central Bank \nof Togo and a Togolese Franc. January 13, 1963,  days before he was about to cement this \ntransition, he was shot dead by former Togolese  soldiers enrolled in the French colonial army. \nA few days later, Farida Nabourema's grandfather  and his comrades were arrested and tortured by \nthe military for organizing against the puppet  government the French had installed. Gnassingbé \nEyadéma was one of the soldiers who committed the  crime. He later seized power and became Togo's \ndictator with full French support, ruling for  more than five decades and promoting the CFA \nFrank until his death from 1967 to 2005. His  son rules to this day. Olympio's murder was just \none of the many ways in which France has punished  those who would overthrow its rule. Whether \nit was France collapsing the Malian economy  by rendering the Malian Franc in convertible or by \npouring huge quantities of counterfeited banknotes  into the Guinean economy their retribution is \nbrutal. Learning about the 1994 devaluation of  the CFA Franc opened Farida's eyes to the ways in \nwhich currency is used as a mechanism of control.  Farida's father had his bank account restricted \nbecause of his pro-democracy activism. Farida,  fearing the same retribution, has turned to \nBitcoin, which has been a financial lifeline  to keep the democracy movement going inside \nTogo's dictatorship. \"When I discovered Bitcoin,  I realized it was a cultural scientific and most \nimportantly, economic revolution all bundled into  one.\" People in the West might be skeptical about \nBitcoin. If you have Venmo and Cash App, you might  not see why it is important, but when you go to \nTogo, more than 75% of the people have never set  foot in a bank. \"Today, Africa is made up of \n54 countries and an incredible 46 currencies.\"  Bitcoin gives Africans the ability to unite on one \nmonetary standard, controlled neither by dictators  nor by colonial powers. Money and currency are \nburied beneath the surface, and the global human  rights movement, they hardly ever come up at human \nrights conferences and are rarely discussed among  activists. Monetary repression continues to \nbe hidden and not spoken of in polite circles.  The reality today for the 182 million people \nliving in CFA Nations, is that while they may be  politically independent in name, the economies \nand money are still under colonial rule.  But even monetary independence from France \nwould not guarantee that they will perform well  or that the country's leaders \nwill not abuse the currency.  Today, Farida and like-minded activists \nare spreading the word of Bitcoin.  \"It is clear that people are in need of \na currency that actually breaks the will,  one that cannot be manipulated by government of \nany kind.\" Cameroonian Economist Joseph Tchundjang  Pouemi wrote: Monnaie, servitude, et liberté, \nthe thesis monetary dependence is the foundation  of all other forms of dependence, the final \nwords of the book ring especially strong today.  Africa's fate will be forged through \nmoney, or it won't be forged at all.",
