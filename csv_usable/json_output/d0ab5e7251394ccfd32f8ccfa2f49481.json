hyper bitcoinization is theidea that bitcoin will one day reach alevel of adoptionwhere it has become the one medium ofexchangeand store of value hyper bitcoinizationis the phasewhen bitcoin is used to buy your coffeeandpower the global economy bitcoin has theopportunity to become the world'sfirst universal digital currency due toits fundamentallysound monetary properties what do i meanby thatlet's take just three examples firstbitcoin is borderless you've probablyheard thismany times but let's think about whatthis meanstraditionally nationalistic monetarysystems keepthe citizens of a country financiallyhostage by forcing upon thema government decreed currency forexamplein sweden i cannot pay rent or buy gaswith us dollars andi can't use the swedish krona in the ukif my government was so inclined itcould refuse me the right to trade withother currenciesand i would for all intents and purposesbe locked up in my own country this isnot a big issue in swedenbecause the government is stillrelatively functional in venezuelahoweverthe citizens are at this very momentbeing held financially hostage by theirgovernmentthey are prisoners they cannotphysically escapetheir country they are not allowed toexchange their nationalcurrency for any other currency or tradewith other statesbitcoin solves this completelywith bitcoin you don't have to flee yourcountry physically to escape anoppressive governmentthere are many many stories of familiestrying to escape china or venezuelaand how they have had all their cash andgold confiscated at the borderno one can confiscate your bitcoins allyou have to do and listen this isimportantall you have to do is remember yourprivate key in the form of 24 wordsand you can travel the world with yourentire life savingsif you wanted to flee a country and atthe border they ask youif you're carrying any bitcoin if you'removing any illegal bitcoins across theborderyou say no because you don't first ofallbitcoins don't exist there's nothing youcan point to and say that's a bitcointhere are only unspent transactionoutputs which we callcoins for simplicity but in reality theyare justledger entries or unspent transactionoutputsand they are on the blockchain and theblockchain iseverywhere your bitcoins are already inthe country you're going toso no you're not carrying any bitcoinswith 24 words in your headyou can go anywhere and no one can touchyour savingsbitcoin is global there are no bordersno one canimpose borders and no one can confiscateyour bitcoinsthe fact that bitcoin is borderless is ahuge dealsecond bitcoin is permissionless andthisis an equally big deal listen in bitcointhere's no central agency this meansthat no one can prevent you fromtransacting with bitcoinever you can transact with whomever youwantwhenever you want and you don't need toask for permission regardless of theamount you want to sendyour funds cannot be frozen orconfiscated and your transactions cannotbe stopped because there is no oneto stop them there is no one to freezeyour funds in bitcoinno permission is needed to use yourmoney like it should bebecause you own your money and this isabsolutely not the case with fiat by thewaynever before have we had apermissionless digital currencythird the most important valueproposition of bitcoinis true digital scarcity nothing is asscarce as bitcoinnothing and digital scarcity is a hugedealin the year 2140 about 120 years fromnowjust fewer than 21 million bitcoins willhave been createdthere will never be more than 21 millionbitcoinsthat's the mathematical asymptotic caphard coded into the protocolno government bank or bitcoin developercould ever changethis no one could ever artificiallydeflate bitcoin's value by increasingthe supplythe supply and the issuance rate arepredeterminedmeaning that unless and this isimportant meaning that the bitcoins youownwill always be the same percentage ofthe total supplyimagine that regardless of how muchbitcoin's purchasing power increasesor how much someone is willing to payfor bitcoin your percentage of the totalsupplydoesn't change let's look at how muchmoney there is in the world73 trillion dollars in global stocks
