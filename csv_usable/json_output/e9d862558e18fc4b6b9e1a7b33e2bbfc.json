prerequisites what are yougoing to need to know in order to gothrough this process with me right nowthe great thing is not really much elsethan you already do i'm assuming thatyou are an individual that has gone onto an online exchange in some capacityand bought some bitcoin and now you'rewondering what do i do next how do iactually hold this myself i've heardthat's very important you are absolutelyright it is very important you'veprobably seen headlines of custodianslosing or freezing people's bitcoinyou've heard of people getting frozenout of their accounts you've heard ofexchanges being hacked and a plethora ofother examples of why leaving your moneyin the hands of another is not the bestoption bitcoin was inventedto be the antithesis to the currentbanking system to be able to takeresponsibility for yourself and holdyour own wealth so let's go about doingthat right now you will be able to withme today walk through the steps so thatyou are holding your own money in yourown handssowhat are we going to do first let's takea look at how to get you set up with abitcoin walleta bitcoin wallet is a piece of softwarethat holds the keys to your moneyjust like a regular key you can createcopies of it and you can use the backupcopy of your key should you lose theoriginal that's why it's very importantto keep it very safealso like a key anybody who holds a copyof that key can open what it's meant toopennamely your money so you want to keepyour keys safe and away from others youdon't want to be leaving copies of thesearound people you don't trust or reallyaround anybody and you don't want tostore them necessarily digitally inwritten form or in aan online place you want to keep thempretty safe and away from prying eyesbecause again if somebody gets a copy ofyour keys then they will have a copy ofyour money and they'll be able to moveit somewhere that you may not be able totouch it now a wallet is not to beconfused with an exchange which you'relikely sitting on right now an exchangeis you trusting your money in somebodyelse's wallet and that's probably not aplace you want to be so that's whatwe're going to do right now i would likeyou to go to bluewallet.ioand download this app you can get it onandroid you can get it for ios on uh anapple phone or you can get it on yourdesktop today i will be working fromdesktop but it is effectively the exactsame flow it's just easier to have myscreen like thisafter you download the app you're goingto get something that looks like this alittle bit different on mobile but moreor less the same idea you're going tosee more a lot of blank space and thenyou're going to see an option to add awallet and that's exactly what we'regoing to do i'm going to hit add nowyou're going to name the wallet andwe'll just name itmy wallet for right now whatever youwant to name it is fine you're going tochoose bitcoin you don't need to knowabout lightning or the vault or anythingcomplicated like that just choosebitcoin that's all you needand then you're going to hit create nowthere's a few extra options down here iwant you to ignore those right now ihave my wallet set to advanced featuresfor things that you may dig into downthe line but you don't need to know anyof this stuff right now we're just goingto hit bitcoin and choose createnow it's going to show you 12 wordsthese words are incredibly importantthese are the keys to your money theyare randomly generated by this walletand your job is to write them down on apiece of paper and keep them safe andaway from prying eyes this is that keyto your money i was talking about ifanybody gets a hold of a copy of thiskey they can unlock your money and moveit somewhere else uh but this is alsothe backup to your money so that if youaccidentally delete this wallet or smashyour phone or or your your hard drive onyour computer corruptsyou all you will need are these 12 wordsand the best part is you don't even needto use blue wallet with them you can usethese 12 words with any other bitcoinwallet out there you just need to have acopy of them you need to download a newwallet and you need to put these 12words in and you will recover your moneylike magic all right so i want you towrite those down right now and come backto me in a secondokay did you write them down i hope sobecause we're gonna move onso you're gonna click ok i wrote it downandvoila you are readyuh so what you will now see is you'regonna see my wallet or whatever youhappen to name it and this is aclickable wallet you can click on it togo on it and by the way you can have asmany different wallets as you want thatis all it takes to set it up is writedown those words and you're done if youwant an extra wallet you can hit thelittle plus sign and you have the optionto do the same thing bitcoin create soand so forth but you don't need toin order to start using your walletyou're going to simply click or tap onyour wallet my walletand you will now see on the app itselfthis blue color will have the entire topof the screen but on desktop it looks alittle bit different here you're goingto have a balance in bitcoin you'regoing to have a list of transactionsdown below which is empty right nowbecause we haven't done anything yet andat the bottom of the screen you'll havereceive and send okayso at this point we have everything weneed already in just a couple of minutesto be able to take our money off of theexchangenowthis is what's known as a hot wallet itis connected to the internet so thatmeans this particular wallet is only assecure as the device it's on so it's onan online device you know if it'scompromise or something like that thennot the best there are ways to secureyour money even better buttoday i want you to take a small amountof your bitcoin and remove it from theexchange it doesn't have to be a lot infact yeah i want you to treat thiswalletkind of how you would treat walkingaround with cash in your pocket youdon't want your life savings in itbuti want you to learn how to use itproperly okay so maybe 50 bucks you wantto take off something like that that's acomfortable amount maybe a few hundredis comfortable for you whatever thatnumber is we're gonna do that right nowokaysolet's hop over to our exchange and learnhow to do thatthe first thing you're going to do otherthan having your exchange app open orlogging into your exchange in yourbrowser is in your wallet that you justcreated you're gonna hit the receivebuttonnow at the first time you do this it'sgoing to say hey have you saved yourbackup those words that we wrote downvery carefully it's just ensuring thatyou've done that step because it'sincredibly important so yes i haveand now we get a receive screen whatyou're going to see hereis a qr code this can be scanned byanybody so if somebody's in front of youphysically and they have a bitcoinwallet they can scan this qr code theyhave all the information they need inorder to be able to send you moneyalternatively down below there's astring of digits and this is also thesame information in text form that isyour bitcoin address and so you can usethis information to copy and paste intoan exchange or sent to somebodybasically again it's all the informationneeded to send you money so right nowwe're simply going to click on it or tapon your phone and that will copy thatinformation it's also worth making noteof the first few digits in the last fewdigits you don't need to read the entirething and memorize it don't worrybut take a look at the first few bc oneand the last fewsix t two six it'll be different fromyou of coursebut that's all we needso we're going to jump over i've got mybrowser open as as an example we havecoinbase so coinbase is a fairly popularexchange there you may be on somethinglike binance or ftx or whatever it ismaybe you're on umcash app or or strike or or somethinglike that maybe you're on swan bitcoinum maybe on shake pay whatever it isi just want you to find the place onyour exchange where you can send orwithdraw it'll probably be one of thosetwo terms so in the case of coinbasehere on thedesktop version of it there's a sendreceive button in the top right howeverit looks a little bit different in theapp i'll show you here in the app here'sa screenshot of it there's a send buttonkind of right in the top middle allright so it may look a little bitdifferent for youbut here on desktop we're going to go tosend slash receiveso this is going to bring up my sendscreen and my receive screen uh both ofthem so that i can choose what i want todo so you can toggle between them youcan hit receive or send or sending wewant to send outsowe have the option to type in a dollaramount that we'd like to send or thesetwo little arrows will give us a bitcoinamount that we'd like to sendor alternatively there's a send allbutton and i'd like to send all of thisout but you may be inputting 50 bucks or100 bucks or whatever it may be so i'mgonna hit send allthis is all of the funds that icurrently have on the exchangenowuh i want to send my bitcoin out andthen here where is it going to it couldbe an email a bitcoin address we have abitcoin address that we're sending it toso we're going to click here and we'regoing to paste inthat addressthat we had before so we cancross-reference this remember it wasbc16t26andit looks like that is the same addressthat we had so we're good to go we canadd a note an optional message if wewant someexchanges allow you to do that butthat's pretty much all we need so i'mgoing to hit continuenowsome of these exchanges want a lot ofinformation from you uh which is anotherreason to get it into your own custodybecause then you don't need permissionto do anythingall right uh so where are you sendingthis to well we're sending it to aself-custody walletall right it gives me a littleuh overview of what's happening here i'mgonna hit send nowand thenwith coinbase there's an authenticatorapp that you're using or maybe you mighthave a text message that's comingthrough to you but it's going to ask forthatspecial code that you have to withdrawand this is the same with a lot ofdifferent exchanges so i'm just pullingthat up right now and i can type it inand it changes everyyou know 60 seconds or something likethatokayand i'll hit confirmall right so it says this much bitcoinor around 51 worth of bitcoin was sentto this bitcoin address this transactionusually takes about 30 minutes this isbecause exchanges in order to beefficient on the bitcoin network they'llbatch a whole bunch of withdrawals alltogether at one time um which is apositive for bitcoin users overallso just so you know it might take alittle bit of time to come through butyou should see it within the time amountthat they've allotted here so we'll bebackwhen we see that happennow of course the example of coinbasehere is going to vary a little bit fromother types of exchanges as i said butagain you are simply looking for thewithdraw or send option on your exchangeand you're going to find a field whereyou're able to paste in a bitcoinaddress or perhaps scan a bitcoinaddress to send toeasy peasy all you got to do is findwhere that function is on the exchangeyou are usinga few minutes later i have now seen anincoming transaction in my wallet righthere it says pending and if i tap on iti can see the details this is the amountof bitcoin i have receivednow what does pending mean well thebitcoin network updates the ledger ofwho owns whatroughly every 10 minutes so i can seethis one coming in and in about 10minutes time it should say that i haveone confirmation or that the ledger hasbeen officially updated for the firsttime with my transaction affixed to itso as long as you see it incoming thenyou know that a transaction has beensent to you and thenagain it will show as uh officiallyconfirmedin roughly 10 minutes time so againwe'll come back when we see that and weshould see our balance above updatedwith that as welland here we are with the updated screenmy transaction has now confirmed andwith that the balance at the top of myscreen has been updated to reflect suchat this pointthe exchange i was using can no longerdo anything with my funds they can'tfreeze them they can't censortransactions they can't run away with mymoney and that's because it's sitting inmy own walletwith which the keys i myself secure theonly thing that can result in loss offunds at this point is if i'm carelesswith the backup that we've written downit's a good idea to keep it somewheresecure in a safewith a family member somewhere whereprying eyes will not get a hold of it donot secure it digitally or anything likethatbecausesomebody can get a hold of that if it'sin your camera roll and uploaded to thecloud uh the other instance of lossmight be if i'm careless with my devicei let people get on my computer andstart playing with things and maybe theysteal it that way from me but this isall about personal responsibility andyou do that by removing it from atrusted third partyuh if you want to dive deeper into howto use blue wallet because we've set itup we've received money but i'm notgoing to go into sending and receivingtransactions back and forth and all ofthe little features thereinyou can check out my full tutorial onblue wallet it is listed in the shownotes down belowbut that begs the question what is nextnow that we have our own bitcoin in ourown walletand we've backed up said wallet let'ssee what it would look like if forinstance wehad our computer fail and we needed torecover our wallet so i'm going to goaheadand i'm going to delete this wallet iknow scary so i'm going to go in i'mgoing to hit delete i'm going to say yesi want to delete this wallet it doesbecause i have a balance it wants todouble checkthat i am sure i want to delete this i'mgoing to go ahead and do it and it asksme to type in my balance here so i'mgoing to hit deleteoff it goesso what do you do when you haveaccidentally discarded your wallet fromyour actual devicewell you can use that backup phrase thatwe wrote down i've got it just offscreen here so all i would dois i would hit add now or the littleplus sign will also create a new walletuh and instead of selecting bitcoin andcreate we're just gonna hitimport walletand i'm just gonna simply type out thephrase that i wrote down uh andjust a single space between eachnonocaps lock or anything like that alllower caseonce i have everything typed in i'm justgoing to hit the import buttonwhile it has been importedand look at that there's our balanceright back on our computer with our listof previous transactionsand again i will reiteratethat those 12 words that you've writtendown in some cases it may be 24depending on the wallet you're using butthose 12 words can be used with anyother bitcoin wallet that's all you needto recover your funds so if you wereworried about properly backing things upand recovering afterwards that's how youdo it and that's how i want you to tryit today when you take some funds offthe exchange try deleting your wallettry recovering it with the words thatyou've written down double check thembefore you do that and you can be surethat you know how to recover your fundsshould something go awrythe wallet that we just set up is knownas a hot wallet and that means that thekeys to your money are located on adevice that is connected to the internetthat also means that the keys to yourmoney are only as secure as the devicethat they reside onthere is an additional layer of securitythat you can obtain by using what isknown as a hardware wallet orputting your coins into cold storagesowhat is your next step well you're goingto want to decide what kind of hardwarewallet works best for youwith a hot wallet you don't want to havemuch beyond what you would becomfortable carrying around in yourpocket as cashwith a cold wallet you can think of itas a specialized digital bank vault justfor yourselfthat will store all of your money soi've done a full video uh on the tophardware wallets that i like torecommend i highly recommend that youcheck it out i will link it down belowbut it goes through six differentoptions of different hardware devicesthat may appeal to youeverybody's a little bit different somewill gravitate to others um and itreally depends on your personalpreference as i've said but give it alook see what works best for you andthen in the show notes of that you willfindin depth tutorials for every single oneof those options there's a lot of greatones again the ones that are here trezorledger keystone cold card bitbox02foundation passport they're alldifferent flavors of the same idea whichis keeping your keys on a dedicateddevice that does notdirectly connect to the internetso again that is your next step andif you found this process of setting upyour own bitcoin wallet on a phonerelatively straightforwardthis is not too far detached what fromwhat you've already done you alreadyhave the skill set necessary to make oneof these work and iencourage you to take that step rightawaymy hope is that having seen this videoyou will beless apprehensive about
