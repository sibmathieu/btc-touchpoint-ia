worst outcome is a lifetime of debtslavery as an npc zombiestudent loans are not discharged inbankruptcy so it's particularlyonerous burdenlike the monetary equivalent of weighing400 poundsbeing in

passiveincomesign me uplike all coiners they don't deliver ontheir promise and the stats bear thisoutjust 45 percent of students graduateafter four years and only 65 percentgraduate after sixtraditional education how did we end uphere where did higher education go sowrongthe answer as readers of this column canprobably guess is fiat moneythere are many ways in which fiat moneyaffects education but let's look at twouniversal education and student loansthe first is an outcome of theprogressive error which brought aboutsuch wonderful things as the income taxand the federal reserveuniversal education was the idea thatevery child should have the opportunityto learnthis is a great sentiment and one thatcivilizations should aspire to but theproblem wasn't the intentionthe problem was who was running it andhow it was executedgovernment granted itself a monopoly oneducation and like most things it doeswith no competition it screwed it upworse than hollywood screws up childactorsthe monopoly persists because of themomentum of bureaucracy funded by themoney printerthe moral imperative of fiat moneythe existence of the money printingmachine is both a boon and a curse forgovernmentsit's a boon because they can steal moneyfrom everyone else for whatever purposethey desireit's a curse because there is now amoral imperative to solve all socialproblemsit's like the idea that superman is ajerk because he's not constantlyrescuing peoplethe money printer makes the governmentsupermanif the government can print money to fixinjustice it's hard to justify notfixing it especially in a democracyeducation is seen as a way to provideequal opportunity so the government hadto keep trying no matter how badly itfailedlike a degenerate gambler that keepsdoubling down they keep throwing morefundingand they provide this funding as they doeverything in a central bank back fiatmonetary system through loansand thus colleges were turned into rentseeking institutions by subsidization ofstudent loansa large bureaucratic class of rentseekers take advantage of this moneygrowing like an invasive species tochoke out anything and everything in itswayfiat money grows the educationalindustrial complex as it does thehealthcare industrial complex and themilitary industrial complexindustrial complex is a synonym for rentseeking outgrowth that's difficult orimpossible to removeconfusing causation and correlationas more people become educated thedissatisfaction with the opportunitiesin the economy led to a focus on collegecollege was for a long time an upperclass endeavor and unsurprisingly thosethat went to college had higher incomesthe correlation between income andcollege was always mingled with thefamily backgrounds of the attendees butthat was ignored for the preferrednarrativecollege became the reason poor peoplewere not richthe class mv in general pride electionin a democracy to equalize led to publicfunding of college education throughstudent loanspropagandizing to poor people theyblamed education as the primary reasonfor economic failurelack of education became a convenientscapegoat rather than the injustice ofthe cantelon effectonce again the moral imperative of fiatmoney came into playtaxing the public to fund that collegeeducation would be called what it iswith redistribution from poor people torich people but doing the same thingthrough fiat money printing also knownas student loans obscures the wealthredistributionaspectthe focus goes towards the intentionwhich is to equalize opportunity andindeed that's the basis by which theseloan programs were sold to the publiccollege becomes a consumer goodstudent loans make college way moreexpensive as any analysis of collegetuition costs over time makes clearan increase in the supply of money in arelatively fixed supply of collegesmeant that tuition skyrocketedwhat's remarkable is how the additionalrevenue didn't go to go into professorsor even research but to administratorsi remember going to my alma mater about10 years ago and seeing a building thatwas new it was a beautiful collegegothic building and i imagine it wasexpensive i was shocked to see what thename of the building wasthe law school administration buildingthe building didn't hold classes orhouse students or even a cafeteria thebuilding was for a bunch of busybodiesthe growth of the bureaucratic class isobvious in any graph of college tuitioncosts and college administrators haveemployed over timebureaucrats are like termites theyconsume and destroythe bloat of the rent-seeking class hasmeant that colleges started focusingmuch more on getting people in the doorthan in educating themunsurprisingly the easiest way to dothat is to make the experience a lotmore fun and appealingthis is how college became a four-yearvacationeducation under a bitcoin standardit's worth thinking about what bitcoindoes to the education systemcollege costs are bloated as a result oftoo much money being pumped in throughstudent loanswhen that spigot of money stops whatwill education look likethe first thing to consider is thatcollege is a recent phenomenon it's onlyin the last hundred years or so thatcollege has become something most peoplestruggle forprior to thateducation was much more a private affairfamilies would hire tutors or send theirchildren to private schoolsa bitcoin standard will lead to a returnto a similar system with morecompetition and different ways toeducate clear winners will emerge andthe most effective best roi educationsystems will proliferateto some degree that's already happeningwith boot camps and charter schoolsa bitcoin standard will let the marketchoose rather than the governmentstatus will not beintimately tied to education as it isnow and there will be a decoupling ofjobs from their prestigethere are all manner of trade schooljobs like welding or plumbing which payhandsomely but aren't well regardedbecause of their low level of educationsecond there will still be a market forcolleges though there will be a lotfewer of themschools cannot continue to support alarge bureaucracy without the studentloans funding them so i expect manycolleges to failthe good schools will show good roi andkeep the rent seeking to a minimumthey'll be far less able to exploit thepoor and middle class because the mainweapon of student loans won't be therebitcoin takes away the monetaryequivalent of sugary processed carbdebbie foods and we're likely to see alot less 400 pound peoplebecause the loans won't be therefamilies that want their children to goto college will save up bitcoin to payfor itthey're likely to be a lot morediscerning since the money was earnedand saved in other words bitcoin fixesthe economic incentives and that willstop the exploitation of collegesa new set of valuesthe current system of fiat educationserves the people in power through fiatmoneythe values they encourage arerent-seeking that's slavery andacceptance of propagandamost children go through at least 12years of indoctrination about why thecurrent system is good and should beunquestionedcollege furthers this indoctrinationwith keynesian lunacy and cantelonstatus gamesit's no wonder we've got an anxiouspopulation they're all forced intostatus games which are naturallyzero-sumthere's a large chance they come out onthe short end of the
