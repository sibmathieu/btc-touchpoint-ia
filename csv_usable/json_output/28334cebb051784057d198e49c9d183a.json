talk\nto us about the current events and thoughtssurrounding the Bitcoin mining industry.This was a fascinating conversation because\nHarry got into a lot of specifics about thehardware migration coming out of China, the\npotential impacts moving forward, and thenwe had a general conversation about the business\nof mining.As many already know, Harry’s a treasure\ntrove of information on this topic.So without further delay, here’s my conversation\nwith Mr. Harry Sudock.I love having these conversations with you,\nHarry.I’ve been a big fan for quite a few years\nnow.So welcome back to the show.Harry Sudock (01:07):\nI appreciate it, Preston.Thanks for having me.It’s been a bit of a roller coaster in mining\nland for the last 3, 6, 9 months.Preston Pysh (01:14):\nTo say the least.To say the least.Hey, I want to start off because we’ve never\ncovered this.The last time you were on with Marty, we didn’t\ncover your background or your story.So I’m just kind of curious, what’s your\nbackground, how you found Bitcoin, and howyou got into it in the first place?Harry Sudock (01:32):\nI appreciate it.So I’m a FinTech native.Basically, I joined up with a FinTech halfway\nthrough college, interned there end the summerbetween my sophomore junior year, interned\nthere again the following summer, and joinedfull time five days after graduation, and\nthat company really focused on the full bellyof the beast.We were a big data company that sat in between\nhedge funds and prime brokers.Harry Sudock (01:57):\nSo we tried to leverage the back and middleoffice functions to generate operational alpha\nfor clients.That was as simple as saying to some folks,\n“Put your short on at Citibank, not a JPMorgan.They’re going to charge you less,” or\nit was as nuanced as recreating their marginagreement, and validating that they had to\npost as much collateral as they thought theyhad to post.Harry Sudock (02:18):\nSo we were able to just shave some pointshere and there, but for a $15 billion hedge\nfund, a few points mean 10, 15, $20 millionin costs saved per year.So it was a really interesting business and\nit put me really in the guts of how the otherbroader financial system worked, which was\na blessing and a curse, because it made merealize that this stuff is still running on\nmainframes.Harry Sudock (02:40):\nThe idea that these large financial institutionsand massive sources of institutional grade\ncapital are somehow sophisticated, is likea wild misnomer.There are hedge funds that are still working\nwith paper orders.So the insight into that side of the world\nwas one part of it and like with many others,I had my three swings at the plate with Bitcoin.Harry Sudock (03:04):\nFirst, in high school, there was a kid whowas very involved in some of the early anonymous\nstuff when they got involved with fightingback against Scientology, and they were sending\nBitcoin to each other.So, the kid who got investigated by the FBI\nin my high school was the first pass at Bitcoin.Harry Sudock (03:24):\nThen, the second pass was the kids who werebuying drugs in college and then the third\npass was like, the most junior guy on ourdesk at the FinTech had just given his buddy\nfive grand to trade Bitcoin prop for him.So I got these three swings at it, that was\nprobably sub $1 in high school.It was probably sub $20 in college, and it\nwas sub $1,000 at my first job.Missed all three swings, obviously, but had\nfinally reached that critical informationexposure point where the proverbial viral\nload had reached the saturation I needed tosay this is worth time and effort.Harry Sudock (04:05):\nFrom that point forward said, this is interesting.Went from this is interesting, to I can’t\nthink about anything else and from that pointsaid, I need to find a way to make this my\ncareer.Anything other than full career exposure to\nBitcoin is underexposed.At that point, I said, I have a thesis about\nthe future that balance sheet is going toreplace valuation.Hard assets are going to trade at such a ridiculous\npremium over the coming, I don’t know, callit 10-year time horizon, that the actual free\ncash flow that your business generates, andthe balance sheet that you build with it is\ngoing to be like a way more useful sourceof compounding than the next up round, which\nis what it’s been previously where the ideais that you can … If you go back maybe six\nor seven years, you’ve got to just infinitelymark up your next venture round until you\nsell it to SoftBank [inaudible 00:05:01].Harry Sudock (05:02):\nNow, it’s like you just sell your next upround until Tiger comes in and pays for it.I was of the opinion at that point that businesses\nneed to generate free cash flow, and the bestuse of that free cash flow over time becomes\na balance sheet.So I tweeted it during some of Trump’s rise,\nbut like make balance sheet great again, waskind of what we were going through.Harry Sudock (05:26):\nI continue to believe that and I think thatthe reason why that’s so exciting is that,\nand the original thought before I got to itwith Bitcoin was that if you’re someone\nwho’s 25 years old, what are the best assetsyou can put on your personal balance sheet.It’s like, I’m going to spend two years\nat Stripe, I’m going to spend two yearsat Airbnb, I’m going to spend two years\nat Uber and I just want to vest three of thebest 10 companies I can find.Harry Sudock (05:50):\nThen my personal balance sheet will actuallyexceed anything else I’m doing.Then Bitcoin came and said, the thesis is\nright, but the collateral is wrong.So now it’s just, how do you aggressively\nfree cash flow as quickly and best as youcan to be able to build your personal balance\nsheet in such an early and aggressive way,that it becomes the best performing asset\nof your lifetime.That’s the replacement for the pension myth\nor the Social Security myth.Harry Sudock (06:20):\nWhat those are, it’s a replacement for thebalance sheet.So developing personal balance sheet early,\nand front loading it.It’s like what all the fire people get wrong,\nor they get right, but maybe get wrong.They’re right that saving these hard assets,\nthey do it in the form of equities.My perspective is that that needs to happen\nin the form of Bitcoin for lots of differentreasons, but then extend that thought process\nout to either starting or joining a very earlystage company.Harry Sudock (06:46):\nHow do you not mine a coin then?So, took that idea and said, the two best\nfree cash-flowing companies that you can buildin the Bitcoin space are an exchange, or a\nminer.Having just been through five plus years of\nFinTech experience at the heart of prime brokersand hedge funds was not thrilled to jump onto\nan exchange at that moment, and by the graceof serendipity, found my way into a cold DM\nwith Griid’s founder and CEO, Trey Kelly,and we met for coffee a few times.I was thinking about starting my own thing\nand he very wisely said, “Don’t do that.Come join me,” and it was at that point\nthat I joined Griid as the first employee.Preston Pysh (07:28):\nWow.Oh, that’s fascinating.I agree with your fundamental thesis about\nthe balance sheet.I think it’s so important and I think it’s\nreally difficult for people to wrap theirhead around, because they’ve been so groomed\nand conditioned, especially anyone comingout of business school, that the income statement\nis the place to really spend all of your timeand analysis and for good reason.Preston Pysh (07:52):\nYou got to find a company that’s kickingoff free cash flows, but when you think about\nhow everything’s just being capitalizedto the moon because interest rates keep going\ndown, it forces you to really understand whatis on the balance sheet and how’s it being\ncapitalized on the balance sheet.So when you’re seeing these numbers and\nthe equity growth of the business, is thatreally equity growth, or is that just the\ncapitalization of the assets that are sittingthere?I’m with you 100%.Harry Sudock (08:18):\nExactly.So for me, there were two moments within traditional,\nhigh growth companies that I thought werenot fully emperor has no clothes, because\nI respect a lot about what some of these companiesdo, but they were like, these are companies\nthat are maximally extracting from the existingstate of play.They’re not actually designed for the future\nstate.I think like, Airbnb is like the perfect example.Harry Sudock (08:42):\nAirbnb is like the perfect company to haveas minimal balance sheet as humanly possible,\nor all that money into building two sidedmarketplace and let’s let the balance sheet\nheadaches live on the host’s desk.Because we all agree that dealing with that\npiece of it, owning that hard asset, doingthe thing, it’s a pain.What they’re really doing is like value\nchain hacking.Harry Sudock (09:10):\nThey’re saying like, “Here’s a valuechain that traditionally would accrue over\nhere to the real estate.We’re going to have that traditional approach\nand we’re going to try to pull all of thatvalue accrual into this matching engine.”They’re basically pulling it into this liquid\nplace within that traditional business model.Kudos to them.They build a generational business, it’s\nincredible, but it’s very much a creatureof 2013 to 2020, clearly early 2020.Harry Sudock (09:41):\nThen the other, which is an example that Imuch don’t respect is just like the WeWork\nplaybook, where WeWork is like the screamingexample of money is hilariously tucci.If you’re allowed to do this, if your board\nof directors lets you do this, then the interestrates aren’t accurate and the risk models\nare wrong.Good on you [inaudible 00:10:08] he did a\ngreat Stanford Business School speech wherehe said, “The playbook,” I think he presents\nhis own problems and he’s a challengingperson to wrap your head around generally,\nbut he’s exactly right in this speech, becauseof the moment that he gives the speech in\nwhich is, his point is getting money.Harry Sudock (10:23):\nWhy?Because it’s free.So if you’re not just going out and raising\nas much money as humanly possible at thatpoint in time, whether it’s debt or it’s\nequity, or it’s an ICO or whatever the casemay be, everyone’s giving it away for free.Go get yours, and make sure you sit down before\nthe music stops.EOS and Block.one are a great example of this.They raised $4 billion and paid out 20, some\nodd million dollar SEC fine.You don’t think the money is too cheap?Preston Pysh (10:51):\nLet’s pull the thread on this.So when we think about this cost of capital\nbeing nothing, effectively, and you thinkabout how everyone’s maneuvering, we’ve\nseen the Michael Saylor playbook, but froma mining business standpoint, they’re crazy\nnot to go out there and be borrowing as muchof this as possible in order to buy more hardware\nand put it to work.So are you seeing more companies here in the\nStates, anywhere in the world, it doesn’treally matter, using that playbook of the\nrates are manipulated.So let’s take advantage of it while we can\nand conduct this speculative attack on fiatcurrency?Harry Sudock (11:29):\nI don’t see it in practice yet.I see the edge of it.I think people are 5% of the way into that\nstrategy you just described, and I think thatone of the reasons that I love mining so much\nis that it is a really hardcore meritocracy.It’s a hardcore meritocracy from the standpoint\nthat it’s actually challenging businessto build and operate.So you may be able to roll … The way that\nMichael Saylor is rolling out this attackstrategy is much, much easier to execute,\nbecause all he has to do is go buy Bitcoin.That’s the playbook.Harry Sudock (12:01):\nRaise money, buy Bitcoin.He doesn’t care how the money is raised,\nwhether it’s equity, debt, convert.Preston Pysh (12:06):\nThey’re happy to give it to him.Harry Sudock (12:09):\nFor sure.So I think like that version of the attack\nis a lot easier to bring to market maturity,where even if there was as much demand to\nbring a similar strategy to market and mining,I just think the execution is way harder.Preston Pysh (12:22):\nYeah.Because you’re having to know where you’re\nat in the cycle and just there’s a lot moremoving parts to this.So tell us some of your thoughts on all these\nmoving parts?Harry Sudock (12:33):\nI want to use the counter again, just fora moment and say the worst thing that can\nhappen to Mike Saylor is that Bitcoin goesdown and stays down.Way down, like 90 plus percent for a protracted\nperiod of time.Preston Pysh (12:45):\nHe’s got five year notes.So he needs it to be down for a very long\ntime.Harry Sudock (12:51):\nHe needs Bitcoin to do something it’s neverdone.In mining, there’s a lot of other places\nwhere the business models break on an interimbasis.So you’re subject to, let’s just use a\nbunch of examples.The machines you buy don’t work, you raise\n$100 million in some Michael Saylor stylefunding event and you go buy S7 teams, and\nlet’s just assume this is early ’19.The S7 teams had an incredibly high failure\nrate, and Bitmain did their best to basicallystring you along until warranty period rolled\nover, and you get what you get and you don’tget upset.So there was a blend between hardware quality\nrisk, and counterparty good behavior riskthat has nothing to do with borrowing money\nand buying hardware.Preston Pysh (13:39):\nSo my immediate thought when I’m hearingthis story is like so okay, for people that\naren’t familiar, Bitmain is over in China.So you’re just looking at hardware manufacturing,\nin general.With the China ban and with examples like\nthe one you just provided, I would think there’smassive demand for hardware that’s not being\nproduced inside of China.Is that the case?Are you seeing some hardware manufacturers\ntrying to migrate out of there?Talk to us about that industry.Harry Sudock (14:09):\nWell, I think it’s important to double clickon why you don’t want the machines to be\nmade in China.I break it down into three major categories.One of them is straight up tariff risk.Buying machine out of China is 25% more expensive\nthan a machine not made in China.Apples to apples.The second is jurisdiction, litigation stuff.So you send them money, they renege on a contract,\nwhere do you sue them?Preston Pysh (14:39):\nYou don’t.Harry Sudock (14:40):\nYou don’t.Or you’d go to China, you try to sue them,\nhundreds of thousands of dollars, millionsof dollars in legal bills later, you hope\nyou win.Do they pay you for legal fees in Chinese\ncourts?I don’t know.I don’t care to know.So the second is really that you don’t have\na lot of recourse.The third is some kind of intervention of\nsome kind that blows up the deal.We’ve seen it from a governance perspective\nwithin Bitmain.Harry Sudock (15:04):\nSo those who aren’t familiar with theircorporate governance structure, there’s\nbeen a lot of upheaval that’s gone on withintheir corporate structure, they’ve forked\ntheir company.I’d get into the Bitmain conversation, but\nthe truth of the matter is, they still makea really good machine.So, I’m of these two minds that like, you’re\nonboarding counterparty risk by dealing withthem, but you’re also dealing with the best\nmanufacturer.Harry Sudock (15:27):\nIt’s this duality where like, you got tobuy enough to satisfy your growth, but you’ve\ngot to manage those procurement channels prettycarefully to protect yourself from the bad\nscenarios.We run Bitmain machines.We continue to buy and run Bitmain machines.We think they make a good machine, but navigating\na business relationship with them take savvyand takes skill, and it’s part of why you\ncan’t just jump into this thing.Preston Pysh (15:51):\nNow, are you seeing any change or any guidancethat’s being put out in the future now that\nChina has their ban in place, as far as forBitmain, specifically, or any other Chinese\nmanufacturer?Harry Sudock (16:03):\nI think that it’s too early to tell.We don’t have anything super definitive\nthat they’re going to cut their volumesby 50%.We don’t see anything like that.We see that they’re looking to sell more\nmachines, demand for hash continues to behigh but there’s complexity to all of that.We’ve heard some reports around dropping\nexisting production quantities so that someof the existing orders or pre orders can migrate\nelsewhere.Harry Sudock (16:29):\nThis is also part of the challenge, wherethe way that the manufacture is they forward\nsell so many of those machines.They’re selling a year ahead, even longer\nfrom time to time.That allows for a lot of different stuff to\nhappen, especially in a businesses as dynamicas mining and as an industry that 24/7 is\nBitcoin.A lot can happen in 12 months, as we’ve\nseen time and time again.Preston Pysh (16:52):\nLet’s say the worst case scenario playsout and China just shuts Bitmain down.No more of this, you’re not making any more\nof these things.The company is toast.What does that mean for the market?What does that mean for the hash rate?Just like, if that scenario were to play out,\nwhat would that mean for you guys?Harry Sudock (17:10):\nIt would put a lot of pressure on the usedmarket.Preston Pysh (17:13):\nSo you’d be paying prices way higher thanwhat they’re going for today?Harry Sudock (17:17):\nI think…Preston Pysh (17:20):\nHow about the hash rate in general?Harry Sudock (17:22):\nThe hash rate would still rise?There’s other manufacturers, and more than\nlikely, I would expect … So TSMC and Samsung,which are the two chip foundries are both\nnot on Mainland China.So the ability to produce chips would still\n… No impact there.It’s really about the [crosstalk 00:17:41]\nof the corporate structure, and there’soutside of mainland assembly as well.So there are paths that would be achievable\nfrom a supply chain standpoint.It would be disruptive, for sure.I think that we would … It’s a hard thing\nto speculate on.There’s a lot of moving pieces around where\nit could go.Our assumption is that there’s a lot of\nmarket demand for hash, enough demand wherealternative supply chains would be re-established\nover time.Preston Pysh (18:09):\nAnd they would strengthen over time.Harry Sudock (18:10):\nAnd they would strengthen over time.I think we’re already seeing that.We’re seeing, whatever, 40 some odd billion\ndollars invested in US foundries.The price of machines would go up, because\nthe price of labor and component parts mightgo up, but there are pathways to continue\nto produce significant amounts of ASICS thatdon’t involve Mainland China’s involvement.Preston Pysh (18:30):\nSo let’s go back, I don’t know, 60, 90days, and the China announcement comes out.I know my personal opinion when I saw the\nheadline, I just kind of rolled my eyes andwas like, “Yeah, sure.Yeah, right.”Like seen this story multiple times in the\npast.There’s no way this is real.I guess my first question for you is like,\nwhat was your interpretation?I see you nodding your head, but then from\na company standpoint, from a mining companystandpoint, how did you guys start to interpret\nit as it started to look like oh, no, holdon a second, this might be real.Harry Sudock (19:05):\nSo, umber one is we’ve seen this story before.We’ve heard about China banning Bitcoin,\nbanning Bitcoin mining every 30 days for thelast three years.So our first instinct was not to take it too\nseriously.We’ve been taking China regulation a little\nmore seriously, since we’ve seen … InnerMongolia really did go through significant\nreductions in hash rate prior to this.So there was some provincial pressure that\nwe’d seen, that was real and significant.Harry Sudock (19:33):\nSo our instinct, obviously was to say, “Let’ssee if it’s real.Not giving us any credence right away at all,”\nbut we had seen at the province level effectiveregulation in some regions already and quite\nquickly, it became clear that this was happening.We were hearing and seeing real panic.The other thing that we don’t want to let\nget memory hold too quickly is that we’dseen the significant disruption to the coal\nsector, where there’d already been a 10plus percent reduction in hash rate … Forget\nif it was weeks or months earlier, where therewas a coal plant that significantly malfunctioned.Harry Sudock (20:12):\nSo they ran a series of tests across all ofthe plants in that region over the next, I\nthink it was maybe 10 or 12 days, and we saw10 to 15% of hash reduce during that difficulty\nadjustment as well.It came back towards the end of the adjustment.Preston Pysh (20:29):\nYes, yes.Harry Sudock (20:29):\nSo there were signs prior to this, that weshould A, be sizing the reduction in hash,\nmaybe more aggressively than we would havethought otherwise.So, that was the first piece and the second\nwas that these markets were more vulnerableand susceptible to black swans, whether they\nbe in the energy generation piece, or fromthe regulation, we should be taking that more\nseriously, than we have historically.Harry Sudock (20:54):\nSo we quickly digested that this was real.Frankly, my first thought was, this is really\nchallenging.No doubt every miner is competing with every\nother miner, but having now gone through multiplecycles with Griid and having stood up significant\noperations with Griid, we have compassionfor other operators.This is a really hard business.Harry Sudock (21:16):\nSo to have built your business in a placewith regulatory vulnerability, and to see\nthat vulnerability get played out, throughno fault of the business that you run and\nbuilt, it sucks.We have friends with close ties to some Chinese\nminers and we feel there is capitalistic andaggressive and competitive business owners\nand operators as you can ask for.So we recognize that they’re no different\nthan us and we compete with them like anyother miner, not like a Chinese miner.Preston Pysh (21:46):\nSo Harry, if you could put on your hat asif you are one of these participants over\nin China that are going through this regulatorysituation, how do you think they were thinking\nthrough how they solved their situation, asfar as selling their rigs, as far as getting\nthem out of the country.Walk us through that thought process and how\nthey were probably handling it in the highestprobability way that you would suspect what\nthe typical miner in China was thinking.Harry Sudock (22:17):\nIn my experience with how they think and operate,and they don’t think and operate one way.There are a huge segment of this market.They operate all over different provinces\nwith all different kinds of energy relationships.Their families own the coal plants that they’re\noperating out of.Some of them are building out a bilateral\nagreement with a hydro dam.So there’s a really wide range of how these\nminers are actually running their operations.I think the first is like, you should have\nbeen planning for this already.Preston Pysh (22:44):\nDo you think most were?Harry Sudock (22:46):\nThe biggest were.I think that like with everything, there’s\na barbell.The biggest were planning for this already,\nthe smallest might go unnoticed, but it’sthat sort of middle 50 to 70%, that are in\nthe danger zone of not being big enough tofully invest in diversification, but also\nbeing too big to escape the Eye of Sauron.I think for that cohort, it’s seeing where\ncan I move these things outside the countryand how can I be first?Being first or last.Rushed for the door.So first order of business would be speed,\nhow do I move the rigs?Second order of business is, what price can\nI get for the rigs and try to sell them?Somehow we be at the front of that order book.Preston Pysh (23:31):\nDo you think many were trying to move theircompany so they’re trying to retain the\nrigs, or are they just trying to get themout the door?Then also, how are they managing their own\npersonal balance sheet, which I would imagineis heavily denominated in Bitcoin?Harry Sudock (23:44):\nI think that the most common behavior is thoserigs are in storage.There’s just dry powder, so to speak, that\na lot of folks don’t like the pricing they’regetting to sell them.They don’t have a place to move them, because\n… We’ll get into a lot of this, but Ithink that the shift has moved dramatically\nfrom hardware premium to rack space premium.Preston Pysh (24:07):\nYou’re saying for all the ones buying therig.So they didn’t have the infrastructure in\nplace outside of China in order to buy [crosstalk00:24:16].Wow, interesting.Harry Sudock (24:18):\nNo, there’s no rack space to confuse machines.There’s a ripple effect.So then you say, “Why isn’t there enough\nrack space?”Some mixture of the inability to execute on\nbuilding out the locations or the inabilityto design enough scaled power contracts.So now you run into all of the normal supply\nchain problems that we’re seeing acrossused cars and other industries.Preston Pysh (24:39):\nYou’re not going to buy those rigs unlessyou know the electrical expense that you’re\nsigning up for whatever that contract is goingto be before buying.I got you.I think the other thing that people that aren’t\nfamiliar with the mining space, the infrastructureitself, like pouring the concrete, having\nthe heating cooling in place, having the buildingitself, all the capex that’s associated\nwith the stuff that just goes beyond the rigitself is massive.Takes a significant long time to establish.We’re talking a year to get some of that\nstuff stood up or six months?Harry Sudock (25:14):\nI think six months is aggressive and I think18 months is conservative, and it depends\non what …. There’s almost reverse economiesof scale.So diseconomies of scale are totally present\nthe bigger the mining operation you’re tryingto build.So the longer lead time items, that lead time\nextends, the higher up the power stack youget.So low voltage transformer used to take like\n12 to 16 weeks, maybe now it’s closer to20 or 30 weeks.Harry Sudock (25:42):\nThat doesn’t talk about sort of a substationtransformer.Those are 18 months in the making, and those\naren’t getting any quicker.They’re not getting shipped any quicker.Boats aren’t moving, ports aren’t seeing\nthe type of throughput that they need to beseeing to achieve this kind of stuff.So the bottlenecks and the supply chain, other\nthan the minor are significant and growing.So trying to get another 100 megawatts stood\nup, there’s 1,000 megawatts trying to getout of China.So the ability to build the rack space for\nall of this new supply is not easy.Preston Pysh (26:18):\nMan, that’s not something that I consideredwas just how much time is associated with\ndoing that.Now what I want to get back to is in China,\nso if you’re one of these companies thathad just tons of rigs, correct me if I’m\nwrong, but this is like half of the entirehardware infrastructure for the Bitcoin network\nthat’s been turned off.Harry Sudock (26:36):\nYes.Preston Pysh (26:37):\nSo half the rigs are in storage is what you’resaying.You think a majority of them went to, mostly\nbecause they didn’t have a buyer at theprice that the person would be willing to\nsell it for, they would just rather get sometype of storage and put them in the storage\nuntil they can find the right buyer and theright price to offload it.Some of them have left.Where are some of the locations that those\nhave gone to?Harry Sudock (27:02):\nI’m seeing a lot of noise around Kazakhstan.Even though they’ve introduced a new sort\nof Bitcoin minor power contract tariff ofa quarter cent per kilowatt hour, we’re\nstill seeing a lot of volumes migrate there,but those supply chain problems, those are\ncountry agnostic.They’re a little easier to overcome in some\ncountries, because they have different electricalstandards, but I think that by and large,\nit’s hard to build rig-ready rack space,for miners.So we’re seeing Kazakhstan, we’re seeing\na ton to US.Harry Sudock (27:32):\nEven though we don’t have the ability toplug it all in right away, what is available\nis coming here.So really, what’s interesting is we’re\nseeing updates to deal structures.So the folks who were able to get their machines\nout of China, and they want to retain interestin them, they’re striking much more creative,\nmuch more hosting friendly deals in the US,or partnership friendly.Harry Sudock (27:55):\nI don’t know that I would call all of ithosting, but for the folks that are hosting,\nit’s an opportunity to sign way above marketpower prices.So what used to be a four or five or six cent\nrate, all of a sudden is a 9, 10, 11 centrate, which is crazy, and introduces a bunch\nof interesting price vulnerability to someof these mining operations.If hash rises and price falls, or if hash\nrises and price rises slower, or hash staysthe same and price falls, all of a sudden\nthe machines that are at a higher marginalprofit than they would have been otherwise.Preston Pysh (28:33):\nIt’s a short term game at that point.Harry Sudock (28:35):\nExactly.So for us at Griid, we’ve always had the\nsame pieces, which is we’re vertically integrated,and we self mine, full stop.That’s what we do.We build rack space for ourselves, we plug\nin our own machines, like we talked aboutearlier.It’s a balance sheet game and one of the\nbeautiful things about being a Bitcoin mineris that the ASICs you purchase are just like\nlittle baby Bitcoin bonds.Harry Sudock (28:58):\nSo their value is largely associated withthe price of Bitcoin, because their future\ncash flow streams are Bitcoin.So we love being an asset-heavy business in\na market that you still love asset-light,because it gives us this opportunity to build\nthese multiple compounding layers that arehighly correlated to Bitcoin price.Harry Sudock (29:18):\nSo we saw all this migration happening andwe said, “Well, we liked being a self miner\nwho’s vertically integrated before doubledown.Let’s do more.We want to do more of this.We think that more value is going to accrue\nto our business model.”What we’ve seen is other folks have woken\nup to this strategy, but that’s why we’vebeen building the whole business this way\nwith this in our DNA for two years.Preston Pysh (29:45):\nAny other comments about the lens from theChinese miners?From a business standpoint?Harry Sudock (29:51):\nI think really, it’s this introduction offragility into the unit economics that they’re\nnow going to see which is, they used to buythree cent power in China, a US hosting used\nto be five or six cents.They come to the US, and now they’ve got\nnine cent power, and they’re giving up whatever,a 10% or 20%-Preston Pysh (30:10):\nOh, yeah.That’s brutal-Harry Sudock (30:11):\nProfit share.So you’re getting crushed on both ends and\nwhat used to be totally immovable hash isnow pretty fragile hash relative to the unit\neconomics of the network.So something I’m watching closely is, what\ndo we start to see around those rigs if thefavorability of Bitcoin economics and mining\nchange, and how do we win those deals?Preston Pysh (30:36):\nSo Harry, I’ve always had the thesis thatthe hash rate is really setting the floor\non the price action.Just if we were thinking about gold, and gold’s\nreaching a steady stock, the flow issuanceand demand and all that kind of stuff, you’re\ngoing to get to really what’s the productioncost to pull this out of the ground that would\nreally set your floor price.So when we’re thinking about Bitcoin, and\nwe’re thinking about half of that network,half of that hardware that’s conducting\nthis mining has now moved to a location wherethe price to the electrical expense to put\nthis into the market is significantly higherthan where it came from.Are you of the opinion that this might favorably\nimpact the underlying price or that floorprice that Bitcoin might achieve on the cycle\nthat we’re currently in?Harry Sudock (31:27):\nIt’s a good question.It’s hard to speculate on what price will\ndo over time.I think that it’s not an unreasonable thesis.I think that there are folks who might take\nprofits at levels in other environments thatno longer can, because there is no profit\nto take, but I think it cuts both ways.So if you have a higher cost structure on\nyour mining, you’re selling more coin tofund operations.Harry Sudock (31:50):\nOn the other hand, you’re selling less coinsto take profits into, potentially, or maybe\nyou always kept all your profit in Bitcoinbut I think there’s evidence both ways on\nthat.So I think that a higher cost of production\n… Net net.A higher cost of production means selling\nmore Bitcoin.Preston Pysh (32:06):\nIt’s kind of interesting, and you hear alot of arguments and I think we’re hitting\nat this a little bit is does price followhash or does hash follow price.When I’m thinking about which one of those\ntwo are leading the other, I see it more asthis homeostasis between the two, like they\nhave this tethered relationship with eachother, where sometimes the ones driving the\nother and sometimes it’s the other way around.I’m curious to hear some of your thoughts\non that idea as well.It’s just like, which one of those two is\ndriving the other?Harry Sudock (32:37):\nSo I think that price drives hash at the tails,basically.Preston Pysh (32:43):\nWhen you say at the tails, what do you meanby that?Harry Sudock (32:46):\nSo I mean that when bitcoin price precipitouslyfalls during COVID Black Thursday, that drives\nhash.That says to people, I need to turn my machines\noff, I’m worried about paying for power.Similarly, when bitcoin price goes from 10,000\nto 60,000, people say, “If I don’t pluga machine into my garage, that’s the cheapest\nway for me to mine a Bitcoin, not to buy it.”Harry Sudock (33:11):\nSo I think when we see the most extreme priceaction, it drives, maybe not irrational, but\nit drives extreme behavior with regard tomining.I think the chart is most clear, when you\nlook at Black Thursday.You saw a price come down, borderline 50%\nand you saw hash drop double digit into the20s. 20 to 20, some 30% on a very short term\nbasis, and people panicked.Harry Sudock (33:36):\nI think you saw the same … The problem is,is that hash coming online lags, hash coming\noffline is real time.So the way to try to correlate price and hash\non the upside is with bitcoin price and machineprice, rather than bitcoin price and hash\nrate.Because with hash rate, we just talked about\nit, there’s significant lead times of plugginganything new in at scale.Harry Sudock (34:00):\nSo I can’t say, “Oh, Bitcoin went from30 to 60.Time to plug in all those machines I’ve\njust been sitting on.Oh, maybe now it’s time to kick off purchase\norders for transformers.Now it’s time to engage with my general\ncontractor.Now it’s time to work with my electrical\nengineering team to start plotting out expansionwithin existing operations.I got to go back to negotiate with power producers.”Harry Sudock (34:20):\nSo there’s a lot of levers that have toget pulled to bring net new hash online.I’ll pull all those levers, [inaudible 00:34:27]\nbut that doesn’t mean that the hash is goingto come online any shorter than 90 days, but\non the way down, shut the machines out.Preston Pysh (34:36):\nI just want to go back to the China pieceone more time.So this was a common question that we saw\nfrom people online is how confident are wethat we’re actually seeing rigs leave China\nor it’s like a theory that people have thatChina might have just made it appear like\nthey’re turning off the rig, but they’rereally going to be there for some type of\nattack into the future.So I’m kind of curious … Yeah, I’m with\nyou.I’m kind of curious what percent of that\nhardware do you think is actually leavingthe country right now?So we both talked earlier that 50% of the\nhardware was in China.How much of that 50% is staying versus leaving?Harry Sudock (35:13):\nI’ll caveat and say leaving thus far.So I bet you we’ve seen one in five of those\nmachines leave.Preston Pysh (35:21):\n20% of what was there.Harry Sudock (35:23):\nYeah, 10% total network, 20% of what shutoff and that’s because we’re having conversations\nwith folks that are trying to move machines.This is still a pretty small club of folks\nwho mined Bitcoin at scale.A, we’re seeing it in pricing.So if those machines weren’t really leaving,\nwe wouldn’t have seen prices in machinescome down so far.B, we’re seeing the network recover.Those machines are going somewhere.Our feeling is they’re coming to the US\nand they’re going to Eastern Europe.Preston Pysh (35:50):\nSo this one was pretty politically chargedand got a lot of people in the community,\npretty emotional and that’s the Mining Council.I’m curious to hear what your thoughts are\non the Mining Council, and then I’m alsocurious to hear your thoughts on Elon Musk’s\npiece about Tesla no longer accepting Bitcoin,because of the high energy costs.How are you seeing that as somebody in the\nmining industry?Harry Sudock (36:18):\nIt’s a tough topic.The Bitcoin Mining Council, so long as the\nobjective is opt-in data disclosures, is agood thing.Preston Pysh (36:28):\nIt’s no harm no foul.If people want to provide their data, they\ncan.If they don’t want to, then they don’t\nhave to and there’s no anybody holding agun to anybody’s head saying they have to\ndo it.Harry Sudock (36:38):\nExactly, and these were two questions thatgot asked at their first.It was like first, either monthly or quarterly\n… They did a Twitter Spaces.The two questions that Pete McCormack asked\nthat I was really grateful for were, numberone is, can anyone join the Bitcoin Mining\nCouncil no matter the energy mix that theyuse?And the answer is yes.Number two is, does this group commit to never\nlobbying for legislation around the energymix that Bitcoin miners should be using, or\nshould we regulate against?And the answer was similarly, we’re not\nhere to drive legislation on any of this.We’re here to provide opt-in voluntary data\ndisclosures and from that perspective, I thinkit’s awesome.Harry Sudock (37:23):\nI think providing tools to the community tomake fact-based arguments around how this\nindustry works is a really positive thing.I think that the minute you try to get into,\n“Hey, I just heard about Bitcoin, and I’mhere to fix it,” or, “Hey, we want to\ncenter green blocks and clean blocks and aBitcoin is a Bitcoin except for that one,”\nthat’s the type of stuff that doesn’twork in this network.Preston Pysh (37:47):\nI think the thing that got everyone so excitedabout it is just they were having flashbacks\nto the summer of 2017 with the Bitcoin Cash-Harry Sudock (37:56):\nNew York Agreement-Preston Pysh (37:56):\nOh, yeah, the big New York Agreement.So I think that’s where a lot of it was\nstemming from and at the same time, you kindof breathe energy into this ESG FUD that’s\nout there by just talking about, well, where’dyou get your source from.So I can understand that side of it to where\npeople are upset that they’re even doingit because when you look at the trend, and\nwe’re both well aware of the trend, andthe direction that this is going to go, which\nis the person who can get the energy the cheapestis going to be the ones that are really driving\nthe train in the future.Preston Pysh (38:29):\nSo with that, let’s talk a little bit aboutgeothermal.I know the El Salvador piece with the mining\nthe volcanoes was just a huge story.Everyone’s got volcanoes in their Twitter\nhandles and stuff.What are some of your thoughts on that?Where do you see that going?Is it really that cheap of electricity that’s\nbeing produced out of these volcanoes or anyother type of geothermal activity?I’m just curious to hear how you view it.Harry Sudock (38:55):\nI want to click out one level and just talkabout what goes into choosing a jurisdiction\nfor a miner, which I think is maybe not wellunderstood yet.This is … Forgive any talking to my own\nbook, but we’re of the opinion that theUS is the best place in the world to mine\nBitcoin.Preston Pysh (39:11):\nBecause of the lack of vulnerabilities-Harry Sudock (39:13):\nMore than that.Preston Pysh (39:14):\nOh, really?Harry Sudock (39:15):\nMore than that.We think that if you are in the business of\nconverting energy to money, the best placeto do it is here and that’s for a number\nof different reasons.One of those reasons is that we’ve got an\nincredible electric grid that has its wattsor caught outage this year, and it has its\npolitical warts, where state representativesfrom my beautiful state of New York are concerned.At the end of the day, our ability to deliver\nenergy across this country is a modern marvel.Harry Sudock (39:45):\nIt has challenges but we deliver power withmore reliability to 340 or 50 million people\nevery day, which it’s an astounding featof engineering and we’ve designed that system\nin such a way where there are huge pocketsof over engineering that are begging for revenue\nenhancement in the form of a Bitcoin miningpower relationship.Harry Sudock (40:08):\nYou layer into that we are still the bestplace to form capital, we’re still the best\nplace to protect property rights and takea bad actor to court.We’re the ideal business environment for\nBitcoin mining, as far as I’m concerned,and we’ve got a lot of runway before that\nthesis is maximized.So we are heavily, heavily invested in the\nfuture growth of Bitcoin mining in the US.Harry Sudock (40:32):\nWe think this is the place to do it.We’ve had conversations with half a dozen\nother countries that are really exciting placesto also mine Bitcoin, and we haven’t been\nconvinced that that’s a better place todo it.That being said, El Salvador, other areas\nof South America that have truly abundantsources of energy, are really, really good\nelectrical priced places.Preston Pysh (40:52):\nThe geothermal, like the volcano.So how much are they able to get it for you?You were quoting 2 cents, 5 cents earlier.Where are we at with something like that?Harry Sudock (41:01):\nMy guess is that they’re able to get itfor 2 cents or lower.Preston Pysh (41:04):\nWow.Harry Sudock (41:05):\nI haven’t talked to anybody from El Salvadorand ask them for a power purchase agreements.This is pure speculation, but I think that\nthere’s a number of different countriesin south America, geothermal, hydro as the\ntwo sources in particular, where I think thatsub 2 cent power is probably achievable.Preston Pysh (41:21):\nSo when we fast forward 10 years into thefuture, 15 years into the future, these locations\nthat have these naturally occurring, justabundant, ridiculously abundant energy, these\nare going to be the hubs.These are going to be the financial hubs of\nwhere Bitcoin is distributed at a geographiclocation of where those coins are going to\ninitially flow into.Now, whether the ownership is of the business\nthat owns them, is there where the hardwareis located is maybe not necessarily going\nto be the case, but as far as the locationwhere the hardware is at, that’s going to\nbe it, correct?Harry Sudock (41:57):\nIt is correct.I think of Bitcoin mining, it’s basically\nlike a giant egg crate and you basically throwa glass of water onto the egg crate and if\nyou give it enough time, the water settlesat the lowest points in the egg crate.That’s where the miners will end up in the\nlong-term in the steady state.The scenario you introduce is actually, again,\ntheoretically, very interesting.There’s a huge premium right now on mining\nthe soonest Bitcoin, not necessarily miningfor the longest, where in 10 years, there’s\nmany fewer Bitcoins available to you per megawatthour of energy purchased or per terahash unit\ncontributed to the network.So in our opinion, time premium is actually\nbigger than marginal energy cost premium atthe edges.That doesn’t mean go buy 7 cent power for\nus.Preston Pysh (42:53):\nIt also speaks to the regulatory vulnerabilitybeing probably one of the biggest factors\nright now in the near term.As you’re thinking about capturing as many\ncoins as possible in the near term versusin the future, it’s everybody’s going\nto allow it because they’d be crazy notto, as they’re trying to compete with this\nglobal money that’s made its way throughthe entire global economy.Harry Sudock (43:17):\nExactly.Preston Pysh (43:17):\nInteresting.Harry Sudock (43:19):\nThe thing with Bitcoin is that it’s prettyeasy, or not easy.It is reasonable to predict the 20 year future.It is utterly impossible to predict a two\nyear future.Preston Pysh (43:29):\nTalk to us about, I don’t know how familiaror well versed you are on this, but Blockstream\njust came out with a note that’s associatedwith their mining and this was in order to\nraise capital so they could buy hardware,buy infrastructure.Then the amount of coins that are being mined\nwith that hardware, because it’s tied tothe hashing power, like whatever amount that\nyou buy the note for has an associated hashingamount that comes with it.Then whatever Bitcoin, they were able to mine\nwith that over a three-year period of time,you’re able to collect that in Bitcoin.Preston Pysh (44:02):\nYou’re going to receive that back as yourcoupon.This seems like a really, really innovative\nway to structure the cost of hardware andalso structure the operational risk.All of those things, all wrapped into this\nreally unique financial instrument.I’m curious if you’re seeing other businesses\nthat are looking at doing something similarto this, or just your thoughts in general,\non that type of vehicle.Harry Sudock (44:29):\nThere’s two financial products wrapped upinto one in your question.One of them is how do miners reliably engage\nin capital formation to buy hardware.That’s really expensive.These are not a traditional VC backed business.We certainly aren’t.I think we’ll achieve sort of VC backable\nreturns, but because Bitcoin does half thework and we do have to work.So as long as that relationship exists, we’re\na weird business.Harry Sudock (44:57):\nReally what we’re best fit for is like abunch of project finance, but that doesn’t\nreally exist at maturity yet because the pricingof the future Bitcoin cash flows isn’t seen\nas safe enough, I think in a lot of capitalmarkets.So I think that what Blockstream is doing\nA, is really good for the investors.I think people taking on mining risk and receiving\ntheir coupon in Bitcoin is awesome.I think it’s really valuable.It’s an exciting financial product.Harry Sudock (45:22):\nSo they’re solving capital formation inan interesting way.The other instrument that they’re in the\nprocess of solving for is how do I hedge difficultyand how do I hedge Bitcoin price, and there’ve\nbeen a lot of swings at this that a bunchof different people have taken, but really\nwhat people want to do is they want to be… And I’m speaking from the perspective\nof the miner, is they want to be long difficultyand they want to be short Bitcoin price.Preston Pysh (45:52):\nI need to wrap my head around that.They want to be long difficulty and short\nBitcoin price?Harry Sudock (45:59):\nYeah.A miner’s, natural position, I buy rig,\nI plug in rig, I mine Bitcoin.You’re short difficulty because your Bitcoin\nyield goes up when difficulty goes down.So you’re naturally shorter and your long\nBitcoin, because your ASIC is correlated toBitcoin and your revenues are obviously Bitcoin\ndenominated.So the way you hedge that is with a product\nthat gets you long difficulty and short price.Preston Pysh (46:26):\nI got you.Your returns aren’t going to be nearly as\ngood as just buying the underlying, but ifyou’re looking for something that removes\nthe volatility out of Bitcoin, you’re goingto achieve it through owning something like\nthis, but it’s going to be at a lower return.Harry Sudock (46:41):\nExactly.So ideally this would be a product that you\nwould be able to roll out for whatever percentageof your COGS … Your business needs to achieve\nreliably.Then it’s about how much of a haircut are\nyou willing to take to achieve stability onyour COGS, cost of goods sold.Preston Pysh (47:00):\nGot it.Hey, so we had a question on Twitter.A person was asking, “What’s the hottest\ntopic right now in passive cooling and wherethe technology is heading to.”Harry Sudock (47:14):\nThis is a very technical question.It’s a very interesting one, but the question\nis really what is the best way to design aBitcoin mining facility.That’s really what’s being asked here.It’s being asked around, how do you cool\nand there’s sort of a two-prong school ofthought, which is air cool versus liquid cool.We think that air cooled can really work effectively,\nbut not everywhere.So we’re seeing a ton of machines come online\nin Texas from a lot of different operators,and there’s certainly areas within the ERCOT\ngrid within west Texas that needs liquid cool,immersion cooling to function effectively.Harry Sudock (47:53):\nSo our expectation is that that’s goingto be an area of growth.We’re excited about where it’s headed,\nbut we want to make sure to be part of thegroup that gets it right, not that tries to\nget it early.Preston Pysh (48:04):\nIt just shows, I think the question reallydemonstrates to people just how complex all\nof the considerations that you have to makeas you’re trying to allocate the free cash\nflows of your business, while constantly offsettingthem with just the price of Bitcoin and retaining\nyour earnings in Bitcoin.Right now is a perfect example where we just\nhad the price get down to like 30,000 now.Preston Pysh (48:30):\nI’m looking at the price right now.Evidently, it just went up to 40,000.I see your eyes just lit up.It’s back to 38.The thing’s all over the place.It’s so volatile and you’re trying to\nget that timing right of like this preciousthing that you’re mining and you’re trying\nto retain at all costs, but you also wantto keep buying more rigs so that you can get\nmore of this stuff and that equation is anythingbut simple, especially when you’re talking\nabout like, well, so what does the coolingget you as far as being able to run the machine\nharder?Oh my Lord, it’s just so complex.It’s amazing.Harry Sudock (49:08):\nThe beauty of this business is, and what youjust described is why I have so much respect\nfor anybody operating mining at scale, isjust that there are no experts yet.The most expert people have been around for\nfour, five, six years.What other business has the most seasoned\nveterans with five years experience?Nobody.Preston Pysh (49:29):\nNobody.Exactly.Harry Sudock (49:32):\nYou know about the history of airplanes.What did the airplane industry look like five\nyears in, relative to today?Preston Pysh (49:38):\nRelative to today.It’s just laughable-Harry Sudock (49:40):[inaudible 00:49:40]\nand we’re there.So my perspective is that truly mature, industrial\nscale, future proof, Bitcoin miners are gettingforged today, but that operations don’t\nlook like that yet.There’s a tremendous amount of money to\nbe made.There’s a tremendous amount of capital formation\nrequired to do it, but the people operatingthese businesses successfully are really,\nreally, really, really special and that’snot me.Harry Sudock (50:09):\nThat credit on our team goes to the engineeringfolks, goes to the people writing all of this\nproprietary software, running all of thisdetailed analysis around hardware and mechanical\nengineering.This is a deeply technical business and we’re\nlost without them on our team.Preston Pysh (50:26):\nI really like this question.A person asks the easiest method to shield\nBTC to state grid operators.Harry Sudock (50:33):\nNo megawatt goes unsold.Preston Pysh (50:35):\nSo with that … I love that.How do you involve the bigger players in energy\nproduction like GE Mitsubishi, Siemens?How do you start to get them more involved\nand more excited about this?Because that’s the sell, like you said.What was it?Three or four words.Harry Sudock (50:54):\nThe sell is, show me a detailed breakdownof every hour in the last five years and the\nprice you sold it for and all the ones whereyou didn’t sell them, you got to be honest\nand cop to it.So look at those revenues and compare that\nto a 1% energy mix allocation to Bitcoin mining,and what does that do for financial returns?It’s ridiculous.Preston Pysh (51:15):\nYeah.Especially if you drop it on their balance\nsheet at the price that they mined it.Harry Sudock (51:20):\nExactly.Exactly.That’s the thing.The detractors to Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining\njust aren’t running the numbers.This is a ridiculously valuable business and\nthe reason that it’s so exciting is it’sso transferrable conceptually to massive infrastructure\nacross other areas of the grid, of energygeneration, of utilities, of all the ONG stuff\nthat’s going on.So the sell for Bitcoin to a hedge fund is\npretty easy.The sell for Bitcoin mining to an energy operator\nshould be easy.Preston Pysh (51:59):\nBut you’re saying it’s not.Harry Sudock (52:04):\nTo me, it’s like the same thing that wejust talked about with the way that Mike Saylor\nis able to enact his capital formation, Bitcoinallocation strategy, versus why a miner can’t\ndo it as easily.There’s operational risks, there’s business\nrisks, there’s volatility risks.That’s harder to tolerate in our business\nand that’s why we have levered upside tothe underwire.We get paid for it.Preston Pysh (52:25):\nDo you see them coming around?Has the conversation gotten easier in the\npast year?Harry Sudock (52:29):\nYes.Preston Pysh (52:30):\nIt has.Harry Sudock (52:31):\nWe get inbound at this point.Preston Pysh (52:33):\nOh, that’s awesome.Harry Sudock (52:35):\nI think that there’s a gap in between peoplesaying, “We’re ready to mine Bitcoin directly\nto our balance sheet,” versus, “Hey, canwe develop a relationship with you Griid,\nthe Bitcoin miner to better optimize our energyrevenues.”So we’re still living in the, we generate\nand sell power and we’re living in the worldof we buy power.That’s still the nature of the relationship\nrather than the energy producer saying, “Hey,how do we [inaudible 00:52:59] balance sheet\nand how do we use mining to do it?”Harry Sudock (53:01):\nSo we’re not there yet, but I think thatthe conversation around what role does the\nBitcoin miner play within a stable, reliable,high uptime grid, that has changed dramatically\nand we’ve been at the forefront of that.So when we think about how to make Bitcoin\nmining work in the US, we spend a massiveamount of time investing in our energy relationships,\nand those investments have paid off massively.We love working deeply with energy partners\nand we think that it’s at the core of everythingwe do.Preston Pysh (53:33):\nAll right.Harry, it’s hard for me to believe that\nwe’ve been talking for an hour already,because that went super fast.My last question is for you to pull out your\ncrystal ball here, and everyone wants to knowwhen you think the hash rate is going to reach\na new all-time high, and then I’ll tellyou what my guess is after this.Then when we’re both wrong, probably everyone\ncan tease us.Harry Sudock (53:56):\nYeah, fair.Preston Pysh (53:57):\nlet’s hear it.Harry Sudock (53:59):\nI think that we see new hash rate all timehigh … Let’s just be specific.Does that mean 180X a hash?Preston Pysh (54:06):\nYeah, if that’s whatever the high was before,then yes.I don’t even know what it was and here I\nam guessing.Harry Sudock (54:14):\nLet’s use the data.I’m looking at a seven day average over\nthe last year.The peak on the seven day average was 179.3.I think we returned to that in 10 months.Preston Pysh (54:30):\nAll right.I was going to say Christmas day, but now\nyou got me concerned because you’re a littlebit further out there than me.You’re biasing my original guests.I’ll say Valentine’s day 2022.We’ll see what happens.I’m with you.I think it’s going to take a lot of time\nfor this to come back online.Everything that was shut down in China.So it’s almost like you have to rebuild\nall that hashing that has occurred and whenyou look at how far it’s come down, that\ntook a year to build to where we got to.That was like a year of building hash rate.Preston Pysh (55:04):\nSo it’s going to be interesting to see howlong this takes.I know there’s a lot of people that are\ninterested in knowing when the price is goingto recover back to the previous all time high,\nbut I’m pretty sure we’re going to getthere faster than the hash rate recovery,\nbut who knows.We’ll find out.Any highlights or anything … Any articles\nthat you read that were really interestingor anything that you want to point people\ntowards here at the end?Harry Sudock (55:29):\nI think that the industry really benefitsfrom more people who are fluent around energy.So there’s a great book that’s out there\nright now, and I promise no affiliations calledThe Grid, one I.It’s by Gretchen Bakke.After the colon is, The Fraying Wires Between\nAmericans and Our Energy Future.I think that even if some of your listeners\nare not all the way bought into Bitcoin, whichI don’t know after listening to you how\nthey wouldn’t be, but we all have a hugevested interest in high reliability, high\nstability, energy being available to us.Harry Sudock (56:03):\nIt’s integral to everything we do.It’s part of leading a modern high quality\nlife.So getting more informed around how energy\nis created, how it’s transmitted and howit gets consumed is just a really … I think\nit’s a fundamental coherence building blockfor the modern conversation around energy,\nwhich is bigger than Bitcoin for now, butI think the queen plays a vital role in that\nconversation going forward.Preston Pysh (56:28):\nAwesome.Awesome recommendation.I’m going to pick that up.People, if you want to find a Harry, I’m\ngoing to have a link in the show notes tohis Twitter.What is the handle on Twitter, Harry?Harry Sudock (56:39):\nIt’s @harry_sudock.S-U-D-O-C-K.I welcome all resumes.Preston Pysh (56:46):\nWell, there you go, folks.If you’re interested in working with Harry,\nmake sure you guys follow him on Twitter andwe’re also going to have a link to the book\nrecommendation there as well.Harry, with that, thank you so much for coming\non.I always enjoy these chats.Harry
