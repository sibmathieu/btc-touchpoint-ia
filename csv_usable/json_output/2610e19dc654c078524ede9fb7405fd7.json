the university system howmoney has made ithighly inefficient and how the internetis routing around itsafety and also tells us about howgovernment money has made colleges intoineffective researchinstitutions and how phd students areabused as cheap laborsafety the moose how's everything goingthese daysthings are good jimmy things are goingvery well i'mbusy at work on two books that i've beenworking on for a while nowprinciples of economics a textbook oneconomics andthe fiat standard which is uh the sequelto the bitcoin standardso these are taking up most of my timelike a true academic anduh speaking of which you've been inacademia forquite a while can you tell us the storyof how you got into itand uh what what led you to that roadwell i was i think three years old whenmy parents marched me into kindergartenand i only managed to extricate myselfout of that vicious cycle of dependencyon the academic systemlast year when i quit my job as auniversity professori basically went from kindergarten toschool university back to working at theuniversityup until last year when i quit my job asa university professorand became essentially an independententrepreneurteaching economics on my own website tostudents from all over the world andfocusing on my own writingand research i've developed a lot ofmisgivingsabout the educational system as you andi have discussed and and readers who arefamiliar with my bookwill identify thethe connection here is that i can seethe impact of fake moneyon academia on easy money money that isuhproduced at a low opportunity cost or ata zero opportunity cost almostis quite corrupting of umthe process of academic inquiry it'sit's quite disillusioningand and the outcomes of the process arequite mediocrebecause of that mediocre to start offbeing flattering at leastyeah you're getting into some of theproblems with college education butbefore we get into thatwhy do you think people get into collegeeducation because as far as i can tellthere's a glut of supply there's so manypeople that want to be professorsalmost no job so what what's going onthere why why is there this theimbalancei think ultimately the root cause of theimbalance isgovernment intervention in the academicsystemand of course this is almost sounds likeit's a caricature responsebut you know it also happens to be truein all of these caseswhen you prevent producers and consumersof products from interacting freely withone another you develop all theseartificialrules and restrictions and all theseinterventions in whereintaxpayer money or fiat money is usedto make market decisions effectivelyin the hands of the people who are ableto command money that they haven'tworked forthen you're distorting the institutionfromworking toward the people that issupposedlyintended to serve and turning into aninstitution that works moreto serve the people that are financingit with thelow opportunity cost money yeah there'sdefinitelya lot of money in academia i think iheard like third-party payers oryou know student loan givers likeessentiallyset the agenda in many ways can you talka little bit more aboutthat and many other problems withcollege education today what what iswrong with with the mission that theyoriginally had versus whatstudents are getting yeah well i i guessi i'll umlet's just focus a little bit uh perhapson the way in whichuh the incentives are corrupted perhapsthen we can discuss the consequences ofit because i thinkuh identifying you know contrary tokeynesian believe i iuh to keynesians and keynes who used tothink it's not important to understandthe causes of things it's important tounderstandsolutions i'm one of these old-fashionedpeople whothinks causes matter the ultimatedistortionin in this case to go back to youroriginal question is thatthere's an enormous amount of governmentsubsidy given for college educationand you know we can at some pointthere are all kinds of different umsociological explanations and culturalexplanations of why it is thatgovernment wants to subsidize this thingbutputting all of that aside thinking fromthe economics of itwe have to understand that once you'remaking it so that loansin the college industry are cheaper toacquire and easier to acquirethen you're distorting people'sincentives soif your ability to borrow to start abusiness isdifficult but your ability to borrow togo and get a college degree is mucheasierthis is distorting your economiccalculation you know you're constantlytrying to getprice signals from the market you neverhave fullknowledge and full information of whatis going on you're always trying toyou know make the most out of theknowledge that is available for youwhen these prices are distorted byeffectively by the ability of fiat moneytoenter these markets and distort capitalallocationthen it distorts people's incentives andso more and more people are likely toconsidercollege when getting a loan for collegeis almost like a birthright you know anywell not exactly but i mean it's easierthanother things although the notion ofmaking college debtuh a birthright is popular in some areasi would saybut effectively it is as you and i ithink would agree it iseffectively a form of uh being born intoslavery because you're beingyou're getting everybody into debt forcollege there's always an opportunitycost i think that's really the key thingthere's always an opportunity cost to itanddistorting prices and distortingincentives manipulatespeople people's uh calculations andleads to them making erroneouscalculations and that'swe see it in every market and i see noreason why this would not happen in theeducation marketand in capital markets in general yeahand wewe've seen the growth of colleges mostof themcharge way more money than they used toandin large part because these loans areavailablewhat do you think that does to theactual education experience of thestudentone way to look at it is that whenyou're creatinga bureaucratic incentive for one ofthose thingsit sounds like a nice ideal you knowlet's finance this thing with creditmoney and then we'll have more of it youknow let's financemore college or more hospitals or morehealth healthcare and then we'll getmore of it butreally what you're doing is that you'remanipulating people's economiccalculationthis is definitely true that a lot ofcollegesare able to spend a lot more moneybecause of the existence of thesestudent loanswe've seen in the past uh 20 30 yearshow college tuition has gone uptremendously and they're able toget a tremendous amount of capitalallocationuh you know probably not inproportion to the value that they'reactually providing sohow does that affect the studentexperience how does thatyou know change the incentives for thestudents what ends up happening when yousubsidize any kind of business it startsoff with the nice intentions thatyou know we'd get more college we'd getmore college degrees and so thereforewe'd havebetter qualified labor force and higherproductivity and better incomebut in reality once you've made it sothat it isa government objective for money to bespent in this regardthen you've created a source of incomethat is free from market competitionyou'vecreated a bunch of jobs where people canget a salarywithout having to satisfy customersand you've created incentives for peopleto take onspecific jobs that do not produce valuefor consumer but they are able to securethe funding from the funders and soi think you see this happening inbureaucracies all overand it is outlined byacademic economists from universitieswho apply this frameworkto the study of industries all over theworld andto cartels all over the world buthesitatesomehow for understandable reasons toapply itto their own profession because you knowtheir salaries depended on it what endsup happening in this situation is thatit's possible for a bureaucracy toemergein these institutions whose focusis on continuing to do what is requiredpoliticallyboth in the sense of domestic politicsas well as in the sense ofthe running of the organization itselfrather thansatisfying the consumers you know you'veyou've establisheda a group of jobs that aredetached from the bottom line in a senseand that have different incentivesbecauseit's not about securing the students asmuch as it issecuring the low interest rate loansand so i think if you look throughoutthe years what is happening is thatwe're getting a massive increase in thetuitionthere's also a massive increase in thenumber of degrees and in the number ofuniversitiesand so you would expect that becausewe're getting so many more universitiesthatprices would be dropping you know thesame way we have many moretvs and laptops we're always making morestuff and sothe new stuff the new stuff continues toget cheaper over timeas it gets older you would expect thatwith universities with so manyuniversities out there that you wouldgeta competition that brings down thesupply that you would havea lot more education going on and at alower price but instead what we find isthe price continues to go up part ofthat as we said is because of theavailability of low credit but also ifyou look at the expenses you see thatthe majority ofthe increase in spending in universitieshas gone toward administrative rolesand so the growing politicization of theuniversity and the growing insneed for uh just a large institutionalapparatus in order to make theuniversity continue to runends up becoming just an increase inbureaucratbureaucratic bloat of uh people who areuh dependent uh on these jobs and theydon't necessarily add much value oneidea that keeps coming to coming to meis thatwhy is it that we've not really seenproper entrepreneurshipin university setting emerge like wehaven't seen ina steve jobs of universities we haven'tseen university administrators who havemanagedto get their university to issuegreat degrees at a cheaper price oryou know making these enormous uhimprovements we justsee growing increase in price andeffectively a setting wherebureaucratically and organizationallythe power in the university structure isbecoming more and more in the hands ofthe bureaucracyand the operation of the university ismore about the bureaucracyrather than the professors or thestudents andi think you know the the the excitingthing about theinternet is that um it fixes thiswell so question for you about uh thesecollege administrators uhwhich by every metric they've beengrowing like gangbusters at everycollegewhy is it that when there is a lot morefunds like that that tends to be thecase that you get a lot moreadministratorsum in any sort of organization i knowthis is true forcolleges like we've been talking aboutbut it's also true of governmentof health care of a lot of differentthings it seems like they'rethey almost always kind of show upsomehow whenever youhave a lot of extra money yeah i thinkultimately it's justwhenever you have as i was sayingearlier jobs that are protected fromcompetitionthese these are people get into thosejobs and thentheir incentives are wrapped fromproducing value to consumers and andchanged intofocusing on survival in the institutionyou know you don't have to satisfyconsumers every dayyou're not facing the pressure of theconsumer or at least the pressure fromsomebody who isin your organization facing the consumeryou'refacing increasingly bureaucratic andpolitical pressure for your job and sothe bad thing about those jobs is thatthey're not productive the worst thingis that they can't be eliminated youknow it's a becauseyou can't kill what is uh undead orwhatever it is that that cliche goesthere's you can't deprive those peoplefrom yourmoney because you know it's not likeyou're giving them your moneywillingly anyway they get it through themoney printer directly and try and stopthat from workingif you can i wish we could we'recreatinga lot more college degrees and we'recreating a lot morepeople that are educated and things likethatwhat that's kind of led to in theeconomy is an over-education of theworkforce i think i i read somewherethatabout 60 of the jobs out therelike the workers have way too mucheducation for it like if you'reuh flipping burgers at mcdonald's orsomething like that you don't even needa high school education but oftentimestheythey'll have a college education orsomething like that so uhhow does that affect the economy andcivilization and so oni mean i think it's um it's it's notreally so much of anover-education in as much as it is amismatchof jobs and skills because if yourdegreewon't help you get a higher salary onthe marketthen it was not really a degree it wasnot an investment it wasit was a consumer good it was you knowyou went to college to enjoy yourselfmore or lessuh one way or the other and it could beintellectually you know you wanted toenjoy yourself where you'rewriting essays about interesting topicsfor four yearsthere's nothing wrong with that um butyou know you can't really think about itasbeing a job qualification it has to helpyou get a better job and i thinkin my mind there's nothing wrong withyou know working at a mcdonald's orflipping burgers or serving coffee atstarbucksbut i think the problem is that peoplehad wasted a lot of their livesbefore getting that stage i think thereal cost of collegeis beyond just the tuition more muchmore important than just the tuition isthat the cost of collegesthose really important formative yearsof 18 to 22 whenbasically you're at the peak of yourphysical uh powers almost oryou're extremely young and you canlive extremely rough compared toyou know when you were younger orcompared to when you're going to beolderit's the time for you to take advantageof thatto the most by learning the most bybeing exposed the most and i thinkthat really is the time for people to beout there in the worldlearning uh useful trades and if youuh if you want to succeed in collegethat's four years in which you'reeffectivelyisolated from useful trades isolatedfrom the real world isolated from realworki mean obviously not all college degreesare isolated but a lot of theminvolve and even the ones that are notyou know there's still a lot ofcurriculum that isreally irrelevant to job skills not tosay that this is not something that youshouldnot learn learning is one thing butgetting a degreeis something else and i think theinternet is helping usunpack these where the opportunity costnow is becoming clearer to me and iremember speaking to some of my studentsa few years ago atuniversity they had done theirundergraduate and they've done theirmaster's degreeand they still had that question of idon't know what i want to dothey would have known what they hadwanted to do at the age of 22 or 23 whenthey finished their master's degree ifthey'dspent the previous years out there in inthe real world workinglearning skills i think when you thinkabout the amount of timethat you spend in college and you thinkabout the amount of knowledge that isavailable for you for free or for closeto freeonline and the amount of knowledge youcould gainfrom working in the real world fromengaging in the labor market and fromworking with peopleand seeing what is going on in differentindustries and so onwhen you when you factor that i thinkthe cost of college becomesextremely high it and it's it it makesless and less sense i think with timebecause the alternative isreally attractive i i remember tellingone of my students thatin these six years they could have iremember asking one of themwhat what what would you ideally want towork inand they said something about you knowprobably own a restaurant or somethingin the hospitality business and iand i said you know if you'd uh when youfinished high school if youstarted working as a waiter at arestaurantand worked your way up and then duringthose six years you know you worked as awaiterand you learned things onlinekept on studying whatever interests youon the side and learning the skills thatare needed for a businessthink about all the money that you'dpaid at universitythink about all of that time how muchyou would learn in six years workingyour way up from a waiterat a restaurant plus all of this moneythat yourthat you spent at college and imaginewhat you could do with it right nowi think that's really the opportunitycost of colleges becoming anincreasingly expensiveindulgence at a time whenall the knowledge that you want isavailable online andin the real world what you need to bedoing is figuring outa way to add value to people's lives inthe real world or onlinein order to secure an income from thatand i thinktoo much of people's thinking over thepast few decades has beenum distracted by the needto go through thestation of college before you are ableto enter the labor market wheni think it's it's not necessarily trueuh sothat that brings up an interesting ideafor me uh which is thatuh they a lot of people do spendsomething like six to eight years inuh college and grad school and so on andwe also have a glut of phds ii i honestly wonder how many of themare continuing in that education marketalmost kind of like becausethey've already invested a significantamount of time and money into it do yousee that as a factor at all inthe number of phds that are beingproduced by these universitiesabsolutely and i think the market isskewed in the case of phds becauseeffectively phds are cheap labor foruniversitiesthey can teach as well as the professorsif not better because most professorsare terrible at teaching becauseteaching is not really important foryourpromotion or for your ability to keepyour job like nobody really cares aboutwhat you do in your teaching and a lotof very good professors areterrible teachers when i say very good imean in the sense ofbeing able to produce academic researchbecause that's what mattersso universities are far more focused onproducing academic research in the topjournals because that's what gets themthe research funding and the grantsfrom government mostly this thenencourages them to continue to hire moreand moreundergraduates to help with the teachingrather than professors because if theyhire professors that are good withteachingthen they don't get to succeed based onthe fiat metrics ofhow many articles and how many journalsthat's ultimately what matters the mostfor them the rankings and the metricsand the funding thatis entailed from that so on the otherhandgraduate students are able to offeressentially cheap laborbecause they don't require an expensivethey're cheap for the universitiesbecause the alternative is professorswhocome with tenure and come with a lot ofbaggage effectively you know it's along-term commitment in tenure and so onand so obviously universities areincentivized toput more and more of their work inthe hands of in the hands of phdstudents so incentivized to give a lotof programscreate a lot of phd programs and itsecures them fundingand it gets a lot of students to do workfor freebut the problem is that you know there'sthere's just not that much market demandfor people who have a phdin many of those fields and even inthe fields for which there is marketdemand a lot of the workends up being to a large extent largelyirrelevanti mean it proves your competence thatyou have obtained a phd in this topicbutif you spend that time working onsomethingin the market trying to satisfy people'sneedsyou would improve your confidence in amuch more valuableway than a phd and b you would probablyfinancially benefit from itmore and i think more importantly youwould learna lot more if you're out there in themarket facing the pressure ofdelivering products in the market anddelivering things that people want ithink that teachesmore and i think that the opportunitycost of being at universityafter your work is very highyeah uh you're describing i think whatwhat's kind of common in universities isthatthe teaching aspect which is whatessentially students are paying foris separated from this sort of likeweird status game ofof doing research and getting grants umand it seems like from what you'resayingthat a lot of universities they focusalmost exclusively on the research partbecause that's essentially what bringsin the money because that'sthat's what gets money from government ii meanwould that be an accurate way todescribe it yes i mean i thinkyou know to to get into to get a job ata good universitythe most important thing to do is to getuh good uhpublications in high-ranking journalsthe universitiesare also in this game with thepublishers whohave interest in maintaining you knowthe game of journals and prestigiousjournalsfor which they charge exorbitantly highamounts of moneyand for which they don't pay theirwriters and their reviewersand for which they make enormous amountsof moneylocking this stuff up so the wholesystemis run in a way that is monopolistic ina way that is extremely wastefuland a deeply sad reality about thesystem is thatpeople who partake in it think thatthey'reyou know that they think that they'reoutsmarting the system they think thatthey're getting their end up from itit's really the other way around it'sit's actually that so the end result ofthis is that youend up focusing all of your time andyour energy onproducing content effectively for thesejournals thatare read by nobody that are hiddenbehindpay walls that charge exorbitant fees touniversitiesbut effectively the accreditationinstitutions that give universitiestheir uhaccreditation and their status and theirranking and so onthese institutions work along with thepublishers on ensuring thatuniversities need to continue to tojudgetheir professors by how much contentthey produce for these journalsand by how much access they provide fortheiruniversity students and professors intothose journalsand so the sad thing is people thinkthat they're they'rebenefiting from the system becausethey're advancing in it but ultimatelythe sad thing isyou're working to produce things thatdon't really add valueexcept in that they're being used inthisindustrial production of academicgibberish essentiallyyou know nobody really reads what iswritten in academic journals butyou have to publish in these journalsthat are not read by nobody in order toget to keep your joband your university has to keep takingmoney from your students and paying foraccess to those journalsso the fact that you know the success ofuniversities i think is separated fromthe marketmeans that universities can afford toindulge in these bureaucratic gamesrather than focusing on providingvalue to students you know instead ofthinking about how do we make this thecheapestand most effective and most productiveuse of a student's timeteach them the most they're engaged inthese games ofpublishing in journals and making surethat we get into those generals and soyou end up with the professors who areinwho are succeeding and getting to keeptheir jobbecause they're able to publish in thosejournals andit's not a very good selection criteriait's actually i would sayin many ways counterproductive to or orcounterto being a good teacher and a goodcommunicator becausethe level of dedication and focusand the ability to spend enormousamounts of time going through the peerreview process i meanthe the process is so slow and soso ridiculous in a way in which it worksyou know you send inyou send in the manuscript and you waitseveral months before theyread it and then they turn it to areviewerand then you wait several months andthen you get comments and thenyou send them back and you wait severalmonths it takes many many months towork on a piece of paper that's going tothen get downloaded by eight peoplein 20 years you know it's it'sastonishing and and you cansee that uh in in order to be able to dothisyou know you're not going to be able tofocus on being a good effectivecommunicatorof uh whatever it is that you'reteaching at university what it soundslike is that there'sin the free market you have an objectivemetric whether or not peoplebuy or buy your product but inin the university system essentially youareultimately satisfying some governmentbureaucratum whether or not they're giving grantsor umproviding student loans or somethinglike that they get to decideinstead of the market and that seems tobe the big difference here and whatwhat's caused the university to sort ofget into the system that you'vedescribedyeah and i think a very important pointto stressuh so far you know we focused on studentexperience andthe financial distortion to thestudent side of the university but it'simportant to rememberwhen thinking about the peer reviewprocess from the professor's sideand from the side of the research i ithink an excellent wayof trying to understand the dysfunctionis to try and imagineif we had peer review as amechanism for selecting anything else inour life so imagine if we had computersdesigned by peer reviewimagine if government decided that youknow we can't just let anybody makecomputers or make softwarewe need to have a committee of softwareproducers that meetand agrees on each other's software youknowwe have to get say the 12 largestsoftware producerson 12 operating systems they each needto present their software for a voteon the central software committee thisis effectively how academic research isjudgedpeer review originally the idea of apeer-reviewed journalat a time when paper was extremelyexpensive and printing wasnot easily available and physicallibrarieswere you know required goingout of your home and you know sometimesbracing the rain and the mud getting into placesin in that kind of time being able tosaythat a group of say physicists oreconomists orchemists have looked at thisand studied it and they've selectedthe good articles that they've onlyselected good articles with a specificquality for you to readdeveloping that kind of institution inthat kind of time made sense becausewhen you bought a peer-reviewed journalyou got the idea thatas opposed to say the newspaper which iswhich was justtyped up by one guy and edited byanother guy you're gettingexperts in a specific field who spent aserious time putting a lot of thoughtinto these articles before they put itin the newspaperyou can see the value back then but nowpeer reviewhas become effectively a peer onlyreview process effectively things thatare published in peer-reviewed journalsare read by nobodynobody really pays whatever it is 20 or30 or 40 dollars thatthey charge for these articles nobodyoutside of academia reads themand so effectively you have a um aclosed circle that ends updeciding who gets to produceresearch you know in the same way if weimagine if we apply this in the carindustry where you ended up with threecarproducers or a few carpet producers whoare able to get together andhave to approve each other's plansimagine if we had something like thisin the car industry um you know you canyou could quickly see how this wouldbe very very good for the car industrybut uh not very good for the car driversand passengers who are going to behelpless to this monopoly once we'vemoved to the era ofgovernment control of universities andgovernment financing of universities andyou've madepeer review into this sacred almost uhinstitution that is the voice of sciencethat is the answer of science that isthe answer ofthat is the voice of uh in uhdispassionate scientific objectiveanalysisas it is presented then you've createdan enormous incentive foruh people to capture this system andit's naturally going to be capturedbecausepeople in the system are going to end upbeing a group of people that approveeach other's work and that continue tofocus on assessing the work and thesuccess of the workbased on how it serves their agendasin other words if getting a license toproduce a caror getting a license to make a softwarewas inherent ongetting the approval of existingsoftware producers thensoftware producers are not going to bethinking aboutthe benefits of the consumer firstthey're going to be thinking aboutthemselvesfirst or satisfying whoever gives themthe moneybut in this case that's the criteria bywhich they're judged so that'suh and so you can you can see how thisthen leads to the groupthing and then how it leads to this umthesethis march down dead andrabbit holes of silly mainstreamanalysisin many topics in particular you know weknow economics and nutritiononce you've gotten a group of people inacademia who have promoted a specifictheory or a specific school of thoughtit's practically impossible to dislodgeit within equitybecause those people can't be wrong in awaythat will cost them their salary and soyou can you know we've had the realitycontinuouslydisprove the keynesian model by its ownstandards you knowthe silly keynesian model believes thatyou can't have inflation andunemployment at the same time you eitherhave this or you have that oneand we saw that happen in many placesover and over and over again and yetpeople continue to teach the keynesianacademic modelbecause the keynesian academic model isprotected from marketcompetition there's the peer reviewprocess that determines who gets tosit on these journals who gets to getpromoted who gets to keep their jobeffectively you have to toe the line inorder to keep your job and that's whyin economics we see city keynesianeconomics andall of its ridiculous cargo cult sciencemathematicscontinue to dominate academic researchin all universities producing completelyunreadable and irrelevant garbage thevast majority of economic research ispractically read by nobodyand we see the same thing with nutritionnutrition i think is an incredibleexample of thisnina titus i'm not sure if i'mpronouncing it incorrectlybut she's written an incredible book thebig fat surpriseand it's incredible the lengths to whichindustrialfood producers or fiat food as i like tocall themfiat food producers have gone in orderto promoteand support the presence of uhprofessorsand academics who support the idea thatanimal fats and meat are bad for you andthatyou need to eat some grains and sugar inmoderation and that industrial foodis actually food and thatall these ridiculous criminal ideas thathave costreally literally billions of peopletheir healthyears of health years of healthy lifehave really been sacrificed to theseideasit's impossible to dislodge them evenyou know if you look aroundtoday on the internet thousands ofpeople from all over the worldmillions maybe are changing their livesbyabandoning this industrial food byabandoning thisperspective on nutrition and the resultis you know their lives improveand academia is completely silent andblind to it and you stillsee overweight obese nutritionists allover the worldharanguing people on twitter you know ihave a phd in nutritionand no you should not quit eatingindustrial junkand you're starving yourself becauseyou've lost50 pounds and now you can run a marathonuh clearly you're unhealthy you need togo back to lookinglike the nutritionist andand eating industrial junk in balanceyou know the field of nutrition inuniversitiesis completely beyond salvation andgovernment guidelineguidelines are completely beyondsalvation becausethis stuff in academia is not out thereby its by virtue of success on themarketit's out there because it's out there byfiatand that brings up a really interestingpoint i think what what you basicallysummarize is that there's an orthodoxythat sort of develops and probablybecause of what you said earlieris that uh the quote-unquote experts ina particular field their main agenda isto keep the power that they havekeep the version of reality or theirresearch to sort of stay where it is andthatby protecting the status quo you'renot allowing market forces to workin these fields and allowing essentiallytruth tocome to light and it's ironic of coursebecausecollege is supposed to be a place amarketplace for ideas but what you'redescribing here is the exact oppositeit's an orthodoxy that you pretty muchhave to subscribe to in order to go upthat ladderabsolutely and i think you know theexample of nutrition when you thinkabout it it's umthink about how many people have madesuccessful careersout of being low-carb anti-industrialfoodencouraging people to eat meat orencouraging people to eat more animalfat and to avoid industrial fatthere's an enormous number of peoplehave made careers from thison the internet you know instagraminfluencers twitter influencersex uh nutritionists ex qualifiednutritionist exdoctors and doctors as well but youdon't seeany academic department leading thislike can you think of any universityor any prominent academic university uhprofessor who has spent yearssuccessfully publishing in academiain and showing results and uh succeedingwith thisyou don't you know these people oncethey realize this stuffthey leave the system and they uh youknow they start their own businessesaround this they might start a brand offood products ora restaurant or you know a twitteraccount or an instagram pagearound this facebook page they'll havetheir own audience their own websitewhateveryou can have all of these things butit's impossibleto build a career out of producingvaluablenutrition research that helps people intheir life within academia you look atall academic nutritionistsand they're still peddling the samecriminal garbage about you know eat yoursix to tenratios of grain every day andavoid fat and use low-fatindustrial food it's all everything youknow it's all about replacingreal animal foods with industrial sludgebasically which is cheap to produceand this is all that universities canoffer that that's really all that theycan offer and very very very very fewuniversity professorsare able to buck this trend or topublish anything against it and i thinkyou know obviously we see this withbitcoin as well but i don't need to tellyou about thatno no we don't i i want to go back tothis idea that college has become aconsumption gooddo you think that's what happens whenyou have basically the money printercome inlike is is that what it turns into whatwhat was onceuh a good that could help you become abetterthing becomes more like uh something tohave fun withyeah i think you know one aspect of itis of course the flip side of the factthat you're subsidizing college and thatit has thishalo around it of you know college goodum degree goodthis is one aspect of it um but also ithink you know the flip side of the factthatwhere where you bring that subsidy fromit comes fromthe devaluation of the currency which asi discussed in the bitcoin standardincentivizes people toward moreconsumption more present orientationand less focus on the future and i thinkin this regard you could see college asanas an experience as a consumer goodbecause you look at a lot of people thatgo into college you know you look at thelife that they live during collegeuh you know the amount of hard work thatthey have to doand the life that they get to enjoy youdo that from 18 to 22and then you find yourself you know 22to 30living a much rougher life it could bethe k obviously not alwaysbut in many cases that is the case andso if you if that was the case then youknowthat was a consumption good and in facteven if that was not the case of courseit could be a consumption good comparedto the alternative of you not spendingany timein college you know spending the time uhin an actualbusiness in the real world making actualmoney all right solooking to the future supposing that wedo get on the bitcoin standard how doyou think college education changesi think first thing is the this kind ofintellectualuh mafia that has captured research inmost fields well i don't know about mostfields buti can assume that it is very similarjust by looking at the few that i havedeveloped some kind of knowledge aboutthe this idea there's one school ofthought that's just going to capture allthe funding and theneverybody just publishes completelyirrelevant and pointless uhpapers that just discuss irrelevantdetails that question nothing of theseassumptionsi think we'd get out of that and we'dhave a free market ineconomic research in general but i thinkyou know this is already emerging thethe internet is already routingaround this stuff you know people inall individual fields they they don'twait for college foruniversity and academic journals topublish theirarticles in order for them to learnabout what is going onit's it's true in pretty much everywhereyou learn what is going on frommany other sources but not this one andyou know the internet is providing uswith all kinds of different sources anddifferent ways ofcommunicating information and ofresearch and i think you knowwhat what i see is in the uberificationof education in the sense ofgetting rid of the taxi cab licensecommissions andall of these intermediaries whose jobsbecomemore important than the actualservice being offered you know that thepeople who owned thetaxi cab uh medallions at some point youknow theythe medallions were worth a milliondollars and uhthey were extremely it's an extremelyprofitable thing to have becausethe workers and the riders areessentiallywaking up every morning and giving apartto their money to somebody who paidsomebody for a license many years agoand it's just it's massively inefficienti think education islike that in a sense so i think theinternet is going to allow us to routearound that in thatpeople who want to learn things will beable to learn them directly fromindividuals and frompeople and people who want to teach willfind ways ofreaching these people directly andresearch on the other hand you know thesame people of course can carry researchand i thinkthere will be many healthier ways offinancing research in a world in whichwe don't subsidize itwith government money i thinkindividualsprivate companies all kinds ofinstitutionslike universities will finance researchuh in all kinds of different ways andand you know we saw thisthere's a there's an incredible bookthat i highly recommend on this and it'scalledthe economic laws of scientific researchit's by terence keatingand mentions enormous amount of usefulinformation on this issue one of whichis you know england had the industrialrevolutioneven though it was the one europeancountry that spent nothingon subsidizing scientific researchall the other european countries had allthese government supported andsubsidized institutions forscientific research but it was englandthatmade the steam engine and the industrialrevolutionand that offered an enormous number ofadvances in science and an enormousnumber ofimportant scientists without therehaving to be in governmentsubsidies and in fact you know when youlook back you see thata few scientists and geniuses weresupported by taxpayers it was usuallyeither they financed themselves they hadtheir own businesses and theycarried their research on the side orthey would be financed byyou know rich patrons but uh they neverheld a gun to somebody's head and toldthemyou know you have to pay me for myresearch from your tax money so i thinkuh we have a much healthier model whenit is subject to market competitionyeah i i think what you're suggesting isthat you know research based on profitmotive tends todo a lot better than research based ongovernment grantsis is that what you're saying exactlyabsolutely all right solet's talk about what you uh sort ofmentioned before like what doeseducation look like and you were talkingabout the internet sort of routingaround the current educationalindustrial complex and the oneexample that i can think of at leastfrom the industry that i'm familiarwhichwith which is programming so you have alot of coding boot camps uh whichare something like six weeks and at theend of six weeks you're pretty much adeveloper which isa way better deal than four years ofcollege getting a cs degree which isgonnacost you four years and a lot more moneylike do you see that forother occupations is is that thedirection that we're going to go inas sort of the subsidies for theseuniversitiesgo away with a bitcoin standard i thinkso we'll see the specializationand increase in productivity manifest inthese you know short specific to thepointprograms and courses that you can takeandestablish your own knowledge i thinkwe're likely moving away fromcertification and degreesand more toward learning for the sake oflearning soin my website safedean.com you know ioffer courses i teach courses oneconomicsand i teach them directly to studentsyou know i like to interact withstudents as much as i canand we have seminars we have emailsthe way that i look at it is okay icould devise exams and i couldcharge people more for an exam maybe buti would really much rather spend my timeand i think my readersand my students would much rather than ispend my time making another courserather than you know spend it correctingessaysi think ultimately you know if you ifyou think you need to learn more aboutsomething rather than justuh thinking about uh writing essays andexams uhyou know just read more about it writepublicly you don't have to write for ateacher who assesses you i meanobviously there is value in that and i'mi'm thinking ofintroducing uh something like this atsome point that i'd have aan individual program where i uh we meetindividually with the student anddiscuss the material and then they writean essay about it but i thinkthere's an enormous amount of value tobe had just frombasic ability to download videoor audio lectures and class notes andlearn a topicthe teacher experience is very valuablethe ability to have somebodywho knows what's going on hold your handand guide youthrough something is extremely valuableand the internet allows us to do thisextremely uh cheaply it allows us tomake this scale massively so i have aclassin my class we'll have 10 hours oflectures and 10 hours of discussion so20 hours and you can you knowi post these online and then anybody canbuy this course at any point in timeand watch it and get that experienceit'sit's quite close to being in theclassroom when you're listening to thelecture and then we we have the weeklydiscussion sessions which are live everyweekso i do these every thursday and i'mgoing to be adding a couple morewherein anybody taking the courses atany time canyou join the discussion session live andtalk about thecourses and i think you know the numberof people that i can interact withthis way is so much larger than what icould interact with if i was in a brickand mortar universityand i think you know the economies ofscale here aremuch better and i think we're going tosee more and more people realize thisultimately you just want to give peopleuh valuable informationin my case i teach people economics inthe case of coding you knowyou spend a few weeks you learn valuableskills from codingif if you have these skills you can goout there and you can workyou don't need to prove that you havethem with a degree you know the workitself is its own proofand more and more of work is going tobecome like that and more and more ofeducation is going to become umself-directedand you know lifelong it's not justsomething that you doin uh for four years where you go andhang out with some professors who tellyou thingsyour entire life you're learning newthings taking new coursestalking to new people on new differenttopicsi think this is how i see the internetfixing thisyeah it's interesting because there area lot of jobsin the you know economy today that areessentially credentialed you have tohave this degree in order to take thisjobuh but i think what you're suggesting isthat maybea lot of those are created by fiat moneyand thatreally it should be about whether or notyou can do the job andit's one thing to have theexperience to do that and another tohave this sort ofcredential that gets corrupted by fiatmoney is that what you're sayingyeah and i think um you know sometimeswhen i say something like this peoplewill tell me well so you thinkyou don't wanna you would you go to abrain surgeon who doesn't have a degreeand the answer is i'm not against thethe concept of a degree there will bedegrees andit's it's perfectly it's perfectlypredictable and normal that you wouldgetseveral institutions that issue degreesor that you would get jobs that requiresome kind of degreebut if it were to be the case then itwould have to really demonstrate valueit would have to be one out there on themarket notby throwing people in jail you know ifhaving a degree that says i have adegree in brain surgerymakes you a better brain surgeon thansomebody who doesn't have a degreethen people will look for that andpeople will just not go to somebody whodoesn't have it i mean at the end of thedayyou're not compelled to go to a brainsurgeon who doesn't havea specific degree in in a free marketthe way that i see it you knownobody goes to anybody who wants tooperate on their brain unless they havesome pretty convincing evidence thatthis person knows what they're talkingabouti i don't necessarily think that auniversity degree is the best evidence ithinkin a completely free market in ahealthcare education systemit's far more likely that in that kindof system you know you would haveuniversitiesdevelop their own surgeons with theirown programsmaybe it doesn't have to go throughcollege at all maybe it doesn't involveacollege and maybe maybe maybe it's justthe process of anapprenticeship maybe that's how it worksyou goas a 16 year old into a hospital and youstarthelping a doctor by washing his stuffand silently watching himand then if for a year you're helpfulenough and you never bother him andyou never break anything then maybehe'll start talking to you when you're17.if you stick around for another coupleof years maybe he'll start teaching youhow to do his job and a few more yearsif you're good enoughyou know you'll start letting you do itand yeah then you could see thatyou could become a surgeon much fasterthat way i would imaginethan going through the all the ritualsofmodern fiat education these kind ofsystems you knowthey can emerge through apprenticeshipand you know the university uhthe hospital that has a reputation tokeep has uhyou know they only hire the rightsurgeons and they trust thosesurgeons to hire their replacements youtrust them tooperate brains and then you also trustthem to hiretheir own replacements for to operate onpeople's brains it's not necessarilyit's not necessary that degrees areinvolved but even if degrees areinvolved so what that can happen in afree marketand there's no reason why it can't yeahit's interesting uhwhat you talked about just reminded meof something that i read a long time agowhich is abouthow you get unemployed people employedand almost always what the governmenttries to do is they put them in a classandtrain them for some other job uh throughsome sort of educationand those almost always are much worsethan throwing those people into jobs insome sort of apprenticeship programthoseare almost almost always way better andare much easier for not just a candidatebutor the people that are training them andso on in order toget them to be good at a particularskill is just to try againinstead of learning in a classroom um ii suppose that'ssort of the world that you're suggestingwe would be in with a bitcoin standardyou said it very well yeah let's uh moveon to sort of like thefinal questions how does the currentcollege educationalindustrial complex end what do you thinkhappens andhow do you think it finally crumbles ohi don't know i i don't have crystal ballbut i mean for me it crumbled when ijustmoved on with my life and set up my ownwebsite and started teaching peopleonlinei don't like to think in terms ofcollectivist solutions i just think ofit individually and i thinkmaybe that's what happens more and morepeople start realizing thattheir time is far better used in moreproductive avenues and placesmaking things of more value i i've beento your side and i've actually donei've paid for a bunch of the coursescourses and i've enjoyed them and allthat can you tell us a little bit moreaboutsafetying.com and what you teach there ii teacheconomics from the austrian perspectivefrom the austrian traditioni teach also on the economics of bitcoinso so far i've donefour courses over the last year mywebsite's been around foruh a year and a month now i'veduring that time i've taught fourcourses which you can still take i didone course onbitcoin economics 21 on the bitcoinstandard so that wasa deeper dive into the bitcoin standardwherei go into the readings that i discussedin the bookwe we discussed the topic in much moredetail and then i didthe second course economics 31 which wasbased on the papers which are going tobeturned into the fiat standard soonand then i also made then i made the uhprinciples of economics courseseconomics 11 and economics 12and these are these are basically meantasan intro to economics from the austrianperspective and they are theuh genesis of my textbook which i'mworking on right now sothis just starts from you know karlmanger subjective valuewhat is economics andworking your way up through mises andhuman actionand all of the main important conceptsineconomics these are the two courseseconomics 11 and 12which i um i highly recommend foranybody who's interestedin austrian economics it's it'sdefinitely not it's not the final wordon australian economics but it's a gooda good intro to the main topics thatwill give you a good sense ofwhere to read and what to read and whatis going on in austrian economics ingeneralyeah and i i can testify to theeffectiveness of thati i know for myself like looking ataustrian economics and thenseeing a book like human action andbeing completely intimidated it's likehow the heck am i going to learn allthissafety definitely takes you through uhin a much more friendlier way the entirecorpusof pretty much austrian economicsliteratureuh in nice bite-sized chunks that itfelt so much bettergoing that way instead of reading theentirety ofuh mises or rothbard or something likethat so ii totally recommend it another questionfor you five years from now what's yourbest and worst case scenario for bitcoinbest case scenario would becomplete and final capitulation of allgovernmental and private coinsand the monetization of everythingmoney becomes just like the sewagesystem of a town where the entire planetsettles with one another every 10minutes on the blockchainand there are no other monetary assetsand i think you know in this kind ofworldthere'd be no inflation there'd be norecessions there'd be no business cyclesthere'd be just continuous relentlesssloweconomic growth and uh limiteduh neutered government unable to getmuch doneyeah obviously five years way too earlyfor thatbut that you ask for the best scenarioi'm not saying it'll happen in fiveyears but you knowthe best case scenario the worst casescenario i guessi would say you know the worst casescenario would be uh bitcoin continuestoyou know it would have to be severalthings going at thisgoing wrong at the same time in the sameway sorunning a bitcoin node becomes harderand harder sothe network becomes less decentralizedthere are fewer peoplerunning nodes also for whatever reasonpeople lose interest in bitcoin it couldbei don't think it would be necessarilygovernment bans becausebitcoin is resilient enough that even ifgovernments ban iteven without it being uh worth a lotand even without it having a lot of alot of people holding it it can stillsurviveunder cover and then continue to go onbut i think what would beum what would be worse than governmentbans would becomplete apathy if for whatever reasonyou know government manages toget its monetary house in order and umeverythingbecomes much better than maybe peoplejust lose interest in bitcoin and thenthe price stops going up a lot and thenmore and more people lose interestand then it becomes less and less secureso conflation of a reduction inthe number of nodes a reduction in thepricea reduction in interest and eventuallyfading into irrelevance or attacksand 20 years from now what do you thinkeducation looks like based on yourexperience in the educationi think it becomes a i think 20 yearsfrom now it becomesfar more micro than it is today thatum you'd have individualteachers and individual students fromall over the worldand you'd have small classes orindividual guidancebeing the norm done online and in personand so you'd have a lot of onlineinstructionand then you'd also have someand you'd have it supplemented within-person classesand interaction and i thinkthat would tend to be more of apeer-to-peer nature i think you'll seemore of ayou know independent professors goingdirectly to their students andessentially through their own platformsrather than throughlarge institutions yeah it's interestingbecause i i kind of already see thathappening there's alreadya ton of youtube gurus that will takestudents andyou can learn something like the wim hofmethod oryou know a particular you know if youwant to train for mmaor whatever so i can definitely see thathappeningso safety where can people

intoineffective researchinstitutions and how phd students areabused as cheap laborsafety the moose how's everything goingthese daysthings are good jimmy things are goingvery well i'mbusy at work on two books that i've beenworking on for a while nowprinciples of economics a textbook oneconomics andthe fiat standard which is uh the sequelto the bitcoin standardso these are taking up most of my timelike a true academic anduh speaking of which you've been inacademia forquite a while can you tell us the storyof how you got into itand uh what what led you to that roadwell i was i think three years old whenmy parents marched me into kindergartenand i only managed to extricate myselfout of that vicious cycle of dependencyon the academic systemlast year when i quit my job as auniversity professori basically went from kindergarten toschool university back to working at theuniversityup until last year when i quit my job asa university professorand became essentially an independententrepreneurteaching economics on my own website tostudents from all over the world andfocusing on my own writingand research i've developed a lot ofmisgivingsabout the educational system as you andi have discussed and and readers who arefamiliar with my bookwill identify thethe connection here is that i can seethe impact of fake moneyon academia on easy money money that isuhproduced at a low opportunity cost or ata zero opportunity cost almostis quite corrupting of umthe process of academic inquiry it'sit's quite disillusioningand and the outcomes of the process arequite mediocrebecause of that mediocre to start offbeing flattering at leastyeah you're getting into some of theproblems with college education butbefore we get into thatwhy do you think people get into collegeeducation because as far as i can tellthere's a glut of supply there's so manypeople that want to be professorsalmost no job so what what's going onthere why why is there this theimbalancei think ultimately the root cause of theimbalance isgovernment intervention in the academicsystemand of course this is almost sounds likeit's a caricature responsebut you know it also happens to be truein all of these caseswhen you prevent producers and consumersof products from interacting freely withone another you develop all theseartificialrules and restrictions and all theseinterventions in whereintaxpayer money or fiat money is usedto make market decisions effectivelyin the hands of the people who are ableto command money that they haven'tworked forthen you're distorting the institutionfromworking toward the people that issupposedlyintended to serve and turning into aninstitution that works moreto serve the people that are financingit with thelow opportunity cost money yeah there'sdefinitelya lot of money in academia i think iheard like third-party payers oryou know student loan givers likeessentiallyset the agenda in many ways can you talka little bit more aboutthat and many other problems withcollege education today what what iswrong with with the mission that theyoriginally had versus whatstudents are getting yeah well i i guessi i'll umlet's just focus a little bit uh perhapson the way in whichuh the incentives are corrupted perhapsthen we can discuss the consequences ofit because i thinkuh identifying you know contrary tokeynesian believe i iuh to keynesians and keynes who used tothink it's not important to understandthe causes of things it's important tounderstandsolutions i'm one of these old-fashionedpeople whothinks causes matter the ultimatedistortionin in this case to go back to youroriginal question is thatthere's an enormous amount of governmentsubsidy given for college educationand you know we can at some pointthere are all kinds of different umsociological explanations and culturalexplanations of why it is thatgovernment wants to subsidize this thingbutputting all of that aside thinking fromthe economics of itwe have to understand that once you'remaking it so that loansin the college industry are cheaper toacquire and easier to acquirethen you're distorting people'sincentives soif your ability to borrow to start abusiness isdifficult but your ability to borrow togo and get a college degree is mucheasierthis is distorting your economiccalculation you know you're constantlytrying to getprice signals from the market you neverhave fullknowledge and full information of whatis going on you're always trying toyou know make the most out of theknowledge that is available for youwhen these prices are distorted byeffectively by the ability of fiat moneytoenter these markets and distort capitalallocationthen it distorts people's incentives andso more and more people are likely toconsidercollege when getting a loan for collegeis almost like a birthright you know anywell not exactly but i mean it's easierthanother things although the notion ofmaking college debtuh a birthright is popular in some areasi would saybut effectively it is as you and i ithink would agree it iseffectively a form of uh being born intoslavery because you're beingyou're getting everybody into debt forcollege there's always an opportunitycost i think that's really the key thingthere's always an opportunity cost to itanddistorting prices and distortingincentives manipulatespeople people's uh calculations andleads to them making erroneouscalculations and that'swe see it in every market and i see noreason why this would not happen in theeducation marketand in capital markets in general yeahand wewe've seen the growth of colleges mostof themcharge way more money than they used toandin large part because these loans areavailablewhat do you think that does to theactual education experience of thestudentone way to look at it is that whenyou're creatinga bureaucratic incentive for one ofthose thingsit sounds like a nice ideal you knowlet's finance this thing with creditmoney and then we'll have more of it youknow let's financemore college or more hospitals or morehealth healthcare and then we'll getmore of it butreally what you're doing is that you'remanipulating people's economiccalculationthis is definitely true that a lot ofcollegesare able to spend a lot more moneybecause of the existence of thesestudent loanswe've seen in the past uh 20 30 yearshow college tuition has gone uptremendously and they're able toget a tremendous amount of capitalallocationuh you know probably not inproportion to the value that they'reactually providing sohow does that affect the studentexperience how does thatyou know change the incentives for thestudents what ends up happening when yousubsidize any kind of business it startsoff with the nice intentions thatyou know we'd get more college we'd getmore college degrees and so thereforewe'd havebetter qualified labor force and higherproductivity and better incomebut in reality once you've made it sothat it isa government objective for money to bespent in this regardthen you've created a source of incomethat is free from market competitionyou'vecreated a bunch of jobs where people canget a salarywithout having to satisfy customersand you've created incentives for peopleto take onspecific jobs that do not produce valuefor consumer but they are able to securethe funding from the funders and soi think you see this happening inbureaucracies all overand it is outlined byacademic economists from universitieswho apply this frameworkto the study of industries all over theworld andto cartels all over the world buthesitatesomehow for understandable reasons toapply itto their own profession because you knowtheir salaries depended on it what endsup happening in this situation is thatit's possible for a bureaucracy toemergein these institutions whose focusis on continuing to do what is requiredpoliticallyboth in the sense of domestic politicsas well as in the sense ofthe running of the organization itselfrather thansatisfying the consumers you know you'veyou've establisheda a group of jobs that aredetached from the bottom line in a senseand that have different incentivesbecauseit's not about securing the students asmuch as it issecuring the low interest rate loansand so i think if you look throughoutthe years what is happening is thatwe're getting a massive increase in thetuitionthere's also a massive increase in thenumber of degrees and in the number ofuniversitiesand so you would expect that becausewe're getting so many more universitiesthatprices would be dropping you know thesame way we have many moretvs and laptops we're always making morestuff and sothe new stuff the new stuff continues toget cheaper over timeas it gets older you would expect thatwith universities with so manyuniversities out there that you wouldgeta competition that brings down thesupply that you would havea lot more education going on and at alower price but instead what we find isthe price continues to go up part ofthat as we said is because of theavailability of low credit but also ifyou look at the expenses you see thatthe majority ofthe increase in spending in universitieshas gone toward administrative rolesand so the growing politicization of theuniversity and the growing insneed for uh just a large institutionalapparatus in order to make theuniversity continue to runends up becoming just an increase inbureaucratbureaucratic bloat of uh people who areuh dependent uh on these jobs and theydon't necessarily add much value oneidea that keeps coming to coming to meis thatwhy is it that we've not really seenproper entrepreneurshipin university setting emerge like wehaven't seen ina steve jobs of universities we haven'tseen university administrators who havemanagedto get their university to issuegreat degrees at a cheaper price oryou know making these enormous uhimprovements we justsee growing increase in price andeffectively a setting wherebureaucratically and organizationallythe power in the university structure isbecoming more and more in the hands ofthe bureaucracyand the operation of the university ismore about the bureaucracyrather than the professors or thestudents andi think you know the the the excitingthing about theinternet is that um it fixes thiswell so question for you about uh thesecollege administrators uhwhich by every metric they've beengrowing like gangbusters at everycollegewhy is it that when there is a lot morefunds like that that tends to be thecase that you get a lot moreadministratorsum in any sort of organization i knowthis is true forcolleges like we've been talking aboutbut it's also true of governmentof health care of a lot of differentthings it seems like they'rethey almost always kind of show upsomehow whenever youhave a lot of extra money yeah i thinkultimately it's justwhenever you have as i was sayingearlier jobs that are protected fromcompetitionthese these are people get into thosejobs and thentheir incentives are wrapped fromproducing value to consumers and andchanged intofocusing on survival in the institutionyou know you don't have to satisfyconsumers every dayyou're not facing the pressure of theconsumer or at least the pressure fromsomebody who isin your organization facing the consumeryou'refacing increasingly bureaucratic andpolitical pressure for your job and sothe bad thing about those jobs is thatthey're not productive the worst thingis that they can't be eliminated youknow it's a becauseyou can't kill what is uh undead orwhatever it is that that cliche goesthere's you can't deprive those peoplefrom yourmoney because you know it's not likeyou're giving them your moneywillingly anyway they get it through themoney printer directly and try and stopthat from workingif you can i wish we could we'recreatinga lot more college degrees and we'recreating a lot morepeople that are educated and things likethatwhat that's kind of led to in theeconomy is an over-education of theworkforce i think i i read somewherethatabout 60 of the jobs out therelike the workers have way too mucheducation for it like if you'reuh flipping burgers at mcdonald's orsomething like that you don't even needa high school education but oftentimestheythey'll have a college education orsomething like that so uhhow does that affect the economy andcivilization and so oni mean i think it's um it's it's notreally so much of anover-education in as much as it is amismatchof jobs and skills because if yourdegreewon't help you get a higher salary onthe marketthen it was not really a degree it wasnot an investment it wasit was a consumer good it was you knowyou went to college to enjoy yourselfmore or lessuh one way or the other and it could beintellectually you know you wanted toenjoy yourself where you'rewriting essays about interesting topicsfor four yearsthere's nothing wrong with that um butyou know you can't really think about itasbeing a job qualification it has to helpyou get a better job and i thinkin my mind there's nothing wrong withyou know working at a mcdonald's orflipping burgers or serving coffee atstarbucksbut i think the problem is that peoplehad wasted a lot of their livesbefore getting that stage i think thereal cost of collegeis beyond just the tuition more muchmore important than just the tuition isthat the cost of collegesthose really important formative yearsof 18 to 22 whenbasically you're at the peak of yourphysical uh powers almost oryou're extremely young and you canlive extremely rough compared toyou know when you were younger orcompared to when you're going to beolderit's the time for you to take advantageof thatto the most by learning the most bybeing exposed the most and i thinkthat really is the time for people to beout there in the worldlearning uh useful trades and if youuh if you want to succeed in collegethat's four years in which you'reeffectivelyisolated from useful trades isolatedfrom the real world isolated from realworki mean obviously not all college degreesare isolated but a lot of theminvolve and even the ones that are notyou know there's still a lot ofcurriculum that isreally irrelevant to job skills not tosay that this is not something that youshouldnot learn learning is one thing butgetting a degreeis something else and i think theinternet is helping usunpack these where the opportunity costnow is becoming clearer to me and iremember speaking to some of my studentsa few years ago atuniversity they had done theirundergraduate and they've done theirmaster's degreeand they still had that question of idon't know what i want to dothey would have known what they hadwanted to do at the age of 22 or 23 whenthey finished their master's degree ifthey'dspent the previous years out there in inthe real world workinglearning skills i think when you thinkabout the amount of timethat you spend in college and you thinkabout the amount of knowledge that isavailable for you for free or for closeto freeonline and the amount of knowledge youcould gainfrom working in the real world fromengaging in the labor market and fromworking with peopleand seeing what is going on in differentindustries and so onwhen you when you factor that i thinkthe cost of college becomesextremely high it and it's it it makesless and less sense i think with timebecause the alternative isreally attractive i i remember tellingone of my students thatin these six years they could have iremember asking one of themwhat what what would you ideally want towork inand they said something about you knowprobably own a restaurant or somethingin the hospitality business and iand i said you know if you'd uh when youfinished high school if youstarted working as a waiter at arestaurantand worked your way up and then duringthose six years you know you worked as awaiterand you learned things onlinekept on studying whatever interests youon the side and learning the skills thatare needed for a businessthink about all the money that you'dpaid at universitythink about all of that time how muchyou would learn in six years workingyour way up from a waiterat a restaurant plus all of this moneythat yourthat you spent at college and imaginewhat you could do with it right nowi think that's really the opportunitycost of colleges becoming anincreasingly expensiveindulgence at a time whenall the knowledge that you want isavailable online andin the real world what you need to bedoing is figuring outa way to add value to people's lives inthe real world or onlinein order to secure an income from thatand i thinktoo much of people's thinking over thepast few decades has beenum distracted by the needto go through thestation of college before you are ableto enter the labor market wheni think it's it's not necessarily trueuh sothat that brings up an interesting ideafor me uh which is thatuh they a lot of people do spendsomething like six to eight years inuh college and grad school and so on andwe also have a glut of phds ii i honestly wonder how many of themare continuing in that education marketalmost kind of like becausethey've already invested a significantamount of time and money into it do yousee that as a factor at all inthe number of phds that are beingproduced by these universitiesabsolutely and i think the market isskewed in the case of phds becauseeffectively phds are cheap labor foruniversitiesthey can teach as well as the professorsif not better because most professorsare terrible at teaching becauseteaching is not really important foryourpromotion or for your ability to keepyour job like nobody really cares aboutwhat you do in your teaching and a lotof very good professors areterrible teachers when i say very good imean in the sense ofbeing able to produce academic researchbecause that's what mattersso universities are far more focused onproducing academic research in the topjournals because that's what gets themthe research funding and the grantsfrom government mostly this thenencourages them to continue to hire moreand moreundergraduates to help with the teachingrather than professors because if theyhire professors that are good withteachingthen they don't get to succeed based onthe fiat metrics ofhow many articles and how many journalsthat's ultimately what matters the mostfor them the rankings and the metricsand the funding thatis entailed from that so on the otherhandgraduate students are able to offeressentially cheap laborbecause they don't require an expensivethey're cheap for the universitiesbecause the alternative is professorswhocome with tenure and come with a lot ofbaggage effectively you know it's along-term commitment in tenure and so onand so obviously universities areincentivized toput more and more of their work inthe hands of in the hands of phdstudents so incentivized to give a lotof programscreate a lot of phd programs and itsecures them fundingand it gets a lot of students to do workfor freebut the problem is that you know there'sthere's just not that much market demandfor people who have a phdin many of those fields and even inthe fields for which there is marketdemand a lot of the workends up being to a large extent largelyirrelevanti mean it proves your competence thatyou have obtained a phd in this topicbutif you spend that time working onsomethingin the market trying to satisfy people'sneedsyou would improve your confidence in amuch more valuableway than a phd and b you would probablyfinancially benefit from itmore and i think more importantly youwould learna lot more if you're out there in themarket facing the pressure ofdelivering products in the market anddelivering things that people want ithink that teachesmore and i think that the opportunitycost of being at universityafter your work is very highyeah uh you're describing i think whatwhat's kind of common in universities isthatthe teaching aspect which is whatessentially students are paying foris separated from this sort of likeweird status game ofof doing research and getting grants umand it seems like from what you'resayingthat a lot of universities they focusalmost exclusively on the research partbecause that's essentially what bringsin the money because that'sthat's what gets money from government ii meanwould that be an accurate way todescribe it yes i mean i thinkyou know to to get into to get a job ata good universitythe most important thing to do is to getuh good uhpublications in high-ranking journalsthe universitiesare also in this game with thepublishers whohave interest in maintaining you knowthe game of journals and prestigiousjournalsfor which they charge exorbitantly highamounts of moneyand for which they don't pay theirwriters and their reviewersand for which they make enormous amountsof moneylocking this stuff up so the wholesystemis run in a way that is monopolistic ina way that is extremely wastefuland a deeply sad reality about thesystem is thatpeople who partake in it think thatthey'reyou know that they think that they'reoutsmarting the system they think thatthey're getting their end up from itit's really the other way around it'sit's actually that so the end result ofthis is that youend up focusing all of your time andyour energy onproducing content effectively for thesejournals thatare read by nobody that are hiddenbehindpay walls that charge exorbitant fees touniversitiesbut effectively the accreditationinstitutions that give universitiestheir uhaccreditation and their status and theirranking and so onthese institutions work along with thepublishers on ensuring thatuniversities need to continue to tojudgetheir professors by how much contentthey produce for these journalsand by how much access they provide fortheiruniversity students and professors intothose journalsand so the sad thing is people thinkthat they're they'rebenefiting from the system becausethey're advancing in it but ultimatelythe sad thing isyou're working to produce things thatdon't really add valueexcept in that they're being used inthisindustrial production of academicgibberish essentiallyyou know nobody really reads what iswritten in academic journals butyou have to publish in these journalsthat are not read by nobody in order toget to keep your joband your university has to keep takingmoney from your students and paying foraccess to those journalsso the fact that you know the success ofuniversities i think is separated fromthe marketmeans that universities can afford toindulge in these bureaucratic gamesrather than focusing on providingvalue to students you know instead ofthinking about how do we make this thecheapestand most effective and most productiveuse of a student's timeteach them the most they're engaged inthese games ofpublishing in journals and making surethat we get into those generals and soyou end up with the professors who areinwho are succeeding and getting to keeptheir jobbecause they're able to publish in thosejournals andit's not a very good selection criteriait's actually i would sayin many ways counterproductive to or orcounterto being a good teacher and a goodcommunicator becausethe level of dedication and focusand the ability to spend enormousamounts of time going through the peerreview process i meanthe the process is so slow and soso ridiculous in a way in which it worksyou know you send inyou send in the manuscript and you waitseveral months before theyread it and then they turn it to areviewerand then you wait several months andthen you get comments and thenyou send them back and you wait severalmonths it takes many many months towork on a piece of paper that's going tothen get downloaded by eight peoplein 20 years you know it's it'sastonishing and and you cansee that uh in in order to be able to dothisyou know you're not going to be able tofocus on being a good effectivecommunicatorof uh whatever it is that you'reteaching at university what it soundslike is that there'sin the free market you have an objectivemetric whether or not peoplebuy or buy your product but inin the university system essentially youareultimately satisfying some governmentbureaucratum whether or not they're giving grantsor umproviding student loans or somethinglike that they get to decideinstead of the market and that seems tobe the big difference here and whatwhat's caused the university to sort ofget into the system that you'vedescribedyeah and i think a very important pointto stressuh so far you know we focused on studentexperience andthe financial distortion to thestudent side of the university but it'simportant to rememberwhen thinking about the peer reviewprocess from the professor's sideand from the side of the research i ithink an excellent wayof trying to understand the dysfunctionis to try and imagineif we had peer review as amechanism for selecting anything else inour life so imagine if we had computersdesigned by peer reviewimagine if government decided that youknow we can't just let anybody makecomputers or make softwarewe need to have a committee of softwareproducers that meetand agrees on each other's software youknowwe have to get say the 12 largestsoftware producerson 12 operating systems they each needto present their software for a voteon the central software committee thisis effectively how academic research isjudgedpeer review originally the idea of apeer-reviewed journalat a time when paper was extremelyexpensive and printing wasnot easily available and physicallibrarieswere you know required goingout of your home and you know sometimesbracing the rain and the mud getting into placesin in that kind of time being able tosaythat a group of say physicists oreconomists orchemists have looked at thisand studied it and they've selectedthe good articles that they've onlyselected good articles with a specificquality for you to readdeveloping that kind of institution inthat kind of time made sense becausewhen you bought a peer-reviewed journalyou got the idea thatas opposed to say the newspaper which iswhich was justtyped up by one guy and edited byanother guy you're gettingexperts in a specific field who spent aserious time putting a lot of thoughtinto these articles before they put itin the newspaperyou can see the value back then but nowpeer reviewhas become effectively a peer onlyreview process effectively things thatare published in peer-reviewed journalsare read by nobodynobody really pays whatever it is 20 or30 or 40 dollars thatthey charge for these articles nobodyoutside of academia reads themand so effectively you have a um aclosed circle that ends updeciding who gets to produceresearch you know in the same way if weimagine if we apply this in the carindustry where you ended up with threecarproducers or a few carpet producers whoare able to get together andhave to approve each other's plansimagine if we had something like thisin the car industry um you know you canyou could quickly see how this wouldbe very very good for the car industrybut uh not very good for the car driversand passengers who are going to behelpless to this monopoly once we'vemoved to the era ofgovernment control of universities andgovernment financing of universities andyou've madepeer review into this sacred almost uhinstitution that is the voice of sciencethat is the answer of science that isthe answer ofthat is the voice of uh in uhdispassionate scientific objectiveanalysisas it is presented then you've createdan enormous incentive foruh people to capture this system andit's naturally going to be capturedbecausepeople in the system are going to end upbeing a group of people that approveeach other's work and that continue tofocus on assessing the work and thesuccess of the workbased on how it serves their agendasin other words if getting a license toproduce a caror getting a license to make a softwarewas inherent ongetting the approval of existingsoftware producers thensoftware producers are not going to bethinking aboutthe benefits of the consumer firstthey're going to be thinking aboutthemselvesfirst or satisfying whoever gives themthe moneybut in this case that's the criteria bywhich they're judged so that'suh and so you can you can see how thisthen leads to the groupthing and then how it leads to this umthesethis march down dead andrabbit holes of silly mainstreamanalysisin many topics in particular you know weknow economics and nutritiononce you've gotten a group of people inacademia who have promoted a specifictheory or a specific school of thoughtit's practically impossible to dislodgeit within equitybecause those people can't be wrong in awaythat will cost them their salary and soyou can you know we've had the realitycontinuouslydisprove the keynesian model by its ownstandards you knowthe silly keynesian model believes thatyou can't have inflation andunemployment at the same time you eitherhave this or you have that oneand we saw that happen in many placesover and over and over again and yetpeople continue to teach the keynesianacademic modelbecause the keynesian academic model isprotected from marketcompetition there's the peer reviewprocess that determines who gets tosit on these journals who gets to getpromoted who gets to keep their jobeffectively you have to toe the line inorder to keep your job and that's whyin economics we see city keynesianeconomics andall of its ridiculous cargo cult sciencemathematicscontinue to dominate academic researchin all universities producing completelyunreadable and irrelevant garbage thevast majority of economic research ispractically read by nobodyand we see the same thing with nutritionnutrition i think is an incredibleexample of thisnina titus i'm not sure if i'mpronouncing it incorrectlybut she's written an incredible book thebig fat surpriseand it's incredible the lengths to whichindustrialfood producers or fiat food as i like tocall themfiat food producers have gone in orderto promoteand support the presence of uhprofessorsand academics who support the idea thatanimal fats and meat are bad for you andthatyou need to eat some grains and sugar inmoderation and that industrial foodis actually food and thatall these ridiculous criminal ideas thathave costreally literally billions of peopletheir healthyears of health years of healthy lifehave really been sacrificed to theseideasit's impossible to dislodge them evenyou know if you look aroundtoday on the internet thousands ofpeople from all over the worldmillions maybe are changing their livesbyabandoning this industrial food byabandoning thisperspective on nutrition and the resultis you know their lives improveand academia is completely silent andblind to it and you stillsee overweight obese nutritionists allover the worldharanguing people on twitter you know ihave a phd in nutritionand no you should not quit eatingindustrial junkand you're starving yourself becauseyou've lost50 pounds and now you can run a marathonuh clearly you're unhealthy you need togo back to lookinglike the nutritionist andand eating industrial junk in balanceyou know the field of nutrition inuniversitiesis completely beyond salvation andgovernment guidelineguidelines are completely beyondsalvation becausethis stuff in academia is not out thereby its by virtue of success on themarketit's out there because it's out there byfiatand that brings up a really interestingpoint i think what what you basicallysummarize is that there's an orthodoxythat sort of develops and probablybecause of what you said earlieris that uh the quote-unquote experts ina particular field their main agenda isto keep the power that they havekeep the version of reality or theirresearch to sort of stay where it is andthatby protecting the status quo you'renot allowing market forces to workin these fields and allowing essentiallytruth tocome to light and it's ironic of coursebecausecollege is supposed to be a place amarketplace for ideas but what you'redescribing here is the exact oppositeit's an orthodoxy that you pretty muchhave to subscribe to in order to go upthat ladderabsolutely and i think you know theexample of nutrition when you thinkabout it it's umthink about how many people have madesuccessful careersout of being low-carb anti-industrialfoodencouraging people to eat meat orencouraging people to eat more animalfat and to avoid industrial fatthere's an enormous number of peoplehave made careers from thison the internet you know instagraminfluencers twitter influencersex uh nutritionists ex qualifiednutritionist exdoctors and doctors as well but youdon't seeany academic department leading thislike can you think of any universityor any prominent academic university uhprofessor who has spent yearssuccessfully publishing in academiain and showing results and uh succeedingwith thisyou don't you know these people oncethey realize this stuffthey leave the system and they uh youknow they start their own businessesaround this they might start a brand offood products ora restaurant or you know a twitteraccount or an instagram pagearound this facebook page they'll havetheir own audience their own websitewhateveryou can have all of these things butit's impossibleto build a career out of producingvaluablenutrition research that helps people intheir life within academia you look atall academic nutritionistsand they're still peddling the samecriminal garbage about you know eat yoursix to tenratios of grain every day andavoid fat and use low-fatindustrial food it's all everything youknow it's all about replacingreal animal foods with industrial sludgebasically which is cheap to produceand this is all that universities canoffer that that's really all that theycan offer and very very very very fewuniversity professorsare able to buck this trend or topublish anything against it and i thinkyou know obviously we see this withbitcoin as well but i don't need to tellyou about thatno no we don't i i want to go back tothis idea that college has become aconsumption gooddo you think that's what happens whenyou have basically the money printercome inlike is is that what it turns into whatwhat was onceuh a good that could help you become abetterthing becomes more like uh something tohave fun withyeah i think you know one aspect of itis of course the flip side of the factthat you're subsidizing college and thatit has thishalo around it of you know college goodum degree goodthis is one aspect of it um but also ithink you know the flip side of the factthatwhere where you bring that subsidy fromit comes fromthe devaluation of the currency which asi discussed in the bitcoin standardincentivizes people toward moreconsumption more present orientationand less focus on the future and i thinkin this regard you could see college asanas an experience as a consumer goodbecause you look at a lot of people thatgo into college you know you look at thelife that they live during collegeuh you know the amount of hard work thatthey have to doand the life that they get to enjoy youdo that from 18 to 22and then you find yourself you know 22to 30living a much rougher life it could bethe k obviously not alwaysbut in many cases that is the case andso if you if that was the case then youknowthat was a consumption good and in facteven if that was not the case of courseit could be a consumption good comparedto the alternative of you not spendingany timein college you know spending the time uhin an actualbusiness in the real world making actualmoney all right solooking to the future supposing that wedo get on the bitcoin standard how doyou think college education changesi think first thing is the this kind ofintellectualuh mafia that has captured research inmost fields well i don't know about mostfields buti can assume that it is very similarjust by looking at the few that i havedeveloped some kind of knowledge aboutthe this idea there's one school ofthought that's just going to capture allthe funding and theneverybody just publishes completelyirrelevant and pointless uhpapers that just discuss irrelevantdetails that question nothing of theseassumptionsi think we'd get out of that and we'dhave a free market ineconomic research in general but i thinkyou know this is already emerging thethe internet is already routingaround this stuff you know people inall individual fields they they don'twait for college foruniversity and academic journals topublish theirarticles in order for them to learnabout what is going onit's it's true in pretty much everywhereyou learn what is going on frommany other sources but not this one andyou know the internet is providing uswith all kinds of different sources anddifferent ways ofcommunicating information and ofresearch and i think you knowwhat what i see is in the uberificationof education in the sense ofgetting rid of the taxi cab licensecommissions andall of these intermediaries whose jobsbecomemore important than the actualservice being offered you know that thepeople who owned thetaxi cab uh medallions at some point youknow theythe medallions were worth a milliondollars and uhthey were extremely it's an extremelyprofitable thing to have becausethe workers and the riders areessentiallywaking up every morning and giving apartto their money to somebody who paidsomebody for a license many years agoand it's just it's massively inefficienti think education islike that in a sense so i think theinternet is going to allow us to routearound that in thatpeople who want to learn things will beable to learn them directly fromindividuals and frompeople and people who want to teach willfind ways ofreaching these people directly andresearch on the other hand you know thesame people of course can carry researchand i thinkthere will be many healthier ways offinancing research in a world in whichwe don't subsidize itwith government money i thinkindividualsprivate companies all kinds ofinstitutionslike universities will finance researchuh in all kinds of different ways andand you know we saw thisthere's a there's an incredible bookthat i highly recommend on this and it'scalledthe economic laws of scientific researchit's by terence keatingand mentions enormous amount of usefulinformation on this issue one of whichis you know england had the industrialrevolutioneven though it was the one europeancountry that spent nothingon subsidizing scientific researchall the other european countries had allthese government supported andsubsidized institutions forscientific research but it was englandthatmade the steam engine and the industrialrevolutionand that offered an enormous number ofadvances in science and an enormousnumber ofimportant scientists without therehaving to be in governmentsubsidies and in fact you know when youlook back you see thata few scientists and geniuses weresupported by taxpayers it was usuallyeither they financed themselves they hadtheir own businesses and theycarried their research on the side orthey would be financed byyou know rich patrons but uh they neverheld a gun to somebody's head and toldthemyou know you have to pay me for myresearch from your tax money so i thinkuh we have a much healthier model whenit is subject to market competitionyeah i i think what you're suggesting isthat you know research based on profitmotive tends todo a lot better than research based ongovernment grantsis is that what you're saying exactlyabsolutely all right solet's talk about what you uh sort ofmentioned before like what doeseducation look like and you were talkingabout the internet sort of routingaround the current educationalindustrial complex and the oneexample that i can think of at leastfrom the industry that i'm familiarwhichwith which is programming so you have alot of coding boot camps uh whichare something like six weeks and at theend of six weeks you're pretty much adeveloper which isa way better deal than four years ofcollege getting a cs degree which isgonnacost you four years and a lot more moneylike do you see that forother occupations is is that thedirection that we're going to go inas sort of the subsidies for theseuniversitiesgo away with a bitcoin standard i thinkso we'll see the specializationand increase in productivity manifest inthese you know short specific to thepointprograms and courses that you can takeandestablish your own knowledge i thinkwe're likely moving away fromcertification and degreesand more toward learning for the sake oflearning soin my website safedean.com you know ioffer courses i teach courses oneconomicsand i teach them directly to studentsyou know i like to interact withstudents as much as i canand we have seminars we have emailsthe way that i look at it is okay icould devise exams and i couldcharge people more for an exam maybe buti would really much rather spend my timeand i think my readersand my students would much rather than ispend my time making another courserather than you know spend it correctingessaysi think ultimately you know if you ifyou think you need to learn more aboutsomething rather than justuh thinking about uh writing essays andexams uhyou know just read more about it writepublicly you don't have to write for ateacher who assesses you i meanobviously there is value in that and i'mi'm thinking ofintroducing uh something like this atsome point that i'd have aan individual program where i uh we meetindividually with the student anddiscuss the material and then they writean essay about it but i thinkthere's an enormous amount of value tobe had just frombasic ability to download videoor audio lectures and class notes andlearn a topicthe teacher experience is very valuablethe ability to have somebodywho knows what's going on hold your handand guide youthrough something is extremely valuableand the internet allows us to do thisextremely uh cheaply it allows us tomake this scale massively so i have aclassin my class we'll have 10 hours oflectures and 10 hours of discussion so20 hours and you can you knowi post these online and then anybody canbuy this course at any point in timeand watch it and get that experienceit'sit's quite close to being in theclassroom when you're listening to thelecture and then we we have the weeklydiscussion sessions which are live everyweekso i do these every thursday and i'mgoing to be adding a couple morewherein anybody taking the courses atany time canyou join the discussion session live andtalk about thecourses and i think you know the numberof people that i can interact withthis way is so much larger than what icould interact with if i was in a brickand mortar universityand i think you know the economies ofscale here aremuch better and i think we're going tosee more and more people realize thisultimately you just want to give peopleuh valuable informationin my case i teach people economics inthe case of coding you knowyou spend a few weeks you learn valuableskills from codingif if you have these skills you can goout there and you can workyou don't need to prove that you havethem with a degree you know the workitself is its own proofand more and more of work is going tobecome like that and more and more ofeducation is going to become umself-directedand you know lifelong it's not justsomething that you doin uh for four years where you go andhang out with some professors who tellyou thingsyour entire life you're learning newthings taking new coursestalking to new people on new differenttopicsi think this is how i see the internetfixing thisyeah it's interesting because there area lot of jobsin the you know economy today that areessentially credentialed you have tohave this degree in order to take thisjobuh but i think what you're suggesting isthat maybea lot of those are created by fiat moneyand thatreally it should be about whether or notyou can do the job andit's one thing to have theexperience to do that and another tohave this sort ofcredential that gets corrupted by fiatmoney is that what you're sayingyeah and i think um you know sometimeswhen i say something like this peoplewill tell me well so you thinkyou don't wanna you would you go to abrain surgeon who doesn't have a degreeand the answer is i'm not against thethe concept of a degree there will bedegrees andit's it's perfectly it's perfectlypredictable and normal that you wouldgetseveral institutions that issue degreesor that you would get jobs that requiresome kind of degreebut if it were to be the case then itwould have to really demonstrate valueit would have to be one out there on themarket notby throwing people in jail you know ifhaving a degree that says i have adegree in brain surgerymakes you a better brain surgeon thansomebody who doesn't have a degreethen people will look for that andpeople will just not go to somebody whodoesn't have it i mean at the end of thedayyou're not compelled to go to a brainsurgeon who doesn't havea specific degree in in a free marketthe way that i see it you knownobody goes to anybody who wants tooperate on their brain unless they havesome pretty convincing evidence thatthis person knows what they're talkingabouti i don't necessarily think that auniversity degree is the best evidence ithinkin a completely free market in ahealthcare education systemit's far more likely that in that kindof system you know you would haveuniversitiesdevelop their own surgeons with theirown programsmaybe it doesn't have to go throughcollege at all maybe it doesn't involveacollege and maybe maybe maybe it's justthe process of anapprenticeship maybe that's how it worksyou goas a 16 year old into a hospital and youstarthelping a doctor by washing his stuffand silently watching himand then if for a year you're helpfulenough and you never bother him andyou never break anything then maybehe'll start talking to you when you're17.if you stick around for another coupleof years maybe he'll start teaching youhow to do his job and a few more yearsif you're good enoughyou know you'll start letting you do itand yeah then you could see thatyou could become a surgeon much fasterthat way i would imaginethan going through the all the ritualsofmodern fiat education these kind ofsystems you knowthey can emerge through apprenticeshipand you know the university uhthe hospital that has a reputation tokeep has uhyou know they only hire the rightsurgeons and they trust thosesurgeons to hire their replacements youtrust them tooperate brains and then you also trustthem to hiretheir own replacements for to operate onpeople's brains it's not necessarilyit's not necessary that degrees areinvolved but even if degrees areinvolved so what that can happen in afree marketand there's no reason why it can't yeahit's interesting uhwhat you talked about just reminded meof something that i read a long time agowhich is abouthow you get unemployed people employedand almost always what the governmenttries to do is they put them in a classandtrain them for some other job uh throughsome sort of educationand those almost always are much worsethan throwing those people into jobs insome sort of apprenticeship programthoseare almost almost always way better andare much easier for not just a candidatebutor the people that are training them andso on in order toget them to be good at a particularskill is just to try againinstead of learning in a classroom um ii suppose that'ssort of the world that you're suggestingwe would be in with a bitcoin standardyou said it very well yeah let's uh moveon to sort of like thefinal questions how does the currentcollege educationalindustrial complex end what do you thinkhappens andhow do you think it finally crumbles ohi don't know i i don't have crystal ballbut i mean for me it crumbled when ijustmoved on with my life and set up my ownwebsite and started teaching peopleonlinei don't like to think in terms ofcollectivist solutions i just think ofit individually and i thinkmaybe that's what happens more and morepeople start realizing thattheir time is far better used in moreproductive avenues and placesmaking things of more value i i've beento your side and i've actually donei've paid for a bunch of the coursescourses and i've enjoyed them and allthat can you tell us a little bit moreaboutsafetying.com and what you teach there ii teacheconomics from the austrian perspectivefrom the austrian traditioni teach also on the economics of bitcoinso so far i've donefour courses over the last year mywebsite's been around foruh a year and a month now i'veduring that time i've taught fourcourses which you can still take i didone course onbitcoin economics 21 on the bitcoinstandard so that wasa deeper dive into the bitcoin standardwherei go into the readings that i discussedin the bookwe we discussed the topic in much moredetail and then i didthe second course economics 31 which wasbased on the papers which are going tobeturned into the fiat standard soonand then i also made then i made the uhprinciples of economics courseseconomics 11 and economics 12and these are these are basically meantasan intro to economics from the austrianperspective and they are theuh genesis of my textbook which i'mworking on right now sothis just starts from you know karlmanger subjective valuewhat is economics andworking your way up through mises andhuman actionand all of the main important conceptsineconomics these are the two courseseconomics 11 and 12which i um i highly recommend foranybody who's interestedin austrian economics it's it'sdefinitely not it's not the final wordon australian economics but it's a gooda good intro to the main topics thatwill give you a good sense ofwhere to read and what to read and whatis going on in austrian economics ingeneralyeah and i i can testify to theeffectiveness of thati i know for myself like looking ataustrian economics and thenseeing a book like human action andbeing completely intimidated it's likehow the heck am i going to learn allthissafety definitely takes you through uhin a much more friendlier way the entirecorpusof pretty much austrian economicsliteratureuh in nice bite-sized chunks that itfelt so much bettergoing that way instead of reading theentirety ofuh mises or rothbard or something likethat so ii totally recommend it another questionfor you five years from now what's yourbest and worst case scenario for bitcoinbest case scenario would becomplete and final capitulation of allgovernmental and private coinsand the monetization of everythingmoney becomes just like the sewagesystem of a town where the entire planetsettles with one another every 10minutes on the blockchainand there are no other monetary assetsand i think you know in this kind ofworldthere'd be no inflation there'd be norecessions there'd be no business cyclesthere'd be just continuous relentlesssloweconomic growth and uh limiteduh neutered government unable to getmuch doneyeah obviously five years way too earlyfor thatbut that you ask for the best scenarioi'm not saying it'll happen in fiveyears but you knowthe best case scenario the worst casescenario i guessi would say you know the worst casescenario would be uh bitcoin continuestoyou know it would have to be severalthings going at thisgoing wrong at the same time in the sameway sorunning a bitcoin node becomes harderand harder sothe network becomes less decentralizedthere are fewer peoplerunning nodes also for whatever reasonpeople lose interest in bitcoin it couldbei don't think it would be necessarilygovernment bans becausebitcoin is resilient enough that even ifgovernments ban iteven without it being uh worth a lotand even without it having a lot of alot of people holding it it can stillsurviveunder cover and then continue to go onbut i think what would beum what would be worse than governmentbans would becomplete apathy if for whatever reasonyou know government manages toget its monetary house in order and umeverythingbecomes much better than maybe peoplejust lose interest in bitcoin and thenthe price stops going up a lot and thenmore and more people lose interestand then it becomes less and less secureso conflation of a reduction inthe number of nodes a reduction in thepricea reduction in interest and eventuallyfading into irrelevance or attacksand 20 years from now what do you thinkeducation looks like based on yourexperience in the educationi think it becomes a i think 20 yearsfrom now it becomesfar more micro than it is today thatum you'd have individualteachers and individual students fromall over the worldand you'd have small classes orindividual guidancebeing the norm done online and in personand so you'd have a lot of onlineinstructionand then you'd also have someand you'd have it supplemented within-person classesand interaction and i thinkthat would tend to be more of apeer-to-peer nature i think you'll seemore of ayou know independent professors goingdirectly to their students andessentially through their own platformsrather than throughlarge institutions yeah it's interestingbecause i i kind of already see thathappening there's alreadya ton of youtube gurus that will takestudents andyou can learn something like the wim hofmethod oryou know a particular you know if youwant to train for mmaor whatever so i can definitely see thathappeningso safety where can people find you whathow can theysee what you're up to and stuffsafeidine.com is my websiteand the twitter on safety dean andmy website is going to soon have abig revamp and i'm going to be buildinga

soyou sign up and every two weeks you geta new chapter of the bookas i finish it up and you can jointhe members area where we'll bediscussing my booksas well as the courses and all manner ofissues related to bitcoinand austrian economics and low timepreference andstakes and the likeall right well i i look forward to yourversion of the school virtual school ofathens thank you safetyit was a
