  "text": "good morning Ericwell it's morning for us what time is itfor youyeah it's uh 3 30 in the afternoon herein Nairobiall right well finally after a couple offull starts we can get this interviewdone and we can find out about yourAmazing Projectwell hopefully I mean we haven't gottenas far yet as we did that even that thatfifth time or whatever it was so let'ssee let's see if we can make it happenI'm feeling confident we've got gooduploads of speed good download speedwe've got Danny here we've got you we'vegot Jeremy we're going to get this doneokay so recently I saw some tweets uhabout your project there was aconference Down in Africa which I reallywanted to get to and I just could notmake it work uh but one of the bigtalking points if not the biggesttalking point was gridless that's why Ifelt like everyone was talking aboutyour company so uh we normally like tointerview in person we couldn't get downto Nairobi we can't get you here inAustin so we're going to do thisremotely but I want to hear everythingabout gridless what you're up to tell meall about this projectyeah thanksum you know so at gridless what wereally are about isyou know yes we do Bitcoin miningum but really we're about backstoppingmini grid uh electricity providers soreally what you have in Africa is a lotof um people who don't have electricityand grids that aren't aren't well builtand so uh what they need is they needsomebody who can come in and use thatenergy and help provide somesustainability to their own economicmodelum and then what we do at the same timeis we provide some you know someconfidence to to them that they can pushout further to other locations and thatthey'll have a buyer of Last ResortI I think for a lot of people it'sprobably going to be a little bit tounderstand what life is like living inthese communities in Africa because mostof us have just become very used to thefact that we live in a house withrunning water electricity you knowsewage all the kind of things that we'vecome to take for granted yet in some ofthese communities they can't soum firstly start with the cities inthese African countries all major citiesare they just like major cities anywhereelseyeah so um that's a big bucket right soyou've got yeah you've got some majorcities let's start with that so ifyou're in Nairobi or Lagos or Cape Townor Cairo or you know just some of thebig cities it is a lot like anywhereelse in the world with some you knowmaybe some more extremes on both therich and the poor sideum and so you have uh and you don't haveas good of infrastructure in thosecities either so um yes that that is thecaseum then and even in the cities so forthe past 10 years before this we werebuilding a you know internetconnectivityum infrastructure throughout both urbanand rural and and you and you see thatwhat you have in the in the low incomeareas is really really nothing andpeople are really struggling and thenyou get a small sliver of middle classand uh even smaller sliver of upperclass andum and it's it's a it's a numbers gameright so you have something likeonly 40 of the people in the Africancontinent can get connectivity to theinternetuh the other 60 can'tum and even of those 40 who can getconnectivity to the internet uh this iseven in the cities right not not justrural areas they um most of them can'tafford it so there's an affordabilityproblem too the same actually applies toelectricity uh so the numbers aresimilar I think it's 37 or approximatelyWho Um can can get access to electricitybut even those who can get accessum aren't always able to afford it andso you have this kind of double doublingdown problem so access and affordabilityare closely linked for both internet andconnect to and Powerand when you talk about access toInternet uh does that include mobileaccessyes that's and and so when I when I talkabout internet connectivity I mean allof the internet connectivity andum something like 95 of internetconnectivity in Kenya is mobile so thatis the majority of that internetconnectivity is mobile uh so we do havethese islands of connectivity now uhKenya is particularly well blessed withit we have companies who've done a goodjob over the past decadeum other countries are not nearly as faralong so if you go to Malawi you'regoing to have a very very differentexperience than if you were in Kenyaum but even there you have these islandsof connectivity but the prices are stillhigh so if you have somebody who's who'smonthly you know uh disposable income islet's say five dollars you know you'reyou're going to be very careful how youspend every penny uh every ceiling andum and and so you have to make us achoice between you know am I going topay school fees am I going to buy wateror milk or bread or am I going to payfor internet connectivity and those arethe kinds of decisions people are makingevery day okay so the expense isrelative to what they earnnot so much relative to the rest of theworldyeah that's true so it's actually we getamazingly cheap data prices if youcompare it relative to where you'resitting today in Austin or even inLondon we have really really cheapinternet but it's relative to how muchyou make and a lot of people don't havethat same level of incomeuh you know so I wasyou know for for years you'd see me if Istood up on stage somewhere I'd be I'dgive some pithy statement about like youcan't have a 21st century economywithout power and connectivity and andthat's true right because if you thinkabout it you know if you're going tobuild any of the Digital Services wethink about for government or if you'regoing to have some type of Ed Tech playor you're going to have you knowinformation for the the doctors andhealth care providers or if you're goingto run a business more efficiently youneed both power and connectivityum internet connectivity and so you knowwhen when we were looking at this spaceit was like Wow we've been so so focusedon internet connectivity for so manyyears but Powerisn't there either and and so if we ifwe really hope to kind of push thesethings forward you have to provide abase level that Foundation thateverything else can be built onand it might seem like a simple questionbut the if you're able to bring powerinto these communities what are therange of differences it makes I mean Iwould simply think of simple things likeif it's a home it would make it easy forthe kids when they're doing the homeworkwhen it gets dark like simple thingslike that but you probably have got abetter range of examples of thedifferences it can makeyeah so you know I have some land-upcountry and um you know we have friendswho are the farmers who live around usit's very agricultural it's tea fieldsandum you know Maize and just normal cropsvery agricultural dirt roads and um ourneighbors uh don't have a power line uhto their house they still useum they buy the very small solar uhpanels that they can put on their houseand they'll charge a light with it allday and then at night they'll have thator they use paraffin uh and paraffinlamps are are very dangerous especiallyyou know for growing children and so youknow you still have that all over Kenyaso what do you think it's like in othercountries right it's uh that aren't asfar along aren't as middle class as asKenyans are so there's a there's a bigproblem across the continent aboutelectricity and what it can do for youso you know at first when people getelectricity they they do the the thingswe just talked about which is first canI get the light bulb the differencebeing between being able to work fromwhen the Sun goes down which it goesdown like a rock at 6 30 to 7 o'clockevery night right so when it goes andwhen it goes dark it's very dark uhthere's there's nothing else you can usebesides fireum so if you can't use a paraffin lampum then what are you going to do you'regoing to do nothing and so people go tobed and they wake up early and it'sagricultural networks but it's not goodand it's not it's not kind of furtheringThe Human Condition it's not making it aMore Level Playing Field it's not youknow allowing people to get to the samelevel as other parts of the world andelectricity energy is the thing thatdoes that you know as much as asInternet is important if you don't haveif you don't have electricity you don'thave lights then you don't really haveanythingso if you if so if you start there yousay well what do people do well first ofall they get lights second of all theycharge their phones because everybodyhas a phone and they'll buy a smartphoneif they can afford it they're relativelyinexpensive nowum the third thing they do is they willmaybe and this is this might be three tofive years down the line if they can geta you know a mini grid power cable totheir homeum they might buy a refrigerator uh or atelevision and then they start usingmore electricityum other things they do is you knowespecially in the agricultural belts isthey um they're able to pump water nowand so then they can irrigate more andfeed their crops with more water as wellas their animals so it changes theirlives significantly uh the more theyhave access to energyand does it do anything in terms ofsafetybecause you said it gets very dark veryquickso depends um so you'll see in uh townsso not Villages but more towns you'llsee in places like Kenya you'll see themerect these really tall towers with biglights on them that then cover as muchas much of the town as possible withoverhead light and so yes that does addSecurity in The Villages you need it alittle less because everybody knowseverybody uh you know it's thesevillagers who've been you knowGenerations around each otherum but does it at first does it addsecurity absolutely it does every timeyeah okay and so currently what are thepower sources how are they generatingpower across you know uh major citiessmaller towns what's the current EnergyMixagain it depends on Country uh in EastAfrica we're really blessed withrenewable energy so I think somethinglike 90 plus percent of the grid mixhere is renewable energyand that's hydro and geothermalprimarily we've had some large solarbeing built as well and we have a verylarge wind turbine plant up in thenorthern desert uh near Lake turkana inother countriesum it differs so Ethiopia Uganda KenyaRwandaum you know mostly East Africa has a tonof hydro you go further south you getmore solar and that makes a part of themix but they're still buildingum you know they're still burning a lotof fossil fuels for energy as well uhthat just it's needed and quite franklyyou know I think it's fair to say thatAfrica should have the benefit of goingthrough the sameenergy use curve that the rest of theworld got to useis there plenty of investment wanting tocome in and support the thesecommunitiesso there's plenty of discussions and andpeople trading words about it uh youknow right so you know if you talk tothe World Bank sorts um and you know theusaid to use and see does and you knowUK type organizations they're alltalking about how much we need to buildmore energy in Africa and they're rightI mean they're absolutely right aboutthatum there's been a huge amount of moneycommitted to it uh not a huge amount ofmovement on that money it takes a longtime uh to actually move that money outand put it to work uh there's there'ssome interesting things that arehappening you know if you're if you lookacross a country there is a grid diagramthat might not be well built it might beokay on its generation side it might bepoor it might be goodum but generally the grid and thedistribution of that energy is wherethings fall down andum the you know what we're seeing isthat you know you'll go into cities likeLagos and you'll get you know 30 plusum power outages in a month uh in Kenyayou get maybe three to five uh andthat's just downtown Nairobi right butif you're on a mini grid you might getone out of General month and so it'sit's a the ability for these theseenergy distribution arms of the of thegrape to be able to do it and do it welland and that's just it's difficult forthem to uh to do we're not wellconnected on our grid and therein liesthe opportunity and and the challengeand Eric what's your background what howcome this has become your missionyeah I'm I might not look like it orsound like it uh but I grew up in Sudanand Kenya and uh went to the US forUniversity and then came back uh goshwas it early 2000s started building techcompanies here in Kenya this is homeum and so yeah I've been very involvedin the tech ecosystem buildum as well as uh you know so it reallystarted with software and then um gotinto uh well small history so ushihidiis one of the first platforms I builtocean was built with uh three otherKenyans and what we were doing is wewere building a software system forcrowdsourcing crisis information duringthe post-election violence in Kenya in2008.um that's Global it's big it's used in200 countries around the world it's usedevery time you have a you know a tubestrike in Londonum it's used when there's an earthquakein Pakistan or a flood in you know nameyour countryum as well as almost every election likeLatin America so there's that thatplatform is really solid and valuableand has gone Global and then also builtout the ihub here in Nairobi the ihub isthe um kind of the big Tech space thenerve center for the tech Communityum That Grew about 17 000 members injust a few years and um it was in themidst of that that I was I started toget really interested in if software isso easy why can't we do some of thethings in Hardware thatum would really change things as welland so started to think about what arethe what are the what are the thingsthat we're missing that are being madeelsewhere in the world that we couldmake locally we could design locally andum so that's where the company brickcame from uh and brick you know hasfirst started being a hardware companybuilding the best router for internetconnectivity the most rugged router orsomething you could kind of use and takeanywhere in the world and haveconnectivity and we did that we realizedthat building that is a as a hardwarecompany was a linear business and soalso realized that we weren't solvingthe real problem of how do you connectpeople to the internet that's actuallywhat's needed and so um starteddeploying that Hardware as a as the basefor a whole layer of connectivity endedup connecting a million people acrossKenya and Rwanda and um recently soldthat company and taking that same kindof understanding of infrastructurehardware and software and applying itinto this new space around energy andBitcoinand your Bitcoin story tell me that howdid you get into Bitcoinso it's actually that one's uh both youknow everybody has their oh shoot Ishould have seen that earlierumso mine came around when we werebuilding the I have in 2010.and um we had you know we had you knowthis great group of peopleum and we we knew what was going on Techeverywhere and we're looking at Bitcoinand we built a super computer clusterand never mind with it right you knowlike we thought about it we talked aboutit but we never did it so 2010 we couldhave done quite well with thatum and then but in 2013 we just startedthe brick company and we were we werelooking at the um there was 300megawatts of wind energy being built upin Northern Kenyaand it was it's phenomenal so this is upin turkana it's like a lunar landscapedesert it's just Barren but it has someof the best wind in the world it's justamazing and so uh you know theseEuropean companies been contracted tobuild these massiveum windmills up there and they hadstartedand they have built it without anycontract for transmissionso they built it and it sat there and itpumped power into the ground for sixyears while they built out the powerdistribution and we were looking at thatin 2013 and we had just received fundingfor for Brick and Philip my businesspartner was saying hey you know weshould go up there you know what'swhat's the type of business that youcould put up there and get just somedecent connectivity on the internet andbe able to to do something with Bitcoinmining and I was like dude we just gotfunding for this other company we got afocus man and so yeah you know there wasthe second time that I didn't do it andso when it came to 20 it was like youknow when we saw what was happening in2020 and 2021 I was like you know I amdone not doing this I've said I've saidno two times if I say no a third timethen it's on me right it's really on meand that's how I said you know what eventhough like right when we startedconsidering this and we started playingwith it Bitcoin prices were high theprices of miners were incredibly High ittook us you know we're being told fourfive six months before you could receivea twelve thousand dollar Bitcoin minerin Nairobi and we're like oh my goshthis is crazy but we need to do this weneed to figure this out and um you knowthe the Stars aligned and uh uh theprice on bitcoin crashed and the priceof Bitcoin miners you know went down bya factor and now we're able to buyBitcoin uh Miners and put them to workin the right wayyou know who know who knew that wouldhave happened so I'm glad we startedwhen we did great okay and also can yougive us a bit of a lens into Bitcoinunderstanding adoption in Africa becausewe hear about it a lot and I Know Jackdorsey's uh very keen to support theproliferation of Bitcoin in Africa butwe often get told uh because in certaincountries a lot of people reallyappreciate the uh Bitcoin and they'reusing it but also at the same time wewe're fully aware that scams haveproliferated through Africa as well butuh it's all kind of second-hand evidenceso somebody who's been there spent a lotof time obviously various differentcountries can you give us a lens intowhat's happening there yesum so when we started up and I'll comethis from two different angles I'll sayfrom when we start up with gridless Istarted to really try and connect to theother Bitcoin miners sorry bitcoiners inKenya just in Kenya alone and reallystruggledum because there's a lot of people whoare interested in crypto and very fewwho are interested in in just Bitcoin uhso there's a there's a handful of peoplewho are just bitcoiners and then there'sa lot of people many many thousandsmaybe Millions who are really intocrypto and a number of them have beenburned over the past few yearsum becauseit really is you know if you think aboutit you know the the problems that wetalk about with withum payments the problems we talk aboutwith moving money with banks and bordersand everything like that it's it reallyhits home here uh maybe it hits homehere worse than it does in the UK or theus or you know most developed parts ofthe world and so people really do needthis thing and they need it for a couplereasons they need it for payments uhthey do need it forum the the ability to just dopeer-to-peer so like send money upcountryum but but most of all like they most ofthem don't have bank accounts so what doyou do with somebody who doesn't havethat right so in Kenya we have Safaricommon and PESA so in Tessa is you knowa mobile moneyum system and people say well you havemobile money and can you you should befine right you should be able to movemoney fairly frictionless you you knowyou have all these abilities that quitefrankly most of the other countries inAfrica don't have the cost of movingthat money on empessa is notinsignificant to people most Kenyans ifthey have a choice will use cash ratherthan in PESA and that's because there isa very high transaction cost so if youcan take something and and useum in this case I think I think BitcoinI think the lightning Network on top ofthat is really really the right way tothink about it and this is whyif you if you look across the wholeAfrican continent about who's buildingthe two things that I think the mostrelevant for African bitcoiners and orthe usage of Bitcoin by Africans whichis maybe the better way to think aboutit is is mushroom Kura who is out ofSouth Africa and the ability to pay viaussd with a dumb phone rightjust a you know a phone that you can usewithout any real touch screen oranything and two isum what they're building a bit knobwhich is just an on-ramp into buying andand and moving it across currenciessoum and then there's a third moreimportant thing too which is you have toremember that while the devaluation ofthe dollar of the Euro of all theseother things are happeningit has a trickle-down effect to ourthird order currencies of the KenyaShillingum and and others across Africa where weget burned even worse so you know theconditioning I think is devaluedum from a hundred and I think it was 104shillings to the dollar this time lastyear to 125 todayum and so that's pretty significant it'snot as bad as Ghanaum but it's pretty bad and um you knowso there's there's some real there'ssome real needs for it we've had similarin the UK against the dollar in the lastyearall right that's true you guys did sodid the Euro right yeah I guesseverybody's getting hammered if youdon't own the dollar and so you have tohave something to hedge against thatwith so when I went up to Venezuelapeople used five currencies uh this thetechnical uh technically literate willuse Bitcoin uh they are forced to usethe Bolivar people will do want thedollar so especially if you go intoCaracas they want the dollar uh but theyalso will use the Colombian Peso andwhat was that stupid crypto they bit thePetro and the Petro but no one reallywants to use that but but I even saw thesame when I was in uh Cambodia I took mykids out to Cambodia a couple of yearsagoum and you know if you're in a yeah wellyou know if you're in a major city theythey want the dollar and they also theywant crisp flat dollars and they won'ttake any dollars that have any kind oftear in them in the slightest but weknow that people we we know that peopletry and find better money when they needit and so in terms of across Africa orthe places you've been is does theDollar proliferate as well and do peoplewant the dollarnot every day as a means of exchange noum but as a as something to to hold orumthen yes or to trade if they're a Traderabsolutely so uh here it's I think it'sa little different of course again it'scountry by country if you go down toZimbabwe like yes the kind of a 100 USDbill is is King rightum but if you're in Kenya people willstill use the Shilling day to day but inuh yeah it's it's interesting here youtalk about like you don't have to be acrisp clean bill no pets uh no tearsum here it also has to be a hundreddollar bill from a certain year forwardeven if you go to a Forex so even anofficial Forex they'll only take it froma certain year for it so now that youknow I think I'm trying to remember thatyear I can't I mean it's maybe it's like2008 or something they won't take ahundred or if they take it you getdiscounted on it to I think maybe 20 uhso it's pretty significant why is that Idon't trust it because the the U.Schanged something on this dollar billand they just and then you know the fearwas that it wasn't going to have thesame value anymore so they just actuallyumyou know they don't they don't and hereit is it's a it's a it's a USD buyer'smarket right so um they get to set therules right okay so and and just backinto the banking infrastructure youmentioned There's issues with thebanking infrastructure some people don'thave banking what other kind of issuesare thereyeah it's not just that some peopledon't have banking across the continentthere's only like 45 of the con of thecontent that does have banking so themajority doesn'tum so they don't have it what do they dowell it's you know it'sum in Kenya you'll put money in a PESAand so that's a way to store it and it'sa little more secure but most peoplejust have cash you know it's cash intothe mattressum and cash payments for things everyday uh that just that's just kind of howit is and um and and you know in thecities you have more access to cash whenyou're in the rural areas it's it'sactually really hard to find cashsometimes and soum you know having an alternative meansum and I actually think if you know if Iwasn't building grid list what elsewould I be building I think there's areally interesting play and I'm hopingthat somebody does this which is youknow if you if you take Bitcoin as yourbase layer and you use lightning as atransmission layer it still has cost andI think that you know what we callagents here or just you know these arepeople who run Dukas and and run storesif they use the lightning Network atthat level it's fine but Everyday Peopleit still has a pretty high transactioncosts I think there's a maybe a thirdorder that needs to be built on top ofthat and that's where guys you knowwe're you know we've been fortunate tohave guys like OBum and also on ourum on our investment side and you knowhe's building fediment and I think thatidea of a of a kind of like he was hecoined in uh December which is like youknow a Bitcoin Frontier Town isinteresting because you basically thenhave a Community Bank working off of hisum it's called ecashum that allows people to to back intothe lightning and then all the way bepegged down into Bitcoin but do itwithout any any um any cost frictionum and I think that becomes reallyimportant in the future for uptakeacross the continent and how do you findeducated people in Africa about Bitcoinand the the thing that always kind of Iworry about is the price volatility andhow people cope with that yeah anotherthat's a good question I mean like we wetry to you know if you think about ithow we we view it in the US or Europeit's like we can deal with that pricevolatility to a certain extent but eventhe price volatility over the last youknow 24 hours I don't know maybe it'smaybe it's aum a couple per percent could be fairlysignificant to somebody here and soasking people to put their save in youknow put all of their savings intoBitcoinum as an African is is I think verydangerous and so you have to be verycareful about how you talk about thatwith people I think in in what you andthis is where I 100 agree with with JackDorsey is that the usage of Bitcoin as amedium as a means of exchange isactually the most valuable use case andum it will we will find its home heremore than in savings it will be used forsavings but it's not as or orit just won't be it won't be as valuableas the as the use of everyday moneyexchanging it for goods and servicesthat's where I think Bitcoin really willwill be valuable and it can't be Bitcoinitself it has to be you know thelightning Networkum and other things on top of that thatmake it workso it just becomes another tool like Ihave bank accounts in the UK forbusiness and personal life which are uhwhich are pound denominated but I alsohave with one of those accounts a dollarto nominate account but I also have aBitcoin wallet where I could store ColdStorage by Bitcoin but I also have amobile wallet where I have liked theBitcoin and I've come to use differentones for different purposes that suit mylife as somebody who lives in the UK hasa uh recently rapidly devaluing poundwho works internationally and travelsI've learned the different monetarytools I need for different things Iguess that's just a similar scenariothat people face Maybe in Africa andthey would just use this as a differenttoolright and so people are always lookingfor ways that they can either save moremoney or make more money uh and sothey'll pick up new tools I mean youthink you use every feature on a phoneyou haven't seen an African use a phoneyetum you know you you think you you usethat app the best it can be you've neverseen an African using that same appright they'll they'll come up with waysto use things and do things that youjust are like oh wow I never thoughtabout it in that wayum like you know one of the issues wehave here is on ramping into Bitcoin soif we talk about education you say okaylet's say let's go to the village andyou guys should join me sometime as wego to a village and we say okay let metell you about Bitcoin and you talkabout Bitcoin you say isn't this amazingand you say well how can you buy itwell you're going to have some cricketsfor a minute nobody like there's it'sreally hard to buy but you have to youknow go download so you have to have aninternet connection you have to have asmart enough phone that you can downloadthe bitmob appum register an account and then you canbuyor alternatively maybe you have anempessa account already on your dumbphone andum you have a friend who has access to asmartphone or the internet and you cango to paxful or local Bitcoins and thenyou can trade you know with the KenyaShillings for Bitcoinum fairly expensive by the way those arenot cheap ways to accrue Bitcoinum you know it's actually difficult likethere's there the biggest problem wehave I think right now is on-ramps andoff-ramps uh to bitcoin uh because evenif you can get people to believe thatthis is a thing that they can useum then how do they do itit's not it's not simple and I guessthere's another consideration one of thethings we talk to people about withBitcoin is you know your keys not yourBitcoin back up your private Keys uh Ihave a 305 multi-sig setup for my coldstorage where I have keys distributedinto different Geographic locations uhbut that suits somebody who's aWesterner who lives in the UK who hasall the options of you know family wholive in different locations friendsoffices you know uh you could take outthe security boxes at Banks like there'slots of different options to dosomething like that if you're a villagerlive in a village and I've I've no ideaof what the housing situation is and Iwould jump to some embarrassing clichesabout imagining people living in maybehuts and thingsum the idea of backing up a private keyand where do you keep that secureaccurately it's very different fromsomebody you live in in New York orLondonyeah no I mean this isso yes you're not wrong I mean in someparts of Africa you know even in therural area where I have um a placepeople still have mud houses and tinroofs you know that's very much realityum and yeah I mean like they don't havethe same optionality as as you or I dofor how they're going to do thingsum which is why I think what's what'sgoing on with fettiment is reallyinterestingum you know that idea of being able touh have a community by the way we'revery community based here in Africa soit's that that model does fit right likethis idea that there's people in thecommunity that you can trust and youknow that can be shared acrossindividuals is does work and so you knowthat's a way to think about about yourkeys and your coins um that's a way tothink about your access to bitcoin aswell in a way that has been done beforeum so I'm I am I am bullish on that Ihope they you know the the protocol aswell as fetty and the team are able tobuild some some useful tools that can beplugged in right awaybut beyond that it's like you knowum you know you think about like how doyou secure it I mean it's hard for it'shard for usyou know somebody in a village with adumb phone is going to have a hardertime you know maybe they can use move itmove lightning payments um do thingslike that but what they're going to endup doing is cashing out into the localcurrency as soon as they can afterthey've done those payments to hold itbecause there is a a really good viableoption for holding and securing it rightnow right okay okay let's get intogridless then let's get into yourproject uh explain in detail again whatcordless is I know we covered this alittle bit at the start but I kind ofwant to dig into it nowyeah so you know we started off um justlooking at different energyum in the mix of it and you know there'sthere's opportunities to go after someof the larger energy generation and umgrid connected energy if you wanted toin Africaum but the real benefit of of gridlessis going to the places that are not wellconnected that don't have a good grid sowe found mini grid providers and westarted just calling a bunch of them allover East and Southern Africa and sayinghey tell us about your your problems andso this would be solar wind Hydrogeothermal tends to be bigger so weweren't dealing with geothermal at thetime can you explain what a mini grid isyeah so we we started talking to thesemini grid providers who were all overthe content and many grid providers tous um there's no really good definitionof it that we tend to think of them aspeople who are developing energy productprojects that are probably under twomegawatts soum and oftentimes under oneum so we would we found out that whenthey were going in and building it theyhad to over build for the communityum for two reasons one because the usageof the community over time will go upand they need to be ready for it and twouh if you're doing Wind or solar youhave a certain amount of of energygeneration during the day but only acertain amount of use and the use duringthe daytime is very low in thesecommunities and the use in the morningsand the evenings is is higher so youknow you have to build enough that youcan you can have enough for thoseperiods and that meant they have a tonof stranded energy like the energy isgoing to waste it's sitting there isliterally being wasted and it's beingturned into heat and dissipated and sowe said we have a better way of turninginto heat and dissipating it let's put aBitcoin miner on it and um then we canpay you for it and soum we found a partner who was willing togive it a try we tested it out and andit really works and if you've if you'veseen any of the stuff we've done onlineum one of the first sites we set up wasuh you know it's about a 50 kilowatt uhsite and the community around it it wasusing 20 kilowatts of it during the dayand so that left 30 kilowatts uh for usto access which is you know maybe sixminers so we set up six miners insidethere and um and thenum at night we would be like what whathappened to the energy this is hydro Ishould start with that this is a smallmini Hydro side of 50 kilowatts and youknow at night it would all you know halfour miners would just shut off what isgoing on we had no idea what was goingon and um so finally we went to the sitewe were talking to the engineers he'slike oh yeah well you know between sixand ten in the eveningum people use more energy so we need towe need to use about 15 more kilowattsso I just I go out down there and flickoff your switch and they were like ohum okay well you know now that we knowthat we can do that remotely in fact wecan automate it so you don't have towalk down that Steep Hill in the darkand and flick a switch and if it'sraining slip and slide down it and theseare steep money Hills too and so he wasreally happy with that we and we turnedon this kind of Auto curtailing of amini Grid in you know in the middle of avery agricultural belt of rural Kenyathere's very little differencefundamentally what you're doing withthese mini grids then say Hive is doinguh in Texaswell I mean I would say that uh besidesthe orders of magnitudeum and the ability to get paid whenwe're curtailing the power like we don'tget paid week or tail but but it's thesame kind of scenario right you'remaking a grid more efficientyeah so I think there's two things goingon there's there's yes you're making thegrid more efficientum but you're also providingsustainability so if you if you think Ihad never seen this kind of a I call ita win-win-win situation so when we whenwe were talking to the mini gridproviders you know we called up dozensof them all over the content and um theyhave a really big problem withsustainability it costs a fair whack ofmoney to put one of theseum sites together and then they have tocharge a certain amount for it sothere's some solar sites where they'recharging 90 cents a kilowatt to ruralusers who don't have much disposableincome 90 cents in Kenya and Nairobiwe're paying 22 cents pre-tax on ourenergy which is still fairly high rightum and you know in places in the USYou'll Play 10 centsum or less and um so it's it's I mean 90cents for a rural African user is isincredibly high and we asked them wellwhy is that that doesn't seem like ifyou're there to kind of bring energy topeople and you're putting in 100kilowatt solar site how does that evenmake sense and like we just we have tomake our return on investment and so wehave to charge this much and we have abunch of wasted energyum so what happens when a Bitcoin minercomes in we buy that excess and so ithelps make the the mini grid themselvesmore sustainable because they're gettingso three five times the money they weregetting before andum and that brings the third win whichis not up to us it is up to the energyprovider uh the mini grid themselvesthey can decrease the cost to the enduser so the communities that we've beenworking in they have done that they candrop the price from 35 cents before wegot there to kind of more like what itis in Nairobi so 22 to 25 cents todayand you know that's that makes asignificant change in somebody's life soyou have a win for us we're miningBitcoin you have a win for the energygeneration the mini grid because they'reable to sell all their power now and youhave a win for the community becausethey have a more power more efficientpower and cheaper power and one of thesesites these uh these mini crit siteswhat kind of size Community are theyserving and what's the what is the localeconomy in these places is it mainlyfarmingyeah it's hugely agricultural aroundhereum you know we're we're going to beopening up the site pretty soon in insouthern Africaum that I I think is agricultural aswellum but there's more mining sites andother other Industries down there thatare in those rural areas uh but in ourareas it's all it's all Agriculture andum and so yeah with that with a sitethat is you know 50 kilowatts you'llprobably have about 500 connections toit in the in the communityum you know and uh there's moreconnections you can you could actuallybuild that grid out further if you hadmore power so that's one of the thingsthat's happenedum the second site that we went into wasactually just a little way up the sameriver and they put another Runner RiverSiteum a mini grid site there and that has500 kilowatts of uh of energy in whichwe use about 60 for Bitcoin mining so300 kilowatts for Bitcoin miningyeah so uh so in those scenarios like inin a 50 kilowatt site we'll have sixminers on shelves inside of the energysite next right next to the turbineright and um in a 500 kilowatt sitewe'll have a container sitting next tothe site that has more miners in it andthe connectivity to the internet andthings like that what is The Upfrontinvestment cost to build one of thesemini grids and I know it will changedepending on the the size of the outputso it's I actually think this is maybeone of the biggest things I need tochange so that's a fantastic questionso our partners if they're building amini grid that's 200 kilowatts that'sgoing to charge them about four thousanddollars it's going to cost them aboutfour thousand dollars per kilowatt tobuild if they're building somethingthat's about 10 times bigger so 1.9megawatts that will cost them about athousand dollars a kilowatt to buildjust because of economies of scale so Ithink one of the biggest advantages thatBitcoin mining can bring is a new energydevelopment where we can come alongsideas a partner for somebody who's tryingto build more energy into further offplaces so move the grid even further outto the edges and we can say listenyou're going to build a 200 or 500 Megayou know kilowatt site why don't youbuild something that's one to one and ahalf maybe two we'll help bring thefinancing alongside for that and thenthe Bitcoin mining we'll backstop thefinancing of that for the first howevermany years until it's paid off and Ithink that is the is one of the biggestPromises of of electricity generationacross Africa that I've seen in my wholelife yeah the reason I ask because itfeels like that is a initial investmentthat could beuh High tens but possibly hundreds ofthousands of dollars just to get thesite operational to serve anagricultural community of maybe 500connections and so I was just wonderingof the economics of it for yeah it seemslike a very tough Market yeah you'vetalked about these communities maybehaving people who don't have a lot ofmoney aren't paid a lot I mean I mightbe wrong here these these these FarmThese Farms these agricultural areasmight you know do okay economically butit still feels like a tough businessyou would think so rightum but remember if you have a if youhave an off take or an energy off takerwho can provide you a base levelum for 50 of that or more then you'reactually in a very good positionso um you had Brandon Clinton on earlieruh I think where I was in December maybeand he had a you know he talks about youknow uh Bitcoin miners coming in andcreatingum space for new things to happen rightfor for other types of activity to comeon board and I think that is very muchwhat happens here is that with moreenergyum and access to it with more affordableenergy then people do more I'm really onthat Ericum as you drive the price of energy downfor the people in the community that aresort of close to the grid that they'reoperational now presumably their usageof energy will increase so what doesgridless plan to do when that happens isit like you move on and you see theproject somewhere else and kind of growit again or do you actually grow out theGrid in the same locationso our partners grow out the Grid in thesame location further what we do is themore energy that's needed by thecommunity and small businesses then wedecrease our usage of miners and we movethem and that's written into ourcontractsand in terms of the kind of testing workyou're doing with this at the moment howwell is this workingso it's working really wellum sometimes and then other times itjust like falls apart so like um was itfour days ago three days ago we lost uhinternet connection at uh one of oursites uh for 13 hours and so our minerswere sitting there mining away the wholetime and um we didn't earn a single youknow Bitcoin or sat for it and um it'sfrustrating because that's somethingthat you know we know quite a bit aboutconnectivity internet connectivity andum and that but we just didn't haveanybody there we hadn't built theredundancy for connection into that siteyet and uh so sometimes you have thoseissuesum we've come across other this is wherewhen you're in the trenches it'sdifferent than in theory landum where you know the the rainfall thisyear was really poor in in Kenya so thatmeans we're getting less water into theturbines which means that again thecommunity gets first take and then weget the next so we haven't actually beenable to run 300 kilowatt side of 300kilowatts for the last three weeks we'vebeen running it at 100 which means thatyou know only a third of our miners arerunning in that site so we're now movingthem to other sites so that they getmore usage uh you know so in reality Ithink what we're finding is that youhave to be able to first of all build avery lean operation uh with people whocan figure things out on the fly on theground as they happen two is then buildprocesses and systems and that you canmake sure that strengthen you to take tomake sense of these variables againwhich is not not an abnormal thing forus to have to deal with but you have tobuild that into your organization and umand your operations and um I think aswe're kind of figuring out that businessoperation side of things it's going tolevel outum but it's going to always have somevariability to it the um I'll tell youanother interesting story I you know theI think the biggestI think they're the biggest Bitcoinminer in Africaum is a big block data center out of theCongoI don't know if you've ever talked toSebastian Sebastian's the French guy whostarted it and um they run I think it'sfive megawatts of oldum really kind of like S9 kind of minersin um in uh in the varunga forest and umit's a it's a really amazing setup it'sa great setup it helps supportum the the you know the the gorillas andeverything that are in the park rightthere it's a it's a very fantasticprogram but you know he was telling me astory at the Africa Bitcoin conferencethis year about how they have to theyhave to deal with electricityum uh specifically lightning solightning strikes in the mountains areare are really they're very consistentthey happen all the time and it alsobrings down things all the time so theyhave to control for that they have tosometimes turn off all their their theyhave to curtail all of what they dountil the Lightning goes away you havethings like that environmental factorsthat are maybe maybe a little differentthan what you'd find in you know theother places that do a lot of Bitcoinmining but I think as we get as we getto as we come to terms with theenvironmental issues that we have todeal with at a mini grid level or evenwhat what Sebastian is doing at bigblock data center you know you you youstart to build new things you build newways of managing itum we've been building software now thatcan you know there's software alreadythat runs the miners the foreman is thisreally good software that we use tomanage our Miners and then there's thesoftware that's used to kind of seewhat's going on with the turbines orwith the solar power whatever it is butthey don't talk to each other right sowe're already thinking about like whatare this what's the pieces of softwarewe need to write so they can speak toeach other to do the auto curtailing andand base load managementum in these locations I think there'sgoing to be a whole bunch of innovationaround the Bitcoin mining space thatcomes from Africa because we have todeal with it in a very different wayyeah I mean everything you're telling mejust sounds like The Growing Pains of anew business the unknown unknowns whenthey come along okay okay well we nowhave to plan for that and consider howwe deal with that in the futureyeah that's true um I just you knowum the only difference is that I thinkthat the types of things that get thrownat you here might be a little differentthanum in other parts of the worldyeah I can imagineumso was it what is the size of theopportunity heresoumI can I can talk about him being apartner of this because uh he's he'slike an early advisor and then ended updoing some investment as well but wehave a a really old school Bitcoin minerwho's been uh helping us figure thingsout that's uh uh Marshallum out of um a lot of Texas yeahMarshall Long uh he works with rhodiumand um he's he knows more about thisspaceum than almost anybody at least thatwe've met and it's been super helpful infiguring out things and um so he cameand visited with us in I think Octoberand he looked around and uh he said youknow I think Africa might be the nextbig hum of Bitcoin mining and the reasonwhy is because you don't have a gridthat actually makes it really valuablefor Bitcoin miners because you can comein and you can do deals that would bevery difficult to do elsewhere and it'snot seen as kind of turning the screwson somebody it's seen as a thank Godyou're here to help me so so when we goand talk to an energy provider an energydeveloperum so we have um let me give you somefinite examples so we went and talked toa solar farm that had built 94 megawattsof solar they've been able to sell 80Megabots of it to the grid they have 14megawatts that are just sitting therestranded so they had never heard ofBitcoin never thought of Bitcoin miningany of that stuff so we went there wespent the first hour just explainingwhat Bitcoin is what Bitcoin mining ishow the Bitcoin network worksThis Global you knowum This Global Network of of computersand and hash powerand then at the end of it they said sohow much are you going to pay for thepower he said we're not going to pay youanythingum and they said well we need to be paidyou know x amount for this power we saidwell here's the deal you're not sellingthat power to anybodybut I'll tell you what we'll do we'llgive you 30 of the of the revenue we'llgive you 30 of the Bitcoin that's mineevery minute of every dayand they sat there and thought about itthey're like okay and we went around andsaw everything for the next hour and wecame back and said well how much are yougoing to pay he was like we're not goingto pay you're gonna get 30 Revenue shareon this Bitcoin they're likeI know but we're like you're not gettinganything else there's nobody else tosell this power to they're likeokay you're right and we can do let'sstart with two megawatts let's see whatwe can do so that's the kind of thingthat happens here and I think that's whyMarshall and others see the advantagelike there's not only the larger powergeneration you know Renewable PowerGeneration sites that are like them andHydra is the same Hydro has massiveamounts of stranded energy like in inEast Africa alone there's over 200megawatts of just stranded energy in inI think actually in just Kenya alonethere's 200 megawatts of just strandedenergy and that's mostly Hydroum Sun solar and um and you know youlook at that you're like wow that's abig opportunity and then you turn overhere and you say the mini grids have thesame problem at a smaller scale ourbusiness has been built around sayinghey we want to do a very instead of justkind of vertical growth where we go tobig mining sites and we build anotherjust Big Data Center we want to buildyou know we want to build laterally wewant to we want to build horizontallywhere we have many small sites and maybea couple larger ones right in the futurebut um we think that's that's wheregrowth and decentralization security ofthe network comes from and there's aadditional benefit here because youcould have turned around to them andsaid yeah we'll pay you accents on thedollar for uh for your power and theywould have just issued you an invoiceyou'd have paid them but you've kind offorced them to learn a little bit aboutBitcoin now and they're people who workin this sector they're going to tellother people who work in this sectorabout what they're doing so you helpspread the knowledge and understandingof Bitcoin as wellyeah we do you know we think we haveum a pretty nice pole position in thespace but you talk about sharing rightum I'm wearing the the gamma shirt gammais the green African mining Allianceright it's just an association of otherrenewable energyum based Bitcoin miners in Africa andthere's only five of us right nowbut the idea is like how can we sharethis knowledge so it can be done by morepeople gridless alone can't takeadvantage of all the opportunities thatare just in East Africa so why would wetry and and and and take that knowledgeand just own it ourselves we shouldshare this we should share themethodologies we should share theblueprints for how to do this and um weshould we should also share some datawith each other and maybe with TheRegulators who are going to come alongbehind us and try and make laws aroundus so that it opens it up to more peoplemore more Bitcoin is being mined on thecontinent more companies are beingdeveloped around it some small somelarge no doubt some will be even largerthan us andum but it also opens it up to the energyguys in a way that they've never neverhad it before and I think that's that'swhat gets exciting when you when you cantake just so you know the numbersthere's 600 million people in Africathat don't have access to electricitythat's a lot right that's two-thirds ofthe world's total that don't have accessto electricity that's here and so whatwe all should be trying to do is focuson how can we help electricityproliferate across this continentBitcoin mining just happens to be themissing link that allows that to happenand so it ends up being good businessfor us it also ends up being good forthe rest of society and Eric would yousay it's fair to say that whilst you'rean entrepreneur and you've clearly had asuccessful career this is part Missiondrivenyou know um yeah like I just have alwaysbeenif you're gonna spend your life doingsomething build something that makes theworld a better place makes it moremeaningful I think that's where I saidum you know there's there's you canbuild all kinds of things you can makeall kinds of moneyum you can build small things in likeyou can build large things but whateveryou try and do and whatever I try and doit let me say is try and build somethingthat doeshelp you know proliferate the the betterHuman Condition andum and yes you should make money at thesame time because I you know I grew uphere and I've seen the the damage thatngos and government can do and so Ithink if you actually want to makechange happen in in Africa then youbuild businesses you grow well and um Ithink business is the right way is theright Vector for thatso I asked the question for a reasonbecause uh as a bitcoiner I'm abitcoiner Danny's a bitcoiner you're abitcoiner uh when we you know travel tosay a Bitcoin Meetup we spend most ofour time just talking about ideas andopportunities and what people areworking on but then outside of that wealso have to interact with thenon-bitcoin world which can be verychallenging uh we have people who arevery critical of Bitcoin people whospread misinformation risk of Regulationuh we have all these external forcesworking against usyeahThey Don't Really unders I thinksometimes it comes from a place ofprivilege this one guy I can't rememberhis name he's a very critical he's he'squite a big critic of Bitcoin he livesin Berkeley and you know in SanFrancisco he lives a very privilegedlife and I don't think he realizes theconsequences of what he's trying to stopin places like Africa you know he he haselectricity he doesn't well he's inCalifornia it might have blackouts buthe doesn't have uh the kind of issuesthat people in Africa are dealing withand from his privileged position he'sworking against a technology whichsupports you know the flourish the humanflourishingyeah I mean I think what you have ispeople there's a lot of people withblinders on who live in the west becausethey can't see beyond what happens tothem every day and there are challengesI mean that's that's not you knowthere's people who have real issues inthe US and Europe and places like thatbut umyou know when you when you're superfocused on your own view of the world Ithink what happens is you just you don'tsee what's going on elsewhere and um andthe Damage that you can do on a kind ofa macro scale around it because you'reso focused on yourself andum and you know for you know for thatreason I think you know you need morepeople to travel you need more people tosee and it's when those experiences arehad uh that you you change your worldview like before you started travelinginternationally I bet you had a verydifferent world view than you do todayand a lot of these people haven'ttraveled enough or when they do they'rein a very controlled environment thatdoesn't allow them to actually see whatthe every man does and every man has todeal with well I think gridless mightbecome one of those things that I end upmentioning quite a bit on the show or onTwitter or when I'm with somebody who'svery critical of Bitcoin need to saylook you really need to understand thein what this Innovation is doing indifferent parts of the world yeah we'vehad different case studies like theBelarus protests against lukachenka orthe protests in Nigeria but now what wehave is another opportunity which iscreate an economic economicopportunities so don't be surprised ifthis is becomes one of my case studiesAlex Gladstone and I've known each othera long time because of ushahidi and thehuman rights foundation and so we wereboth at a conference recently and someof my old friends were there too and youknow very academic veryanti-bitcoin that's what I came to findout and they were they they saidsomething you know I remember sitting atthe table and said well it's yeah I'mjust sad to see that you're doing thisnow Eric right I'm like wait it's likewell hold on a second what do you notlike about it and then you know it'sthis alone you know Bitcoin uses so muchenergy it's just it's not good for theplanet and I said well let me see if Ican change your mind right on that andstart talking about it and you know it'svery easy to be anti-bitcoin when you'resitting in you know a comfy house in ain a nice situation uh somewhere in U.Sor Europe but you know when you actuallysee the change in the ability forsomebody to to do their homework atnight maybe cool their food for thefirst time everum charge their phone and be able to bein communication you can't tell me thatyour comfort andum even even if even though we all knowthe numbers are wrong but you can't tellme that your theory on what is good foryou in that situation is better uh it'sit's more important than it is for thatkid or that family living in ruralAfrica and I think that's what peopleforget yeah okay uh the main thing uhsorry the last thing I want to get intowith you or ask you about is uh we'vehad a lot of amazing Innovation uhcoming off the back of mining we'vecovered it on the show so whether thatis what is happening in Texas with thegrid whether it's what Adam Wright isdoing withlandfill sites fluoromethane you knowthe gas flare inside is what you'redoing there's all this innovationthe thing that keeps niggling at theback of my mind iswill there be enough opportunity willthere be enough uh profitableopportunity for miners to support allthese projects and we we made a show theother day with Sam wooters I probablypronounce this surname wrongum that's going to come out soon andhe's going to be talking about the saythis actual thingum but really we need Bitcoin tocontinue to grow the price to grow themarket to grow the network to grow tomake these projects like you're doingand they're doing actually uhsustainable and is that something youthink about much well we're alreadysustainable now rightum and I think this is this is theadvantage in the the beauty of of theBitcoin Network in mining is thatif you can go out and and co-locate anddo a proper partnership with an energyprovider like I for instance I grew upin South Sudan right South Sudan is nota place you want to go uh for mostpeople it's it's a messum there's gas flaring going on thereall the time so there's no reason thoughif you can't find the partnership withthat local Oil Company you couldn't dogas flaring like you're dancing in Texasthere right nowit's there's nothing stopping youthere's the risk associated with thepolitical risk rightum and there's ways to control for thatum but the opportunities are there andthere's money to be made and I thinkthere's going to be money to be madeinto the future on it too I don't thinkthat there's I don't think there's alack of opportunity I think there isum there's this Delta where there's ahuge amount of opportunity and there'sthere's the people who aren't ready forthat risk profile yet because they areare flooded to death on bitcoin theydon't know what it is and they're scaredof it so that's an opportunity for thoselike us to take advantage of and movefaster just just before we close out canI ask a question on that um thepolitical risk I know that Kenya isfairly stable but what about the othernations in Africa like how do you how doyou account for whether it's corruptgovernment or non-government groupscoming in and seizing equipment orwhatever it might be yeah so um Africais very relational you have to have goodrelationships and you have to bepartnered with people who have goodrelationships and are connected so umyes some countries are more stable thanothers rule of law does countum and so Kenya is a good place for thatyou know Say Ghana is South Africa isZambia probably is tooum but the there's other places that areyou knowtougher and um I think you know youcould talk about South Sudan that's onewhere if you're going to go into SouthSudan you better be partnering withsomebody who knows the Office of thePresidentum because if you don't then you youknow who knows what might happen sopolitical risk um and Geographic riskare real uh which is why what we do iswe're quickly moving past just onecountry so yes Kenya is our backyardit's our homeum but you know getting another sitegoing Malawi uh there's another site inWest Africa that'll go live in FebruaryI'm trying to make sure that we we toohave Geographic spread of our hash rateinto our own company so that we don'tum you know get turned upside downbecause of something that happenedeconomically or politically in thecountry and Eric anyone listening howcan people help you like how can Dannyand I help you how can listeners helpyou what do you want from peopleso we were very fortunate to get areally good funding round uh from theteam at block at stillmark and um youknow we've been able to move forwardpretty well with thatum it allows us to buy things you knowinexpensively right now but we're we'regoing to be we're going to grow beyondthat at some point and so we're lookingwe're going to look for partners who caneither bring power to the tableum you know good pipeline here in Africaor people who um were partnering withsomeum unnamed uh larger mining institutionswe we can take their older Miners andput them to work we can sweat theirassetsum and so we can deploy more to maybelower efficiency sites uh like solarthat way and so looking for partners inthat places in those places is good forus and then I think it's just like Heylisten tell the story of how Bitcoinmining actually is good for people andPlanet I think that's that's the casehere where you know we thought thatinstead of sitting out there and justtalking about it and writing about itwe're saying let's do it and make surethat others can do it tooum so if there's there's other minorsyou know we've got symbola in Nigeriawe've got Nemo up in Ethiopia we haveyou know Sebastian and Congo and youknow these guys need support and theyneed they need help and they need growthtooum how can you know if we've already gotour funding then Finance themum help them growum they they they have all that theyneed up here but sometimes they don'thave the same access to Capital as we dookay and if people want to find out morewhere are we sending themso it's gridless compute.com for uswe're also at gridless compute onTwitter and then uh for gamma you justgo to www.gamma.comright okay Danny I think we need to goto Africa I don't know when we're goingto come but I think we're going to comeand visit uh come and see what you'redoing but come and see some of the otherprojects so uh we will have to look atour diary and see where we can make thathappen hopefully we can do it this yearuh keep doing what you're doing this isfascinating I think I'm going to betalking about this a lot uh especiallywhen I'm talking to a fun star aprivileged prick up in San Francisco orsomebody who just doesn't understandBitcoin I think I'm going to say well Ineed to tell you about something uhthat's happened in Africa that mightchange a world view so uh well donecongratulations on your funding roundum congratulations on everything you'vedone if you need anything from Danny andI or I just reach out to us where we'rehere to help and we wish you the bestfor the futurethank you guys for having me on it'sbeen a been a real pleasureall right thank you",
