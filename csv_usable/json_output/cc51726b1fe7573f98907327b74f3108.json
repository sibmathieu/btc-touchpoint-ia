  "text": "[00:01:39] Preston Pysh: Hey everyone, welcome \nto the show. I’m here with William. William,  I am thrilled to have you here. I really, \nI’m really excited about this conversation.[00:01:47] William Casarin: Yeah, it’s great to \nbe here. It’s the first time I’ve . I haven’t  watched too many podcasts, but yeah, I’m \nexcited to be on and chat about Nostr.[00:01:54] William Casarin: So this[00:01:54] Preston Pysh: topic \nis incredible and I think we  just need to start for everybody in our audience.[00:01:59] Preston Pysh: I would, I \nwould imagine most are not familiar  with what we’re talking about. Give them \na, just a basic overview of what Nostr is.[00:02:07] William Casarin: So Nostr is \nan idea that started from someone named  Fiatjaf. He was a a Bitcoiner. He is a \nBitcoiner in the Bitcoin community and  he was just trying to come up with a way \nto build a, a social network like Twitter,  but make it decentralized so that \nit’s not in control of a single party.[00:02:22] William Casarin: Cause we were starting \nto see the issues crop up around that recently. So  he just came together with like the simple, \nit was just like a markdown document. Like,  Hey, how could we do this? And that’s where \nit started. And I saw this technology a while  back and I’m just, Hey, let’s try to build \na client and then started building on it.[00:02:35] William Casarin: And \nI’ve just been like blown away  at how how impressive it is and how simple it is.[00:02:38] Preston Pysh: So, so \nfor people that are hearing that,  they, I think the use case is really obvious. \nDecentralized social media, you. Both parties,  political parties, trying to gain control. \nI think you see a lot of large banks trying  to control the boards of like Facebook and \nTwitter and trying to control the messaging.[00:02:58] Preston Pysh: That’s really \nwhat you’re after, right? But doing it  in practice is the difficult part. Talk \nto us a little bit about why that’s so  hard to solve from just a technical \nstandpoint, from a broad brush over.[00:03:11] William Casarin: So when \nyou’re trying to build a network that  like everyone in the world can connect \nto and communicate with each other,  you naturally have centralizing effects \njust because to, to even pull that off,  you need to some beefy servers and those people \nare run, those servers are run by someone.[00:03:24] William Casarin: And the minute \nyou try to make things more decentralized,  typically the user experience gets very \npoor. These networks tend to be kind of  a little bit more complicated than \na centralized solution like Twitter.  So now we’re just trying to figure out \nwhat’s the best way to do this in a way  that we can scale it out to more and more people.\n[00:03:38] William Casarin: So this is where Nostr  comes in. We, we think we have a pretty good idea \nof how to do this with like not just one person in  control, but maybe like a small set of people. So \nit’s like a little bit more decentralized and it’s  a tough problem, but I think we actually \nmight be able to crack it with this one.[00:03:50] Preston Pysh: What’s the foundation? \nBecause my understanding is that you have an  event and I think it’s really important for \npeople to understand that you’re going to the  protocol level. And then we talk about the \nclient level. So get into some of that and  also talk more specifically about this idea of \nthe event and the simplicity around the event.[00:04:08] William Casarin: In the protocol \nlevel, the way I like to describe it is if  you’re not familiar with like internet protocols, \nthey underlie a lot of the, the technology we use,  like our web browser, you know, it speaks the \nHCTP and TLS protocol and that allows us to  contact any server. The browser knows how to \nfetch the page and render it, and things like,  There’s other protocols like email where we can \nrun many different email clients, so like Gmail  Outlook, and they all can talk to each other \nbecause they’re using this underlying language.[00:04:31] William Casarin: So \nthis is all what a protocol is.  It’s just an underlying language for the \ncomputers can use to talk to each other.  So what Nostr is, we’re trying to, what’s \nthe language, what’s the computer language  for social media? The basic idea that we’re \ntrying to go for here is instead of like,  we’re a Twitter like model where you’re just \nsending a tweet to a single server, you just  send that event or that note, like you mentioned, \nyou just send it to like any server you want.[00:04:49] William Casarin: Like, \nbut they all kind of have the same,  they understand the message that you’re sending \nthem, so they’ll, they’ll understand like, okay,  this is a tweet that this person send \nout and they save it to their server,  and then other people who are also connected \nto those relays can just pull those messages.[00:05:01] William Casarin: So instead \nof just getting it from one server,  you’re just now getting it from 10. So that \nkind of decentralizes the risk in terms of  you being censored or you being like your \nspeech being controlled. But it also, you  get the benefits of having like high performance \nservers and versus like some type of peer-to-peer  model where we’re all trying to get it from each \nother, which can be kind of bad for performance.[00:05:17] William Casarin: It’s a \nnew type of protocol, not knowing,  I don’t know that many protocols that \nlike do it in this particular model,  but for the use case of social \nmedia, it works really well.[00:05:25] Preston Pysh: How are you able to \nmake the size of the events small enough? If  a person runs a relay or their own \nprivate server, that it’s just not,  how do you truncate that and make it small, \nbut still carry the underlying message?[00:05:39] William Casarin: There’s \nall this blockchain craze that took off  recently and this idea where you just collect \neveryone’s transaction. Everyone has a store,  everyone’s transaction. This is not what Nasra is. \nNasra is not a blockchain. It’s not these, like,  you’re not trying to achieve global consensus. \nSo if you want to just run a relay in your own  house that just stores your messages and your \nmessages for your friends, that’s completely okay.[00:05:56] William Casarin: You probably \ndon’t want us sync Twitter’s database to  your note at home cause you’ll probably, your \ncomputer will catch. It’s kind of specifically  designed in a way that allows you to get \nthe messages from the people you care about,  from your own nodes, and then you can \nignore a lot of the other busier stuff.[00:06:09] William Casarin: And so we can \nkind of start to talk about like different  types of relays there might be in the future. \nI, I’m sort of thinking about this a lot now  in terms of like, what’s a public relay \nversus like a private relay. But yeah,  we’re just starting to see the beginnings of \nthis, because right now they’re just a bunch  of public relays that everyone’s just \nkind of sending all their messages to.[00:06:23] William Casarin: But it’s \nstarting to get kind of crazy with  like a lot of crazy people on the relay. \nSo we’re trying to think about how we’re  going to scale this out and what, \nwhat that’s going to look like.[00:06:30] Preston Pysh: That’s one of the biggest \nquestions that I see is five years from now,  scale-wise, how in the world can something like \nthis scale, when you talk about the incentives  around people running their own and you, and \nyou’re using the term relay for people that  might not be dialed in, just think of that as \nlike your own personal server or anybody can  host as many of another person’s persona \nthat they want or as few as they want.[00:06:54] Preston Pysh: But go ahead and \nand explain a little bit of that scale.[00:06:57] William Casarin: So the way that I \nlook at a, a relay, a relay in some sense is  like you take the Times Square. So Twitter and \nElon is trying to, you know, Twitter’s going to  be the nude public town square on the internet, \nthat’s fine, but it’s in control of one person.[00:07:08] William Casarin: So what \na relay is that in my mind is it’s  democratizing the town square on the internet. So,  so that anyone can become a platform of speech \nthat you can connect to. So they’re kinda like  free speech nodes on the internet. The way \nthat I see it breaking down is I can see it,  there’s probably going to be like a public good \nor like a public relays, which are kind of crazy.[00:07:23] William Casarin: There’s going \nto be a lot of spam, but anyone can go  there and get their their message out, and \nit might be a shelling point for meeting up  and things like that. But maybe you don’t \nwant to have that crazy, hectic, wild west  of communication. So maybe you’d pay some money \nto whitelist your pub key and get onto another,  like maybe more semi-private public relay where \nyou can have a more civilized conversation.[00:07:41] William Casarin: But the cool thing \nabout clients is they can connect to both. I  can connect to the public relay, I can connect \nto the more, you know, chill relay that’s like  less crazy, and then I can turn them on and off \nat will and just see different perspectives of  the worldwide conversation. Those are like the \ntwo modes I’ve been thinking about recently.[00:07:54] William Casarin: And then you can \nhave a note in your own house just to back up  your own speech, which, which is cool is every \ntime you, you send a speech into the internet,  it’s getting backed up onto your node or, or in \nyour house. And then if you ever want to broadcast  your, your, your history of your speech, you can \ndo that to the internet and just backing it up has  that benefit of no one can just delete your speech \noff the internet or, or take you off the internet.[00:08:12] William Casarin: You can always \nbroadcast it to new relays. So yeah,  it has a lot of cool properties in that.[00:08:17] Preston Pysh: There’s a lot \nof people, Bitcoiners specifically,  that are already running their full nodes, and \nI’ve seen a lot of chatter with people saying,  Hey, I want my Umbr full node, which \nis for people not familiar with Umbral.[00:08:30] Preston Pysh: It’s basically a \nturnkey, really simple. You don’t have to  have a lot of technical chops to be able to \nrun your own full node if you’re running this  Umbral version. And so people were \nsaying, I want an application on my  umbr that I can just basically run my own relay \nmy own Nostr relay by clicking a couple buttons  and it sets it up on the hardware that \nI already have that I’m running my umbr.[00:08:53] Preston Pysh: Is something \nlike this possible, if it is possible,  how many personas could you basically \nload or store on something like that for  somebody who’s just running maybe \na terra of hard drive on their.[00:09:06] William Casarin: I actually \ndo this. I don’t have an umbrella,  but I have a machine at home that \nI connect to over like a vpn.[00:09:10] William Casarin: So I have \na private relay that I connect to. And  the reason I do this is A, to back up \nmy speech just in case even, I mean,  I run a public relay and I’m like, \nI’m not worried about that going down,  but it’s just nice to have a local cash of \nmy speech that I have backed up. And I think  that’s a really good, just, just to start \na really good use case just to backup idea.[00:09:25] William Casarin: But \nyou could also use that as a, a  local cache of speech that you \nwant from the internet. So for.  Let’s say I have a bunch of people that I really \nwant to make sure that I, I get their speech from  the internet, so maybe I’ll know that they’re \non certain public relays, and I’m worried that  those relays might go down so I can sync their \nspeech to my local node and only store the things  that I care about and it’ll be really fast, and \nit’s on your local network and things like that.[00:09:46] William Casarin: I see that as a \nreally cool use case of having an umbrella,  like free speech node just for those use cases. \nBut in terms of like syncing the entire public  relays to like to your local node is probably not, \nis not reasonable. There’s no reason why you want  to do that unless you really want to just see a \npublic conversation and have it backed up locally.[00:10:00] William Casarin: You could do, \nit was just, you need to have a lot more  space in that sense. But to give you an, \nan idea of how much this takes the store,  I’ve probably been running the biggest \nrelay for a couple months now, and I’m only  up to like four or five. That’s going to Wow. \nBecause it’s just small text. It’s just text.[00:10:14] William Casarin: We’re not starting \nany, all that’s in an, an event is just a content,  some tags, a signature and, and your \npub key, which is just a hex pub key  of, of your snor key. It’s very small \nin terms of what, what you can store.[00:10:25] Preston Pysh: Do you think that there’s \nbeen enough functionality built into the events,  these individual events of the Nostr \nprotocol, or do you think that,  I know there’s similar to Bitcoin, \nthere’s this submission process.[00:10:38] Preston Pysh: If people think that \nthere needs to be more functionality added into  the protocol, there’s kind of this community. \nTalk to us about that process and then talk to  us about the additional functionality that you \nthink might need to be added into it or removed.[00:10:52] William Casarin: So the \ninteresting thing about Bitcoin is that,  you know, it requires some \nform of global consensus.[00:10:56] William Casarin: So anytime you try \nto change the protocol, everyone kind of has  to agree. If, if people don’t agree to upgrade, \nthen everything starts breaking and we don’t want,  like, Bitcoin know it’s breaking around the \nworld. Cause some people can’t transact and  it’s not good. Bitcoin is very restricted in terms \nof like how you upgrade it and things like that.[00:11:08] William Casarin: Whereas Nasha doesn’t \nrequire global consensus. So I didn’t even talk  about this yet cause I was specifically \nfocusing on the social media use case,  but Nostr isn’t technically, doesn’t \nneed to be a, a speech or, or social  media pro protocol. It actually stands for \nnotes and stuff transmitted over relays.[00:11:23] William Casarin: And those notes \ncan be, have content of any kind. So there’s  some people using it for like playing chess. \nYou know, there’s like chess games going over  us right now. And the way that works is that \neach note has like something called a kind and  all it is is a number. Speech notes are just kind \none. Your contact list is kind three and there’s  direct messages and end-to-end encrypted \ndirect messages, which is like kind four.[00:11:42] William Casarin: But there’s like \nan integer number of kinds you can do. So if  you have a custom application and you want \nto run it on nas, The protocol is flexible  enough to do that, and, and there’s nothing \nwe can do to stop you because you can just  run your own relay and put your own notes \nof your own kinds on, and that’s fine.[00:11:54] William Casarin: That’s what it’s \nmeant for. So it’s really extensible in terms  of types of applications you can build on it. \nSo that leads into like, okay, maybe there’s  going to be a, a CK for Nostr where you can \njust, you don’t even need to run a, or even,  yeah, so content publishing or publishing \nblogs. You don’t even need to run a server.[00:12:08] William Casarin: You \ncan just publish it to the public  relays. There’s a lot of cool use cases \nthat people are not even exploring yet.[00:12:14] Preston Pysh: So you,  I think you said kind four was encrypted \nmessaging. When we set up this discussion, that’s  how I contacted you, was over this encrypted \nmessaging system. I’m curious if, in your opinion,  do you find that to be more protected from a \nprivacy standpoint than something like Signal?[00:12:33] William Casarin: So Signal is \nprobably much more secure because they’ve,  they have like hardcore crypto people who \nare working on state-of-the-art ratcheting  technology for to make sure it’s forward \nsecret. Our encryption spec right now  isn’t that good. It was kind of just thrown \ntogether. So there are some flaws with it.[00:12:46] William Casarin: So for \ninstance, if you ever leaked your  key or I’ve ever leaked my key. Yeah. Or \nsome got access to it. Yeah. You can see  both of our conversations whereas. That \nwould be much harder to do on on signal  because they have much better properties for \nthat. But there’s no reason why we couldn’t  build something like Signal on top of \nNasra cause of the Extens sensibility.[00:13:01] William Casarin: So I have a \nbounty we’ll get into that, but I have a  bounty. That’s like if you want to implemented \ncool signal, like level spec on top of Nasra,  I’m happy to pay to get that going because I, \nI definitely want better secure comms as well.[00:13:12] Preston Pysh: Going \nback to the discussion on the Umbr,  as far as people running their own full node.[00:13:18] Preston Pysh: Let’s say that there’s \nan app that’s built an Nostr app that’s integrated  into it, and I want my node to basically monitor a \nhundred different people that I personally follow  very closely from a storage standpoint. Going \nback, you were talking about how small the storage  space is. Do you think that for the typical person \nthat wants to closely follow a hundred people,  that should be no problem to basically \ninput those addresses of of those people?[00:13:44] William Casarin: I think for most \npeople they won’t even need to run their own node,  right? So this is more already the \npower users. This protocol is set  up so you don’t need to run anything. So \nit already has a somewhat advantage over  Bitcoin in the sense that you don’t really \nneed to run your own node. Yeah. Again,  the protocol is Zion that way, \njust so it’s just that easy.[00:13:59] William Casarin: And not \nonly that, you don’t need to run a node,  you don’t even need to have a, a phone number or \nan email address. You just look, just generate  a key and get going. So that is already \nhuge compared to like what most things you,  you’re used to online where you need to \nlike K y C yourself and things like that.[00:14:11] William Casarin: But if you \ndo want to run your own node and you do  want to sync stuff locally, yeah, it’s super \ntrivial. . And even if it does get too big,  it’s not like a blockchain where you need \nto keep the whole history. You can just like  chop off the data. because a lot of the time \nthere’s this thing on social networks where  older data seems not that interesting or not as \nuseful or the value of older data isn’t that.[00:14:28] William Casarin: Unless you’re \nlike going back and looking for old tweets,  there might be a concept of like an archival \nrelay and maybe more just like a real-time  relay that you don’t really care about the \nolder data. It’s very flexible in that.[00:14:38] Preston Pysh: What if somebody, \nokay, so let’s say I’m running my own  relay and I wanted to be nefarious and say, \nwell, we’ll just take your feed as example,  and let’s say that I’m, I’m trying to \nmisrepresent something that you’re saying,  and I want to create an event that says \nthe opposite of what maybe you said.[00:14:56] Preston Pysh: And so then I’m \npropagating this event. That’s a, that’s  a fake event. How do the clients, I \nknow it has to do with you signing,  basically, signing that event, but if I \nwas going to try to misrepresent something,  how is that protected against \nwalk people through that?[00:15:11] William Casarin: So these messages are,  these just small js o blobs and so JSON is just \nlike, you know, data format that’s very simple.[00:15:16] William Casarin: Text the \ncontent. So the, yeah, the content,  the tags, and pretty much all the data on, \non the note is signed using something like  very similar to a Bitcoin key and it’s called, \nthat’s just your nasr. That signature is, is  included in the message. And when you send it \nto a relay, the relay will actually check the  signature and it won’t even store that message \nunless it’s like a valid note from that person.[00:15:36] William Casarin: So that’s \nwhy that signature is really important,  because your client will say, yes, verify this \nis from this person. But there are some things  that people can do, like phishing, like a text, \nbecause there’s no u there’s no unique username  on this protocol. Really the only thing unique \nis, is your pub key, which is like a long.[00:15:51] William Casarin: you need some way to \ndistinguish if a person is like, like how do you,  like, people are not going to be memorizing \npeople’s pub keys. So we have a way of, the  way that I do it in, in the DOIs client \nis that if you’re following the person,  it’ll show like an Icon X their name. \nLike, hey, this is someone you know?[00:16:03] William Casarin: Mm-hmm. \n. But if someone’s trying to pretend  to be someone else, you know, it’s, it’s \nvery visible cause it’s from a different  key. And there’s other things we’re doing as \nwell, which is domain verification. So you  can have like JB five five, JB five \nfive.com and it’ll be very apparent  on your profile. So you know that that \nperson actually is who they say they are.[00:16:18] William Casarin: Amazing.[00:16:19] Preston Pysh: Okay, let’s talk about \nthe clients. For people that are non-technical  listening to this, I’m going to provide what \nI think it is and then I want you to correct  me and give us the actual definition. But so like \npeople are familiar with Twitter and so they like,  they log into quote unquote Twitter, and that \nwould be, let’s just say that that’s a client.[00:16:38] Preston Pysh: Then you have Facebook \nthat might be another client that people hear and  recognize from like a brand standpoint. These are \njust interfaces to the Nostr protocol. That that  is all the messages people have created \nthroughout their lifetimes. And so like  you’re developing a client right now, talk to \nus about this client, this software that you’re  developing that allows people to tap into this \nnetwork of messages that are out there right now.[00:17:05] William Casarin: Since all the \nsocial media companies, they, they’re not  using any underlying protocol. Their protocol is \nsimply their API to their centralized servers,  and it’s usually very locked down and they don’t \ninterop operate. If you send a tweet on Twitter,  it’s not going to show up on \nFacebook. Right. It’s just,  it’s not something that people expect \ncause it just seems so ridiculous.[00:17:20] William Casarin: But the \nminute you have an underlying protocol,  sending a tweet and yet showing up on Facebook \nwould be a very reasonable thing. Or even just  retweeting a tweet from Facebook if \nthat’s, I don’t think, I dunno if they  have pret tweets haven’t been there, Twitter, \nwhatever, whatever those things are called.[00:17:32] William Casarin: It might show \nup on the Twitter side as long as you have  some common language. Right. Yeah. This \nis kind of how it works right now. So I,  I’ve written an iOS client called Damas. \nIt connects, it doesn’t do anything  fancy. It doesn’t connect to my servers. \nIt just connects to relays. And then,  so the messages you see on that client are, \ncould be from, people could be posting from  the web clients that I, I don’t even \nwrite that I, that I, I haven’t written.[00:17:50] William Casarin: It’s \njust people con have written,  there’s probably like 10 or 20 clients that \nhave not, people have written on Nostr and  people are all communicating each. Yeah, it’s \njust, it enables this more flexibility in terms  of what types of clients you want to use. \nLike for instance, I know someone who runs  a terminal client, and this might \nbe really good for people who,  for accessibility reasons, just being able to \nuse a text mode version of your Twitter client.[00:18:09] William Casarin: Yeah, \nthere’s a lot more flexibility  in terms of what the experiences \nyou would want to have on Usher,  just just by having that flexibility \nbetween the client. So, I can tell you,[00:18:17] Preston Pysh: so like I have my iPhone,  I have the, the Damus app downloaded. It’s \nD A M U S for people. It’s in test flight  right now. So if you want to download it onto \nyour phone, you have to download test flight,  and then you go to the DOIs website and you \ncan download the app right off the app store.[00:18:35] Preston Pysh: And it works just like \nTwitter right there on my phone. I mean, it  looks a lot like Twitter, the feel, the \ninterface, everything is very much like  Twitter. And then I go to my computer. and I \ngo to astrol.ninja. Yeah, . And I entered my,  I signed in with my private keys and which \nthat’s a whole nother thing for people.[00:18:56] Preston Pysh: Yeah. There’s a \nsafer way to do it, and we might get too  technical through the, an app called Alby, \nwhich is what I would highly recommend  people do if they’re working off of their, \ntheir desktop computer. But for simplicity,  I went to this astral.ninja website. I logged \ninto my account that I’ve been creating.[00:19:14] Preston Pysh: Effectively tweets from  my iPhone through the DMO app, and it’s almost \nlike what we were describing earlier where  I was logged into Twitter on my phone and \nthen I went to my computer and it was like  I logged into Facebook and I’m seeing \nthe same exact messaging. It’s crazy.[00:19:31] William Casarin: Yeah, it’s and it’s, \nand we all support like different features.[00:19:34] William Casarin: Like I think ESL \nNinja doesn’t even have likes or anything. It  causes a lot of confusion because we’re like, when \npeople are talking on the network, they’re like,  oh, this is broken. And then everyone’s like, \nokay, what client are you talking about? What,  what’s broken? ? So there’s a lot of like \ninteroperability we still gotta figure out.[00:19:46] William Casarin: But for the most part, \nlike if you’re just sending that text messages,  we can all kind of communicate with each \nother, which has been really cool and,  and has this network effect. And I think \nthis is going to be very underappreciated.  I think it’s underappreciated the network \neffect that you have. There’s a reason why  emails still lit like everywhere is because \nthe network effect, like everyone has it.[00:20:02] William Casarin: Everyone \nhas servers and everyone has clients  and we’re just so used to it. Imagine \nif, I don’t know it. Just having it  as a protocol is really helps \nit spread to a wider audience.[00:20:10] Preston Pysh: Well, explain \nthis to me. So we have an email protocol.  Why couldn’t we use that protocol for this \ntype of activity? What’s the differences?[00:20:20] William Casarin: Yeah, so with \nemail, there’s not a concept of querying  notes. Cause if you, let’s say I wanted to like \npull an email thread from somewhere. There’s  not a really a good way to do that. Maybe \nthere might be a way to do it to hack it,  but it wasn’t really designed \nfor that use case. It was more  designed for like sending these like long \nworded letters and stuff between servers.[00:20:37] William Casarin: Whereas this is, \nwe are trying to build it more for a Twitter  like experience. So you maybe you could build \nTwitter over via, over the email protocol,  but that would be Yeah, pretty, pretty crazy.[00:20:47] Preston Pysh: Well, it \nseems like that protocol was designed  for point to point where this is more \ndesigned for just broadcasting, right?[00:20:56] William Casarin: Yeah, \nyeah. So you’re just broadcasting  a message to the public and then \npeople may or may not hear you,  but depending on what tree laser connected \nto. So it’s very much different than maybe  it’s more closer to the Usenet or whatever \nthe old school mail servers or something.[00:21:09] Preston Pysh: But do you see \nthe clients, so like you’re doing the dam.[00:21:14] Preston Pysh: Do you see \nclients specializing in certain benefits  or restricting things in the future that \ngravitate and and does that potentially  cause kind of a split in the network \nor these compartmentalized groups?[00:21:30] William Casarin: I think \nwe’re going to see lots of different  things play out. There’s going to be \nsome clients that just are maximum  interoperability and just want to work \nfor all the different types of messages.[00:21:39] William Casarin: There’s \nsome clients who are just going to,  okay, they, well, they want to craft a \nmore friendly user experience for their  users. So maybe they’ll block like all \npublic messages unless you’re verified  on their platform. And that’s okay. I think we \nmight have them as like a company. Slack. You  have an internal relay within your company \nand you just use that for communications.[00:21:55] William Casarin: Mm-hmm. , and you \ncan use all the standard clients to talk to your  company Slack, and it’s not controlled by Slack \nand . You control your own data, so you get a  lot of flexibility for these use cases. I can see \nit, you know, in many different ways. It’s just  we’re very early and I, I’ve yet to see, and it’s \nreally just public relays right now, so we’ll,[00:22:11] Preston Pysh: So I don’t think \nthat Bitcoiners would have this concern,  but I think people, other people might, where \nthere’s a bit of protection that you currently  get with the centralized servers where you \ndon’t have pedophiles, you don’t have people  doing racial slurs and this type of stuff \nbecause it’s being monitored with this.[00:22:28] Preston Pysh: This is the wild, wild \nwest. I mean, you could literally go on there,  say anything you want. From a masked, no one would \nknow you’re, everything’s anon unless you want  to be known who you are. And so it opens up this \nfree communication where people can hide behind.  So like, how do you see that playing out? I, this \ncan’t be stopped, this protocol can’t be stopped.[00:22:49] Preston Pysh: So I think that \nthat’s out of the question. I’m, I’m  curious if you would agree with that, but \nwhat are some of your thoughts on this?[00:22:54] William Casarin: Again, I \nthink it’s just going to come down to,  you know, there’s going to be a \nwild west part of the network of  the public relays and just crazy \npeople shouting at each other.[00:23:02] William Casarin: But even in that \nmode where you have the public wild West,  you can still build clients that only pull \nmessages from your friends. Clients will  have very strong filtered capabilities, and \nI suspect clients might even compete in terms  of like creating the best algorithm \nfor filtering a lot of this garbage.[00:23:17] William Casarin: And this, again, \nshould always be a, a client choice. We shouldn’t,  initially I was always like, oh, well \nmaybe relays should just be completely  dumb and just never filter anything. And, and \nI still kind of along those lines and I think  that clients should provide the tools to filter \neverything that the, the people don’t want to see.[00:23:32] William Casarin: But it’s hard to \nsay, like I totally imagine there’s going to  be a situation where you have like \nprivate relays that just filter all  their stuff and have heavy moderation. And \npeople who are on the metaverse right now,  they kind of prefer that. Like maybe \nthere’s a certain type of people who  prefer heavy moderation, and that’s fine, \nand you can only connect to those relays.[00:23:45] William Casarin: But even just \ntoday, just having the public relays and  all this crazy stuff going on. Just being able \nto just only see messages from your friends and  friend to friends already filters out \nall out of the nonsense. Again, it’s,  there’s so many different ways to deal \nwith this fam on this network and just,  and I’ve been brainstorming like \nall the different ways and I think  it’s going to be okay as long as we have this \nunderlying protocol that’s just uncensorable.[00:24:03] William Casarin: I think \nthat’s the most important part so we  can start to build these type tools on top of it.[00:24:06] Preston Pysh: So I can tell you \nfrom personal experience using your app,  so I go into the settings where it’s \njust the people that I follow. I think  I’m following like a hundred people on the \nplatform. and I mean it’s just pure signal.[00:24:20] Preston Pysh: It’s so nice because \nall the politics are not in there . It’s just,  it is awesome. You can see everybody building \nand then I’ll click on the global search and  I’m seeing like the global conversation and I mean \nthere’s a lot of cesspool there and I, I guess I’m  kind of curious, I’m assuming you’ve had the \nsame experience, but from a spam standpoint.[00:24:42] Preston Pysh: How do \nyou start basically putting a cost  to spam and bots and all this? I \nmean, you’re seeing it on Twitter,  it’s a disaster of bots. So \nhow does that work with Nostr?[00:24:55] William Casarin: So I’ve been thinking  about this a lot and I think there’s \na couple ways, ways to do it. Again,  there’s two kind of modes. There’s this one mode \nwhere you may only want to talk to your friends,  and that’s easy cause you can only \npull messages from your friends.[00:25:04] William Casarin: That’s just a query \nthat says, only gimme these messages from these P  keys. And you’ll never see anything from anyone. \nThat’s fine, but if you want to have more of  like an open, you don’t know who wants to talk to \nyou. You want to have, be able, be able to accept  messages from strangers. Unfortunately, messages \nfrom strangers aren’t always the nicest messages.[00:25:19] William Casarin: I think there’ll \nprobably be a mode and, and I’m planning to do  this in Damas, where any message from a stranger \nthat either shows up in your dms or notifications  is going to have a cost associated with it. \nI put together this spec on, I’m not sure,  called the proof of work spec, that it’s \nbased on hash cash, so Adam Adam’s hash cash.[00:25:33] William Casarin: It’s basically \nidentical to hash cash. It’s just counting  the number of zeros on the ID of the. And \nthen we have a special way to query number  of leading zeros in the protocol. So you \ncan say, okay, if it’s not from my friends,  but I still want messages from random \npeople, maybe okay, you can send it to me.[00:25:48] William Casarin: But it’s going to, you \ngotta do some proof of work before I receive that  message. And maybe we can put that as a label \non your tweet that says, if you’re a stranger,  you want to send me a message. Just just know. \nBut I won’t get anything. Cause I’m not going  to create, but if you want to try to send me a \nmessage, you gotta run your CPU for like an hour.[00:26:01] William Casarin: So I think that’s \nkinda like one cool way. I don’t know how  scalable that is, but it’s kind of. Another \nway I’ve been thinking about it is this whole  idea that Michael Sailor was talking about at one \npoint is like the orange check. Imagine you go to  some service provider and \nyou can just buy a badge.[00:26:16] William Casarin: We’re working on \nthe badge specs, so you can attach badges to  your profile and it’s kind of fun. Maybe \nyou buy this orange check badge and your  client recognizes those as you can use those \ndespite spam. So if someone has that badge,  okay, fine. You can, if you’re a \nstranger, you can reply to my, my thread.[00:26:29] William Casarin: Those are the \ntwo that I’m looking at in terms of getting  message. . But yeah, there’s other, there’s other \nthings as well, like just paid relay, so everyone  who’s on the relay is pays, wants to get on. Those \nare the things I’ve been thinking about right now.[00:26:38] Preston Pysh: So for people \nthat aren’t familiar with Michael’s idea,  I would just describe it like this, and this \nis how Michael also describes it and when he  is trying to explain it to people, is just, \nif you go to a hotel and you check in,  They’re going to swipe your card for, call it a \nhundred or $200, and they’re going to put a hold  on the card so that if you would go into the hotel \nroom and break the faucet or do whatever cause  damage to the room that they’ve already taken \nsome money from you that you can’t claw back.[00:27:07] Preston Pysh: When you think of like \nyour Twitter or Nostr or whatever and you’re  posting a tweet and somebody comes in there and \nis just wrecking havoc and is just a total idiot.  They would have to post some type of collateral, \nsome small amount. Let’s just say it’s 25 cents to  make a post. and if they’re in there, you know, \nswearing at you or just, you know, whatever,  they’re a bad actor, you can basically take \ntheir 25 cents within a certain period of time.[00:27:34] Preston Pysh: Let’s say that it’s \nactive for one hour or one day or whatever,  that they have to basically post \nthis collateral and you can take  it. If they’re a bad actor and if they’re \nnot a bad actor, well then you don’t do  that because then you’re going to get \nsome type of, there would have to be  some type. This person takes any amount \nof money that’s posted to their feed.[00:27:52] Preston Pysh: So there’s like a star \nranking or something that talks to your history  of whether you’re taking people’s posts or, or \nyou yourself are a bad actor on that policy. So  that’s the idea, is just there’s an economic \nconsequence to being a bad actor. And so  where I’m going with this, William, \nis you, have you, I saw this on Nostr,  you said none of this would be \npossible without the Lightning.[00:28:15] Preston Pysh: You believe none of this  would be possible without the Lightning \nNetwork. Explain what you mean by that.[00:28:21] William Casarin: Lightning enables \na very fast point to point transactions  without like dealing with like the legacy \nfinancial system. So this allows for really  tight integrations with incentivizing relays to \nstay up because it costs money to run a relay.[00:28:35] William Casarin: So we we’re going to \nneed some ways to, in incentivize relays to run.  If there was an option. And so this originally \ncame about because I’m starting to integrate  lightning more and more into Thomas. So \nright now you can post a lightning invoice  and a tweet or in a post and it will \njust like render a little cool widget.[00:28:49] William Casarin: You can click pay. \nSo people love that feature. But this is just  the start of this where maybe there’ll \nbe a a SAT button where you click it and  then you can just send stats instantly \nto another person on the network. So I  started thinking about like, what \nis it going to look like when you,  anyone in the network can sense that \ninstantly to anyone else on the network.[00:29:04] William Casarin: And you have these \nnetwork effects where people are doing this  all the time. Well, maybe it’d be cool if you \njust a portion of that and just send it to all  the relays you’re connected to, to incentivize \nthem to run, as well as to maybe even whitelist  your key for some temporary amount of time. \nImagine like, okay, you send me some SATs,  so I trust you for now, so I’m going to, I’m going \nto let you post to my thing for and the next day,  and if you keep sending SATs, so that, that \nis some sense, an aspect of what you were  referring to of the orange check where you’re \nputting down collateral, you don’t get it back.[00:29:28] William Casarin: I, I mean I guess \nthat Relay could send it back to you if, if you,  once you’re done. But I think that’s one po \npossible way to fight Sam and I think it’s  really cool and I think a Lightning specifically \nenables that because it’s just so fast and. Relays  can put a little lightning invoice or Eleanor on \ntheir, on their relay, and it’s, and your client  can easily connect to it and send to it without \nany coordination, which is really important.[00:29:45] Preston Pysh: So do you \nfind traditional social media platforms  being able to benefit from this protocol by \nincorporating it in some kind of way? I mean,  it’s all centralized for them today, but maybe \nthey move a little bit towards decentralization  and then it allows them to optimize their \nperformance. Is that something that you think is.[00:30:06] Preston Pysh: So \nthis is already happening. .[00:30:07] William Casarin: Oh really? \nProps to bill@minds.com because we had  a call with them a couple months ago \nand with their team and we’re like,  how can we integrate nasra into your platform? And \nthey were so, because we talked about Activity Pub  and the previous protocols they were looking \nat and they’re like, oh, it’s so complicated.[00:30:20] William Casarin: And they’re like, \nwell, let’s try it with Nostros. So they’re,  they were able to build a nostril \nrelay that you can connect to it.  It’s still kind of buggy but we’re still \nworking on it. But if you connect to it,  you get like this fire hose of events from \ntheir platform. Cause they have a lot of users.[00:30:31] William Casarin: And it allows you to, \nit uses this feature that they developed called  delegation. So they, they actually created a new \nspec so that if you go onto the platform and do a  post, it can create events on behalf of ano, of a \nNostr key that, anyway, so it gets, that’s a bit  more complicated, but it basically allows them \nto post events to, to Thomas and it just works.[00:30:47] William Casarin: So, so \nminds.com is a Nostr client that sends  nodes and there’s no reason why Twitter or \nfor instance, could implement Nasra. It’s  really a flexible protocol where you can, any \nlarge platform could, in theory implement it.  So it’d be cool one day, hopefully one \nday DOIs can connect to like Twitter.[00:31:01] Preston Pysh: Would \nthat save them on cost because  they’re not having to store as, \nas much data on their own servers?[00:31:07] Preston Pysh: Or like, what would be  the benefit for them or the incentive \nfor them to do something like that?[00:31:12] William Casarin: In some sense, the, \nthe Nostr relay would just be an interface to  their database, so they still store all \nthe data. The benefit to them is they get  access to the wider, if Nostr eventually \ntakes off and, and everyone’s using it,  then your Slack channel communicate \nvia DM to like Twitter or something.[00:31:25] William Casarin: Right. Just like \nthey get the benefits of that network effect.  And then Twitter could just become, Twitter could \njust become the best Nostr client. Cause it’s a  pretty good client right now. Like I love Twitter. \nI’ve been using it since like 2007. So I wish they  would implement Nasra and, but I think it’d be \ntechnically kind of challenging just cause they  built all of their infrastructure around Twitter, \nbut they could totally run a, an nasra relay.[00:31:42] William Casarin: Even with, without \nthe Twitter client itself being a, a direct Nasra  client, other clients could still connect \nto Twitter. I don’t know, it would be hard,  but it’s doable and that’s kind \nof cool that it’s even possible.[00:31:51] Preston Pysh: So, so we had \nmentioned earlier that you’re designing  this dais client that connects into \nthe Nostr relay of all these messages.[00:32:01] Preston Pysh: And this is on iPhone \niOS. The first question I saw on Twitter whenever  I said I was going to be interviewing \nyou is when? When W E N , when Android.[00:32:15] William Casarin: This is \nmy number one question and I’m like,  oh yeah, I’ll just, I’ll, I’ll do it tomorrow. \nI’ll just put together a whole Android client.  Yeah. But I was working on one when, when \nthings were like much more chill and I was,  I had time to like tinker and \nlike build multiple clients.[00:32:26] William Casarin: But yeah, I \nhave so many users on iOS now. It’s just,  I’ve been just trying to put out fires \nover there and I would love to get back  to the Android client. I’m just hoping with \nsomeone to just build one and then I can just  use that so I don’t have to do it . I’m still \nwaiting for that and there’s a couple in in  progress and I hope they’ll be up to speed \nand up to feature parody with Donis one day.[00:32:41] William Casarin: But yeah, I would \nlove to, but I don’t know if I have time to do.[00:32:44] Preston Pysh: When do you think \nyou’re going to get outta test flight?[00:32:47] William Casarin: I’m going to do \nit soon. I probably like, I’m going to try to  submit it today or tomorrow. Oh wow. Okay. \nBecause we hit the, we hit the beta limit,  so we hit 10,000. We went from like 5,000 \nusers to 10,000 users in like two days.[00:32:58] William Casarin: I didn’t even \nknow there was like a beta limit on test  flight. I was like, okay, I guess I \nshould get releasing this app now.[00:33:03] Preston Pysh: So that’s a good sign.[00:33:05] William Casarin: Yeah. Gotcha. \nThanks to Jack. Like ever since, ever since  Jack started tweeting about, it’s \njust like everything went crazy.[00:33:11] Preston Pysh: So biggest challenge \nyou face right now on the Damus app?[00:33:17] William Casarin: I think the biggest \nchallenge right now is getting the UX up to par  with like what people are familiar with on \nTwitter. because like I have this real, okay,  I’m not even an iOS developer, I just had an \niPhone at the time and I just wanted an app  for Nostr. I have the first time I ever built \nan I iOS app, so I have no idea what I’m doing.[00:33:31] William Casarin: So the UX is \ncompletely terrible. I’m not even a UX person,  so I’m surprised that it’s even like \nusable, but I’ve had a lot of people  who are helping me out and making it much \nbetter. So that’s, . Other than that, once  I get once, once I get released it to the public, \nmy biggest concern is this, the spam issue.[00:33:44] William Casarin: Because yeah, if \npeople have a really bad experience, we have like  Nazi propaganda of like flying the global feeds, \nlike that’s going to be instantly probably banned  from the app store to begin with. And so I’m going \nto need a way to filter that. So I was thinking  maybe just, maybe there’s a premium version where \nyou can like get a an a paid relay or something.[00:33:59] William Casarin: But then again, \nwe’re already starting to move to like this.  Privatize relays, but maybe it’s inevitable. \nInevitable. I don’t know. I’m just worried that  people have a bad experience. They don’t, \nbecause a lot of times they’ll join an app  thinking it’s just going to be like another \nTwitter and everything’s moderated for them.[00:34:10] William Casarin: But reality, this \nis like, this is wild west. Right? And then I  can’t control what people see in some sense. \nbecause if they connect to a relay, I’m like,  I can’t control what you see. It’s just, that’s \nwhat you got from that relay. I mean, I can’t  stop that speech. Right? That’s my biggest concern \nright now is if I, once it starts getting more,[00:34:24] Preston Pysh: For a person who’s \nhearing what you just said, they might think,  oh my God, this is going to be, it’s just \ngoing to turn into a centralized thing.[00:34:31] Preston Pysh: Yeah. If the app \nstore can moderate these apps, these clients  like this, yeah. But I would maybe push back and \nsay, I don’t think that it is a centralizing force  because anybody can go out and run their own relay \nand it’s not hard to do. Well, I won’t say it’s  not hard to do cause I’m struggling, but I think \nin the future it’s going to be very easy to do.[00:34:52] Preston Pysh: And the cost, the, the \nbarrier to entry to run your own small relay is  going to be very minimal in the grand scheme of \nthings for people to do it. And so I can still  check into all these notes via web browser, right? \nThat’s not something that Apple controls. I’m  curious, so if somebody’s posting content there, \nit’s not your app that’s creating that content.[00:35:16] Preston Pysh: So how \nwould you be responsible for the  global messaging that’s happening \non the Nostr protocol and how would  you be held responsible for that? \nOr, or would you or would you not?[00:35:28] William Casarin: And that’s the \nthing. In some sense, it’s just a web browser,  like, you know, is Chrome responsible for \nevery crazy website that someone puts up?[00:35:34] William Casarin: It’s like, that \nshouldn’t be the case, right? So maybe like I have  some responsibility for the bootstrap relay list \nthat I, that I initially, so there’s some initial  set of relays that you connect to. So maybe that \nwould have to be locked down just because like,  well, I’m providing. I don’t want that to be the \ncase cause I want this to be like an open hour.[00:35:47] William Casarin: But I, it really \ndepends. I have to look through the Apple  terms of service and because I don’t, I don’t \nwant to get banned. I, I really like this, the  Apple I’m working on, but if I do get banned \non, I’m actually not that worried. It’ll just  gimme more time to focus on the Android version or \nsomething. It would be sad but it, I could totally  see Apple maybe getting upset about this app just \nbecause it’s too much free speech or something.[00:36:02] William Casarin: I \ndon’t know. too much free speech.[00:36:05] Preston Pysh: Holy mold, shut ’em down.  Biggest reward that you’ve \nexperienced building this.[00:36:11] William Casarin: I just love seeing \npeople get excited. Like it kind of reminds  me of the early days of IRC or like kinda the \nold school internet protocols where people just  like join these crazy fun, weird networks that \npeople are communicating with each other freely.[00:36:22] William Casarin: Just the, the \namount of feedback like I’m getting from  people saying like, this is revolutionary. I’m \nlike, this is like change. This is blowing my  mind. And they’re so, people are so excited. \nI’m like, oh, it’s cool. I’m just sending json  messages over web sockets. I guess it’s kind of \ncool, but in, in some sense, it does have these  wide-reaching implications and so I, for me, \nit’s always just been kinda like this toy thing.[00:36:38] William Casarin: And, and this was \nalways the same thing with Bitcoin as well. I  just, I got in like 2010 just playing, just always \njust a toy. To me, I didn’t know anything about  monetary. The more I, I start to build it out. \nI’m like, holy crap, this actually does have  some pretty, pretty, pretty big implications. And \nthen and I think that’s why people are excited.[00:36:51] William Casarin: It’s \nlike they can see the future where,  you know, free speech is not limited on \nthe internet. And then that it’s easy.  It’s easy to communicate with \npeople without getting blocked.[00:37:00] Preston Pysh: We have \na lot of people that listen to  this show. What would help you out \nthe most for people listening to.[00:37:07] William Casarin: I think \nif people just want to get involved,  if people want to even just contribute code.[00:37:10] William Casarin: If you’re a coder \nand you want to contribute, or if you’re like  a designer and you want to design, suggest \nimprovements to the app or if you want to  write about it, if you’re a writer and you want to \nspread the word, all these things are are helpful.  because I think education is going to \nbe a big part of this just because.[00:37:22] William Casarin: It’s just a \nnew thing and it’s, it’s kind of confusing.  So just be able to like communicate what \nit is and what it isn’t. It’s not another  like true social platform. It’s not like, you \nknow, this is a, a truly a, a different beast.  You know, just learn about it, you know, \nwrite about it, like help out, contribute.[00:37:38] William Casarin: \nIt’s like a, it’s a very,  it’s an open source project everyone seems, \nand everyone’s very welcoming. So yeah,  get involved and that’s a, that \nI can’t ask for more really.[00:37:46] Preston Pysh: I’ve seen some comments \nabout ment being incorporated into this,  and I’m not so sure that I fully have wrapped \nmy head around the implications of that.[00:37:54] Preston Pysh: Can you first of all  explain very generically FEI and then \ntalk about how that fits into Nostr?[00:38:01] William Casarin: I actually \ndon’t know anything about Femine . So I  am a Bitcoin dev and I, I work in Bitcoin \ncore and Core Lightning. I love light, I  love lightning. I haven’t had a lot \nof time to jump into like the ecash.[00:38:10] William Casarin: Whole \nthing. So I couldn’t give like a, a  technical breakdown or even a high \nlevel breakdown. But more generally,  what I was trying to say with that post was, \nI really want Damus to be a Bitcoin only. I  want like a Bitcoin only app on top of \nNostr where you can make it real. Just  everything related to Bitcoin and, and \ninteracting with Bitcoin with your friends.[00:38:26] William Casarin: I just want \nto make it easy as possible to do that  within the app. So if there’s some way \nto send e cash using ment over Damas and,  and maybe do another widget that like we do \nwith the Bolt 11 widgets, I think that’d be.  Making it easier to do multisig stuff on Thomas \nwould be fun. Like imagine if you have a group  DM chat and you all want to cooperatively \nsign a Bitcoin transaction or something.[00:38:43] William Casarin: You can just \npaste your PSBs in a chat and then it’ll  like build up this, it’ll combine the PSBs \nand whatnot to like have a for a multisig  transaction. So anything that makes it easier to \nuse Bitcoin inside this app. That’s kind of what  I want to focus on and want to make the best user \nexperience for. because you know, I’m a Bitcoin.[00:38:57] William Casarin: I love we, a lot of \nthe underlying protocol is built by Bitcoiners.  I’m leveraging a lot of that energy and and \nthat’s not to say DOIs is like a Bitcoin only  app. It’s just right now we have a lot of \nBitcoin users and I want to support them so[00:39:09] Preston Pysh: well, when we look \nat Bitcoin Lightning and we see the immediate  settlement and we see the fees, which are \nfor all intents and purposes, non-existent,  it almost seems like that’s just the natural \nthing to be used for something like this.[00:39:24] Preston Pysh: When you look at these \nother things that are quote unquote blockchains,  even though we kind of smirk when we say, From a \nfee standpoint, I just don’t know how any of that  would even work as seamlessly as, as Lightning \nwould on this. Would you agree with that? And  I’m assuming that’s where you see the future \ngoing based on how you’re working your clients?[00:39:42] William Casarin: Yeah, so it’s \ninteresting because Nostr doesn’t really  care about what you use it with, right? \nNasra has nothing to do with Bitcoin or  Lightning. I just think lightning is great \nand the way to show that is great is to  maybe integrate it into a social network. \nSo that’s what I’m trying to do with DOIs,  but there’s no reason why you couldn’t \ncreate like a, a Manero client.[00:39:59] William Casarin: And \nyou and all people who love Manero,  they want to use Manero in the app. And \nyou have little tit buttons for Manero.  Like sure you can do that. So we can totally \nmaybe see in the future where there’s clients  that have all these different tokens and \npeople can use them in any way they want,  but we can still all inter operate and I don’t \nhave to like see a a manero tip button my client.[00:40:14] William Casarin: Lightning makes \nso much sense, just the instant settlement.  And it’s and the protocol is decent. There’s \nstill some issues with lightning in terms of  liquidity and stuff, but, and I’m, I’m hoping \nmaybe this network will uncover some of those  issues and make and improve liquidity. Just, just, \njust from people trying to pay each other right.[00:40:26] Preston Pysh: People \nare familiar with Mastodon  as a former free speech platform that can’t \nbe shut down by any central entity. Why  is this different than Mastodon or other \nattempts at doing this in a decentralized.[00:40:44] William Casarin: So this \nis a, a really good question because,  you know, I spent probably two years on \nActivity Pub or Mastodon or whatever,  macon’s a client for activity, \npub activity pub’s a protocol.[00:40:53] William Casarin: And what ended up \nhappening, I noticed there were some severe flaws,  some very bad flaws with Macedon early, just \nthe way that the federation on that protocol  is set up. So typically your typical \nexperience when you joined this platform  is that you’ll join an instance that’s \ncalled, so it might be Macedon social.[00:41:08] William Casarin: And then you’ll get \nin an account, you have all your followers set up,  but that server is run by a single admin and they \nhave sole discretion to like ban you at any point  for anything you say. And then once they do that, \nthere’s no way you have to start over. You have to  go to another instance. Hopefully they, but you’re \nalready like psychologically scarred and you’re,  I noticed I was like censoring \nmyself just because I’m like,  I hopely, I don’t say anything bad until \nthe I’ve admin bands, we have to start over.[00:41:30] William Casarin: Even on the Bitcoin \ninstance, like I know, I, I know N VK is is cool  and he runs a Bitcoin hackers instance, but like, \nI’m like, if I say something bad about cold card,  maybe I’ll get banned. So like, whenever you have \none person in control of like, of a social graph,  it gets really bad. So I think that’s the, \nthe biggest, and it’s a huge flaw with Macon.[00:41:45] William Casarin: \nand that’s why I eventually,  I was trying to write it in an activity pub node \nand clients and stuff. I’m like, I give up. This  is just not going to work. And that’s when I \nstarted focusing on nos. Cause I’m like, okay,  this nasra solve a problem because your contact \nlist and your social graph, you control it.[00:41:56] William Casarin: You can put it \nback it up on your, on your note and you  can broadcast it anywhere and you can’t be, you \nknow, you don’t have to start over every time.[00:42:01] Preston Pysh: Right. I mean,  I just look at the, the amount of time I’ve \nspent on Twitter in the past decade and if  I got banned and they just deleted all \nthat history of, of those interactions.[00:42:14] Preston Pysh: I mean, \nit’s just, it’s a massive blow to  people that are interacting in a public \nkind of way. And so your point there,  as far as like admins controlling it, \nI mean it’s just this needs to happen .[00:42:26] William Casarin: \nWell, yeah, some sense,  some sense Masson is worse than Twitter \nbecause like I thought I was getting,  I got banned from like three instances in this \nspan of like, I’m not even a controversial person.[00:42:34] William Casarin: I just, like I said, \nBitcoin once and like it’s so full of like people  on the left, I just got banned for just saying \nBitcoin. I’m like, all right, this is crazy.[00:42:41] Preston Pysh: So there’s a \nThere’s another attempt at decentralized  social media with Blue Sky. What are the \ndifferences between Nostr and Blue Sky?[00:42:51] William Casarin: \nI briefly looked at Blue Sky.[00:42:53] William Casarin: It seems \nabout what they’re trying to do is  they’re trying to build a, specifically \na social media protocol. And sometimes  that’s what we’re doing on Nostr, but Nostr \nis a bit more general. and they’re trying to  design it for scale, so you have like \nreally big nodes and it, and then it,  that it’s really easy to set up these big nodes \nand they’re very performant and things like that.[00:43:09] William Casarin: And I think that’s \nactually a really interesting way to do it. And  I think that we should totally explore that and \nmaybe one day nostril can interact with those  types of nodes. So I think it’s not a waste of \ntime as much as I’m like a Nostrom Maximalist,  but yeah, they, they, it’s really \njust subtle differences in terms of  how data is communicated and, \nand types of technology they.[00:43:27] William Casarin: They’re very \nsimilar. And this is the cool thing about,  there’s so many decentralized protocols now, \nand we can kind of just battle them against  each other. So I love to see, like I’ve, I’ve \nbeen getting ideas from other protocols like,  Hey, that’s a good idea. We should \nimplement caching at this part of Nostr.[00:43:38] William Casarin: So I think  the competition is good and \nI, and I think that’s yeah.[00:43:42] Preston Pysh: One of the \nthings that I’ve noticed with using  it is it’s a little bit slow to load, but \nI, but I don’t have my own personal relay  set up. If I had my own relay set \nup, would that solve that? Or how  do we get kind of the speed that we’re \naccustomed to with Twitter through Nostr?[00:43:59] William Casarin: The relay that \nI’m running is like written by like this  one guy who just built it in his spare \ntime and it’s, there’s not even that,  like we’ve been going back and forth and trying \nto optimize some basic stuff, but there’s almost  been no performance optimization done on the \nrelay. I was working on something called,  it doesn’t have a name, but it was just a, \na caching relay so they can sit in front of  your relay that will, doesn’t have to do \nthe full query, but can return results.[00:44:20] William Casarin: We don’t even \nhave basic caching yet on the relay side. So  anytime you experience slowness, it’s just because \neveryone is querying everything at the same time.  Yeah. And we just haven’t done that \npart of performance tuning. But these  things will come with time and \njust for now, it’s just adding  more relays kind of spreads out the \nload and seems to help a little bit.[00:44:35] William Casarin: But yeah, we \ndefinitely need to improve performance on relay.[00:44:38] Preston Pysh: Would you \nhave cashes on the client side as well,  which would help improve the speed?[00:44:45] William Casarin: Yeah, \nthere’s I mean, DOAs doesn’t do this,  but it could just like cash more things. \nI don’t, I don’t like the idea of storing  like a huge historical cash in DOAs \ncause it’ll start to get bloated.[00:44:53] William Casarin: Imagine all the data \nhas to store from, like, there’s no reason why it  couldn’t store. Like stuff you’re tweeting in real \ntime, it doesn’t really help in the cases when  you’re trying to pull an old thread. Cause the \nclient definitely probably wouldn’t have that. And  that’s the case where it seems to be the slowest \nbecause we don’t have the relay caches yet.[00:45:07] William Casarin: Hopefully \no in time. I hope we can get it. More[00:45:09] Preston Pysh: performance though. \nIn general, what do you think brings the user  migration to Nostr? Is it just the freest \nand most open way to communicate’s going  to win in the long run? Or like what do \nyou, what’s your thoughts around that?[00:45:24] William Casarin: I think \njust because it made it so easy,  you know, you don’t have to, you know, create \nan account, you have to add your phone number.[00:45:30] William Casarin: It’s just \nso easy to onboard people onto the  platform. They, and it’s just, and they \njust get it instantly. I think that’s  a, that’s a huge one. Obviously. \nObviously Jack talking about it,  Jack Dorsey is just tweeting about it. So that’s, \nthat was a huge boost. But it was cool just to see  so many people get in and that it was somewhat \nstable and, and it didn’t just crash right away.[00:45:45] William Casarin: So people just \nseeing that it works and it’s somewhat stable,  they’re starting to be like, Hey, this \nmight actually work. And like that was  something I always wanted to do with \nthe DOIs Kline. It’s like, prove this,  that it could actually work. It’s still come \nsomewhat of a prototype. Is this going to work at.[00:45:56] William Casarin: So we’re up to 10,  10,000 users now. I, I, I think I see like \n2000 or so people connected to my server at  any given time, who knows what the next stage \nof scaling is? Let’s see if we can get this  up to like 30,000 to hundred thousand. \nYeah, we’re still early, but William,[00:46:09] Preston Pysh: I can’t \nbelieve how active Jack is.[00:46:12] Preston Pysh: Jack Dorsey \nis on the platform right now. I mean,  he is very active. He’s called you. What are some \nof your thoughts around Jack being so active?[00:46:22] William Casarin: I think he got it so \nquickly just because this is what he in some sense  wanted Twitter to be. I’m guessing it’s like \nnostalgic for him. Cause it probably reminds  him and he tweeted about this, this reminds \nhim of Twitter, sub 5,000 users, but better.[00:46:33] William Casarin: Right When he said \nthat my servers went down, basically that,  that caused so much fomo when he said that. But \nyeah, I think Jack just, he sees the potential of  the protocol and he just wants to support that, \neven though he’s also supporting the competing  protocol, blue Sky, right? So he has the same \nidea, like, let’s see which best protocol win.[00:46:47] William Casarin: And so it’s cool. \nYeah, it’s cool to have the support and to see  how we call him the the Walmart, like greeter \nguy. because he just, he’s always there. He’s  like, Hey, he just sends this emoji to \neveryone. . So it’s funny, he, he’s been,  he’s been a very active user on the network, which \nhas been awesome to see and hang out with him.[00:47:02] Preston Pysh: So, last \nquestion is just your bitcoin.[00:47:06] William Casarin: I think I just \nsaw it on Hacker News in like late 2010,  and I just like, just jumped \non, started playing with it,  jumped in the IRC channel and just like \nchatted. I was chatting with some, some of  the people at the time, someone of his \nnamed sipa. I didn’t know who he was.[00:47:17] William Casarin: Turns out he’s like \nnow a major cord offer. So he got me in into the,  in the system really early. Yeah. And then, you \nknow, I’ve, I’ve always used it. I, I worked at a  record label and I we were selling our albums \nin 2013, a record label called Monstercat.  So that was kind of cool to see if we could \nactually start selling stuff on this network.[00:47:33] William Casarin: Yeah, I just, it \nwas always just kind of this fun protocol,  kinda like Nostr, I just like, it was just fun \nthing to play with. I, I wasn’t like super into  monetary theory or like, you know, some of the \nstuff I know now, but the community has really  like educated me on all that stuff afterwards. \nBut it was just, it’s just been a while to see it.[00:47:46] William Casarin: It \njust see it grow from the start.[00:47:49] Preston Pysh: So, William, \nI know you’re active on Nostr for sure.  You’re definitely active on Twitter as well. \nGive people a handoff. I’m assuming you’re  going to get some interest from this discussion \nof how people can help. Tell ’em where they can  find you and anything else you want to \nhighlight, we’ll have links in the show  notes to, to all this stuff so that people can \nquickly access you, but give them a handoff.[00:48:12] William Casarin: Yeah. So for Nostr, \nI highly recommend checking out our GitHub.  It’s it’s github.com/Nostr-protocol/Nostr. I \nthink. And then we’ll have a, there’ll be a  link there to the Art Telegram. We probably \nhave like 4,000 or something people in there  by now. So it’s a huge group of people \nwho just, you can ask questions there.[00:48:27] William Casarin: They’ll help you \nget, you, get you onboarded. You can find me on,  I’m not going to announce my whole pub key. \nI don’t know if I could say that , but I’m  sure you’ll find me talking on there. If \nyou go to the global feed, you’ll find me.  And just my Twitter is JB five five, \nmy website JB five five.com. So, yeah.[00:48:41] Preston Pysh: Fantastic. \nWe’ll have links to all that in the  show notes. I know you are an extremely \nbusy guy right now, , so taking time out  to have this conversation for a full hour. \nI really appreciate that and I know that  all the listeners are going to appreciate \nit as well. So thank you for your time.[00:48:56] William Casarin: This has been awesome.[00:48:56] William Casarin: Thank \nyou so much for having me. So thanks.",
